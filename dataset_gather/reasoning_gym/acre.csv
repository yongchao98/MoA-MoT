0,acre,"You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.

Each example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.

After observing the previous examples, respond with:
- ""on"" if you can determine the detector light will turn on
- ""off"" if you can determine the detector light will stay off
- ""undetermined"" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion

Do not use quotation marks in your answer.

Each example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.

After observing the previous examples, respond with:
- ""on"" if you can determine the detector light will turn on
