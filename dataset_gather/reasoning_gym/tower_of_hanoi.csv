0,tower_of_hanoi,"Solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks and 3 pegs.
Move all disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 following the rules:
- Only one disk can be moved at a time.
- A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.
- All disks must be on a peg at all times.

Provide the sequence of moves.

Formatting guidelines:
- Each instruction should be placed on a single line.
- Each line should be formatted as 'Move disk X from Peg Y to Peg Z'
- Enclose final answer within triple angle brackets, like <<<the sequence of moves>>>.

- A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.
- All disks must be on a peg at all times.

Provide the sequence of moves.

Formatting guidelines:
- Each instruction should be placed on a single line.
- Each line should be formatted as 'Move disk X from Peg Y to Peg Z'
- Enclose final answer within triple angle brackets, like <<<the sequence of moves>>>.

596,tower_of_hanoi,"Solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 6 disks and 3 pegs.
Move all disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1 following the rules:
- Only one disk can be moved at a time.
- A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.
- All disks must be on a peg at all times.

Provide the sequence of moves.

Formatting guidelines:
- Each instruction should be placed on a single line.
- Each line should be formatted as 'Move disk X from Peg Y to Peg Z'
