999,jugs,"You are a police officer. A maniac has planted a bomb next to a public fountain.

To defuse the bomb, you must solve a puzzle. The puzzle is solved when you fill any of the available jugs with the target amount of water.

You have three move types: 'fill', 'empty' and 'pour'.

To fill Jug A, you 'fill A'.
To empty Jug B, you 'empty B'.
To pour the contents of Jug A into Jug B, you 'pour A->B'.
All jugs are empty to begin with.

The empty jugs hold this many litres of water: A:6, B:6, C:11
And your target is: 8 litres.

How do you defuse the bomb?

Reply as a JSON-parsable list of moves which result in any of the jugs being filled with the target amount, and enclose the JSON-parsable list in triple angle brackets, like <<<JSON-parsable list>>>.
