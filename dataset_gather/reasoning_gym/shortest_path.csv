0,shortest_path,"Your task is to find the shortest path from the start to the destination point in a grid.

The grid is represented as a matrix with the following types of cells:
- *: your starting point
- #: your destination point
- O: an open cell
- X: a blocked cell

Therefore, you need to find the shortest path from * to #, moving only through open cells.

You may only move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.

If there is no path from * to #, simply write ""infeasible"" (without quotes).

Your output should be a sequence of directions that leads from * to #, enclosed within triple angle brackets, e.g. <<<right right down down up left>>>

Now, find the length of the shortest path from * to # in the following grid:

Therefore, you need to find the shortest path from * to #, moving only through open cells.

You may only move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.

If there is no path from * to #, simply write ""infeasible"" (without quotes).

Your output should be a sequence of directions that leads from * to #, enclosed within triple angle brackets, e.g. <<<right right down down up left>>>

Now, find the length of the shortest path from * to # in the following grid:

Therefore, you need to find the shortest path from * to #, moving only through open cells.

You may only move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.

If there is no path from * to #, simply write ""infeasible"" (without quotes).

Your output should be a sequence of directions that leads from * to #, enclosed within triple angle brackets, e.g. <<<right right down down up left>>>

Now, find the length of the shortest path from * to # in the following grid:
X O X O O O X
O X O X O X X
O X O X O O O
O O O O O O X
O * X X # X O
O O O X X X O

- O: an open cell
- X: a blocked cell

Therefore, you need to find the shortest path from * to #, moving only through open cells.

You may only move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.

If there is no path from * to #, simply write ""infeasible"" (without quotes).

Your output should be a sequence of directions that leads from * to #, enclosed within triple angle brackets, e.g. <<<right right down down up left>>>

Now, find the length of the shortest path from * to # in the following grid:
O O X X O X O O
O O O O O X O X
X O O O O O O O
X X X X O O O O
O O X X X O * X

- #: your destination point
- O: an open cell
- X: a blocked cell

Therefore, you need to find the shortest path from * to #, moving only through open cells.

You may only move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.

If there is no path from * to #, simply write ""infeasible"" (without quotes).

Your output should be a sequence of directions that leads from * to #, enclosed within triple angle brackets, e.g. <<<right right down down up left>>>

Now, find the length of the shortest path from * to # in the following grid:
X X O * O X X O
O O X O O O X O
X X O X X X X X
X O O O X O X O
O X O O O O O O

- O: an open cell
- X: a blocked cell

Therefore, you need to find the shortest path from * to #, moving only through open cells.

You may only move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.

If there is no path from * to #, simply write ""infeasible"" (without quotes).

Your output should be a sequence of directions that leads from * to #, enclosed within triple angle brackets, e.g. <<<right right down down up left>>>

Now, find the length of the shortest path from * to # in the following grid:
O O O X X O O X
O O # O O O O X
O O O O X O O X
X X O O O O O X
O O O O O O O X

- X: a blocked cell

Therefore, you need to find the shortest path from * to #, moving only through open cells.

You may only move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.

If there is no path from * to #, simply write ""infeasible"" (without quotes).

Your output should be a sequence of directions that leads from * to #, enclosed within triple angle brackets, e.g. <<<right right down down up left>>>

Now, find the length of the shortest path from * to # in the following grid:
O O X X X O X
O O O O O O X
O O X O X # X
X O O O O X O
X X O O * O O

Therefore, you need to find the shortest path from * to #, moving only through open cells.

You may only move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.

If there is no path from * to #, simply write ""infeasible"" (without quotes).

Your output should be a sequence of directions that leads from * to #, enclosed within triple angle brackets, e.g. <<<right right down down up left>>>

Now, find the length of the shortest path from * to # in the following grid:
X O * X O
O X X O O
O X X # O

If there is no path from * to #, simply write ""infeasible"" (without quotes).

Your output should be a sequence of directions that leads from * to #, enclosed within triple angle brackets, e.g. <<<right right down down up left>>>
