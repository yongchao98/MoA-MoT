An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical).
You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.

An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical).
You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.

You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.

An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical).
You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.

An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical).
You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.

An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical).
You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical).
You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.

An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical).
You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.

An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical).
You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.

An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical).
You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical).
You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.

An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical).
You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.

An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical).
You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical).
You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical).
You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.

An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical).
You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.

An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical).
You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.

An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical).
You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.

An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical).
You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.

An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical).
You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.

An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical).
You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.

An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical).
You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.
