0,ab,"A::B is a system with 4 tokens: `A#`, `#A`, `B#` and `#B`.

An A::B program is a sequence of tokens. Example:

    B# A# #B #A B#

To *compute* a program, we must rewrite neighbor tokens, using the rules:

    A# #A ... becomes ... nothing
    A# #B ... becomes ... #B A#
    B# #A ... becomes ... #A B#
    B# #B ... becomes ... nothing

In other words, whenever two neighbor tokens have their '#' facing each-other,
they must be rewritten according to the corresponding rule.

Now, consider the following program:

A# B# B# #A B# #B A# A# A# #A

Return the final state of the program.

An A::B program is a sequence of tokens. Example:

    B# A# #B #A B#

To *compute* a program, we must rewrite neighbor tokens, using the rules:

    A# #A ... becomes ... nothing
    A# #B ... becomes ... #B A#
    B# #A ... becomes ... #A B#
    B# #B ... becomes ... nothing

In other words, whenever two neighbor tokens have their '#' facing each-other,
they must be rewritten according to the corresponding rule.

Now, consider the following program:

A# #B A# B# B# A# A# A# #A A#

Return the final state of the program.

To *compute* a program, we must rewrite neighbor tokens, using the rules:

    A# #A ... becomes ... nothing
    A# #B ... becomes ... #B A#
    B# #A ... becomes ... #A B#
    B# #B ... becomes ... nothing

In other words, whenever two neighbor tokens have their '#' facing each-other,
they must be rewritten according to the corresponding rule.

#A #A B# #A B# #B #B #A A# A#

Return the final state of the program.

To *compute* a program, we must rewrite neighbor tokens, using the rules:

    A# #A ... becomes ... nothing
    A# #B ... becomes ... #B A#
    B# #A ... becomes ... #A B#
    B# #B ... becomes ... nothing

In other words, whenever two neighbor tokens have their '#' facing each-other,
they must be rewritten according to the corresponding rule.

An A::B program is a sequence of tokens. Example:

    B# A# #B #A B#

To *compute* a program, we must rewrite neighbor tokens, using the rules:

    A# #A ... becomes ... nothing
    A# #B ... becomes ... #B A#
    B# #A ... becomes ... #A B#
    B# #B ... becomes ... nothing

In other words, whenever two neighbor tokens have their '#' facing each-other,
they must be rewritten according to the corresponding rule.

Now, consider the following program:

B# A# A# #B #A #B A# A# A# A#

Return the final state of the program.

To *compute* a program, we must rewrite neighbor tokens, using the rules:

    A# #A ... becomes ... nothing
    A# #B ... becomes ... #B A#
    B# #A ... becomes ... #A B#
    B# #B ... becomes ... nothing

In other words, whenever two neighbor tokens have their '#' facing each-other,
they must be rewritten according to the corresponding rule.

#B B# #B A# #B B# A# #B B# B#

Return the final state of the program.

An A::B program is a sequence of tokens. Example:

    B# A# #B #A B#

To *compute* a program, we must rewrite neighbor tokens, using the rules:

    A# #A ... becomes ... nothing
    A# #B ... becomes ... #B A#
    B# #A ... becomes ... #A B#
    B# #B ... becomes ... nothing

In other words, whenever two neighbor tokens have their '#' facing each-other,
they must be rewritten according to the corresponding rule.

Now, consider the following program:

#A B# #B B# #A B# #B #A A# #A

Return the final state of the program.

An A::B program is a sequence of tokens. Example:

    B# A# #B #A B#

To *compute* a program, we must rewrite neighbor tokens, using the rules:

    A# #A ... becomes ... nothing
    A# #B ... becomes ... #B A#
    B# #A ... becomes ... #A B#
    B# #B ... becomes ... nothing

In other words, whenever two neighbor tokens have their '#' facing each-other,
they must be rewritten according to the corresponding rule.

Now, consider the following program:

#A A# A# B# A# #A #B #B #A #A

Return the final state of the program.

An A::B program is a sequence of tokens. Example:

    B# A# #B #A B#

To *compute* a program, we must rewrite neighbor tokens, using the rules:

    A# #A ... becomes ... nothing
    A# #B ... becomes ... #B A#
    B# #A ... becomes ... #A B#
    B# #B ... becomes ... nothing

In other words, whenever two neighbor tokens have their '#' facing each-other,
they must be rewritten according to the corresponding rule.

Now, consider the following program:

#B B# #B A# #A B# A# A# B# #A

Return the final state of the program.

To *compute* a program, we must rewrite neighbor tokens, using the rules:

    A# #A ... becomes ... nothing
    A# #B ... becomes ... #B A#
    B# #A ... becomes ... #A B#
    B# #B ... becomes ... nothing

In other words, whenever two neighbor tokens have their '#' facing each-other,
they must be rewritten according to the corresponding rule.

#A #A #B A# #B #B A# #B #B #B

Return the final state of the program.

To *compute* a program, we must rewrite neighbor tokens, using the rules:

    A# #A ... becomes ... nothing
    A# #B ... becomes ... #B A#

In other words, whenever two neighbor tokens have their '#' facing each-other,
they must be rewritten according to the corresponding rule.

An A::B program is a sequence of tokens. Example:

    B# A# #B #A B#

To *compute* a program, we must rewrite neighbor tokens, using the rules:

    A# #A ... becomes ... nothing
    A# #B ... becomes ... #B A#
    B# #A ... becomes ... #A B#
    B# #B ... becomes ... nothing

In other words, whenever two neighbor tokens have their '#' facing each-other,
they must be rewritten according to the corresponding rule.

Now, consider the following program:

B# #A B# A# A# #A #B B# B# #B

Return the final state of the program.

An A::B program is a sequence of tokens. Example:

    B# A# #B #A B#

To *compute* a program, we must rewrite neighbor tokens, using the rules:

    A# #A ... becomes ... nothing
    A# #B ... becomes ... #B A#
    B# #A ... becomes ... #A B#
    B# #B ... becomes ... nothing

In other words, whenever two neighbor tokens have their '#' facing each-other,
they must be rewritten according to the corresponding rule.

Now, consider the following program:

#B #B B# B# #B A# B# A# A# #B

Return the final state of the program.

To *compute* a program, we must rewrite neighbor tokens, using the rules:

    A# #A ... becomes ... nothing
    A# #B ... becomes ... #B A#
    B# #A ... becomes ... #A B#
    B# #B ... becomes ... nothing

In other words, whenever two neighbor tokens have their '#' facing each-other,
they must be rewritten according to the corresponding rule.

To *compute* a program, we must rewrite neighbor tokens, using the rules:

    A# #A ... becomes ... nothing
    A# #B ... becomes ... #B A#
    B# #A ... becomes ... #A B#

In other words, whenever two neighbor tokens have their '#' facing each-other,
they must be rewritten according to the corresponding rule.

To *compute* a program, we must rewrite neighbor tokens, using the rules:

    A# #A ... becomes ... nothing
    A# #B ... becomes ... #B A#
    B# #A ... becomes ... #A B#
    B# #B ... becomes ... nothing

In other words, whenever two neighbor tokens have their '#' facing each-other,
they must be rewritten according to the corresponding rule.

In other words, whenever two neighbor tokens have their '#' facing each-other,
