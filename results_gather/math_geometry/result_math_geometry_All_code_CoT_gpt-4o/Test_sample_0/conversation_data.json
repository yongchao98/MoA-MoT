    "To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the side length of the original square**: Since the area of the square is 4 square units, the side length is the square root of 4, which is 2 units.\n\n2. **Find the coordinates of the vertices of the original square**: The center of the square is at (8, -8). Since the top side is horizontal, the vertices can be calculated by moving half the side length (1 unit) in the x and y directions from the center. The vertices of the original square are:\n   - Top-right: (9, -7)\n   - Top-left: (7, -7)\n   - Bottom-right: (9, -9)\n   - Bottom-left: (7, -9)\n\n3. **Dilate the square**: The dilation center is at (0,0) with a scale factor of 2. To find the new coordinates of each vertex after dilation, multiply each coordinate by the scale factor.\n\n4. **Calculate the distance from the origin for each vertex of the dilated square**: Use the distance formula to find which vertex is farthest from the origin.\n\n5. **Output the coordinates of the vertex that is farthest from the origin**.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Original vertices\nvertices = [(9, -7), (7, -7), (9, -9), (7, -9)]\n\n# Dilation center and scale factor\ndilation_center = (0, 0)\nscale_factor = 2\n\n# Function to dilate a point\ndef dilate_point(point, center, scale):\n    return (scale * (point[0] - center[0]), scale * (point[1] - center[1]))\n\n# Dilate all vertices\ndilated_vertices = [dilate_point(v, dilation_center, scale_factor) for v in vertices]\n\n# Function to calculate distance from origin\ndef distance_from_origin(point):\n    return math.sqrt(point[0]**2 + point[1]**2)\n\n# Find the vertex farthest from the origin\nfarthest_vertex = max(dilated_vertices, key=distance_from_origin)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"<<<{farthest_vertex}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the coordinates of the vertex of the dilated square that is farthest from the origin."
