# Given values
radius = 58
diameter = 2 * radius
third_part = 80

# Calculate the second part
second_part = diameter  # Since the second part completes the triangle

# Calculate the total distance
total_distance = diameter + second_part + third_part

# Output the result
print(f"<<<{total_distance}>>>")
