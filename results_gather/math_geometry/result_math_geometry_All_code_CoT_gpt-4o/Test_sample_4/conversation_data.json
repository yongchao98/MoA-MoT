    "To solve this problem, we need to equate the volume of the cube to the volume of the square-based pyramid and solve for the height \\( h \\).\n\n1. **Calculate the volume of the cube**: The volume \\( V \\) of a cube with edge length \\( a \\) is given by \\( V = a^3 \\). For a cube with edge length 4 units, the volume is \\( 4^3 = 64 \\) cubic units.\n\n2. **Calculate the volume of the square-based pyramid**: The volume \\( V \\) of a square-based pyramid with base edge length \\( b \\) and height \\( h \\) is given by \\( V = \\frac{1}{3} \\times b^2 \\times h \\). For a pyramid with base edge length 8 units, the volume is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times 8^2 \\times h = \\frac{64}{3} \\times h \\).\n\n3. **Set the volumes equal and solve for \\( h \\)**: \n   \\[\n   64 = \\frac{64}{3} \\times h\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( h \\), we multiply both sides by 3 and then divide by 64:\n   \\[\n   h = \\frac{64 \\times 3}{64} = 3\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to perform these calculations and output the result.\n\n```python\n# Given values\ncube_edge_length = 4\npyramid_base_edge_length = 8\n\n# Calculate the volume of the cube\ncube_volume = cube_edge_length ** 3\n\n# Calculate the volume of the pyramid in terms of h\n# Volume of pyramid = (1/3) * base_area * height\n# Base area = pyramid_base_edge_length ** 2\npyramid_volume = (1/3) * (pyramid_base_edge_length ** 2) * 1  # Volume per unit height\n\n# Set the volumes equal and solve for h\nh = cube_volume / pyramid_volume\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"<<<{h}>>>\")\n```"
