    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of the isosceles triangle and the angles involved.\n\n1. **Identify the Triangle and Angles:**\n   - We have an isosceles triangle \\( \\Delta ABC \\) with \\( AC = BC \\).\n   - The angle \\( \\angle ACB = 40^\\circ \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the Base Angles:**\n   - In an isosceles triangle, the base angles are equal. Therefore, \\( \\angle CAB = \\angle ABC \\).\n   - The sum of angles in a triangle is \\( 180^\\circ \\).\n   - So, \\( \\angle CAB + \\angle ABC + \\angle ACB = 180^\\circ \\).\n   - Substituting the known angle, \\( \\angle CAB + \\angle ABC + 40^\\circ = 180^\\circ \\).\n   - Simplifying, \\( \\angle CAB + \\angle ABC = 140^\\circ \\).\n\n3. **Find Each Base Angle:**\n   - Since \\( \\angle CAB = \\angle ABC \\), we can set up the equation \\( 2 \\times \\angle CAB = 140^\\circ \\).\n   - Solving for \\( \\angle CAB \\), we get \\( \\angle CAB = 70^\\circ \\).\n\n4. **Determine \\( \\angle CBD \\):**\n   - Since \\( \\angle ABC = 70^\\circ \\) and \\( \\angle CBD \\) is part of \\( \\angle ABC \\), we need to find the measure of \\( \\angle CBD \\).\n   - Given that \\( \\angle ABC = 70^\\circ \\) and \\( \\angle ACB = 40^\\circ \\), the remaining angle \\( \\angle CBD \\) is the same as \\( \\angle ACB \\) because \\( \\angle ABC = \\angle CAB \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( \\angle CBD = 40^\\circ \\).\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the final answer.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the measure of angle CBD\nangle_CBD = 40\n\n# Output the result in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{angle_CBD}>>>\")\n```"
