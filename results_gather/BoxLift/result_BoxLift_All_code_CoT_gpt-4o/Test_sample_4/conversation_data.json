    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We have to consider the constraints that each lifter can only lift one box at a time, and multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if necessary.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Sort the Boxes and Lifters**: Start by sorting the boxes in descending order of weight and the lifters in descending order of capacity. This helps in efficiently matching the heaviest boxes with the strongest lifters.\n\n2. **Assign Lifters to Boxes**: For each step, try to lift as many boxes as possible by assigning lifters to boxes. Start with the heaviest box and try to find a combination of lifters that can lift it. Once a box is lifted, move to the next heaviest box.\n\n3. **Repeat Until All Boxes Are Lifted**: Continue the process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that the number of steps does not exceed 5.\n\n4. **Output the Steps**: For each step, output the boxes lifted and the indices of the lifters used.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\nboxes = [96, 21, 29, 92, 86, 28, 42, 25, 74, 28]\nlifters = [66, 73, 66]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes[:]):\n        for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[j] and lifter >= box:\n                step.append((box, [j]))\n                used_lifters[j] = True\n                boxes.remove(box)\n                break\n        else:\n            # Try to combine lifters if a single lifter can't lift the box\n            for j in range(len(lifters)):\n                if used_lifters[j]:\n                    continue\n                for k in range(j + 1, len(lifters)):\n                    if used_lifters[k]:\n                        continue\n                    if lifters[j] + lifters[k] >= box:\n                        step.append((box, [j, k]))\n                        used_lifters[j] = True\n                        used_lifters[k] = True\n                        boxes.remove(box)\n                        break\n                if used_lifters[j]:\n                    break\n    steps.append(step)\n\n# Output the steps\noutput = \"\"\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    output += f\"Step {i + 1}: {step}\\n\"\n\nprint(f\"<<<{output.strip()}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the steps required to lift all the boxes using the given lifters, ensuring that the number of steps is minimized and does not exceed 5."
