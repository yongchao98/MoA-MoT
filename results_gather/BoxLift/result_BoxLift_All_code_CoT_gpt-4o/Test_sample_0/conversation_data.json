    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We have to consider the constraints that each lifter can only lift one box at a time, and multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if necessary.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Sort the Boxes and Lifters**: Start by sorting the boxes in descending order of weight and the lifters in descending order of capacity. This allows us to try to lift the heaviest boxes first with the strongest lifters.\n\n2. **Assign Lifters to Boxes**: For each step, try to assign the available lifters to the heaviest boxes that can be lifted. If a box is too heavy for a single lifter, combine lifters to lift it.\n\n3. **Repeat Until All Boxes Are Lifted**: Continue this process until all boxes are lifted, keeping track of the number of steps.\n\n4. **Ensure the Solution is Within 7 Steps**: If the solution exceeds 7 steps, re-evaluate the strategy to ensure it fits within the constraints.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\nboxes = [43, 88, 84, 64, 56, 87, 20, 57, 82, 14]\nlifters = [51, 49, 48]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    \n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes[:]):\n        lifter_indices = []\n        remaining_weight = box\n        \n        for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[j] and remaining_weight > 0:\n                if lifter >= remaining_weight:\n                    lifter_indices.append(j)\n                    used_lifters[j] = True\n                    remaining_weight = 0\n                    break\n                elif lifter < remaining_weight:\n                    lifter_indices.append(j)\n                    used_lifters[j] = True\n                    remaining_weight -= lifter\n        \n        if remaining_weight == 0:\n            step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n            boxes.remove(box)\n    \n    steps.append(step)\n\n# Print the steps\noutput = []\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    output.append(f\"Step {i+1}: {step}\")\n\nprint(\"<<<\" + \"\\n\".join(output) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the steps required to lift all the boxes using the given lifters, ensuring that the solution is efficient and within the constraints."
