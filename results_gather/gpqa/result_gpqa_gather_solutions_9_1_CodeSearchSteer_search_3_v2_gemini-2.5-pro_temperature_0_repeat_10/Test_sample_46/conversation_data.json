Analyze the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n\n*   Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (C=O or C=C) or another ring.\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of medium-to-strong bands is characteristic of the N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂). The two bands arise from the asymmetric and symmetric stretches, respectively.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region, indicating a C=O group. This value is typical for a conjugated ester or an aldehyde. Given the DoU calculation, this C=O group likely accounts for the fifth degree of unsaturation.\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 protons indicates a methylene group (-CH₂) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃). The chemical shift of 4.5 ppm is quite downfield, which is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an oxygen atom in an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n    *   Together, the signals at 1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an ethyl group attached to an oxygen: an ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃), most likely as part of an ethyl ester.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is typical for the exchangeable protons of an amine (-NH₂) or alcohol (-OH). Combined with the IR data, this signal confirms the primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm corresponds to protons ortho to an electron-donating group (the -NH₂ group).\n    *   The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to protons ortho to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester's carbonyl group, -COOEt).\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   One substituent is a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   The other substituent is an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nPutting these pieces together gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**5. Verify with the Options**\n\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an isomer, but the NMR would show a quartet for the CH₂ next to the carbonyl at ~2.2-2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data.\n*   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is a meta-substituted compound, which would give a more complex aromatic splitting pattern. It is also an amide, and the C=O stretch is usually at a lower frequency.\n*   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H band in the IR and only one N-H proton in the NMR.\n\nThe correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the correct compound is identified by breaking down the information from each spectrum and comparing it with the proposed structures.\n\n### **Analysis of Provided Data**\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    The degree of unsaturation is calculated to be 5. This suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region are highly characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its position is typical for an ester, particularly one that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons indicates a methylene group (-CH₂) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃). The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm suggests this methylene group is attached to an electronegative oxygen atom. Together, the triplet and quartet strongly suggest an **ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is a classic signal for the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). This confirms the interpretation of the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, point to a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons at 8.0 ppm are downfield, indicating they are adjacent to a strong electron-withdrawing group (the ester), while the protons at 7.0 ppm are upfield, suggesting they are adjacent to an electron-donating group (the amine).\n\n### **Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure, also known as Benzocaine, has a para-substituted benzene ring with a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   **Formula (C₉H₁₁NO₂):** Matches.\n    *   **IR:** Contains a primary amine and a conjugated ester. This is consistent with the observed N-H and C=O stretches.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** Contains an ethoxy group, a primary amine, and a para-substituted aromatic ring with electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups. This perfectly matches all the observed signals and their splitting patterns.\n\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is a phenyl ester. While the formula matches, the NMR would show a propionyl group (a triplet and quartet at much higher field, ~1.1 and ~2.5 ppm respectively) instead of an ethoxy group. This is inconsistent with the data.\n\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This structure has a primary amide (-CONH₂) and meta-substitution. The IR carbonyl stretch for an amide is typically at a lower frequency (~1650-1690 cm⁻¹) than the observed 1720 cm⁻¹. The NMR aromatic region would show a more complex pattern for meta-substitution, not two doublets. This is inconsistent with the data.\n\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide (-NH-). It would show only one N-H stretch in the IR spectrum, not two. The NMR would show a signal for only one amide proton, not two, and would also feature a very downfield formyl proton (H-C=O) signal. This is inconsistent with the data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAll spectral data—molecular formula, IR, and ¹H NMR—are fully consistent with the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\nFirst, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE), also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency.\nDBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\nDBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\nA DBE of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond (1 DBE), likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The two medium-to-strong bands in this region are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching of a primary amine (-NH2).\n*   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Given the DBE and the presence of two oxygen atoms, this is very likely an ester group. The frequency is a bit low for a simple alkyl ester, suggesting conjugation with the aromatic ring.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 protons indicates a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3). The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm is the classic signature of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The high chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) suggests the -CH2- is attached to an electronegative oxygen atom, as in an ethyl ester (-O-CH2CH3).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is consistent with the two protons of a primary amine (-NH2), which aligns with the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group, while the protons at 7.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-donating amine group.\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options**\nBased on the analysis, the molecule contains:\n1.  A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n2.  A primary amine group (-NH2).\n3.  An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n\nPutting these pieces together gives ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Let's check this against the options.\n\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, not a para-substituted ester.\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is an ester, but the ethyl group is on the acid side (propionate), not the alcohol side. The NMR would show a -O-C6H4-NH2 pattern, and the propionate group would have different shifts.\n*   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H peak in the IR and NMR.\n*   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: Correct. This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data: a para-substituted ring with a primary amine and an ethyl ester group.\n\n```python\ndef identify_compound():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided spectral data to identify the correct chemical structure.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given Data\n    molecular_formula = \"C9H11NO2\"\n    ir_data = [\"3420 cm-1 (N-H stretch)\", \"3325 cm-1 (N-H stretch)\", \"1720 cm-1 (C=O stretch)\"]\n    nmr_data = {\n        \"1.20 ppm\": \"t, 3H\",\n        \"4.0 ppm\": \"bs, 2H\",\n        \"4.5 ppm\": \"q, 2H\",\n        \"7.0 ppm\": \"d, 2H\",\n        \"8.0 ppm\": \"d, 2H\"\n    }\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"3-ethoxybenzamide\",\n        \"B\": \"4-aminophenyl propionate\",\n        \"C\": \"N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide\",\n        \"D\": \"ethyl 4-aminobenzoate\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step Analysis:\")\n    print(\"1.

A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds). The remaining degree of unsaturation typically corresponds to a double bond, such as a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** This pair of sharp bands in the N-H stretching region is a classic signature for a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**. The two bands arise from the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This rules out secondary amides (one band) and tertiary amides/amines (no bands in this region).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl (C=O) region.\n    *   This frequency is typical for an **ester group conjugated with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR)**. Simple alkyl esters are usually at a slightly higher frequency (~1735-1750 cm⁻¹), but conjugation lowers the frequency.\n    *   It is too high for a typical amide (~1650-1690 cm⁻¹).\n    *   It is too low for a phenyl ester (Ar-O-COR, ~1760-1770 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂) and a conjugated ester group.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Indicates a methyl (-CH₃) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (t, triplet):** The n+1 rule (n=2) means this methyl group is adjacent to a methylene (-CH₂) group.\n    *   **Fragment:** -CH₂-CH₃\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Indicates a methylene (-CH₂) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (q, quartet):** The n+1 rule (n=3) means this methylene group is adjacent to the methyl (-CH₃) group identified above.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very downfield shift for a CH₂ group. This high value is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an ester oxygen (-C(=O)-O-**CH₂**-).\n    *   **Fragment:** The triplet at 1.20 ppm and this quartet at 4.5 ppm together confirm the presence of an **ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (bs, broad singlet):** Broad signals are typical for exchangeable protons like those on N-H or O-H groups. This signal is consistent with the two protons of the **primary amine (-NH₂) group** identified from the IR spectrum.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** Indicates four protons on an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Multiplicity (two doublets):** This symmetrical pattern is characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The amine group (-NH₂) is an electron-donating group, which shields the ortho protons, shifting them upfield (lower ppm). The ester group (-COOEt) is an electron-withdrawing group, which deshields the ortho protons, shifting them downfield (higher ppm). Therefore, the doublet at 7.0 ppm corresponds to the two protons ortho to the -NH₂ group, and the doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the two protons ortho to the -COOEt group.\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, the structure consists of:\n1.  A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n2.  An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n3.  A primary amine group (-NH₂).\n\nAssembling these pieces gives **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Let's check this against the options.\n\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, which contradicts the IR (primary amine, not amide) and NMR (para substitution pattern).\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. This is a phenyl ester. The NMR would show a quartet for the -CH₂- group next to the carbonyl at ~2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. The IR C=O stretch would also be at a higher frequency.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all the data: the molecular formula, the primary amine and conjugated ester in the IR, and the ethyl group, para-substituted ring, and amine protons in the NMR.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR (primary amine). It would also show a formyl proton (-CHO) signal in the NMR, which is absent.\n\n**Final Conclusion:** The compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2 using the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for calculating DoU is C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    *   DoU = 9 - (11/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 9 - 5.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (e.g., a C=O group).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH₂) group. The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. This frequency is typical for the C=O stretch of an ester. It is too high for a simple amide (~1660 cm⁻¹) and in the correct range for an α,β-unsaturated or aryl ester.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 protons indicates a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃-). The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm confirms the presence of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) suggests the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen, as in an ester (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of the two protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). The broadness is due to quadrupole broadening from the nitrogen atom and chemical exchange. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, are a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The significant difference in their chemical shifts indicates that one substituent is strongly electron-donating (shifting ortho protons upfield to ~7.0 ppm) and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing (shifting its ortho protons downfield to ~8.0 ppm).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\n*   From the DoU and NMR, we have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   From the IR and NMR, the two substituents are a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   The amine group (-NH₂) is an electron-donating group (EDG).\n*   The ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG).\n*   Placing these on the ring in a para-arrangement: The protons ortho to the donating -NH₂ group will be shielded and appear at a lower chemical shift (upfield). This corresponds to the doublet at 7.0 ppm. The protons ortho to the withdrawing -COOCH₂CH₃ group will be deshielded and appear at a higher chemical shift (downfield). This corresponds to the doublet at 8.0 ppm.\n\nThis assembly leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**5. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR and have an N-H proton integrating to 1H in the NMR. The C=O stretch would be at a lower frequency.\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is a phenyl ester. The ethyl group would be part of a propionyl group (-CO-CH₂CH₃). The -CH₂- protons would appear around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data: a primary amine, an ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring with appropriate electronic effects reflected in the NMR chemical shifts. The molecular formula C₉H₁₁NO₂ is also correct.\n*   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a primary amide, and its C=O stretch would be at a lower frequency (~1660 cm⁻¹). Also, as a 1,3-disubstituted (meta) ring, it would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two clean doublets.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound with the molecular formula C9H11NO2.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) plus one additional double bond, typically a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### 2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of medium-to-strong bands is highly characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Given the formula and other data, this is likely an ester.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH3) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-). This is the first part of an ethyl group.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons is characteristic of a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3). The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm suggests this methylene group is attached to an electronegative oxygen atom, as in an ethyl ester (-O-CH2CH3).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is a classic signal for the protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadness is due to nitrogen's quadrupole moment and chemical exchange.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly suggest a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons on the ring are split into two distinct signals. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating group (the -NH2), while the downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester's carbonyl).\n\n### 4. Assembling the Structure\n\nBased on the combined analysis:\n*   We have a **1,4-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n*   One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH2)**.\n*   The other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3)**.\n\nPutting these pieces together gives the structure for **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**, which is also known as benzocaine. This structure is fully consistent with all the provided data: the molecular formula, the degree of unsaturation, and the IR and ¹H NMR spectra.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe data provided corresponds to the following compound:\n\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula for calculating the degree of unsaturation is `(2C + 2 + N - H - X) / 2`.\n    *   (2 * 9 + 2 + 1 - 11 - 0) / 2 = (18 + 2 + 1 - 11) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5.\n*   A degree of unsaturation of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two distinct bands in this region are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. The frequency is consistent with a conjugated ester.\n\n### **3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons suggests a methyl group (-CH3) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 protons indicates a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3). The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an oxygen atom (-O-CH2-). This pattern, combined with the triplet at 1.20 ppm, confirms the presence of an ethyl group attached to an ester oxygen (-O-CH2CH3).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is a classic signal for the two protons of a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). The broadening is due to proton exchange and quadrupolar relaxation from the nitrogen atom.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly suggests a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons on the ring are split into two equivalent sets. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to a strong electron-withdrawing group (the ester), while the upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating group (the amine).\n\n### **4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis of the spectral data, the fragments are:\n*   A primary amine group (-NH2)\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3)\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring\n\nPutting these pieces together, the only structure that fits all the data is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n### **5. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is an amide, not an ester, and its NMR spectrum would be different.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is a phenyl ester. The ethyl group would be attached to the carbonyl, showing a quartet around 2.3-2.6 ppm, which contradicts the observed quartet at 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure is perfectly consistent with all the data: the molecular formula, the IR bands for a primary amine and a conjugated ester, and the ¹H NMR signals for an ethyl ester, a primary aromatic amine, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide and is 1,3-disubstituted (meta), which would result in a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum, not two clean doublets.\n\nTherefore, the compound is identified as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the correct compound.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula can be used to calculate the degree of unsaturation, which indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds in the molecule.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A degree of unsaturation of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### 2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two distinct bands in this region are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Given the presence of two oxygen atoms in the formula, this is very likely an ester, which usually appears between 1750-1715 cm⁻¹.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal corresponds to 3 protons, and its triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is adjacent to a -CH₂- group. This pattern is characteristic of the methyl part of an ethyl group (-CH₂**CH₃**).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal for 2 protons is a quartet (q), meaning it is adjacent to a -CH₃ group. The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm suggests the -CH₂- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom within an ester (-COO**CH₂**CH₃). This confirms the presence of an ethyl ester.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) for 2 protons in this region is a classic signal for the protons of a primary amine (-**NH₂**). The broadness is due to proton exchange and quadrupole broadening from the nitrogen atom. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals, both doublets (d) and each integrating to 2 protons, are indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two different chemical shifts for the aromatic protons mean the two substituents on the ring have different electronic effects. The electron-donating amino group (-NH₂) shields its ortho protons, shifting them upfield (to ~7.0 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its ortho protons, shifting them downfield (to ~8.0 ppm).\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nBased on the combined analysis:\n*   The molecule contains a **primary amine** (-NH₂).\n*   It contains an **ethyl ester** group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   These two groups are attached to a **benzene ring** in a **1,4 (para) arrangement**.\n\nThis information leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the given options:\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is an amide, not an ester, and has a secondary amine (N-H), which would show only one IR band.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** The ethyl group is part of the propionate, not the ester's alcohol portion. The NMR would be different.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted (1,3) amide, which contradicts the NMR aromatic pattern and the IR data.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data. The ¹H NMR data for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate shows a triplet at ~1.35 ppm, a quartet at ~4.31 ppm, a broad singlet for the amine protons, and two doublets for the aromatic protons at ~6.62 and ~7.84 ppm, which is consistent with the provided data.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The DBE is calculated to determine the number of rings and/or double bonds.\n    DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2)\n    DBE = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DBE of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) plus one additional double bond (1 DBE), most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### 2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two medium-to-strong intensity bands in this region is characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is typical for an **ester**, specifically an aromatic ester. It is generally too high for an amide and too low for a phenyl ester.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two substituents are electronically different. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, while the upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating group.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to two protons corresponds to the two protons of the **primary amine (-NH₂) group** identified from the IR spectrum. Its broadness is due to quadrupole broadening and chemical exchange. The -NH₂ group is an electron-donating group, which is consistent with the upfield aromatic doublet at 7.0 ppm.\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This pair of signals is characteristic of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The triplet (t) at 1.20 ppm corresponds to the methyl (-CH₃) protons, which are split by the two adjacent methylene protons (n+1 = 2+1 = 3 peaks).\n    *   The quartet (q) at 4.5 ppm corresponds to the methylene (-CH₂) protons, which are split by the three adjacent methyl protons (n+1 = 3+1 = 4 peaks).\n    *   The significant downfield chemical shift of the methylene quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates that it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which in this context is the oxygen of an ester group (-O-CH₂-). This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)**. The ester group is an electron-withdrawing group, consistent with the downfield aromatic doublet at 8.0 ppm.\n\n### 4. Assembling the Structure\n\nBased on the analysis of all the data:\n*   We have a benzene ring substituted at the 1 and 4 positions.\n*   One substituent is a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   The other substituent is an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nPlacing the electron-donating -NH₂ group and the electron-withdrawing -COOCH₂CH₃ group at the 1 and 4 positions of the benzene ring gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. This structure is consistent with all the spectral data.\n\n### 5. Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the data: C₉H₁₁NO₂, primary amine, ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is an amide, not an ester, which is inconsistent with the IR C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹. Also, 1,3-substitution would produce a more complex aromatic NMR pattern.\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** In this ester, the ethyl group is part of the acyl chain (-CO-CH₂CH₃). The NMR signal for this methylene group would be a quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR and one N-H proton in the NMR. It would also have a formyl proton (-CHO) signal above 8 ppm in the NMR, which is not observed.\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   The formula for DoU is: C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2), where C is the number of carbons, H is hydrogens, X is halogens, and N is nitrogens.\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one band, and an amide N-H stretch is typically at a slightly lower frequency.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for an **ester** conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is too high for a typical amide (which is usually < 1700 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (where the oxygen is directly attached to the ring, ~1760 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Corresponds to three protons, suggesting a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (t, triplet):** The signal is split into a triplet, which means it is adjacent to a group with two protons (n+1 rule, 2+1=3), such as a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   This pattern (a 3H triplet) is classic for the methyl part of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons, suggesting a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (q, quartet):** The signal is split into a quartet, meaning it is adjacent to a group with three protons (3+1=4), such as a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very downfield shift for a -CH₂- group, indicating it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom in an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n    *   Combining this with the signal at 1.20 ppm confirms the presence of an **ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃)**, which is part of an ester.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (bs, broad singlet):** Broad signals for 2H are often due to exchangeable protons, like those in an -OH or -NH₂ group. Given the IR data, this signal corresponds to the two protons of the **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The broadness is due to proton exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** There are a total of four protons in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm).\n    *   **Splitting Pattern:** The presence of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The protons at 8.0 ppm are significantly downfield (deshielded) compared to those at 7.0 ppm. This indicates that the ring is substituted with both an electron-donating group (EDG) and an electron-withdrawing group (EWG).\n        *   The -NH₂ group is a strong EDG, which shields the ortho protons, shifting them upfield (to ~7.0 ppm).\n        *   The ester group (-COOR) is an EWG, which deshields the ortho protons, shifting them downfield (to ~8.0 ppm).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   We have a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n*   One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n*   The other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\nPutting these pieces together gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. This compound is also known as Benzocaine.\n\n**5. Verifying the Options**\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all spectral data perfectly.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is a phenyl ester. The NMR would show a -CO-CH₂- quartet around 2.5 ppm, not a -O-CH₂- quartet at 4.5 ppm. Incorrect.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide. The IR would show one N-H band and an amide C=O band (~1670 cm⁻¹). Incorrect.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide and is meta-substituted. The IR C=O band would be incorrect, and the aromatic NMR pattern would be more complex than two doublets. Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis is a classic spectroscopy problem. Let's break down the evidence step-by-step to deduce the structure of the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency) tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds in the molecule.\n\nThe formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\nFor C9H11NO2:\n*   C = 9 (carbons)\n*   H = 11 (hydrogens)\n*   N = 1 (nitrogen)\n\nDoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2)\nDoU = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5\n**DoU = 5**\n\nA DoU of 4 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring. The additional degree of unsaturation (5 - 4 = 1) suggests the presence of one double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O), which is also supported by the IR data.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is a classic signature for the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. A secondary amine (-NH-) would only show one band.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its position is characteristic of a conjugated **ester**. An amide carbonyl typically appears at a lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm⁻¹).\n\n**Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a primary amine (-NH₂) and a conjugated ester group.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's analyze each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents 3 protons, indicating a methyl (-CH₃) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (t, triplet):** The signal is split by 2 adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2). This means the -CH₃ group is next to a -CH₂ group.\n    *   This suggests a **-CH₂-CH₃** fragment.\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents 2 protons, indicating a methylene (-CH₂) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (q, quartet):** The signal is split by 3 adjacent protons (n+1=4, so n=3). This means the -CH₂ group is next to a -CH₃ group.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very downfield shift for a -CH₂ group, which indicates it is bonded to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom in an ester (**-O-CH₂-**).\n    *   Combining this with the signal at 1.20 ppm, we can confirm the presence of an **ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents 2 protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (bs, broad singlet):** Broad signals are typical for protons on heteroatoms that can undergo chemical exchange, such as -OH or -NH protons.\n    *   Given the IR data indicating a primary amine, this signal corresponds to the two protons of the **-NH₂ group**.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0-8.0 ppm):** This is the aromatic region. The total integration is 4H (2H + 2H), indicating a disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet for both):** This symmetrical pattern of two doublets is characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The protons at 8.0 ppm are further downfield because they are ortho (adjacent) to the electron-withdrawing ester group. The protons at 7.0 ppm are more upfield because they are ortho to the electron-donating amine group.\n\n### **Step 4: Assemble the Structure and Final Conclusion**\n\nPutting all the pieces together:\n1.  We have a **1,4-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n2.  One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n3.  The other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\nThis leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Let's check this against the options.\n\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure perfectly matches all the data: C₉H₁₁NO₂, a primary amine, a conjugated ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring.\n*   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is an isomer where the ethyl group is part of the acid portion (CH₃CH₂COO-). The NMR for the -CH₂- group would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR and NMR data.\n\nThe correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   The formula for DoU is: C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (N-H stretching) is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH₂). One band corresponds to the asymmetric stretch and the other to the symmetric stretch.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region.

Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Corresponds to three protons, suggesting a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Splitting (t, triplet):** The n+1 rule indicates it is adjacent to a group with 2 protons (2+1=3), which is a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   This is the -CH₃ part of an ethyl group.\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons, suggesting a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Splitting (q, quartet):** The n+1 rule indicates it is adjacent to a group with 3 protons (3+1=4), which is a methyl group (-CH₃-).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a significantly downfield shift for a -CH₂- group. This high value is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an oxygen atom that is part of an ester (-C(=O)-O-**CH₂**-).\n    *   Together, the signals at 1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an **ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃)** attached to a carbonyl, forming an ethyl ester fragment.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons.\n    *   **Splitting (bs, broad singlet):** This is characteristic of amine protons (-NH₂), which often appear broad due to hydrogen exchange and quadrupolar broadening from the nitrogen atom. This confirms the primary amine found in the IR data.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** Indicates four protons on an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0-8.0 ppm):** This is the aromatic region.\n    *   **Splitting Pattern:** The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The protons at 8.0 ppm are more deshielded (further downfield), meaning they are adjacent (ortho) to a strong electron-withdrawing group (the ester, -COOEt).\n    *   The protons at 7.0 ppm are more shielded (further upfield), meaning they are adjacent (ortho) to an electron-donating group (the amine, -NH₂).\n\n**4.

It has the correct formula (C9H11NO2), a primary amine, a conjugated ester, an ethoxy group, and a para-substituted aromatic ring with the expected chemical shifts.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is an amide, not an ester. The C=O stretch would be at a lower frequency (~1680 cm⁻¹). The aromatic region would show a more complex pattern for meta-substitution, not two doublets.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR. The NMR would show a formyl proton (-CHO) signal around 8 ppm and an N-H proton, not an -NH₂ signal.\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is a phenyl ester. The ester group is -O-C(=O)-CH₂CH₃. The NMR would show a quartet for the -CH₂- group next to the carbonyl at a much lower chemical shift (~2.2-2.6 ppm), not at 4.5 ppm.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate as the correct structure.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound with the molecular formula C9H11NO2.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula and IR Spectrum\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula indicates 5 degrees of unsaturation, which is consistent with a benzene ring (4 degrees) and a carbonyl group (1 degree).\n*   **IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The medium to strong intensity bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are characteristic of the N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. This frequency is typical for a conjugated ester.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal, a triplet integrating to three hydrogens, suggests a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two hydrogens is characteristic of a methylene group (-CH₂) next to a methyl group (-CH₃). The chemical shift at 4.5 ppm indicates the methylene group is attached to an electronegative atom, such as an oxygen in an ester (-COOCH₂-). Together, the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) attached to an ester oxygen.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two hydrogens is a classic signal for the protons of a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂).\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two hydrogens, are characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-donating amino group, while the downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n\n### 3. Structure Determination\n\nBased on the combined data:\n*   The IR and NMR data confirm a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   The IR and NMR data confirm an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   The NMR data confirms a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\nAssembling these fragments leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**, which is also known as benzocaine. The spectroscopic data for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate found in literature is consistent with the data provided.\n\n### 4. Evaluation of Other Options\n\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amine (would show one N-H band in IR) and an amide, which is inconsistent with the data.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This structure has a propionate group, not an ethyl ester. The NMR would show a methylene group adjacent to the carbonyl around 2.2-2.5 ppm, which is not observed.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide, and the aromatic substitution is meta, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the NMR than two doublets.\n\nTherefore, the data uniquely identifies the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    The degree of unsaturation is calculated as follows: `C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`.\n    For C9H11NO2, this is `9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5`.\n    A degree of unsaturation of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Given the molecular formula and other data, this is consistent with an ester.\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons indicates a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃-). The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and this quartet at 4.5 ppm confirms the presence of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an oxygen atom, as in an ethyl ester (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding and quadrupolar relaxation. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons on the ring are split into two distinct signals. The upfield doublet (~7.0 ppm) is adjacent to an electron-donating group (the -NH₂), while the downfield doublet (~8.0 ppm) is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester, -COOEt).\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options**\n    The data points to a structure with a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, a primary amine group, and an ethyl ester group. Assembling these pieces gives ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n    Let's check this against the given options:\n    *   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR and has a different NMR pattern.\n    *   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure, also known as Benzocaine, perfectly matches all the data:\n        *   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂.\n        *   **IR:** Has a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ester carbonyl (C=O).\n        *   **¹H NMR:** Has an ethyl ester group, a primary amine, and a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring. Published spectra for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate show signals at approximately 1.35 ppm (t, 3H), 4.16 ppm (s, br, 2H, -NH₂), 4.31 ppm (q, 2H), 6.62 ppm (d, 2H), and 7.84 ppm (d, 2H), which are in excellent agreement with the provided data.\n    *   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This has a propionate group attached to the phenolic oxygen. The NMR signal for the -CH₂- next to the carbonyl would be much further upfield (around 2.3-2.6 ppm), not at 4.5 ppm.\n    *   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide, and the carbonyl IR stretch would be at a lower frequency (~1680 cm⁻¹). The aromatic substitution is meta, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the NMR, not two clean doublets.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe spectroscopic data is unequivocally consistent with the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: 1 ring and 3 double bonds) plus one additional double bond, typically a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### 2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in this region is a classic sign of a primary amine (-NH2). These bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group. The frequency is typical for an ester.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH3) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons indicates a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3). The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and this quartet at 4.5 ppm confirms the presence of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm suggests the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, like the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH2-).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadness is due to proton exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons on the ring are split into two distinct signals. The upfield signal at 7.0 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating group (the -NH2), while the downfield signal at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester's carbonyl group).\n\n### 4. Conclusion and Structure Determination\n\nBased on the combined analysis:\n*   The formula is C9H11NO2 and the DoU is 5.\n*   The IR spectrum shows a primary amine (-NH2) and a carbonyl group (C=O), likely an ester.\n*   The ¹H NMR spectrum confirms the presence of an ethyl group, a primary amine, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\nPutting these pieces together, the structure is a benzene ring substituted with an amino group and an ethyl ester group at positions 1 and 4. This corresponds to **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**, which is also known as benzocaine. This structure is fully consistent with all the provided data.\n\nLet's review the options:\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** The ethyl group would be part of the propionate, and its methylene protons would be adjacent to the carbonyl, appearing at a much higher field (around 2.3 ppm), not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is an amide, and its IR C=O stretch would likely be at a lower frequency. It would also show a signal for the formyl proton (H-C=O) in the NMR, which is absent.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a 1,3-disubstituted (meta) benzene, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

This suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region are highly characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its position is typical for an ester, particularly one that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons indicates a methylene group (-CH₂) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃). The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm suggests this methylene group is attached to an electronegative oxygen atom. Together, the triplet and quartet strongly suggest an **ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is a classic signal for the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). This confirms the interpretation of the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, point to a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons at 8.0 ppm are downfield, indicating they are adjacent to a strong electron-withdrawing group (the ester), while the protons at 7.0 ppm are upfield, suggesting they are adjacent to an electron-donating group (the amine).\n\n### **Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure, also known as Benzocaine, has a para-substituted benzene ring with a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   **Formula (C₉H₁₁NO₂):** Matches.\n    *   **IR:** Contains a primary amine and a conjugated ester. This is consistent with the observed N-H and C=O stretches.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** Contains an ethoxy group, a primary amine, and a para-substituted aromatic ring with electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups. This perfectly matches all the observed signals and their splitting patterns.\n\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is a phenyl ester. While the formula matches, the NMR would show a propionyl group (a triplet and quartet at much higher field, ~1.1 and ~2.5 ppm respectively) instead of an ethoxy group. This is inconsistent with the data.\n\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This structure has a primary amide (-CONH₂) and meta-substitution. The IR carbonyl stretch for an amide is typically at a lower frequency (~1650-1690 cm⁻¹) than the observed 1720 cm⁻¹. The NMR aromatic region would show a more complex pattern for meta-substitution, not two doublets. This is inconsistent with the data.\n\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide (-NH-). It would show only one N-H stretch in the IR spectrum, not two. The NMR would show a signal for only one amide proton, not two, and would also feature a very downfield formyl proton (H-C=O) signal. This is inconsistent with the data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAll spectral data—molecular formula, IR, and ¹H NMR—are fully consistent with the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\nFirst, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE), also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency.\nDBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\nDBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\nA DBE of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond (1 DBE), likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The two medium-to-strong bands in this region are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching of a primary amine (-NH2).\n*   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Given the DBE and the presence of two oxygen atoms, this is very likely an ester group. The frequency is a bit low for a simple alkyl ester, suggesting conjugation with the aromatic ring.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 protons indicates a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3). The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm is the classic signature of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The high chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) suggests the -CH2- is attached to an electronegative oxygen atom, as in an ethyl ester (-O-CH2CH3).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is consistent with the two protons of a primary amine (-NH2), which aligns with the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group, while the protons at 7.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-donating amine group.\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options**\nBased on the analysis, the molecule contains:\n1.  A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n2.  A primary amine group (-NH2).\n3.  An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n\nPutting these pieces together gives ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Let's check this against the options.\n\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, not a para-substituted ester.\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is an ester, but the ethyl group is on the acid side (propionate), not the alcohol side.

A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds). The remaining degree of unsaturation typically corresponds to a double bond, such as a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** This pair of sharp bands in the N-H stretching region is a classic signature for a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**. The two bands arise from the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This rules out secondary amides (one band) and tertiary amides/amines (no bands in this region).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl (C=O) region.\n    *   This frequency is typical for an **ester group conjugated with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR)**. Simple alkyl esters are usually at a slightly higher frequency (~1735-1750 cm⁻¹), but conjugation lowers the frequency.\n    *   It is too high for a typical amide (~1650-1690 cm⁻¹).\n    *   It is too low for a phenyl ester (Ar-O-COR, ~1760-1770 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂) and a conjugated ester group.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Indicates a methyl (-CH₃) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (t, triplet):** The n+1 rule (n=2) means this methyl group is adjacent to a methylene (-CH₂) group.\n    *   **Fragment:** -CH₂-CH₃\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Indicates a methylene (-CH₂) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (q, quartet):** The n+1 rule (n=3) means this methylene group is adjacent to the methyl (-CH₃) group identified above.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very downfield shift for a CH₂ group. This high value is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an ester oxygen (-C(=O)-O-**CH₂**-).\n    *   **Fragment:** The triplet at 1.20 ppm and this quartet at 4.5 ppm together confirm the presence of an **ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (bs, broad singlet):** Broad signals are typical for exchangeable protons like those on N-H or O-H groups. This signal is consistent with the two protons of the **primary amine (-NH₂) group** identified from the IR spectrum.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** Indicates four protons on an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Multiplicity (two doublets):** This symmetrical pattern is characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The amine group (-NH₂) is an electron-donating group, which shields the ortho protons, shifting them upfield (lower ppm). The ester group (-COOEt) is an electron-withdrawing group, which deshields the ortho protons, shifting them downfield (higher ppm). Therefore, the doublet at 7.0 ppm corresponds to the two protons ortho to the -NH₂ group, and the doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the two protons ortho to the -COOEt group.\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, the structure consists of:\n1.  A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n2.  An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n3.  A primary amine group (-NH₂).\n\nAssembling these pieces gives **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Let's check this against the options.\n\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, which contradicts the IR (primary amine, not amide) and NMR (para substitution pattern).\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. This is a phenyl ester. The NMR would show a quartet for the -CH₂- group next to the carbonyl at ~2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. The IR C=O stretch would also be at a higher frequency.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all the data: the molecular formula, the primary amine and conjugated ester in the IR, and the ethyl group, para-substituted ring, and amine protons in the NMR.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR (primary amine). It would also show a formyl proton (-CHO) signal in the NMR, which is absent.\n\n**Final Conclusion:** The compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2 using the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for calculating DoU is C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    *   DoU = 9 - (11/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 9 - 5.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (e.g., a C=O group).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH₂) group. The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. This frequency is typical for the C=O stretch of an ester. It is too high for a simple amide (~1660 cm⁻¹) and in the correct range for an α,β-unsaturated or aryl ester.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 protons indicates a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃-). The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm confirms the presence of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) suggests the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen, as in an ester (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of the two protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). The broadness is due to quadrupole broadening from the nitrogen atom and chemical exchange. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, are a hallmark of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The significant difference in their chemical shifts indicates that one substituent is strongly electron-donating (shifting ortho protons upfield to ~7.0 ppm) and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing (shifting its ortho protons downfield to ~8.0 ppm).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\n*   From the DoU and NMR, we have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   From the IR and NMR, the two substituents are a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   The amine group (-NH₂) is an electron-donating group (EDG).\n*   The ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG).\n*   Placing these on the ring in a para-arrangement: The protons ortho to the donating -NH₂ group will be shielded and appear at a lower chemical shift (upfield). This corresponds to the doublet at 7.0 ppm. The protons ortho to the withdrawing -COOCH₂CH₃ group will be deshielded and appear at a higher chemical shift (downfield). This corresponds to the doublet at 8.0 ppm.\n\nThis assembly leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**5. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR and have an N-H proton integrating to 1H in the NMR. The C=O stretch would be at a lower frequency.\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is a phenyl ester. The ethyl group would be part of a propionyl group (-CO-CH₂CH₃). The -CH₂- protons would appear around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data: a primary amine, an ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring with appropriate electronic effects reflected in the NMR chemical shifts. The molecular formula C₉H₁₁NO₂ is also correct.\n*   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a primary amide, and its C=O stretch would be at a lower frequency (~1660 cm⁻¹). Also, as a 1,3-disubstituted (meta) ring, it would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two clean doublets.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound with the molecular formula C9H11NO2.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) plus one additional double bond, typically a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### 2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of medium-to-strong bands is highly characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Given the formula and other data, this is likely an ester.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH3) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-). This is the first part of an ethyl group.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons is characteristic of a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3). The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm suggests this methylene group is attached to an electronegative oxygen atom, as in an ethyl ester (-O-CH2CH3).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is a classic signal for the protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadness is due to nitrogen's quadrupole moment and chemical exchange.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly suggest a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons on the ring are split into two distinct signals. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating group (the -NH2), while the downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester's carbonyl).\n\n### 4. Assembling the Structure\n\nBased on the combined analysis:\n*   We have a **1,4-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n*   One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH2)**.\n*   The other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3)**.\n\nPutting these pieces together gives the structure for **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**, which is also known as benzocaine. This structure is fully consistent with all the provided data: the molecular formula, the degree of unsaturation, and the IR and ¹H NMR spectra.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe data provided corresponds to the following compound:\n\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula for calculating the degree of unsaturation is `(2C + 2 + N - H - X) / 2`.\n    *   (2 * 9 + 2 + 1 - 11 - 0) / 2 = (18 + 2 + 1 - 11) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5.\n*   A degree of unsaturation of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two distinct bands in this region are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. The frequency is consistent with a conjugated ester.\n\n### **3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons suggests a methyl group (-CH3) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 protons indicates a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3). The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an oxygen atom (-O-CH2-). This pattern, combined with the triplet at 1.20 ppm, confirms the presence of an ethyl group attached to an ester oxygen (-O-CH2CH3).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is a classic signal for the two protons of a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). The broadening is due to proton exchange and quadrupolar relaxation from the nitrogen atom.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, strongly suggests a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons on the ring are split into two equivalent sets. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to a strong electron-withdrawing group (the ester), while the upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating group (the amine).\n\n### **4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis of the spectral data, the fragments are:\n*   A primary amine group (-NH2)\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3)\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring\n\nPutting these pieces together, the only structure that fits all the data is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n### **5. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is an amide, not an ester, and its NMR spectrum would be different.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is a phenyl ester. The ethyl group would be attached to the carbonyl, showing a quartet around 2.3-2.6 ppm, which contradicts the observed quartet at 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure is perfectly consistent with all the data: the molecular formula, the IR bands for a primary amine and a conjugated ester, and the ¹H NMR signals for an ethyl ester, a primary aromatic amine, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide and is 1,3-disubstituted (meta), which would result in a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum, not two clean doublets.\n\nTherefore, the compound is identified as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the correct compound.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula can be used to calculate the degree of unsaturation, which indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds in the molecule.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A degree of unsaturation of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### 2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two distinct bands in this region are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Given the presence of two oxygen atoms in the formula, this is very likely an ester, which usually appears between 1750-1715 cm⁻¹.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal corresponds to 3 protons, and its triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is adjacent to a -CH₂- group. This pattern is characteristic of the methyl part of an ethyl group (-CH₂**CH₃**).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal for 2 protons is a quartet (q), meaning it is adjacent to a -CH₃ group. The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm suggests the -CH₂- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom within an ester (-COO**CH₂**CH₃). This confirms the presence of an ethyl ester.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) for 2 protons in this region is a classic signal for the protons of a primary amine (-**NH₂**). The broadness is due to proton exchange and quadrupole broadening from the nitrogen atom. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals, both doublets (d) and each integrating to 2 protons, are indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two different chemical shifts for the aromatic protons mean the two substituents on the ring have different electronic effects. The electron-donating amino group (-NH₂) shields its ortho protons, shifting them upfield (to ~7.0 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its ortho protons, shifting them downfield (to ~8.0 ppm).\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nBased on the combined analysis:\n*   The molecule contains a **primary amine** (-NH₂).\n*   It contains an **ethyl ester** group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   These two groups are attached to a **benzene ring** in a **1,4 (para) arrangement**.\n\nThis information leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the given options:\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is an amide, not an ester, and has a secondary amine (N-H), which would show only one IR band.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** The ethyl group is part of the propionate, not the ester's alcohol portion. The NMR would be different.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted (1,3) amide, which contradicts the NMR aromatic pattern and the IR data.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data. The ¹H NMR data for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate shows a triplet at ~1.35 ppm, a quartet at ~4.31 ppm, a broad singlet for the amine protons, and two doublets for the aromatic protons at ~6.62 and ~7.84 ppm, which is consistent with the provided data.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The DBE is calculated to determine the number of rings and/or double bonds.\n    DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2)\n    DBE = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DBE of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) plus one additional double bond (1 DBE), most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### 2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two medium-to-strong intensity bands in this region is characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is typical for an **ester**, specifically an aromatic ester. It is generally too high for an amide and too low for a phenyl ester.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two substituents are electronically different. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, while the upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating group.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to two protons corresponds to the two protons of the **primary amine (-NH₂) group** identified from the IR spectrum. Its broadness is due to quadrupole broadening and chemical exchange. The -NH₂ group is an electron-donating group, which is consistent with the upfield aromatic doublet at 7.0 ppm.\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This pair of signals is characteristic of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The triplet (t) at 1.20 ppm corresponds to the methyl (-CH₃) protons, which are split by the two adjacent methylene protons (n+1 = 2+1 = 3 peaks).\n    *   The quartet (q) at 4.5 ppm corresponds to the methylene (-CH₂) protons, which are split by the three adjacent methyl protons (n+1 = 3+1 = 4 peaks).\n    *   The significant downfield chemical shift of the methylene quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates that it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which in this context is the oxygen of an ester group (-O-CH₂-). This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)**. The ester group is an electron-withdrawing group, consistent with the downfield aromatic doublet at 8.0 ppm.\n\n### 4. Assembling the Structure\n\nBased on the analysis of all the data:\n*   We have a benzene ring substituted at the 1 and 4 positions.\n*   One substituent is a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   The other substituent is an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nPlacing the electron-donating -NH₂ group and the electron-withdrawing -COOCH₂CH₃ group at the 1 and 4 positions of the benzene ring gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. This structure is consistent with all the spectral data.\n\n### 5. Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the data: C₉H₁₁NO₂, primary amine, ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is an amide, not an ester, which is inconsistent with the IR C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹. Also, 1,3-substitution would produce a more complex aromatic NMR pattern.\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** In this ester, the ethyl group is part of the acyl chain (-CO-CH₂CH₃). The NMR signal for this methylene group would be a quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR and one N-H proton in the NMR. It would also have a formyl proton (-CHO) signal above 8 ppm in the NMR, which is not observed.\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   The formula for DoU is: C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2), where C is the number of carbons, H is hydrogens, X is halogens, and N is nitrogens.\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one band, and an amide N-H stretch is typically at a slightly lower frequency.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for an **ester** conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is too high for a typical amide (which is usually < 1700 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (where the oxygen is directly attached to the ring, ~1760 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Corresponds to three protons, suggesting a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (t, triplet):** The signal is split into a triplet, which means it is adjacent to a group with two protons (n+1 rule, 2+1=3), such as a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   This pattern (a 3H triplet) is classic for the methyl part of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons, suggesting a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (q, quartet):** The signal is split into a quartet, meaning it is adjacent to a group with three protons (3+1=4), such as a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very downfield shift for a -CH₂- group, indicating it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom in an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n    *   Combining this with the signal at 1.20 ppm confirms the presence of an **ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃)**, which is part of an ester.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (bs, broad singlet):** Broad signals for 2H are often due to exchangeable protons, like those in an -OH or -NH₂ group. Given the IR data, this signal corresponds to the two protons of the **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The broadness is due to proton exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** There are a total of four protons in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm).\n    *   **Splitting Pattern:** The presence of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The protons at 8.0 ppm are significantly downfield (deshielded) compared to those at 7.0 ppm. This indicates that the ring is substituted with both an electron-donating group (EDG) and an electron-withdrawing group (EWG).\n        *   The -NH₂ group is a strong EDG, which shields the ortho protons, shifting them upfield (to ~7.0 ppm).\n        *   The ester group (-COOR) is an EWG, which deshields the ortho protons, shifting them downfield (to ~8.0 ppm).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   We have a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n*   One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n*   The other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\nPutting these pieces together gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. This compound is also known as Benzocaine.\n\n**5. Verifying the Options**\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all spectral data perfectly.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is a phenyl ester. The NMR would show a -CO-CH₂- quartet around 2.5 ppm, not a -O-CH₂- quartet at 4.5 ppm. Incorrect.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide. The IR would show one N-H band and an amide C=O band (~1670 cm⁻¹). Incorrect.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide and is meta-substituted. The IR C=O band would be incorrect, and the aromatic NMR pattern would be more complex than two doublets. Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis is a classic spectroscopy problem. Let's break down the evidence step-by-step to deduce the structure of the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency) tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds in the molecule.\n\nThe formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\nFor C9H11NO2:\n*   C = 9 (carbons)\n*   H = 11 (hydrogens)\n*   N = 1 (nitrogen)\n\nDoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2)\nDoU = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5\n**DoU = 5**\n\nA DoU of 4 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring. The additional degree of unsaturation (5 - 4 = 1) suggests the presence of one double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O), which is also supported by the IR data.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is a classic signature for the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. A secondary amine (-NH-) would only show one band.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its position is characteristic of a conjugated **ester**. An amide carbonyl typically appears at a lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm⁻¹).\n\n**Conclusion from IR:** The molecule contains a primary amine (-NH₂) and a conjugated ester group.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's analyze each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents 3 protons, indicating a methyl (-CH₃) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (t, triplet):** The signal is split by 2 adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2). This means the -CH₃ group is next to a -CH₂ group.\n    *   This suggests a **-CH₂-CH₃** fragment.\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents 2 protons, indicating a methylene (-CH₂) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (q, quartet):** The signal is split by 3 adjacent protons (n+1=4, so n=3). This means the -CH₂ group is next to a -CH₃ group.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very downfield shift for a -CH₂ group, which indicates it is bonded to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom in an ester (**-O-CH₂-**).\n    *   Combining this with the signal at 1.20 ppm, we can confirm the presence of an **ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents 2 protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (bs, broad singlet):** Broad signals are typical for protons on heteroatoms that can undergo chemical exchange, such as -OH or -NH protons.\n    *   Given the IR data indicating a primary amine, this signal corresponds to the two protons of the **-NH₂ group**.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0-8.0 ppm):** This is the aromatic region. The total integration is 4H (2H + 2H), indicating a disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet for both):** This symmetrical pattern of two doublets is characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The protons at 8.0 ppm are further downfield because they are ortho (adjacent) to the electron-withdrawing ester group. The protons at 7.0 ppm are more upfield because they are ortho to the electron-donating amine group.\n\n### **Step 4: Assemble the Structure and Final Conclusion**\n\nPutting all the pieces together:\n1.  We have a **1,4-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n2.  One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n3.  The other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\nThis leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Let's check this against the options.\n\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure perfectly matches all the data: C₉H₁₁NO₂, a primary amine, a conjugated ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring.\n*   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is an isomer where the ethyl group is part of the acid portion (CH₃CH₂COO-). The NMR for the -CH₂- group would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR and NMR data.\n\nThe correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   The formula for DoU is: C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (N-H stretching) is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH₂). One band corresponds to the asymmetric stretch and the other to the symmetric stretch.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl region. This frequency is typical for the C=O stretch of an ester, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Corresponds to three protons, suggesting a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Splitting (t, triplet):** The n+1 rule indicates it is adjacent to a group with 2 protons (2+1=3), which is a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   This is the -CH₃ part of an ethyl group.\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons, suggesting a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Splitting (q, quartet):** The n+1 rule indicates it is adjacent to a group with 3 protons (3+1=4), which is a methyl group (-CH₃-).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a significantly downfield shift for a -CH₂- group. This high value is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an oxygen atom that is part of an ester (-C(=O)-O-**CH₂**-).\n    *   Together, the signals at 1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an **ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃)** attached to a carbonyl, forming an ethyl ester fragment.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons.\n    *   **Splitting (bs, broad singlet):** This is characteristic of amine protons (-NH₂), which often appear broad due to hydrogen exchange and quadrupolar broadening from the nitrogen atom. This confirms the primary amine found in the IR data.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** Indicates four protons on an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0-8.0 ppm):** This is the aromatic region.\n    *   **Splitting Pattern:** The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The protons at 8.0 ppm are more deshielded (further downfield), meaning they are adjacent (ortho) to a strong electron-withdrawing group (the ester, -COOEt).\n    *   The protons at 7.0 ppm are more shielded (further upfield), meaning they are adjacent (ortho) to an electron-donating group (the amine, -NH₂).\n\n**4.

It has the correct formula (C9H11NO2), a primary amine, a conjugated ester, an ethoxy group, and a para-substituted aromatic ring with the expected chemical shifts.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is an amide, not an ester. The C=O stretch would be at a lower frequency (~1680 cm⁻¹). The aromatic region would show a more complex pattern for meta-substitution, not two doublets.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR. The NMR would show a formyl proton (-CHO) signal around 8 ppm and an N-H proton, not an -NH₂ signal.\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is a phenyl ester. The ester group is -O-C(=O)-CH₂CH₃. The NMR would show a quartet for the -CH₂- group next to the carbonyl at a much lower chemical shift (~2.2-2.6 ppm), not at 4.5 ppm.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate as the correct structure.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound with the molecular formula C9H11NO2.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula and IR Spectrum\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula indicates 5 degrees of unsaturation, which is consistent with a benzene ring (4 degrees) and a carbonyl group (1 degree).\n*   **IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The medium to strong intensity bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are characteristic of the N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. This frequency is typical for a conjugated ester.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal, a triplet integrating to three hydrogens, suggests a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two hydrogens is characteristic of a methylene group (-CH₂) next to a methyl group (-CH₃). The chemical shift at 4.5 ppm indicates the methylene group is attached to an electronegative atom, such as an oxygen in an ester (-COOCH₂-). Together, the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) attached to an ester oxygen.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two hydrogens is a classic signal for the protons of a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂).\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two hydrogens, are characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-donating amino group, while the downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n\n### 3. Structure Determination\n\nBased on the combined data:\n*   The IR and NMR data confirm a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   The IR and NMR data confirm an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   The NMR data confirms a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\nAssembling these fragments leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**, which is also known as benzocaine. The spectroscopic data for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate found in literature is consistent with the data provided.\n\n### 4. Evaluation of Other Options\n\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amine (would show one N-H band in IR) and an amide, which is inconsistent with the data.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This structure has a propionate group, not an ethyl ester. The NMR would show a methylene group adjacent to the carbonyl around 2.2-2.5 ppm, which is not observed.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide, and the aromatic substitution is meta, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the NMR than two doublets.\n\nTherefore, the data uniquely identifies the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    The degree of unsaturation is calculated as follows: `C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`.\n    For C9H11NO2, this is `9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5`.\n    A degree of unsaturation of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Given the molecular formula and other data, this is consistent with an ester.\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons indicates a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃-). The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and this quartet at 4.5 ppm confirms the presence of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an oxygen atom, as in an ethyl ester (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding and quadrupolar relaxation. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons on the ring are split into two distinct signals. The upfield doublet (~7.0 ppm) is adjacent to an electron-donating group (the -NH₂), while the downfield doublet (~8.0 ppm) is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester, -COOEt).\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options**\n    The data points to a structure with a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, a primary amine group, and an ethyl ester group.

Published spectra for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate show signals at approximately 1.35 ppm (t, 3H), 4.16 ppm (s, br, 2H, -NH₂), 4.31 ppm (q, 2H), 6.62 ppm (d, 2H), and 7.84 ppm (d, 2H), which are in excellent agreement with the provided data.\n    *   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This has a propionate group attached to the phenolic oxygen. The NMR signal for the -CH₂- next to the carbonyl would be much further upfield (around 2.3-2.6 ppm), not at 4.5 ppm.\n    *   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide, and the carbonyl IR stretch would be at a lower frequency (~1680 cm⁻¹). The aromatic substitution is meta, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the NMR, not two clean doublets.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe spectroscopic data is unequivocally consistent with the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: 1 ring and 3 double bonds) plus one additional double bond, typically a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### 2.

The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and this quartet at 4.5 ppm confirms the presence of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm suggests the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, like the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH2-).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH2).

The protons on the ring are split into two distinct signals. The upfield signal at 7.0 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating group (the -NH2), while the downfield signal at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester's carbonyl group).\n\n### 4. Conclusion and Structure Determination\n\nBased on the combined analysis:\n*   The formula is C9H11NO2 and the DoU is 5.\n*   The IR spectrum shows a primary amine (-NH2) and a carbonyl group (C=O), likely an ester.\n*   The ¹H NMR spectrum confirms the presence of an ethyl group, a primary amine, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\nPutting these pieces together, the structure is a benzene ring substituted with an amino group and an ethyl ester group at positions 1 and 4. This corresponds to **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**, which is also known as benzocaine. This structure is fully consistent with all the provided data.\n\nLet's review the options:\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** The ethyl group would be part of the propionate, and its methylene protons would be adjacent to the carbonyl, appearing at a much higher field (around 2.3 ppm), not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is an amide, and its IR C=O stretch would likely be at a lower frequency. It would also show a signal for the formyl proton (H-C=O) in the NMR, which is absent.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a 1,3-disubstituted (meta) benzene, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
