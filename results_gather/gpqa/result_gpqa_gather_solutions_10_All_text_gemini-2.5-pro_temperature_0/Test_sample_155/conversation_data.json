This is a trans-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA:** This reagent performs a syn-epoxidation. The reaction of an achiral trans-alkene with mCPBA (an achiral reagent, for practical purposes) can occur from the top or bottom face of the double bond with equal probability. This results in a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric trans-epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This performs an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The water molecule acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons in an anti-fashion (Sₙ2-like mechanism).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:**\n    *   When the (4R,5R)-epoxide is opened by water, attack at C4 (inverting its configuration to S) or C5 (inverting its configuration to S) both lead to the same product: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   When the (4S,5S)-epoxide is opened by water, attack at C4 (inverting its configuration to R) or C5 (inverting its configuration to R) both lead to the same product: (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol are the same molecule. This is a **meso compound**, which is achiral because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The product is a single meso compound, meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is also an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:** Same as Reaction 1.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:**\n    1.  **mCPBA:** The syn-epoxidation of the achiral cis-alkene produces a single, achiral meso-epoxide: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** The anti-attack of water on the meso-epoxide can occur at two different carbons (C4 and C5).\n        *   Attack at C4 (which is R) inverts its configuration to S, leaving C5 as S. The product is **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        *   Attack at C5 (which is S) inverts its configuration to R, leaving C4 as R. The product is **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n    *   These two products, (4S,5S)- and (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol, are **enantiomers**. Since attack at either carbon is equally likely, they are formed in equal amounts, creating a **racemic mixture**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The products are a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe meso compound is a diastereomer to both of the chiral diols. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are enantiomers of each other.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment, so they cannot be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated into different peaks.\n    *   Therefore, the racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diols will appear as **one peak**. The meso-diol, being a diastereomer, will have different properties and will appear as a **second peak**.\n    *   **Total peaks on standard HPLC: 2**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The chiral column will separate the two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, into **two distinct peaks**.\n    *   The meso-diol is achiral and is a diastereomer to the other two compounds. It will be separated from them and will appear as its own **single peak**.\n    *   **Total peaks on chiral HPLC: 3**\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of a trans-alkene, (E)-oct-4-ene, with mCPBA is a stereospecific *syn*-addition. This means both oxygen-carbon bonds form on the same face of the double bond. Since the starting material is symmetric, this reaction produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening.** The subsequent treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) opens the epoxide ring. This is an *anti*-addition, where the water molecule attacks from the side opposite the epoxide oxygen. The attack occurs with inversion of configuration at the carbon atom being attacked.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 1.** The *anti*-opening of the racemic epoxide mixture results in a single, achiral meso compound: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. This is because the opening of the (4R,5R)-epoxide gives the (4R,5S)-diol, and the opening of the (4S,5S)-epoxide gives the (4S,5R)-diol. These two are the same meso compound.\n\n### Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of a cis-alkene, (Z)-oct-4-ene, with mCPBA is also a *syn*-addition. This reaction forms a single, achiral meso epoxide: (Z)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening.** The acid-catalyzed *anti*-opening of this meso epoxide can occur by nucleophilic attack at either of the two equivalent carbons of the epoxide.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 2.** Attack at one carbon results in the (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol, while attack at the other carbon produces its enantiomer, (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Therefore, this reaction yields a racemic mixture of the two enantiomeric diols.\n\n### Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n*   **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (a meso compound from Reaction 1)\n*   A racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (an enantiomeric pair from Reaction 2)\n\nThe meso compound and the enantiomeric pair are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This technique separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. Therefore, the meso diol will be separated from the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will not be separated. The racemic pair will elute as a single peak.\n    *   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The column will separate the meso compound from the other isomers.\n    *   The chiral stationary phase will also resolve the racemic mixture, separating the (4R,5R)-enantiomer from the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n    *   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **3 peaks** (one for the meso compound and one for each of the two enantiomers).\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 1:** Determine the stereochemical outcome of treating (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid.\n    *   The reaction of an alkene with mCPBA is an epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition.\n    *   The subsequent acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide by water is an *anti*-addition.\n    *   The overall process is an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   An *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a meso compound. Therefore, Reaction 1 produces a single meso diol, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2:** Determine the stereochemical outcome of treating (Z)-oct-4-ene with the same reagents.\n    *   This is also an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   An *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene results in a racemic mixture of enantiomers. Therefore, Reaction 2 produces a 50:50 mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Product Mixture:** The chemist combines the products. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n    *   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (the meso compound from Reaction 1)\n    *   (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n    *   (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\n4.  **Predict the Standard HPLC Chromatogram:**\n    *   Standard (achiral) HPLC separates compounds based on physical properties like polarity.\n    *   Enantiomers (like the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) pair) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will co-elute, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers (like the meso compound and either of the enantiomers) have different physical properties and will be separated into different peaks.\n    *   Therefore, we expect two peaks: one for the meso compound and one for the racemic pair.\n\n5.  **Predict the Chiral HPLC Chromatogram:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The two enantiomers, (4R,5R) and (4S,5S), will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer to the other two and will also have a unique retention time, appearing as a third peak.\n    *   Therefore, we expect three distinct peaks for the three stereoisomers.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The analysis predicts 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC, which corresponds to option D.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_hplc_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the products of two stereospecific reactions and predicts the\n    number of peaks observed in standard and chiral HPLC chromatograms.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1\n    # (E)-oct-4-ene (trans) undergoes anti-dihydroxylation.\n    # A trans-alkene undergoing anti-addition yields a meso compound.\n    reaction1_product = \"Meso-octane-4,5-diol ((4R,5S)-diol)\"\n    print(\"--- Analysis ---\")\n    print(\"Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, then H3O+\")\n    print(f\"Product 1: A single meso compound ({reaction1_product}).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 15)\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2\n    # (Z)-oct-4-ene (cis) undergoes anti-dihydroxylation.\n    # A cis-alkene undergoing anti-addition yields a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    reaction2_products = [\"(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\", \"(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\"]\n    print(\"Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, then H3O+\")\n    print(f\"Product 2: A racemic mixture of two enantiomers: {reaction2_products[0]} and {reaction2_products[1]}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 15)\n\n    # Step 3: Combine the products\n    # The final mixture contains three unique stereoisomers.\n    final_mixture = [reaction1_product] + reaction2_products\n    print(\"Combined Product Mixture contains 3 stereoisomers:\")\n    for i, compound in enumerate(final_mixture):\n        print(f\"  {i+1}. {compound}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 15)\n\n    # Step 4: Predict Standard (Achiral) HPLC results\n    # Achiral HPLC separates diastereomers but not enantiomers.\n    # The meso compound is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair.\n    # The two enantiomers will elute together.\n    standard_hplc_peaks = 2\n    print(\"Standard (Achiral) HPLC Analysis:\")\n    print(\" -

This is a trans-alkene. It is achiral.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA:** This reagent performs an epoxidation, which is a syn-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H3O+):** This catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The nucleophile (water) attacks from the side opposite the C-O bond (backside attack), resulting in an overall anti-addition of two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the original double bond. This process is called anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 1:** The reaction is an anti-dihydroxylation of a trans-alkene. There is a general rule for such reactions on symmetrically substituted alkenes: **Trans + Anti -> Meso**.\n    *   Let's verify this. The starting (E)-oct-4-ene is achiral. The reagents are achiral. The reaction proceeds through a racemic mixture of the trans-epoxide. The subsequent anti-opening of this racemic epoxide mixture yields a single meso product.\n    *   The product is **meso-octane-4,5-diol**, which has the configuration (4R, 5S). A meso compound is achiral despite having chiral centers, due to an internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is a single, unique compound.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** One compound, meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** The same as in Reaction 1, leading to an overall anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 2:** The reaction is an anti-dihydroxylation of a cis-alkene. The general rule is: **Cis + Anti -> Racemic**.\n    *   Let's verify this. The starting (Z)-oct-4-ene is achiral. The epoxidation with mCPBA forms a single meso-epoxide. The subsequent anti-opening of this achiral meso-epoxide by water (an achiral nucleophile) must result in an achiral product mixture. Attack at the two carbons of the epoxide leads to two different products that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other (enantiomers). Since attack at either carbon is equally probable, the two enantiomers are formed in equal amounts.\n    *   The products are **(4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. This is a racemic mixture.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture containing two different compounds (enantiomers).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers of octane-4,5-diol:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationships between these isomers:\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of the (4R, 5R)-diol.\n*   The meso-diol is also a **diastereomer** of the (4S, 5S)-diol.\n*   The (4R, 5R)-diol and the (4S, 5S)-diol are **enantiomers**.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated. They will elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   In our mixture, the meso-diol is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair. Therefore, the meso-diol will be separated from the pair. The two enantiomers will co-elute.\n    *   We will observe **2 peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: The racemic mixture of (4R, 5R)- and (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment.\n    *   A chiral column can separate diastereomers.\n    *   Crucially, a chiral column can also separate enantiomers, because the two enantiomers will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, leading to different retention times.\n    *   Therefore, all three stereoisomers in the mixture will be separated.\n    *   We will observe **3 peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: (4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 3: (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Step 1: Treatment with mCPBA.** This is an epoxidation reaction. The reaction is a *syn*-addition, meaning the stereochemistry of the alkene is preserved in the epoxide. A *trans*-alkene gives a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting material is achiral and the reagent (mCPBA) is achiral, the chiral product must be formed as a racemic mixture. The product is a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n*   **Step 2: Treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. Water acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite the oxygen atom (an Sₙ2-like, *anti*-attack).\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step sequence (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 1:** We are performing an *anti*-addition on a *trans*-alkene. A useful mnemonic is **\"TAM\"**: **T**rans-**A**lkene + **A**nti-addition gives a **M**eso compound.\n    *   Let's verify: Starting with the racemic epoxide mixture:\n        *   (4R,5R)-epoxide undergoes anti-attack by water, leading to the (4R,5S)-diol (which is the same as the (4S,5R)-diol). This is a meso compound.\n        *   (4S,5S)-epoxide also undergoes anti-attack, leading to the same (4S,5R)-diol (meso).\n    *   Therefore, the sole product of Reaction 1 is **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. This is a single, achiral compound.\n\n### **2. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Step 1: Treatment with mCPBA.** The *syn*-addition of the oxygen atom to the *cis*-alkene results in a *cis*-epoxide. The product, cis-4,5-epoxyoctane, has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a meso compound ((4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n*   **Step 2: Treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This is the same *anti*-attack ring-opening as in Reaction 1.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** This is also an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 2:** We are performing an *anti*-addition on a *cis*-alkene. A useful mnemonic is **\"CAR\"**: **C**is-**A**lkene + **A**nti-addition gives a **R**acemic mixture.\n    *   Let's verify: Starting with the meso-epoxide ((4R,5S)-epoxide):\n        *   Attack at C4 (R-configured) inverts it to S, giving the (4S,5S)-diol.\n        *   Attack at C5 (S-configured) inverts it to R, giving the (4R,5R)-diol.\n    *   Since the starting material is achiral, the two enantiomeric products must be formed in equal amounts.\n    *   Therefore, the product of Reaction 2 is a **racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationships between these isomers:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers** of each other.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n### **4. Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral stationary phase cannot distinguish between enantiomers.

This means the oxygen adds to the same face of the double bond. Since the starting alkene is symmetrical and achiral, this reaction produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane and (4S,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening.** The subsequent treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) opens the epoxide ring. This is an *anti*-addition, meaning the incoming nucleophile (water) attacks from the side opposite to the epoxide oxygen.\n    *   The ring-opening of the (4R,5R)-epoxide results in (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The ring-opening of the (4S,5S)-epoxide also results in (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 1:** The resulting product, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, has two stereocenters but possesses an internal plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is a single, achiral **meso compound**.\n\n### Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of a *cis*-alkene, (Z)-oct-4-ene, with mCPBA is also a *syn*-addition. Because the starting material is a symmetrical *cis*-alkene, this reaction forms a single, achiral meso epoxide: (4R,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening.** The acid-catalyzed ring-opening of this meso-epoxide is an *anti*-addition. The nucleophilic attack by water can occur with equal probability at either of the two carbons of the epoxide.\n    *   Attack at one carbon produces (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon produces (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 2:** The products are a pair of enantiomers. Since they are formed in equal amounts, the result is a **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the product from Reaction 1 (the meso compound) with the products from Reaction 2 (the racemic mixture of two enantiomers). The final mixture therefore contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n*   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (meso compound)\n*   (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (enantiomer 1)\n*   (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (enantiomer 2)\n\nThe meso compound is a diastereomer of the two enantiomers.\n\n### Chromatographic Observation\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral HPLC column cannot distinguish between enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers will elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers, however, have different physical properties and can be separated by achiral chromatography. The meso compound will have a different retention time from the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Consequently, the chemist will observe **2 peaks**.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers will have different retention times and will appear as two separate peaks.\n    *   The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also have a distinct retention time and will be separated from them.\n    *   Consequently, the chemist will observe **3 peaks**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the standard HPLC will show 2 peaks, and the chiral HPLC will show 3 peaks.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** The starting material is (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a *trans*-alkene. Treatment with mCPBA results in a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom to the double bond. This stereospecific reaction converts the *trans*-alkene into a *trans*-epoxide. Because the attack can happen from either face of the alkene, a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides, (4R,5R)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane and (4S,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane, is formed.\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening:** The subsequent treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) opens the epoxide ring. This is an Sₙ2-type reaction where the water molecule attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite the oxygen atom, causing an inversion of stereochemistry at the site of attack.\n    *   Attack on the (4R,5R)-epoxide at either carbon results in the formation of (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack on the (4S,5S)-epoxide at either carbon results in the formation of (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    These two products, (4R,5S) and (4S,5R), are identical. This product has two chiral centers but also has a plane of symmetry, making it a single, achiral **meso compound**.\n\n### Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** The starting material is (Z)-oct-4-ene, a *cis*-alkene. The *syn*-addition of oxygen from mCPBA converts the *cis*-alkene into a *cis*-epoxide. This epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane, is a meso compound itself.\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening:** The acid-catalyzed hydrolysis opens the meso-epoxide. The water nucleophile can attack either of the two carbons of the protonated epoxide.\n    *   Attack at one carbon results in an inversion of configuration, leading to the (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol enantiomer.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon also causes an inversion, leading to the (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol enantiomer.\n    Since the starting epoxide is achiral, attacks on either side are equally probable, producing a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers. This is a **racemic mixture**.\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the product from Reaction 1 (the meso compound) with the product from Reaction 2 (the racemic mixture). The final mixture therefore contains three stereoisomers:\n*   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (meso)\n*   (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (enantiomer)\n*   (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (enantiomer)\n\nThe (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers are enantiomers of each other. The meso isomer is a diastereomer of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers.\n\n### Chromatographic Observation\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers (the meso compound and the enantiomeric pair) have different physical properties and will be separated, resulting in different retention times.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated.

The epoxidation reaction is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to both carbons of the double bond from the same face. For a trans-alkene, this results in a trans-epoxide. Since the mCPBA can attack from either the top or bottom face of the alkene with equal probability, a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides is formed: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening:** The epoxide mixture is then treated with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This is an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis that opens the epoxide ring. The water molecule acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite the epoxide oxygen (an *anti*-addition or backside attack).\n    *   When the (4R,5R)-epoxide is attacked by water at either C4 or C5, it results in the formation of (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Similarly, when the (4S,5S)-epoxide is attacked, the product is also (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   This product, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, has two chiral centers but possesses an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound.

The *syn*-addition of oxygen to a cis-alkene results in a cis-epoxide. This specific product, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane, is a meso compound because it has an internal plane of symmetry.\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening:** The meso-epoxide is then opened by aqueous acid. The backside attack by water can occur at either C4 or C5 with equal likelihood.\n    *   Attack at C4 (which is R) leads to inversion of stereochemistry at that carbon, producing (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at C5 (which is S) leads to inversion at that carbon, producing (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The two products, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are non-superimposable mirror images of each other; they are enantiomers. Since both are formed in equal amounts, Reaction 2 produces a racemic mixture.\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the product of Reaction 1 (the meso-diol) with the products of Reaction 2 (the racemic mixture of (R,R)- and (S,S)-diols). The final mixture therefore contains three stereoisomers:\n*   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (meso compound)\n*   (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (enantiomer)\n*   (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (enantiomer)\n\nThe meso compound is a diastereomer of the two enantiomers.\n\n### Chromatographic Observation\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   Standard HPLC columns use an achiral stationary phase and separate compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated.

This is a *cis*-alkene, which is also symmetrical.\n*   **Reagents and Transformation:** The reaction sequence is the same as in Reaction 1, resulting in a net *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The stereochemical rule for an *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene is that it produces a *racemic mixture* of enantiomers.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The products are **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. These two molecules are enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images) and are produced in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture therefore contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the stereochemical relationships between these three compounds:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their bulk physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties (e.g., polarity, boiling point, solubility) in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by a standard, achiral HPLC column. The enantiomeric pair, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, will elute at the same time and appear as a **single peak**.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and are, in principle, separable by standard chromatography. The meso-diol is a diastereomer of the other two compounds and will have a different retention time, appearing as a **separate peak**.\n    *   **Conclusion for standard HPLC:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, and one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair).\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment inside the column.\n    *   This chiral environment allows for the separation of **enantiomers**. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, leading to different retention times. They will be resolved into **two distinct peaks**.\n    *   The **meso-diol**, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated and will appear as its own peak.\n    *   **Conclusion for chiral HPLC:** The chromatogram will resolve all three stereoisomers. There will be one peak for the meso-diol, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer, for a total of **3 peaks**.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Standard HPLC: 2 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reagent catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The nucleophile (water) attacks the protonated epoxide in an *anti*-fashion (from the side opposite the epoxide C-O bond).\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step sequence (syn-epoxidation followed by anti-opening) results in the net *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene. The two hydroxyl (-OH) groups are added across the double bond, and they are anti to each other.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** There is a well-known stereochemical rule for addition reactions: **T**rans-**A**lkene + **A**nti-addition → **M**eso compound.\n    *   Let's verify this: The *trans*-alkene reacts via *syn*-epoxidation to form a racemic mixture of the *trans*-epoxide ((4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n    *   The subsequent *anti*-attack of water on either enantiomer of the epoxide leads to the same single product: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. This product has two chiral centers but possesses a center of inversion, making it a meso compound (an achiral molecule).\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** One single compound, the meso-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene.

It is also an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:** The same as in Reaction 1 (mCPBA followed by H₃O⁺).\n*   **Overall Transformation:** This is also an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The stereochemical rule for this case is: **C**is-**A**lkene + **A**nti-addition → **R**acemic mixture.\n    *   Let's verify this: The *cis*-alkene reacts via *syn*-epoxidation to form the *meso*-epoxide (cis-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n    *   The subsequent *anti*-attack of water on this achiral meso-epoxide can occur at either of the two equivalent carbons (C4 or C5). Attack at one carbon produces the (4R,5R)-diol, and attack at the other produces the (4S,5S)-diol.\n    *   Since the starting materials and reagents are all achiral, the chiral products must be formed in equal amounts.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationships between these isomers:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   The meso-(4R,5S) diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) diol and the (4S,5S) diol (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties. The meso diol will have a different polarity than the enantiomeric pair and will be separated from them. It will elute as a distinct peak.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the unresolved racemic pair.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The chiral column will resolve the racemic mixture of (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols into **two separate peaks**.\n    *   The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated and will appear as its own **single peak**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The chiral HPLC will separate all three stereoisomers, resulting in **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe analysis predicts 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions and the resulting chromatograms.\n\n### Reaction Analysis\n\n**Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of an alkene with a peroxyacid like mCPBA is a stereospecific *syn*-addition, meaning the stereochemistry of the starting alkene is preserved in the epoxide product. (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene. Epoxidation of a *trans*-alkene results in a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is achiral, the epoxidation occurs from either face of the double bond at equal rates, producing a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** The treatment of an epoxide with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) opens the ring to form a 1,2-diol (a glycol). This ring-opening is an Sₙ2-like process that occurs with *anti*-addition, meaning the incoming nucleophile (water) attacks from the side opposite to the epoxide oxygen.\n    *   The *anti*-addition to the (4R,5R)-epoxide enantiomer yields (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The *anti*-addition to the (4S,5S)-epoxide enantiomer yields (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 1.** The two products, (4R,5S)- and (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol, are actually the same achiral molecule due to a center of symmetry. This type of achiral diastereomer is called a **meso compound**. Therefore, Reaction 1 produces a single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The *syn*-addition of the epoxide to the *cis*-alkene, (Z)-oct-4-ene, produces the *cis*-epoxide. This product, cis-4,5-epoxyoctane, has a plane of symmetry and is therefore an achiral meso compound.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** The *anti*-addition of water to the achiral *meso*-epoxide can occur by attacking either of the two epoxide carbons. These two carbons are enantiotopic.\n    *   Attack at one carbon produces (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon produces (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 2.** Since attack at either carbon is equally probable, the reaction produces a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers. This is known as a **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe final mixture, which is a combination of the products from both reactions, contains three stereoisomers:\n*   **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n*   **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n*   **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is as follows:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   The meso isomer is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\nThe combined product mixture is then analyzed by two types of High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated by standard HPLC. Therefore, the meso-diol will be separated from the other two isomers.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and thus cannot be separated. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Observation:** The chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard HPLC chromatogram.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment.\n    *   This chiral environment allows for the separation of enantiomers because they form transient diastereomeric complexes with the stationary phase, leading to different retention times.\n    *   Chiral HPLC can also separate diastereomers.\n    *   Therefore, all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved.\n    *   **Observation:** The chemist will observe **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis predicts 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe analysis of the reaction products and their behavior in different chromatographic systems is as follows:\n\n### Reaction Analysis\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** The treatment of (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene) with mCPBA results in a syn-epoxidation, forming a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. The subsequent acid-catalyzed ring-opening of this epoxide by water is an anti-addition. This sequence of syn-epoxidation followed by anti-ring-opening on a trans-alkene results in the formation of a single meso compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n*   **Reaction 2:** The treatment of (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene) with mCPBA also proceeds via syn-epoxidation, yielding the meso epoxide, (Z)-4,5-epoxyoctane. The subsequent acid-catalyzed anti-ring-opening of this meso epoxide produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,4R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Product Mixture\n\nThe combined product mixture from both reactions contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (a meso compound from Reaction 1)\n2.  (4R,4R)-octane-4,5-diol (an enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (an enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is that the meso compound is a diastereomer to the two enantiomers. The (4R,4R) and (4S,5S) isomers are an enantiomeric pair.\n\n### Chromatographic Separation\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. Enantiomers, however, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will therefore elute together, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   The meso-diol and the enantiomeric pair of diols are diastereomers and will be separated.\n    *   The two enantiomers will co-elute.\n    *   Consequently, the chromatogram will show **two peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This method utilizes a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation. It can also separate diastereomers.\n    *   The meso compound will produce one peak.\n    *   The two enantiomers, (4R,4R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, will be resolved from each other, each producing a separate peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will display a total of **three peaks**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The treatment of an alkene with mCPBA results in a syn-addition of an oxygen atom to the double bond, forming an epoxide. The epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene) is stereospecific and produces a racemic mixture of the trans-epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** The opening of an epoxide ring with aqueous acid is an anti-addition. Water attacks the protonated epoxide from the side opposite the oxygen bridge.\n    *   The hydrolysis of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane results in (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The hydrolysis of (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane also results in (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    These two products are the same meso compound, which has a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the sole product of Reaction 1 is the meso-diol.\n\n### Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The epoxidation of (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene) is also a stereospecific syn-addition. This reaction forms the cis-epoxide, (Z)-4,5-epoxyoctane, which is a meso compound because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** The subsequent anti-addition of water to the meso-epoxide opens the ring.\n    *   Attack at one carbon of the epoxide results in (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon results in (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    Since the starting material is achiral and the attacks are equally probable, a racemic mixture of the two enantiomers, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, is formed.\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions, resulting in a mixture containing three stereoisomers:\n*   **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the meso compound from Reaction 1)\n*   **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n*   **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is that the meso compound is a diastereomer to both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers.\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated.

This is a trans-alkene. It is symmetrical, with a propyl group on each side of the double bond.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA:** This reagent performs epoxidation. The addition of the oxygen atom is a **syn-addition**, meaning it adds to the same face of the double bond. For a trans-alkene, syn-addition results in a racemic mixture of trans-epoxides. In this case, (E)-oct-4-ene will form a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This causes the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The nucleophile (water) attacks one of the epoxide carbons in an Sₙ2 fashion, leading to **anti-addition** of the two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the original double bond.\n*   **Overall Stereochemistry of Reaction 1:** The two-step sequence (epoxidation followed by acid hydrolysis) is equivalent to an **anti-dihydroxylation** of the alkene.\n    *   The rule for stereospecific reactions on symmetrical alkenes is: **(E)-alkene + anti-addition → meso compound.**\n    *   Therefore, the product of Reaction 1 is a single, achiral compound: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. This compound has two chiral centers (C4 and C5) but is achiral due to a center of inversion. Let's call this **Product M**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene, also symmetrical.\n*   **Reagents:** The same reagents are used, so the overall reaction is also an **anti-dihydroxylation**.\n*   **Overall Stereochemistry of Reaction 2:**\n    *   The rule for stereospecific reactions on symmetrical alkenes is: **(Z)-alkene + anti-addition → racemic mixture.**\n    *   Therefore, the product of Reaction 2 is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. Let's call these **Product R** and **Product S**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **Product M:** meso-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **Product R:** (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **Product S:** (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationships between these isomers:\n*   **Product R** and **Product S** are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   **Product M** is a **diastereomer** of both Product R and Product S (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n#### **Standard (Achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC**\n*   An achiral HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** (like R and S) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.

This reaction is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond. Starting with (E)-oct-4-ene (a *trans*-alkene), this results in a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting material is symmetrical, the product is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening.** The epoxide is then treated with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This is a ring-opening reaction where water acts as a nucleophile. The mechanism proceeds via *anti*-addition, meaning the water attacks from the side opposite to the epoxide oxygen.\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome.** The overall two-step process is equivalent to an *anti*-dihydroxylation of the starting alkene. An *anti*-dihydroxylation of a *trans*-alkene results in a single *meso* compound. In this case, the product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, which has a plane of symmetry and is achiral.\n\n*   **Product of Reaction 1: One meso diol.**\n\n### Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The *syn*-addition of mCPBA to (Z)-oct-4-ene (a *cis*-alkene) produces a *cis*-epoxide. Because the starting alkene is symmetrical, the resulting *cis*-4,5-epoxyoctane is a *meso* compound (it has an internal plane of symmetry).\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening.** The *meso*-epoxide then undergoes *anti*-addition of water.\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome.** An *anti*-dihydroxylation of a *cis*-alkene produces a racemic mixture of enantiomers. The attack of water on the *meso*-epoxide results in a 50:50 mixture of (4R,4R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n*   **Product of Reaction 2: A racemic mixture of two enantiomeric diols.**\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the single *meso* diol from Reaction 1 with the racemic mixture of two enantiomers from Reaction 2. The final mixture therefore contains three distinct chemical compounds (stereoisomers):\n*   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (*meso* compound)\n*   (4R,4R)-octane-4,5-diol (enantiomer A)\n*   (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (enantiomer B)\n\nThe *meso* compound is a diastereomer of both enantiomer A and enantiomer B.\n\n### Chromatographic Observation\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   Standard HPLC columns use an achiral stationary phase. Such columns can separate compounds with different physical properties, like diastereomers.\n    *   However, enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated. They will elute at the same time.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **two peaks**:\n        *   **Peak 1:** The *meso*-diol.\n        *   **Peak 2:** The co-eluting enantiomers (racemic mixture).\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC columns use a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment.\n    *   This allows the column to distinguish between enantiomers, as they will interact differently with the stationary phase, leading to different retention times.\n    *   A chiral column can also separate diastereomers.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will resolve all three stereoisomers in the mixture, showing **three peaks**:\n        *   **Peak 1:** The *meso*-diol.\n        *   **Peak 2:** One enantiomer (e.g., (4R,4R)-diol).\n        *   **Peak 3:** The other enantiomer (e.g., (4S,5S)-diol).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** The core of the problem is to determine the number and types of stereoisomers produced from two separate reactions and then figure out how these isomers will behave when analyzed by two different types of HPLC (achiral and chiral).\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. The \"(E)\" designation means it's a trans-alkene. It's symmetric, so it's an achiral molecule.\n    *   **Reagents:**\n        1.  mCPBA: This reagent performs epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n        2.  Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺): This reagent catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. This ring-opening is an *anti*-addition (the incoming nucleophile, water, attacks from the side opposite the protonated epoxide oxygen).\n    *   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step sequence (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) results in an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n    *   **Stereochemical Outcome:** There's a well-known rule for stereospecific reactions:\n        *   `trans-alkene` + `anti-addition` -> `meso product`\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The product is a single compound, meso-octane-4,5-diol. Let's call this compound **M**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. The \"(Z)\" designation means it's a cis-alkene. It's also symmetric and achiral.\n    *   **Reagents:** Same as Reaction 1 (mCPBA, then H₃O⁺).\n    *   **Overall Transformation:** This is also an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   **Stereochemical Outcome:** We apply the other part of the rule:\n        *   `cis-alkene` + `anti-addition` -> `racemic mixture` (a 50:50 mixture of two enantiomers).\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The products are a pair of enantiomers: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Let's call them **E1** and **E2**.\n\n4.  **Combine the Products:** The chemist mixes the results of both reactions. The final mixture contains:\n    *   **M** (meso-octane-4,5-diol) from Reaction 1.\n    *   **E1** and **E2** (the enantiomeric pair) from Reaction 2.\n    *   Total distinct molecules in the flask: 3.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Chromatography:**\n    *   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:**\n        *   **Principle:** An achiral column separates compounds based on properties like polarity, size, etc. It *cannot* distinguish between enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. However, it *can* separate diastereomers, which have different physical properties.\n        *   **Application:**\n            *   **E1** and **E2** are enantiomers. They will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n            *   **M** is a diastereomer of both **E1** and **E2**. It has different physical properties and will be separated from them, resulting in a distinct peak.\n        *   **Result:** Peak 1 (for **M**) + Peak 2 (for **E1** + **E2**) = **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Chiral HPLC:**\n        *   **Principle:** A chiral column has a chiral stationary phase. This chiral environment interacts differently with each enantiomer of a pair, allowing them to be separated. It will also separate diastereomers.\n        *   **Application:**\n            *   **E1** and **E2** are enantiomers. The chiral column will resolve them into two separate peaks.\n            *   **M** is a diastereomer of **E1** and **E2**, and it will also have its own unique retention time, resulting in a third peak. (Note: Since **M** is achiral, it cannot be resolved further, it's just one peak).\n        *   **Result:** Peak 1 (for **M**) + Peak 2 (for **E1**) + Peak 3 (for **E2**) = **3 peaks**.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion & Matching:**\n    *   Standard HPLC: 2 peaks\n    *   Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks\n    *   This matches option D.\n\n7.  **Construct the Python Code:** The code will not execute a chemical simulation but will use `print` statements to lay out the logical steps derived above, leading to the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Helper function to print the thinking process\ndef explain_reasoning():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the step-by-step reasoning to solve the stereochemistry problem.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Thinking Process:\")\n    print(\"1.

This overall sequence results in the **anti-dihydroxylation** of the starting alkene.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Addition:** The key is to correctly determine the stereochemistry of the products resulting from an *anti*-addition to both a *cis* ((Z)) and a *trans* ((E)) alkene.\n*   **Symmetry of Molecules:** Both the starting alkenes (oct-4-ene) and the final products (octane-4,5-diol) are symmetrically substituted (a propyl group on each side of the central functional group). This symmetry is crucial for determining whether meso compounds are possible.\n*   **Product Identification:** We need to identify all unique stereoisomers formed in the two reactions.\n*   **Chromatography Principles:** It's essential to understand the difference between standard (achiral) and chiral HPLC.\n    *   **Standard HPLC** separates compounds based on differences in physical properties (like polarity). It can separate diastereomers, but it cannot separate enantiomers. Enantiomers will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Chiral HPLC** uses a chiral stationary phase and can separate enantiomers, as well as diastereomers.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene.\n*   **Reaction:** Anti-dihydroxylation (mCPBA, then H3O+).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The rule for a symmetrically substituted alkene is: **trans-alkene + anti-addition → meso compound**.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The reaction produces a single product, the meso stereoisomer of octane-4,5-diol. This compound is achiral and has the configuration (4R, 5S), which is identical to (4S, 5R). Let's call this compound **Meso-Diol**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene.\n*   **Reaction:** Anti-dihydroxylation (mCPBA, then H3O+).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The rule for a symmetrically substituted alkene is: **cis-alkene + anti-addition → racemic mixture**.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The reaction produces a 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers: (4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Let's call these enantiomers **(R,R)-Diol** and **(S,S)-Diol**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\n*   The chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n    1.  **Meso-Diol** (from Reaction 1)\n    2.  **(R,R)-Diol** (from Reaction 2)\n    3.  **(S,S)-Diol** (from Reaction 2)\n*   **Stereochemical Relationships:**\n    *   **(R,R)-Diol** and **(S,S)-Diol** are a pair of **enantiomers**.\n    *   **Meso-Diol** is a **diastereomer** of both **(R,R)-Diol** and **(S,S)-Diol**.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the Chromatogram on the Standard (Achiral) HPLC Column**\n\n*   An achiral HPLC column separates diastereomers but not enantiomers.\n*   The **Meso-Diol** is a diastereomer of the other two compounds, so it will have a unique retention time and produce one peak.\n*   The enantiomers, **(R,R)-Diol** and **(S,S)-Diol**, are inseparable on an achiral column and will co-elute, producing a second single peak.\n*   **Total Peaks on Standard HPLC: 2**\n\n**Step 5: Predict the Chromatogram on the Chiral HPLC Column**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column can separate both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   The three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will all interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n*   The **Meso-Diol** will produce one peak.\n*   The **(R,R)-Diol** will produce a second, separate peak.\n*   The **(S,S)-Diol** will produce a third, separate peak.\n*   **Total Peaks on Chiral HPLC: 3**\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard HPLC chromatogram and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. The molecule is symmetric.\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process:\n    1.  Treatment with mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid) results in epoxidation. This is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    2.  Treatment with aqueous acid (H3O+) causes acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. This occurs via a backside attack by a water molecule, which is an *anti*-addition.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The combination of these two steps (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene, meaning two hydroxyl (-OH) groups are added to the opposite faces of the original double bond.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** There is a well-established rule for the stereochemistry of anti-additions to alkenes: a *trans*-alkene undergoing an *anti*-addition results in a *meso* product (if the substituents on the alkene are identical, which they are here - both are propyl groups). A useful mnemonic for this is **TAM: Trans-Anti-Meso**.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The product is meso-octane-4,5-diol. A meso compound is achiral and has stereocenters, typically with an (R,S) or (S,R) configuration that are the same molecule due to internal symmetry.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. This molecule is also symmetric.\n*   **Reagents:** The reagents are the same as in Reaction 1, so the overall transformation is also *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The stereochemical rule for anti-addition to a *cis*-alkene is that it produces a *racemic mixture* of enantiomers. A useful mnemonic for this is **CAR: Cis-Anti-Racemic**.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The product is a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other (enantiomers).\n\n**Step 3: Characterize the Final Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct chemical species (stereoisomers):\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is important:\n*   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the Chromatogram for Standard (Achiral) HPLC**\n\n*   Standard HPLC columns are achiral. They separate compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity, size, and boiling point.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties (in an achiral environment) and therefore cannot be separated by an achiral column. They will elute at the same time and appear as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated by an achiral column. They will elute at different times and appear as separate peaks.\n*   In our mixture, the enantiomeric pair ((4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol) will produce **one peak**. The meso-diol is a diastereomer to them and will produce a **second peak**.\n*   **Conclusion for standard HPLC: 2 peaks.**\n\n**Step 5: Predict the Chromatogram for Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC columns have a chiral stationary phase. This allows the column to interact differently with each enantiomer of a chiral compound.\n*   Chiral HPLC can separate **both diastereomers and enantiomers**.\n*   Each of the three stereoisomers in the mixture will have a unique interaction with the chiral stationary phase and will elute at a different time.\n*   Therefore, (4R,5R)-diol will be one peak, (4S,5S)-diol will be a second peak, and meso-octane-4,5-diol will be a third peak.\n*   **Conclusion for chiral HPLC: 3 peaks.**\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe analysis shows that the combined product mixture will exhibit **2 peaks** on a standard (achiral) HPLC column and **3 peaks** on a chiral HPLC column. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reactions**\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n    *   **Step 1 (Epoxidation):** The reaction of a trans-alkene like (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid) is a stereospecific *syn*-addition, which forms a trans-epoxide. Because the alkene is symmetrical, the mCPBA can attack from either face of the double bond, resulting in a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides, ((4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n    *   **Step 2 (Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening):** The subsequent treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) opens the epoxide ring via an *anti*-addition mechanism. The opening of this racemic mixture of trans-epoxides results in the formation of a single, achiral meso compound: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n    *   **Step 1 (Epoxidation):** The reaction of a cis-alkene like (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA is also a *syn*-addition. This stereospecific reaction produces a single, achiral meso-epoxide (cis-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n    *   **Step 2 (Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening):** The acid-catalyzed *anti*-addition of water to this meso-epoxide opens the ring. Because the nucleophilic attack can occur with equal probability at either of the two epoxide carbons, this step produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Composition of the Final Product Mixture**\n\nAfter combining the products of both reactions, the final mixture contains three distinct compounds:\n1.  **Meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1).\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2).\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2).\n\nThe (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are enantiomers of each other. The meso-diol is a diastereomer of the other two compounds.\n\n### **Chromatographic Analysis**\n\nThe combined product mixture is analyzed using two different HPLC techniques.\n\n*   **Standard (Achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. Therefore, the meso-diol will be separated from the other two compounds.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated by a standard HPLC column. Consequently, the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP) to create a chiral environment inside the column.\n    *   This chiral environment allows for the separation of enantiomers because they form transient diastereomeric complexes with the CSP that have different stabilities. Therefore, the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n    *   The meso-compound, being a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, will also have a different retention time and will elute as a distinct, third peak.\n    *   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions and the subsequent chromatographic separation.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reactions**\n\nThe overall reaction sequence involves the epoxidation of an alkene with mCPBA, followed by acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide with water. This two-step process results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the starting alkene, meaning the two hydroxyl (-OH) groups are added to opposite faces of the original double bond. The stereochemical outcome depends on the stereochemistry of the starting alkene.\n\n**Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene)**\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** The reaction of (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to both carbons of the double bond from the same face. Since the starting alkene is achiral, the attack can occur from the top or bottom face with equal probability, producing a racemic mixture of trans-epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Acid-catalyzed Hydrolysis:** The subsequent ring-opening by water is an *anti*-attack.\n    *   Attack on the (4R,5R)-epoxide leads to the formation of (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack on the (4S,5S)-epoxide also leads to the formation of (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    This product has two stereocenters but possesses a plane of symmetry, making it a **meso compound**.\n\nA general rule for stereochemistry is that an *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene yields a meso product. Therefore, Reaction 1 produces a single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene)**\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** The *syn*-addition of mCPBA to the *cis*-alkene produces a single *cis*-epoxide ((4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane), which is a meso compound.\n2.  **Acid-catalyzed Hydrolysis:** The *anti*-attack of water on this meso-epoxide opens the ring.\n    *   Attack at one carbon center results in the (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol enantiomer.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon center results in the (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol enantiomer.\n    Since both attacks are equally likely, the reaction produces a **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\nA general rule for stereochemistry is that an *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene yields a racemic mixture. Therefore, Reaction 2 produces two products that are enantiomers of each other.\n\n### **Analysis of the Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe meso compound is a diastereomer of the two enantiomers.\n\n### **Chromatographic Analysis**\n\n**1. Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n*   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   Diastereomers (like the meso compound and the enantiomers) have different physical properties and will be separated, eluting at different times.\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated. They will co-elute, appearing as a single peak.\n*   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **two peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair.\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC:**\n*   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n*   It can separate all three stereoisomers in the mixture because the meso compound is a diastereomer of the other two, and the chiral column will resolve the two enantiomers from each other.\n*   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **three distinct peaks**: one for the meso compound, one for the (4R,5R) enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S) enantiomer.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nTo determine the final composition of the product mixture, we must analyze the stereochemical outcome of each reaction. The overall reaction in both cases is an anti-dihydroxylation, which proceeds via a two-step mechanism: 1) syn-epoxidation with mCPBA, and 2) anti-addition of water via acid-catalyzed ring-opening. The stereochemistry of the final diol product depends on the stereochemistry of the starting alkene.\n\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\n*   **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene)**\n    The rule for anti-dihydroxylation of a symmetrical trans-alkene is that it yields a meso compound.\n    *   **Step 1 (Epoxidation):** (E)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA in a syn-addition to form a racemic mixture of the trans-epoxides, (4R,5S)-epoxyoctane and (4S,5R)-epoxyoctane.\n    *   **Step 2 (Hydrolysis):** The acid-catalyzed ring-opening of this racemic epoxide mixture proceeds via backside attack (anti-addition) of water. This specific sequence (anti-addition on a trans-alkene) results in the formation of a single, achiral meso compound: **meso-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene)**\n    The rule for anti-dihydroxylation of a symmetrical cis-alkene is that it yields a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   **Step 1 (Epoxidation):** (Z)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA in a syn-addition to form the achiral meso-epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   **Step 2 (Hydrolysis):** The acid-catalyzed ring-opening involves a backside attack by water. This sequence (anti-addition on a cis-alkene) produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### Composition of the Final Mixture\n\nAfter combining the products of both reactions, the final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomeric compounds:\n1.  **meso-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe meso-compound is a diastereomer to each of the two enantiomers. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) compounds are an enantiomeric pair.\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\nThe chemist analyzes this three-component mixture using two different HPLC techniques.\n\n*   **Standard (Achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    This technique separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. The meso-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have a different retention time.\n    *   Consequently, the standard HPLC chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso-compound and one for the racemic pair.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    This technique uses a chiral stationary phase to differentiate between enantiomers.\n    *   The chiral column can resolve the enantiomeric pair, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, into two separate peaks.\n    *   The meso-compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated and appear as a distinct peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **3 peaks**: one for the meso-compound, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis predicts 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the outcome of the reactions and the subsequent HPLC analysis.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. The molecule is symmetrical about the double bond, with a propyl group (CH3CH2CH2-) and a hydrogen atom attached to each carbon of the double bond.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction on the alkene. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to both carbons of the double bond from the same face. For a trans-alkene, this results in a trans-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is achiral, the attack of mCPBA can occur from the top face or the bottom face with equal probability, producing a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H3O+):** This reagent causes the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The mechanism involves the protonation of the epoxide oxygen, followed by a backside (SN2-type) attack by a water molecule on one of the carbons of the epoxide. This backside attack results in an *anti*-dihydroxylation relative to the original alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The overall reaction is an *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene. There is a well-established stereochemical rule: the *anti*-addition to a **trans-alkene** (like (E)-oct-4-ene) results in a **meso** compound (if the alkene is symmetric).\n    *   The product of Reaction 1 is the meso compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. This is a single, achiral compound despite having two stereocenters.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene, also symmetrical.\n*   **Reagents:** The same as in Reaction 1 (mCPBA, followed by H3O+).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The overall reaction is again an *anti*-dihydroxylation. The stereochemical rule for this case is: the *anti*-addition to a **cis-alkene** (like (Z)-oct-4-ene) results in a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers (if the alkene is symmetric).\n    *   The products of Reaction 2 are (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other (enantiomers) and are formed in equal amounts.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the meso compound, let's call it **M**)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (one enantiomer from the racemic pair, let's call it **E1**)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the other enantiomer, let's call it **E2**)\n\nLet's examine the relationship between these isomers:\n*   **E1** and **E2** are enantiomers.\n*   **M** is a diastereomer of **E1**.\n*   **M** is also a diastereomer of **E2**.\n\n### Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms\n\n**1. Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n*   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** (like E1 and E2) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore **cannot be separated**. They will elute at the same time and appear as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** (like M and E1, or M and E2) have different physical properties and **can be separated**.\n*   Therefore, the chromatogram will show two peaks:\n    *   **Peak 1:** The meso compound (M).\n    *   **Peak 2:** The co-eluting enantiomers (E1 + E2).\n*   **Result: 2 peaks.**\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC:**\n*   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment.\n*   In a chiral environment, enantiomers interact differently with the stationary phase and thus **can be separated**.\n*   Since all three compounds in the mixture (M, E1, and E2) are stereoisomers, they will all interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n    *   The meso compound (M) will have its own unique retention time.\n    *   The enantiomer E1 will have a different retention time.\n    *   The enantiomer E2 will have a retention time different from both M and E1.\n*   Therefore, the chromatogram will show three distinct peaks, one for each stereoisomer.\n*   **Result: 3 peaks.**\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Standard (achiral) HPLC will show **2 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **3 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\nLet me re-evaluate my step-by-step thinking.\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene (trans) + anti-addition -> meso product. Correct. One compound.\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene (cis) + anti-addition -> racemic product. Correct. Two enantiomers.\nMixture: One meso compound + one racemic pair (two enantiomers). Total of three stereoisomers. Correct.\nStandard HPLC: Separates diastereomers, not enantiomers. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. The two enantiomers are not separated from each other. So, one peak for the meso compound and one peak for the racemic pair. Total = 2 peaks. Correct.\nChiral HPLC: Separates all stereoisomers, including enantiomers. The three different stereoisomers (meso, R,R, and S,S) will all be resolved. Total = 3 peaks. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC. This matches option C.\n\nLet's check the options again.\nA) 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\nB) 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC\nC) 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC\nD) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\n\nMy conclusion matches C. My previous text saying \"This corresponds to option B\" was a typo.\n\nFinal check of the reasoning.\n- Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA -> (rac)-trans-epoxide. Then H3O+ opens the epoxide via anti-attack. Trans-epoxide + anti-attack gives the meso-diol. Correct.\n- Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA -> meso-cis-epoxide. Then H3O+ opens the epoxide via anti-attack. Cis-epoxide + anti-attack gives the racemic-diol. Correct.\n- Mixture: (meso-diol) + (racemic-diol).\n- Standard HPLC of (meso-diol) + (racemic-diol): 2 peaks. Correct.\n- Chiral HPLC of (meso-diol) + (racemic-diol): 3 peaks. Correct.\n\nThe reasoning is solid. The answer is 2 peaks (standard) and 3 peaks (chiral).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is achiral.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs epoxidation on the alkene. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reagent performs acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. This is an *anti*-addition, meaning the nucleophile (H₂O) attacks from the side opposite to the epoxide oxygen, resulting in an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** A general rule in stereochemistry is that an *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a *meso* compound.\n    *   **Detailed Path:**\n        1.  The epoxidation of the achiral (E)-alkene with the achiral mCPBA can occur from either face of the double bond with equal probability. This produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric *trans*-epoxides: (4R,5R)-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-epoxyoctane.\n        2.  The acid-catalyzed opening of an epoxide involves a backside attack by water.\n        3.  When (4R,5R)-epoxyoctane is opened by water, the attack at C4 inverts its configuration to S, yielding (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. Attack at C5 would yield (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These are the same molecule.\n        4.  When (4S,5S)-epoxyoctane is opened, it also yields (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        5.  The molecule (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol has a center of inversion (in its anti-periplanar conformation) and is therefore a *meso* compound. It is achiral.\n\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single compound, **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** The same as in Reaction 1 (mCPBA, then H₃O⁺), leading to an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** A general rule is that an *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene results in a *racemic mixture* of enantiomers.\n    *   **Detailed Path:**\n        1.  Epoxidation of the (Z)-alkene is a *syn*-addition, which produces a *cis*-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is symmetrical, the resulting epoxide, (4R,5S)-epoxyoctane, is a *meso* compound (it has a plane of symmetry).\n        2.  The acid-catalyzed opening of this meso-epoxide involves a backside attack by water.\n        3.  Attack at C4 (which is R) inverts the configuration to S, yielding **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        4.  Attack at C5 (which is S) inverts the configuration to R, yielding **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        5.  These two products, (4S,5S)- and (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol, are enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images). Since the starting materials and reagents are all achiral, the two enantiomers must be formed in equal amounts.\n\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is:\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n*   The (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers** of each other.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\nThe mixture of these three compounds is analyzed by two types of HPLC.\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   This type of chromatography separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will interact differently with the stationary and mobile phases. Therefore, they can be separated. The meso-diol will be separated from the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will not be separated by an achiral column. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols will elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The achiral HPLC will show **two peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This type of chromatography uses a chiral stationary phase, which allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   The chiral stationary phase interacts differently with each of the three stereoisomers.\n    *   It will separate the meso-diol from the other two (as they are diastereomers).\n    *   It will also separate the two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, from each other.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The chiral HPLC will resolve all three stereoisomers, resulting in **three distinct peaks**.\n\n### **Final Answer Summary**\n\n*   **Standard HPLC:** 2 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nThis is an excellent problem that combines stereospecific reactions with the principles of chromatography. Let's break down the process step-by-step.\n\n### **Step-by-step Reasoning**\n\n**1. Analyze Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene. It is also symmetrically substituted.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The two-step process of epoxidation with mCPBA followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis (H₃O⁺) results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene. This means two -OH groups are added across the double bond, one from the top face and one from the bottom face.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** There is a fundamental rule for such additions: the *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene yields a *meso* compound (assuming the alkene is symmetric, which it is).\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The reaction produces a single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. This compound is achiral because it has a plane of symmetry, even though it contains two chiral centers (4R, 5S).\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene, also symmetrically substituted.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction is the same: *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The corresponding rule for a *cis*-alkene is that *anti*-addition yields a *racemic mixture* (a 1:1 mixture of enantiomers).\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The reaction produces a racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other (enantiomers).\n\n**3. Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationships between these are:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols.\n\n**4.

The meso-diol will produce a **second, separate peak**.\n    *   **Result:** 2 peaks will be observed.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   The enantiomers ((4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol) will interact differently with the chiral column and will be resolved into **two separate peaks**.\n    *   The meso-diol is a diastereomer of the other two and will also have a unique interaction with the chiral column, eluting as a **third distinct peak**.\n    *   **Result:** 3 peaks will be observed.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe combined product mixture will show **2 peaks** on a standard HPLC column and **3 peaks** on a chiral HPLC column.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the stereochemical outcome of Reaction 1.**\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a trans-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process: 1. mCPBA, 2. aqueous acid (H3O+). This sequence achieves anti-dihydroxylation of the alkene, meaning two hydroxyl (-OH) groups are added across the double bond, one from the top face and one from the bottom face (anti-addition).\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-addition of two identical groups to a trans-alkene results in the formation of a meso compound. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** Therefore, the reaction of (E)-oct-4-ene yields a single product: meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the stereochemical outcome of Reaction 2.**\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a cis-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is the same anti-dihydroxylation sequence (mCPBA, then H3O+).\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-addition of two identical groups to a cis-alkene results in the formation of a racemic mixture of enantiomers. A racemic mixture contains equal amounts of two molecules that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** Therefore, the reaction of (Z)-oct-4-ene yields a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 3: Characterize the combined product mixture.**\n*   The chemist combines the product from Reaction 1 (the meso-diol) and the product from Reaction 2 (the racemic pair of (R,R)- and (S,S)-diols).\n*   The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n    1.  meso-octane-4,5-diol\n    2.  (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n    3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n*   The relationship between these isomers is important:\n    *   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are enantiomers.\n    *   The meso-diol is a diastereomer of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the outcome of the standard (achiral) HPLC analysis.**\n*   A standard HPLC column has an achiral stationary phase. This type of chromatography separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity and size.\n*   **Enantiomers**, like the (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diols, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated on a standard HPLC column and will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers**, like the meso-diol and the enantiomeric pair, have different physical properties. They will interact differently with the stationary phase and will be separated into distinct peaks.\n*   **Conclusion for Standard HPLC:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso-diol and one for the co-eluting racemic pair.\n\n**Step 5: Predict the outcome of the chiral HPLC analysis.**\n*   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase. This creates a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n*   The chiral stationary phase will interact differently with the (4R,5R)-diol and its mirror image, the (4S,5S)-diol, causing them to have different retention times. Thus, they will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n*   The meso-diol, being a diastereomer of the other two compounds, will also have a unique interaction with the chiral stationary phase and will elute as a separate peak.\n*   **Conclusion for Chiral HPLC:** The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**: one for the meso-diol, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n*   Standard (achiral) HPLC: 2 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions and the resulting chromatograms.\n\n### Reaction Analysis\n\n*   **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n    1.  **Epoxidation:** (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene) is treated with mCPBA. This is a syn-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond. This reaction is stereospecific, and the trans configuration of the starting material is maintained in the product. This results in the formation of a trans-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is achiral, the product is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening:** The epoxide ring is then opened by an aqueous acid. This is an anti-addition, where the water molecule attacks from the opposite side of the epoxide oxygen. The attack on either the (4R,5R) or (4S,5S) enantiomer results in the formation of the same single, achiral meso compound: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. This compound has two stereocenters but is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n    1.  **Epoxidation:** (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene) reacts with mCPBA. The syn-addition of oxygen results in a cis-epoxide. Because the starting alkene is symmetrical, this cis-epoxide is a meso compound (meso-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n    2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening:** The subsequent anti-addition of water opens the meso-epoxide. This process leads to the formation of a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Product Mixture\nThe final mixture that is analyzed contains the products from both reactions:\n1.  **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (a meso compound from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (an enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (an enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n\nThese three molecules are stereoisomers. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are enantiomers of each other.

Its reaction with mCPBA is a syn-addition, which results in a trans-epoxide. Because the starting alkene is symmetric, the product is a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Acid-catalyzed ring-opening:** The subsequent treatment with aqueous acid opens the epoxide ring. This is an anti-addition, meaning the water molecule attacks from the side opposite the epoxide oxygen. This reaction proceeds with an inversion of stereochemistry at the carbon atom that is attacked.\n    *   The ring-opening of the (4R,5R)-epoxide results in (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The ring-opening of the (4S,5S)-epoxide also results in (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (which is identical to (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol).\n3.  **Product of Reaction 1:** The final product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, which is a single, achiral meso compound. This is because the anti-dihydroxylation of a symmetric trans-alkene yields a meso compound.\n\n### Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a cis-alkene. Its syn-addition reaction with mCPBA produces a cis-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is symmetric, the resulting cis-4,5-epoxyoctane is a meso compound.\n2.  **Acid-catalyzed ring-opening:** The acid-catalyzed ring-opening of this meso-epoxide is an anti-addition. The water molecule can attack either of the two carbons of the epoxide with equal probability.\n    *   Attack at one carbon leads to (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon leads to (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 2:** The products, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are a pair of enantiomers. Since they are formed in equal amounts, the product is a racemic mixture.\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the single meso compound from Reaction 1 with the racemic mixture of two enantiomers from Reaction 2. The final mixture therefore contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n*   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (a meso compound)\n*   (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (an enantiomer)\n*   (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (an enantiomer)\n\nThe meso compound and the enantiomers are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### Chromatographic Observation\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. Therefore, the meso-diol will be separated from the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will not be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Consequently, the chemist will observe **two peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the co-eluting pair of enantiomers.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:** This method uses a chiral stationary phase to separate enantiomers.\n    *   The chiral stationary phase interacts differently with the two enantiomers, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diol, allowing them to be separated into two distinct peaks.\n    *   The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also have a different retention time and will appear as a separate peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chemist will observe **three peaks**: one for the meso compound, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct observation is 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation.** The reaction of (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene) with mCPBA results in a *syn*-addition of the oxygen atom. This stereospecific reaction produces a trans-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is achiral, the product is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening.** The subsequent treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) opens the epoxide ring via an *anti*-addition mechanism. The nucleophile (water) attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the opposite face of the oxygen atom, causing an inversion of stereochemistry at the carbon being attacked.\n    *   Opening the (4R,5R)-epoxide leads to the (4S,5R)-diol.\n    *   Opening the (4S,5S)-epoxide leads to the (4R,5S)-diol.\n    *   Both (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol are the same achiral meso compound due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction 1 produces a single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation.** The reaction of (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene) with mCPBA involves a *syn*-addition of oxygen, which produces a cis-epoxide. This cis-epoxide has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a single meso compound: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening.** The acid-catalyzed opening of this meso-epoxide is an *anti*-addition.\n    *   Attack of water at one carbon (e.g., C4) results in the (4S,5S)-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other equivalent carbon (C5) results in the (4R,5R)-diol.\n    *   These two products, (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol and (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol, are enantiomers. Since the attack at either carbon is equally likely, they are formed in equal amounts.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction 2 produces a **racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n*   **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n*   **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n*   **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe meso-compound is a diastereomer of the two enantiomers.\n\n### **Chromatographic Observation**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   Standard HPLC columns separate compounds based on physical properties like polarity but cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will therefore elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated.\n    *   The chromatogram will show **two peaks**: one for the meso-compound and one for the co-eluting pair of enantiomers.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC columns contain a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The column will also separate the meso-compound from the enantiomers, as they are diastereomers.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **three distinct peaks**: one for the meso-compound, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a trans-alkene.\n*   **Reagents:** mCPBA followed by aqueous acid (H3O+). This two-step sequence results in the **anti-dihydroxylation** of the alkene, meaning two -OH groups are added across the double bond, one from the top face and one from the bottom face.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The anti-addition of two identical groups to a trans-alkene stereospecifically produces a **meso compound**.\n    *   Let's trace this:\n        1.  (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA → A racemic mixture of trans-epoxides ((4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n        2.  Acid-catalyzed ring-opening of either of these enantiomeric epoxides with water (an anti-attack) leads to the same single product: meso-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single compound, meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a cis-alkene.\n*   **Reagents:** mCPBA followed by aqueous acid (H3O+). This is also an **anti-dihydroxylation**.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The anti-addition of two identical groups to a cis-alkene stereospecifically produces a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.\n    *   Let's trace this:\n        1.  (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA → A single meso-epoxide ((4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n        2.  Acid-catalyzed ring-opening of this meso-epoxide with water (an anti-attack) results in two products. Attack at one carbon gives the (4R,5R)-diol, and attack at the other carbon gives the (4S,5S)-diol. Since both attacks are equally probable, a 50:50 mixture is formed.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different molecules (stereoisomers):\n1.  meso-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n2.  (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\nNow let's examine the relationships between these three isomers:\n*   The (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol (they are stereoisomers but not mirror images).\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This column separates compounds based on physical properties like polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore **cannot be separated**. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and **can be separated**. They will elute at different times, giving distinct peaks.\n    *   In our mixture, the enantiomeric pair ((4R,5R) and (4S,5S)-diols) will produce one peak. The meso-diol, being a diastereomer, will produce a second, separate peak.\n    *   **Result: 2 peaks.**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This column has a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment.\n    *   **Enantiomers** interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, forming temporary diastereomeric complexes of different stabilities. This allows them to be separated.\n    *   **Diastereomers** are also readily separated.\n    *   In our mixture, the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol will be separated into two distinct peaks. The meso-diol will be separated from both of them, producing a third peak.\n    *   **Result: 3 peaks.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks on the standard HPLC column and 3 peaks on the chiral HPLC column.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\n### Analysis of the Chromatograms\n\nThe chemist performs two reactions, combines the products, and analyzes the mixture using both standard and chiral High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). A detailed stereochemical analysis of each reaction is necessary to predict the resulting chromatograms.\n\n#### **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Starting Material**: (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n2.  **Epoxidation with mCPBA**: The reaction of an alkene with a peroxy acid like mCPBA is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom to the double bond, forming an epoxide. The epoxidation of a *trans*-alkene results in a racemic mixture of *trans*-epoxides. In this case, (E)-oct-4-ene will yield a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-epoxyoctane.\n3.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening**: The subsequent treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) opens the epoxide ring. This is an *anti*-addition, where a water molecule attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite to the oxygen atom. This results in the formation of a 1,2-diol (a glycol).\n    *   The acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the (4R,5R)-epoxide enantiomer involves an SN2-like attack by water, causing an inversion of configuration at the attacked carbon. Attack at C4 produces (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol, and attack at C5 produces (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Both of these are the same *meso* compound.\n    *   Similarly, the hydrolysis of the (4S,5S)-epoxide also yields the same *meso* compound.\n4.  **Product of Reaction 1**: The final product is a single, achiral compound: *meso*-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\nA general rule for such two-step *anti*-dihydroxylation is that a *trans*-alkene yields a *meso*-diol.\n\n#### **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Starting Material**: (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene. It is also symmetrical and achiral.\n2.  **Epoxidation with mCPBA**: The *syn*-addition of oxygen to a *cis*-alkene produces a *meso*-epoxide. (Z)-oct-4-ene gives *meso*-(4R,5S)-epoxyoctane.\n3.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening**: The *anti*-addition of water to the *meso*-epoxide opens the ring to form a diol.\n    *   Attack at the C4 carbon of the *meso*-epoxide results in the (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the C5 carbon results in the (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n4.  **Product of Reaction 2**: Since attack at either carbon is equally probable, a 1:1 mixture of the two enantiomers is formed. This is a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\nA general rule for *anti*-dihydroxylation is that a *cis*-alkene yields a racemic mixture of diols.\n\n### **The Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n*   *Meso*-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n*   (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n*   (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe *meso* compound is a diastereomer of the two enantiomers.\n\n### **Chromatographic Analysis**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC**:\n    *   Standard HPLC columns separate compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity and size, but they cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will therefore elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and are separable on an achiral column.\n    *   Thus, the chemist will observe two peaks: one for the racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diols, and a separate peak for the diastereomeric *meso*-diol.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC**:\n    *   Chiral HPLC columns contain a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The enantiomers, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diol, will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n    *   The *meso* compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated and will appear as a third distinct peak.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Standard HPLC**: **2 peaks** (one for the racemic pair, one for the *meso* compound).\n*   **Chiral HPLC**: **3 peaks** (one for each enantiomer and one for the *meso* compound).\n\nThis corresponds to the option predicting 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions and the resulting chromatographic separations.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reactant:** (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a symmetrical trans-alkene.\n    *   **Reagents:** First, mCPBA for epoxidation, then aqueous acid (H3O+) for epoxide opening. This two-step sequence results in an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The anti-addition of two hydroxyl groups to a *trans*-alkene results in the formation of a *meso* compound.\n    *   **Product 1:** meso-octane-4,5-diol. This is a single, achiral compound.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reactant:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a symmetrical cis-alkene.\n    *   **Reagents:** Same as Reaction 1, resulting in an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The anti-addition of two hydroxyl groups to a *cis*-alkene results in the formation of a *racemic mixture* (an equal mixture of two enantiomers).\n    *   **Product 2:** A racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n3.  **Combine the Products:**\n    *   The chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n        1.  meso-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n        2.  (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n        3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the other two. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) compounds are enantiomers of each other.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Standard (Achiral) HPLC Chromatogram:**\n    *   A standard HPLC column separates compounds based on physical properties like polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n    *   However, it can separate diastereomers, which have different physical properties.\n    *   Therefore, the two enantiomers ((4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol) will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   The meso-diol, being a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair, will have different properties and will elute at a different time, creating a second peak.\n    *   **Result:** 2 peaks are observed.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Chiral HPLC Chromatogram:**\n    *   A chiral HPLC column has a stationary phase that is itself chiral. This allows it to interact differently with each enantiomer, leading to their separation.\n    *   It will also separate diastereomers.\n    *   Therefore, all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved into separate peaks.\n    *   **Result:** 3 peaks are observed (one for the meso compound, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer).\n\n### Conclusion\nThe analysis shows there will be **2 peaks in standard HPLC** and **3 peaks in chiral HPLC**.

This molecule is achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step sequence: 1) mCPBA, followed by 2) aqueous acid (H3O+). This sequence results in the anti-dihydroxylation of the alkene, meaning two hydroxyl (-OH) groups are added across the double bond, one from the top face and one from the bottom face.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** There's a useful mnemonic for stereospecific reactions: **\"TAM\"** which stands for **T**rans + **A**nti -> **M**eso.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** According to this rule, the anti-dihydroxylation of a trans-alkene yields a meso compound. A meso compound is a single, achiral molecule that contains chiral centers. In this case, the product is meso-octane-4,5-diol. Let's call this compound **M**. It is a single substance.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a cis-alkene. This molecule is also achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction sequence is the same: anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** Another useful mnemonic is **\"CAR\"** which stands for **C**is + **A**nti -> **R**acemic.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The anti-dihydroxylation of a cis-alkene yields a racemic mixture of enantiomers. A racemic mixture contains equal amounts of two enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images). The products are (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Let's call these enantiomers **E1** and **E2**.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the Products and Analyze the Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **M**: meso-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **E1**: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **E2**: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\nNow let's determine the relationship between these three molecules:\n*   **E1** and **E2** are **enantiomers** of each other.\n*   **M** is a **diastereomer** of **E1**.\n*   **M** is also a **diastereomer** of **E2**.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the Chromatogram on a Standard (Achiral) HPLC Column**\n\nA standard, achiral HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers**, like E1 and E2, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by an achiral column. They will elute at the same time and appear as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers**, like M and the pair (E1, E2), have different physical properties. Therefore, they can be separated by an achiral column and will elute at different times.\n\nBased on this, the standard HPLC chromatogram will show:\n*   **Peak 1:** The meso compound (M).\n*   **Peak 2:** The co-eluting racemic mixture of enantiomers (E1 + E2).\n\nTotal peaks observed: **2**.\n\n**Step 5: Predict the Chromatogram on a Chiral HPLC Column**\n\nA chiral HPLC column has a stationary phase that is itself chiral. This allows it to interact differently with enantiomers, enabling their separation.\n*   **Enantiomers**, like E1 and E2, will form transient diastereomeric complexes with the chiral stationary phase. These complexes have different stabilities, causing E1 and E2 to elute at different times, resulting in two separate peaks.\n*   **Diastereomers**, like M and (E1, E2), are already separable on any column, including a chiral one.\n\nBased on this, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show three separate peaks for the three distinct molecules in the mixture:\n*   **Peak 1:** The meso compound (M).\n*   **Peak 2:** One enantiomer (e.g., E1).\n*   **Peak 3:** The other enantiomer (e.g., E2).\n\nTotal peaks observed: **3**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Step 1: Reaction with mCPBA.** m-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA) is a peroxyacid used for epoxidation. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to both carbons of the double bond from the same face.\n    *   The *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom to a *trans*-alkene results in a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides.\n    *   For (E)-oct-4-ene, this reaction produces (4R, 5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S, 5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane in a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n*   **Step 2: Reaction with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The mechanism involves the attack of a water molecule on the protonated epoxide. This attack occurs from the side opposite to the C-O bond, resulting in an *anti*-addition of the two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the original double bond.\n*   **Overall Transformation for Reaction 1:** The two-step process (syn-epoxidation followed by anti-opening) is equivalent to an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n    *   We can use the mnemonic **TAM**: **T**rans-**A**lkene + **A**nti-addition = **M**eso compound.\n    *   Therefore, the product of Reaction 1 is the meso compound, (4R, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol. It is a single, achiral product.\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Step 1: Reaction with mCPBA.** Again, this is a *syn*-epoxidation.\n    *   The *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom to a *cis*-alkene results in a meso epoxide.\n    *   For (Z)-oct-4-ene, this reaction produces the single meso compound (4R, 5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n*   **Step 2: Reaction with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This is an *anti*-opening of the epoxide.\n*   **Overall Transformation for Reaction 2:** This is also an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   We can use the mnemonic **CAR**: **C**is-**A**lkene + **A**nti-addition = **R**acemic mixture.\n    *   The attack of water on the meso-epoxide can occur at either of the two carbons (C4 or C5) with equal probability, leading to the formation of two enantiomers.\n    *   Attack at C4 (with R configuration) leads to the (4S, 5S)-diol.\n    *   Attack at C5 (with S configuration) leads to the (4R, 5R)-diol.\n    *   Therefore, the product of Reaction 2 is a racemic mixture of (4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**3. Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three stereoisomers of octane-4,5-diol:\n*   **(4R, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the meso compound from Reaction 1)\n*   **(4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (one enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n*   **(4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the other enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationships between these isomers:\n*   The (4R, 5R) and (4S, 5S) isomers are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   The meso (4R, 5S) isomer is a **diastereomer** to both the (4R, 5R) isomer and the (4S, 5S) isomer (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n**4. Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by a standard HPLC column and will elute together as a single peak. The racemic mixture of (4R, 5R) and (4S, 5S) diols will produce one peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will be separated. The meso diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It will have a different retention time and elute as a separate peak.\n    *   **Conclusion for standard HPLC:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   A chiral column can separate all stereoisomers.\n    *   It will resolve the enantiomeric pair, (4R, 5R)-diol and (4S, 5S)-diol, into two distinct peaks.\n    *   It will also separate the meso diol from the other two isomers because it is a diastereomer.\n    *   **Conclusion for chiral HPLC:** The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**, one for each of the three stereoisomers in the mixture.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   Standard HPLC: 2 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, then H₃O⁺\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene. The reaction with mCPBA is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to one face of the double bond. This stereospecific reaction converts the *trans*-alkene into a *trans*-epoxide. Because the starting alkene is achiral, the mCPBA can attack from either the top or bottom face, producing an equal mixture of the two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. This 50:50 mixture is called a racemic mixture.\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Hydrolysis:** The epoxide ring is then opened by adding aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This reaction proceeds via an *anti*-attack, where the water molecule (nucleophile) attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite the C-O bond.\n    *   The attack on the (4R,5R)-epoxide results in (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The attack on the (4S,5S)-epoxide also results in (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    This product, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a meso compound. A meso compound is achiral despite having chiral centers. Thus, Reaction 1 yields a single product: the meso-diol.\n\n### Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, then H₃O⁺\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene. The *syn*-addition of mCPBA converts the *cis*-alkene into a *cis*-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is symmetrical and achiral, this reaction produces a single meso compound: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Hydrolysis:** The *anti*-attack of water on the meso-epoxide leads to the formation of two different products.\n    *   Attack at one carbon inverts its stereocenter, leading to (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon leads to the other enantiomer, (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    Since the attack is equally likely at both carbons, the products of Reaction 2 are a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three stereoisomers of octane-4,5-diol:\n*   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (the meso compound from Reaction 1)\n*   (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n*   (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe meso compound is a diastereomer of the two enantiomers.\n\n### Chromatographic Observation\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity. Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. Enantiomers, however, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will therefore elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Peak 1:** The meso-diol, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   **Peak 2:** The co-eluting racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    Therefore, the standard HPLC chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment. This allows for the separation of enantiomers because they interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n    *   The meso compound will be separated from the enantiomers because it is a diastereomer.\n    *   The two enantiomers, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diol, will also be separated from each other.\n    Therefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **3 peaks**: one for the meso compound, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms.\n\n### Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, then H₃O⁺\n\nThis two-step process results in the **anti-dihydroxylation** of the alkene. The stereochemical rule for the anti-addition to a trans (E) alkene is that it forms a **meso** compound.\n\n1.  **(E)-oct-4-ene to epoxide:** The first step is the epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA. This is a syn-addition, creating a trans-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is symmetric, this reaction produces a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Epoxide to diol:** The acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide by water is an anti-addition. The attack of water on either epoxide enantiomer from the side opposite the epoxide ring leads to the formation of a single, achiral meso-compound: **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. This compound has a plane of symmetry and is therefore not optically active.\n\nSo, Reaction 1 yields one product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, then H₃O⁺\n\nThis is also an **anti-dihydroxylation**. The stereochemical rule for the anti-addition to a cis (Z) alkene is that it forms a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.\n\n1.  **(Z)-oct-4-ene to epoxide:** The epoxidation of (Z)-oct-4-ene is a syn-addition that forms a cis-epoxide. Because the starting alkene is symmetric, the resulting epoxide is a meso compound: (4R,5S)-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Epoxide to diol:** The acid-catalyzed anti-addition of water to the meso-epoxide results in the formation of a racemic mixture. Attack at one carbon gives (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol, and attack at the other gives (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These two products are enantiomers.\n\nSo, Reaction 2 yields a racemic mixture of two products: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe final mixture that is injected into the HPLC contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n*   **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n*   **A racemic pair of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe meso-diol is a diastereomer of both of the enantiomers from Reaction 2.\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\n**Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n*   Standard HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, like polarity.\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated; they will elute at the same time, producing a single peak.\n*   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n*   The racemic pair from Reaction 2 will elute together as **one peak**.\n*   The meso-diol from Reaction 1 is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair and will have a different retention time, eluting as a **separate peak**.\n*   Therefore, the standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC:**\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase to separate enantiomers. The enantiomers interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, leading to different retention times.\n*   It will also separate the diastereomers.\n*   The enantiomeric pair from Reaction 2, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diol, will be resolved into **two separate peaks**.\n*   The meso-compound from Reaction 1 is achiral. It will not be resolved into multiple peaks and will elute as a **single peak**.\n*   Therefore, the chiral HPLC will show a total of **3 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\n### Analysis of the Reactions and Products\n\nThe problem describes two sequential reactions starting from geometric isomers of oct-4-ene. Let's analyze each reaction step-by-step to determine the final products.\n\n**Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The starting material is (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a *trans*-alkene. The epoxidation of an alkene with a peroxy acid like mCPBA is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond. A *trans*-alkene undergoing *syn*-addition results in a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting material is achiral, the product will be a racemic mixture of the two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-diethyloxirane and (4S,5S)-4,5-diethyloxirane.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** The epoxide ring is then opened by treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This is an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, which occurs via an Sₙ2-like mechanism with *anti*-addition. The water molecule attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite to the C-O bond, causing an inversion of stereochemistry at the attacked carbon.\n    *   Opening of the (4R,5R)-epoxide results in (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Opening of the (4S,5S)-epoxide also results in (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (which is identical to (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol).\n    This product has two stereocenters but possesses a plane of symmetry, making it a single, achiral *meso* compound.\n\n**Product of Reaction 1:** (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (a *meso* compound).\n\n**Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The starting material is (Z)-oct-4-ene, a *cis*-alkene. *Syn*-addition to a *cis*-alkene produces a *cis*-epoxide. Since (Z)-oct-4-ene is a symmetrical *cis*-alkene, the resulting epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-diethyloxirane, is a *meso* compound.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** The *meso*-epoxide undergoes acid-catalyzed ring opening, which is an *anti*-addition.\n    *   Attack of water at one carbon (e.g., C4, which is R) inverts its configuration to S, leaving the other (C5, which is S) unchanged. This forms (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon (C5, which is S) inverts its configuration to R, leaving C4 as R. This forms (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    The two products, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are enantiomers. Since the reaction starts with achiral materials, they are formed in equal amounts, creating a racemic mixture.\n\n**Products of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis of the Combined Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the single *meso* product from Reaction 1 with the racemic mixture from Reaction 2. The final mixture therefore contains three stereoisomers:\n*   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (*meso*)\n*   (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (*enantiomer A*)\n*   (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (*enantiomer B*)\n\nThe relationship between the *meso* compound and each of the enantiomers is that of diastereomers.\n\n**1. Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\nThis technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers**, like (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers**, such as the *meso* compound and the enantiomeric pair, have different physical properties and will be separated by the column.\nTherefore, the standard HPLC chromatogram will show **two peaks**: one for the *meso* compound and a second for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair.\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC:**\nThis technique uses a chiral stationary phase that can differentiate between enantiomers.\n*   The enantiomers, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n*   The *meso* compound is a diastereomer of the other two and is achiral. It will also be separated from them and will appear as its own distinct peak.\nTherefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will resolve all three stereoisomers, resulting in **three peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Part 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** The starting material is (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule as it possesses a C2 axis of symmetry.\n    ```\n       CH3CH2CH2     H\n              \\   /\n               C=C\n              /   \\\n             H     CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n\n2.  **Reaction Sequence:** The reaction is a two-step process that results in anti-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n    *   **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** This is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond. The reaction of a *trans*-alkene via *syn*-addition on its two faces (top and bottom) produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric *trans*-epoxides. In this case, it yields a racemic mixture of (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis (H3O+).** This step opens the epoxide ring. The nucleophile (H₂O) attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite to the C-O bond (a backside attack). This is an *anti*-opening of the ring.\n\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** The overall reaction is an anti-dihydroxylation. The stereochemical rule for this reaction is:\n    *   **Trans-alkene + Anti-addition → Meso compound**\n\n    Therefore, the product of Reaction 1 is a single compound: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. A meso compound is achiral despite having chiral centers (in this case, (4R,5S) configuration).\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** The starting material is (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a *cis*-alkene. This molecule is also achiral (it has a plane of symmetry).\n    ```\n       CH3CH2CH2     CH2CH2CH3\n              \\       /\n               C=C\n              /   \\\n             H     H\n    ```\n\n2.  **Reaction Sequence:** This is the same anti-dihydroxylation sequence as in Reaction 1.\n\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** We apply the stereochemical rule for the anti-dihydroxylation of a *cis*-alkene:\n    *   **Cis-alkene + Anti-addition → Racemic mixture**\n\n    Therefore, the product of Reaction 2 is a racemic mixture (a 50:50 mixture of two enantiomers): **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Part 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationships between these compounds:\n*   Compound 1 is a meso compound (achiral).\n*   Compounds 2 and 3 are enantiomers (chiral molecules that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other).\n*   Compound 1 is a diastereomer of Compound 2 and Compound 3 (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n### **Part 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This type of chromatography separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties like polarity and size.\n    *   Enantiomers (like compounds 2 and 3) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated and will elute at the same time, appearing as a **single peak**.\n    *   Diastereomers (like compound 1 and the pair of 2/3) have different physical properties. Therefore, they will be separated and will elute at different times.\n    *   So, the chromatogram will show one peak for the meso compound (1) and another peak for the unresolved enantiomeric pair (2 + 3).\n    *   **Total peaks on standard HPLC = 2.**\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This type of chromatography uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment. This allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   Since the three compounds in the mixture are all distinct stereoisomers, they will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n    *   The meso compound (1) will be separated from the enantiomers (2 and 3).\n    *   The enantiomers (2 and 3) will also be separated from each other.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show three distinct peaks, one for each stereoisomer.\n    *   **Total peaks on chiral HPLC = 3.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.

This is a trans-alkene. It is an achiral molecule as it possesses a C2 rotational axis of symmetry.\n*   **Reagent 1: mCPBA.** This reagent performs epoxidation, which is a syn-addition reaction (both C-O bonds are formed on the same face of the alkene double bond).\n    *   The reaction of mCPBA (an achiral reagent) with the achiral (E)-alkene can occur from two faces (top or bottom) with equal probability.\n    *   Attack on a trans-alkene yields a trans-epoxide.\n    *   Attack from the top face yields (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   Attack from the bottom face yields (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   These two products, (4R,5R) and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane, are enantiomers. Since they are formed in equal amounts, the product of this step is a racemic mixture of the two enantiomeric epoxides.\n*   **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This reagent causes the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The mechanism involves the nucleophilic attack of water on the protonated epoxide, which proceeds with inversion of stereochemistry at the attacked carbon (an Sₙ2-like, anti-addition process).\n    *   Let's consider the ring-opening of the (4R,5R)-epoxide. Water can attack either C4 or C5.\n        *   Attack at C5 results in inversion at C5 (R → S), while C4 remains R. The product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Attack at C4 results in inversion at C4 (R → S), while C5 remains R. The product is (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Now, let's analyze the product stereoisomers. (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol has an internal plane of symmetry (when rotated into the correct conformation), making it a *meso* compound. A meso compound is achiral despite having chiral centers. (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol is the same meso compound.\n    *   Similarly, the ring-opening of the other enantiomer, (4S,5S)-epoxide, will also exclusively yield the same meso-diol, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The sole product is the meso compound, **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is an achiral molecule as it possesses a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reagent 1: mCPBA.** The syn-addition epoxidation of a cis-alkene yields a cis-epoxide.\n    *   Because the starting (Z)-alkene is achiral and symmetrical, epoxidation from either the top or bottom face results in the same single product: the meso epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n*   **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This causes the anti-addition ring-opening of the meso-epoxide.\n    *   Let's consider the ring-opening of the meso (4R,5S)-epoxide. Water can attack either C4 or C5.\n        *   Attack at C5 results in inversion at C5 (S → R), while C4 remains R. The product is **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        *   Attack at C4 results in inversion at C4 (R → S), while C5 remains S.

The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the meso compound from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's examine the relationships between these isomers:\n*   (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso compound (4R,5S) is a **diastereomer** of both (4R,5R) and (4S,5S).\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This technique separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore **cannot be separated**.

This is a *trans*-alkene, which is an achiral molecule.\n2.  **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process:\n    *   **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** This is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond. A *trans*-alkene undergoing *syn*-addition results in a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting material is achiral, the chiral epoxide product, trans-4,5-epoxyoctane, is formed as a racemic mixture of (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers.\n    *   **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** The epoxide ring is opened by a backside (*anti*) attack of a water molecule. This step results in the inversion of stereochemistry at the site of attack.\n3.  **Overall Stereochemistry:** The overall transformation is an *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene. A reliable stereochemical rule is that the **anti-addition** to a **trans-alkene** produces a **meso** compound (if the substitution pattern allows for one, as it does here).\n4.  **Product of Reaction 1:** The reaction produces a single product, **meso-octane-4,5-diol**, which is an achiral compound despite having two chiral centers.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene, which is also an achiral molecule.\n2.  **Reagents:** The reagents are the same as in Reaction 1, so the overall transformation is also an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n3.  **Overall Stereochemistry:** The stereochemical rule for this case is that **anti-addition** to a **cis-alkene** produces a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.\n    *   The first step (epoxidation) produces the meso-epoxide (cis-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n    *   The second step (hydrolysis) involves backside attack by water on the meso-epoxide. Attack at the two different carbons of the epoxide ring leads to the formation of two products that are mirror images of each other.\n4.  **Product of Reaction 2:** The reaction produces a 50:50 racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. These two products are enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n*   **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n*   **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n*   **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is crucial:\n*   The **(4R,5R)** and **(4S,5S)** diols are **enantiomers**.\n*   The **meso-diol** is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties. Therefore, the meso-diol will be separated from the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   **Result:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment inside the column.\n    *   This chiral environment allows for the separation of **enantiomers**, as they will interact differently with the stationary phase.\n    *   Chiral columns can also separate **diastereomers**.\n    *   **Result:** All three unique stereoisomers—the meso compound, the (4R,5R) enantiomer, and the (4S,5S) enantiomer—will be resolved into separate peaks. The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** on the standard HPLC and **3 peaks** on the chiral HPLC. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of stereochemical outcomes of two reactions and the subsequent analysis of the product mixture by two different types of High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n        Pr   H\n         \\ /\n          C=C\n         / \\\n        H   Pr  (where Pr = propyl group, -CH2CH2CH3)\n    ```\n*   **Reagents and Transformation:** The reaction involves two steps:\n    1.  **Epoxidation with mCPBA:** This is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond. A *syn*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting material is achiral, the reaction produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R, 5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S, 5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Acid-catalyzed ring-opening:** The epoxide is treated with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This is a nucleophilic ring-opening reaction where water acts as the nucleophile. The mechanism is an Sₙ2-like attack that proceeds with *anti*-addition (the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the C-O bond), causing an inversion of stereochemistry at the attacked carbon.\n*   **Overall Transformation for Reaction 1:** The two-step sequence (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) is equivalent to an *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The rule for *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene is that it produces a *meso* compound.\n    *   Starting with the racemic mixture of (4R, 5R) and (4S, 5S) epoxides, the *anti*-opening leads to the same single product for both enantiomers.\n    *   Opening of (4R, 5R)-epoxide gives *meso*-(4R, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Opening of (4S, 5S)-epoxide also gives *meso*-(4R, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single compound, *meso*-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a *cis*-alkene.

The resulting (Z)-4,5-epoxyoctane is a *meso* compound because it has a plane of symmetry.\n    2.  **Acid-catalyzed ring-opening:** The *meso*-epoxide undergoes *anti*-addition of water.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The rule for *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene (or its meso epoxide derivative) is that it produces a *racemic* mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   Attack of water at one carbon of the *meso*-epoxide gives (4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other equivalent carbon gives the enantiomer, (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the products of both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  *meso*-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n2.  (4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n3.

Therefore, they cannot be separated and will elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak. The racemic pair of (4R, 5R) and (4S, 5S)-diol will produce one peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties. Therefore, they can be separated and will elute at different times.

The *meso*-diol will elute separately from the two enantiomers.\n*   **Conclusion for Chiral HPLC:** The chromatogram will show **3 peaks** (one for each unique stereoisomer in the mixture).\n\n### Final Summary:\n\n*   **Standard HPLC:** 2 peaks (one for the meso compound, one for the racemic pair).\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 3 peaks (one for the meso compound, one for the R,R enantiomer, and one for the S,S enantiomer).\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the subsequent chromatographic observations:\n\n### **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of an alkene with a peroxyacid like mCPBA is a *syn*-addition, meaning both oxygen-carbon bonds form on the same face of the double bond. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene is retained in the product. Treating (E)-oct-4-ene (a *trans*-alkene) with mCPBA results in a *trans*-epoxide. Because the attack can occur from either face of the alkene with equal probability, a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane, is formed.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening.** The subsequent treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) opens the epoxide ring. This ring-opening is an *anti*-addition, meaning the nucleophile (water) attacks from the side opposite the epoxide oxygen.\n    *   Attack on the (4R,5R)-epoxide results in the formation of (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack on the (4S,5S)-epoxide also results in (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    This product, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a single, achiral *meso* compound.\n\n### **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The *syn*-addition of mCPBA to (Z)-oct-4-ene (a *cis*-alkene) forms a *cis*-epoxide. Due to the symmetry of the starting material and the nature of the addition, the resulting epoxide is a *meso* compound, (4R,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening.** The *anti*-addition of water to this *meso*-epoxide results in a racemic mixture of two enantiomers.\n    *   Attack at one carbon of the meso-epoxide yields (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon yields (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    These two products are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, forming a racemic mixture.\n\n### **Combined Product Mixture Analysis**\n\nThe chemist combines the product of Reaction 1 (the *meso*-diol) with the products of Reaction 2 (the racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diols). The final mixture therefore contains three stereoisomers:\n*   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (*meso*)\n*   (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (*enantiomer*)\n*   (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (*enantiomer*)\n\n### **Chromatographic Observation**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties like polarity, but it cannot differentiate between enantiomers.\n    *   The enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will co-elute, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   The *meso*-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.

Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, the product is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Step 2: Aqueous acid hydrolysis.** The acid-catalyzed opening of an epoxide is an *anti*-addition; the incoming water molecule attacks from the side opposite the epoxide oxygen. The anti-addition to a racemic mixture of *trans*-epoxides results in the formation of a single, achiral *meso* compound: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.

This gives a **second peak**.\n*   **Total Peaks on Standard HPLC = 2**.\n\n**Step 5: Predict the chromatogram on a chiral HPLC column.**\n\n*   A chiral column separates both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   Each of the three distinct stereoisomers will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and will be resolved.\n*   The meso-diol will produce **one peak**.\n*   The (4R,5R)-enantiomer will produce a **second peak**.\n*   The (4S,5S)-enantiomer will produce a **third peak**.\n*   **Total Peaks on Chiral HPLC = 3**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combined analysis shows that the chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.

This is a trans-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA:** This reagent performs a syn-epoxidation. The reaction of an achiral trans-alkene with mCPBA (an achiral reagent, for practical purposes) can occur from the top or bottom face of the double bond with equal probability. This results in a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric trans-epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This performs an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The water molecule acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons in an anti-fashion (Sₙ2-like mechanism).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:**\n    *   When the (4R,5R)-epoxide is opened by water, attack at C4 (inverting its configuration to S) or C5 (inverting its configuration to S) both lead to the same product: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   When the (4S,5S)-epoxide is opened by water, attack at C4 (inverting its configuration to R) or C5 (inverting its configuration to R) both lead to the same product: (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol are the same molecule. This is a **meso compound**, which is achiral because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The product is a single meso compound, meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is also an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:** Same as Reaction 1.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:**\n    1.  **mCPBA:** The syn-epoxidation of the achiral cis-alkene produces a single, achiral meso-epoxide: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** The anti-attack of water on the meso-epoxide can occur at two different carbons (C4 and C5).\n        *   Attack at C4 (which is R) inverts its configuration to S, leaving C5 as S. The product is **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        *   Attack at C5 (which is S) inverts its configuration to R, leaving C4 as R. The product is **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n    *   These two products, (4S,5S)- and (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol, are **enantiomers**. Since attack at either carbon is equally likely, they are formed in equal amounts, creating a **racemic mixture**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The products are a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe meso compound is a diastereomer to both of the chiral diols. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are enantiomers of each other.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment, so they cannot be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated into different peaks.\n    *   Therefore, the racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diols will appear as **one peak**. The meso-diol, being a diastereomer, will have different properties and will appear as a **second peak**.\n    *   **Total peaks on standard HPLC: 2**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The chiral column will separate the two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, into **two distinct peaks**.\n    *   The meso-diol is achiral and is a diastereomer to the other two compounds. It will be separated from them and will appear as its own **single peak**.\n    *   **Total peaks on chiral HPLC: 3**\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of a trans-alkene, (E)-oct-4-ene, with mCPBA is a stereospecific *syn*-addition. This means both oxygen-carbon bonds form on the same face of the double bond. Since the starting material is symmetric, this reaction produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening.** The subsequent treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) opens the epoxide ring. This is an *anti*-addition, where the water molecule attacks from the side opposite the epoxide oxygen. The attack occurs with inversion of configuration at the carbon atom being attacked.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 1.** The *anti*-opening of the racemic epoxide mixture results in a single, achiral meso compound: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. This is because the opening of the (4R,5R)-epoxide gives the (4R,5S)-diol, and the opening of the (4S,5S)-epoxide gives the (4S,5R)-diol. These two are the same meso compound.\n\n### Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of a cis-alkene, (Z)-oct-4-ene, with mCPBA is also a *syn*-addition. This reaction forms a single, achiral meso epoxide: (Z)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening.** The acid-catalyzed *anti*-opening of this meso epoxide can occur by nucleophilic attack at either of the two equivalent carbons of the epoxide.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 2.** Attack at one carbon results in the (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol, while attack at the other carbon produces its enantiomer, (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Therefore, this reaction yields a racemic mixture of the two enantiomeric diols.\n\n### Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n*   **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (a meso compound from Reaction 1)\n*   A racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (an enantiomeric pair from Reaction 2)\n\nThe meso compound and the enantiomeric pair are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This technique separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. Therefore, the meso diol will be separated from the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will not be separated. The racemic pair will elute as a single peak.\n    *   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The column will separate the meso compound from the other isomers.\n    *   The chiral stationary phase will also resolve the racemic mixture, separating the (4R,5R)-enantiomer from the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n    *   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **3 peaks** (one for the meso compound and one for each of the two enantiomers).\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 1:** Determine the stereochemical outcome of treating (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid.\n    *   The reaction of an alkene with mCPBA is an epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition.\n    *   The subsequent acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide by water is an *anti*-addition.\n    *   The overall process is an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   An *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a meso compound. Therefore, Reaction 1 produces a single meso diol, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2:** Determine the stereochemical outcome of treating (Z)-oct-4-ene with the same reagents.\n    *   This is also an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   An *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene results in a racemic mixture of enantiomers. Therefore, Reaction 2 produces a 50:50 mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Product Mixture:** The chemist combines the products. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n    *   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (the meso compound from Reaction 1)\n    *   (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n    *   (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\n4.  **Predict the Standard HPLC Chromatogram:**\n    *   Standard (achiral) HPLC separates compounds based on physical properties like polarity.\n    *   Enantiomers (like the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) pair) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will co-elute, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers (like the meso compound and either of the enantiomers) have different physical properties and will be separated into different peaks.\n    *   Therefore, we expect two peaks: one for the meso compound and one for the racemic pair.\n\n5.  **Predict the Chiral HPLC Chromatogram:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The two enantiomers, (4R,5R) and (4S,5S), will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer to the other two and will also have a unique retention time, appearing as a third peak.\n    *   Therefore, we expect three distinct peaks for the three stereoisomers.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The analysis predicts 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC, which corresponds to option D.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_hplc_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the products of two stereospecific reactions and predicts the\n    number of peaks observed in standard and chiral HPLC chromatograms.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1\n    # (E)-oct-4-ene (trans) undergoes anti-dihydroxylation.\n    # A trans-alkene undergoing anti-addition yields a meso compound.\n    reaction1_product = \"Meso-octane-4,5-diol ((4R,5S)-diol)\"\n    print(\"--- Analysis ---\")\n    print(\"Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, then H3O+\")\n    print(f\"Product 1: A single meso compound ({reaction1_product}).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 15)\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2\n    # (Z)-oct-4-ene (cis) undergoes anti-dihydroxylation.\n    # A cis-alkene undergoing anti-addition yields a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    reaction2_products = [\"(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\", \"(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\"]\n    print(\"Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, then H3O+\")\n    print(f\"Product 2: A racemic mixture of two enantiomers: {reaction2_products[0]} and {reaction2_products[1]}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 15)\n\n    # Step 3: Combine the products\n    # The final mixture contains three unique stereoisomers.\n    final_mixture = [reaction1_product] + reaction2_products\n    print(\"Combined Product Mixture contains 3 stereoisomers:\")\n    for i, compound in enumerate(final_mixture):\n        print(f\"  {i+1}. {compound}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 15)\n\n    # Step 4: Predict Standard (Achiral) HPLC results\n    # Achiral HPLC separates diastereomers but not enantiomers.\n    # The meso compound is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair.\n    # The two enantiomers will elute together.\n    standard_hplc_peaks = 2\n    print(\"Standard (Achiral) HPLC Analysis:\")\n    print(\" -

This is a trans-alkene. It is achiral.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA:** This reagent performs an epoxidation, which is a syn-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H3O+):** This catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The nucleophile (water) attacks from the side opposite the C-O bond (backside attack), resulting in an overall anti-addition of two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the original double bond. This process is called anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 1:** The reaction is an anti-dihydroxylation of a trans-alkene. There is a general rule for such reactions on symmetrically substituted alkenes: **Trans + Anti -> Meso**.\n    *   Let's verify this. The starting (E)-oct-4-ene is achiral. The reagents are achiral. The reaction proceeds through a racemic mixture of the trans-epoxide. The subsequent anti-opening of this racemic epoxide mixture yields a single meso product.\n    *   The product is **meso-octane-4,5-diol**, which has the configuration (4R, 5S). A meso compound is achiral despite having chiral centers, due to an internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is a single, unique compound.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** One compound, meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** The same as in Reaction 1, leading to an overall anti-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 2:** The reaction is an anti-dihydroxylation of a cis-alkene. The general rule is: **Cis + Anti -> Racemic**.\n    *   Let's verify this. The starting (Z)-oct-4-ene is achiral. The epoxidation with mCPBA forms a single meso-epoxide. The subsequent anti-opening of this achiral meso-epoxide by water (an achiral nucleophile) must result in an achiral product mixture. Attack at the two carbons of the epoxide leads to two different products that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other (enantiomers). Since attack at either carbon is equally probable, the two enantiomers are formed in equal amounts.\n    *   The products are **(4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. This is a racemic mixture.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture containing two different compounds (enantiomers).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers of octane-4,5-diol:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationships between these isomers:\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of the (4R, 5R)-diol.\n*   The meso-diol is also a **diastereomer** of the (4S, 5S)-diol.\n*   The (4R, 5R)-diol and the (4S, 5S)-diol are **enantiomers**.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated. They will elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   In our mixture, the meso-diol is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair. Therefore, the meso-diol will be separated from the pair. The two enantiomers will co-elute.\n    *   We will observe **2 peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: The racemic mixture of (4R, 5R)- and (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment.\n    *   A chiral column can separate diastereomers.\n    *   Crucially, a chiral column can also separate enantiomers, because the two enantiomers will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, leading to different retention times.\n    *   Therefore, all three stereoisomers in the mixture will be separated.\n    *   We will observe **3 peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: (4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 3: (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Step 1: Treatment with mCPBA.** This is an epoxidation reaction. The reaction is a *syn*-addition, meaning the stereochemistry of the alkene is preserved in the epoxide. A *trans*-alkene gives a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting material is achiral and the reagent (mCPBA) is achiral, the chiral product must be formed as a racemic mixture. The product is a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n*   **Step 2: Treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. Water acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite the oxygen atom (an Sₙ2-like, *anti*-attack).\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step sequence (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 1:** We are performing an *anti*-addition on a *trans*-alkene. A useful mnemonic is **\"TAM\"**: **T**rans-**A**lkene + **A**nti-addition gives a **M**eso compound.\n    *   Let's verify: Starting with the racemic epoxide mixture:\n        *   (4R,5R)-epoxide undergoes anti-attack by water, leading to the (4R,5S)-diol (which is the same as the (4S,5R)-diol). This is a meso compound.\n        *   (4S,5S)-epoxide also undergoes anti-attack, leading to the same (4S,5R)-diol (meso).\n    *   Therefore, the sole product of Reaction 1 is **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. This is a single, achiral compound.\n\n### **2. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Step 1: Treatment with mCPBA.** The *syn*-addition of the oxygen atom to the *cis*-alkene results in a *cis*-epoxide. The product, cis-4,5-epoxyoctane, has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a meso compound ((4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n*   **Step 2: Treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This is the same *anti*-attack ring-opening as in Reaction 1.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** This is also an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 2:** We are performing an *anti*-addition on a *cis*-alkene. A useful mnemonic is **\"CAR\"**: **C**is-**A**lkene + **A**nti-addition gives a **R**acemic mixture.\n    *   Let's verify: Starting with the meso-epoxide ((4R,5S)-epoxide):\n        *   Attack at C4 (R-configured) inverts it to S, giving the (4S,5S)-diol.\n        *   Attack at C5 (S-configured) inverts it to R, giving the (4R,5R)-diol.\n    *   Since the starting material is achiral, the two enantiomeric products must be formed in equal amounts.\n    *   Therefore, the product of Reaction 2 is a **racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationships between these isomers:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers** of each other.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n### **4. Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral stationary phase cannot distinguish between enantiomers. Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will have the same retention time, eluting as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated by an achiral column.\n    *   Therefore, the racemic pair of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diols will elute together as **one peak**. The meso-diol, being a diastereomer, will elute at a different time as a **second peak**.\n    *   **Total peaks on standard HPLC = 2.**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral stationary phase is designed to interact differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   It will also separate diastereomers.\n    *   Therefore, the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol will be resolved into **two separate peaks**. The meso-diol is achiral and will elute as a **single, third peak** (at a different retention time from the other two, as it is a diastereomer).\n    *   **Total peaks on chiral HPLC = 3.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of a *trans*-alkene, (E)-oct-4-ene, with mCPBA results in a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom. This means the oxygen adds to the same face of the double bond. Since the starting alkene is symmetrical and achiral, this reaction produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane and (4S,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening.** The subsequent treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) opens the epoxide ring. This is an *anti*-addition, meaning the incoming nucleophile (water) attacks from the side opposite to the epoxide oxygen.\n    *   The ring-opening of the (4R,5R)-epoxide results in (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The ring-opening of the (4S,5S)-epoxide also results in (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 1:** The resulting product, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, has two stereocenters but possesses an internal plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is a single, achiral **meso compound**.\n\n### Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of a *cis*-alkene, (Z)-oct-4-ene, with mCPBA is also a *syn*-addition. Because the starting material is a symmetrical *cis*-alkene, this reaction forms a single, achiral meso epoxide: (4R,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening.** The acid-catalyzed ring-opening of this meso-epoxide is an *anti*-addition. The nucleophilic attack by water can occur with equal probability at either of the two carbons of the epoxide.\n    *   Attack at one carbon produces (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon produces (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 2:** The products are a pair of enantiomers. Since they are formed in equal amounts, the result is a **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the product from Reaction 1 (the meso compound) with the products from Reaction 2 (the racemic mixture of two enantiomers). The final mixture therefore contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n*   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (meso compound)\n*   (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (enantiomer 1)\n*   (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (enantiomer 2)\n\nThe meso compound is a diastereomer of the two enantiomers.\n\n### Chromatographic Observation\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral HPLC column cannot distinguish between enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers will elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers, however, have different physical properties and can be separated by achiral chromatography. The meso compound will have a different retention time from the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Consequently, the chemist will observe **2 peaks**.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers will have different retention times and will appear as two separate peaks.\n    *   The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also have a distinct retention time and will be separated from them.\n    *   Consequently, the chemist will observe **3 peaks**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the standard HPLC will show 2 peaks, and the chiral HPLC will show 3 peaks.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** The starting material is (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a *trans*-alkene. Treatment with mCPBA results in a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom to the double bond. This stereospecific reaction converts the *trans*-alkene into a *trans*-epoxide. Because the attack can happen from either face of the alkene, a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides, (4R,5R)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane and (4S,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane, is formed.\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening:** The subsequent treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) opens the epoxide ring. This is an Sₙ2-type reaction where the water molecule attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite the oxygen atom, causing an inversion of stereochemistry at the site of attack.\n    *   Attack on the (4R,5R)-epoxide at either carbon results in the formation of (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack on the (4S,5S)-epoxide at either carbon results in the formation of (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    These two products, (4R,5S) and (4S,5R), are identical. This product has two chiral centers but also has a plane of symmetry, making it a single, achiral **meso compound**.\n\n### Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** The starting material is (Z)-oct-4-ene, a *cis*-alkene. The *syn*-addition of oxygen from mCPBA converts the *cis*-alkene into a *cis*-epoxide. This epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane, is a meso compound itself.\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening:** The acid-catalyzed hydrolysis opens the meso-epoxide. The water nucleophile can attack either of the two carbons of the protonated epoxide.\n    *   Attack at one carbon results in an inversion of configuration, leading to the (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol enantiomer.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon also causes an inversion, leading to the (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol enantiomer.\n    Since the starting epoxide is achiral, attacks on either side are equally probable, producing a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers. This is a **racemic mixture**.\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the product from Reaction 1 (the meso compound) with the product from Reaction 2 (the racemic mixture). The final mixture therefore contains three stereoisomers:\n*   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (meso)\n*   (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (enantiomer)\n*   (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (enantiomer)\n\nThe (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers are enantiomers of each other. The meso isomer is a diastereomer of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers.\n\n### Chromatographic Observation\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers (the meso compound and the enantiomeric pair) have different physical properties and will be separated, resulting in different retention times.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Consequently, the chemist will observe **two peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the co-eluting pair of enantiomers.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:** This method uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The meso compound will produce a single peak.\n    *   The two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, will be separated from each other, each giving a distinct peak.\n    *   The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated from them.\n    *   Therefore, the chemist will observe **three peaks**: one for the meso compound, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\nBased on this analysis, the standard HPLC will show 2 peaks, and the chiral HPLC will show 3 peaks.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene) is treated with mCPBA. The epoxidation reaction is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to both carbons of the double bond from the same face. For a trans-alkene, this results in a trans-epoxide. Since the mCPBA can attack from either the top or bottom face of the alkene with equal probability, a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides is formed: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening:** The epoxide mixture is then treated with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This is an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis that opens the epoxide ring. The water molecule acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite the epoxide oxygen (an *anti*-addition or backside attack).\n    *   When the (4R,5R)-epoxide is attacked by water at either C4 or C5, it results in the formation of (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Similarly, when the (4S,5S)-epoxide is attacked, the product is also (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   This product, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, has two chiral centers but possesses an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Therefore, Reaction 1 produces a single, achiral meso product.\n\n### Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene) is treated with mCPBA. The *syn*-addition of oxygen to a cis-alkene results in a cis-epoxide. This specific product, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane, is a meso compound because it has an internal plane of symmetry.\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening:** The meso-epoxide is then opened by aqueous acid. The backside attack by water can occur at either C4 or C5 with equal likelihood.\n    *   Attack at C4 (which is R) leads to inversion of stereochemistry at that carbon, producing (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at C5 (which is S) leads to inversion at that carbon, producing (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The two products, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are non-superimposable mirror images of each other; they are enantiomers. Since both are formed in equal amounts, Reaction 2 produces a racemic mixture.\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the product of Reaction 1 (the meso-diol) with the products of Reaction 2 (the racemic mixture of (R,R)- and (S,S)-diols). The final mixture therefore contains three stereoisomers:\n*   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (meso compound)\n*   (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (enantiomer)\n*   (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (enantiomer)\n\nThe meso compound is a diastereomer of the two enantiomers.\n\n### Chromatographic Observation\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   Standard HPLC columns use an achiral stationary phase and separate compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated.

This is a *trans*-alkene. It is a symmetrical alkene, with a propyl group on each side of the double bond.\n*   **Reagents and Transformation:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The mechanism involves protonation of the epoxide oxygen, followed by a backside (Sₙ2-like) attack by a water molecule on one of the epoxide carbons. This attack is an *anti*-addition relative to the epoxide oxygen.\n*   **Overall Stereochemistry:** The two-step sequence of *syn*-epoxidation followed by *anti*-ring opening results in a net *anti*-dihydroxylation of the original alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** There is a well-established stereochemical rule for additions to alkenes: an *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a *meso* compound. A meso compound is an achiral compound that has stereocenters.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The reaction produces a single product, **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene, which is also symmetrical.\n*   **Reagents and Transformation:** The reaction sequence is the same as in Reaction 1, resulting in a net *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The stereochemical rule for an *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene is that it produces a *racemic mixture* of enantiomers.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The products are **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. These two molecules are enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images) and are produced in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture therefore contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the stereochemical relationships between these three compounds:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their bulk physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties (e.g., polarity, boiling point, solubility) in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by a standard, achiral HPLC column. The enantiomeric pair, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, will elute at the same time and appear as a **single peak**.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and are, in principle, separable by standard chromatography. The meso-diol is a diastereomer of the other two compounds and will have a different retention time, appearing as a **separate peak**.\n    *   **Conclusion for standard HPLC:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, and one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair).\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment inside the column.\n    *   This chiral environment allows for the separation of **enantiomers**. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, leading to different retention times. They will be resolved into **two distinct peaks**.\n    *   The **meso-diol**, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated and will appear as its own peak.\n    *   **Conclusion for chiral HPLC:** The chromatogram will resolve all three stereoisomers. There will be one peak for the meso-diol, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer, for a total of **3 peaks**.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Standard HPLC: 2 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene.

The nucleophile (water) attacks the protonated epoxide in an *anti*-fashion (from the side opposite the epoxide C-O bond).\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step sequence (syn-epoxidation followed by anti-opening) results in the net *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene. The two hydroxyl (-OH) groups are added across the double bond, and they are anti to each other.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** There is a well-known stereochemical rule for addition reactions: **T**rans-**A**lkene + **A**nti-addition → **M**eso compound.\n    *   Let's verify this: The *trans*-alkene reacts via *syn*-epoxidation to form a racemic mixture of the *trans*-epoxide ((4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n    *   The subsequent *anti*-attack of water on either enantiomer of the epoxide leads to the same single product: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.

Attack at one carbon produces the (4R,5R)-diol, and attack at the other produces the (4S,5S)-diol.\n    *   Since the starting materials and reagents are all achiral, the chiral products must be formed in equal amounts.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationships between these isomers:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   The meso-(4R,5S) diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) diol and the (4S,5S) diol (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.

This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions and the resulting chromatograms.\n\n### Reaction Analysis\n\n**Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of an alkene with a peroxyacid like mCPBA is a stereospecific *syn*-addition, meaning the stereochemistry of the starting alkene is preserved in the epoxide product. (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene. Epoxidation of a *trans*-alkene results in a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is achiral, the epoxidation occurs from either face of the double bond at equal rates, producing a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** The treatment of an epoxide with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) opens the ring to form a 1,2-diol (a glycol). This ring-opening is an Sₙ2-like process that occurs with *anti*-addition, meaning the incoming nucleophile (water) attacks from the side opposite to the epoxide oxygen.\n    *   The *anti*-addition to the (4R,5R)-epoxide enantiomer yields (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The *anti*-addition to the (4S,5S)-epoxide enantiomer yields (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 1.** The two products, (4R,5S)- and (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol, are actually the same achiral molecule due to a center of symmetry. This type of achiral diastereomer is called a **meso compound**. Therefore, Reaction 1 produces a single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The *syn*-addition of the epoxide to the *cis*-alkene, (Z)-oct-4-ene, produces the *cis*-epoxide. This product, cis-4,5-epoxyoctane, has a plane of symmetry and is therefore an achiral meso compound.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** The *anti*-addition of water to the achiral *meso*-epoxide can occur by attacking either of the two epoxide carbons. These two carbons are enantiotopic.\n    *   Attack at one carbon produces (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon produces (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 2.** Since attack at either carbon is equally probable, the reaction produces a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers. This is known as a **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe final mixture, which is a combination of the products from both reactions, contains three stereoisomers:\n*   **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n*   **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n*   **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is as follows:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   The meso isomer is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\nThe combined product mixture is then analyzed by two types of High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated by standard HPLC. Therefore, the meso-diol will be separated from the other two isomers.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and thus cannot be separated. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Observation:** The chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard HPLC chromatogram.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment.\n    *   This chiral environment allows for the separation of enantiomers because they form transient diastereomeric complexes with the stationary phase, leading to different retention times.\n    *   Chiral HPLC can also separate diastereomers.\n    *   Therefore, all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved.\n    *   **Observation:** The chemist will observe **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis predicts 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe analysis of the reaction products and their behavior in different chromatographic systems is as follows:\n\n### Reaction Analysis\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** The treatment of (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene) with mCPBA results in a syn-epoxidation, forming a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. The subsequent acid-catalyzed ring-opening of this epoxide by water is an anti-addition. This sequence of syn-epoxidation followed by anti-ring-opening on a trans-alkene results in the formation of a single meso compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n*   **Reaction 2:** The treatment of (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene) with mCPBA also proceeds via syn-epoxidation, yielding the meso epoxide, (Z)-4,5-epoxyoctane. The subsequent acid-catalyzed anti-ring-opening of this meso epoxide produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,4R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Product Mixture\n\nThe combined product mixture from both reactions contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (a meso compound from Reaction 1)\n2.  (4R,4R)-octane-4,5-diol (an enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (an enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is that the meso compound is a diastereomer to the two enantiomers. The (4R,4R) and (4S,5S) isomers are an enantiomeric pair.\n\n### Chromatographic Separation\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. Enantiomers, however, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will therefore elute together, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   The meso-diol and the enantiomeric pair of diols are diastereomers and will be separated.\n    *   The two enantiomers will co-elute.\n    *   Consequently, the chromatogram will show **two peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This method utilizes a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation. It can also separate diastereomers.\n    *   The meso compound will produce one peak.\n    *   The two enantiomers, (4R,4R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, will be resolved from each other, each producing a separate peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will display a total of **three peaks**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The treatment of an alkene with mCPBA results in a syn-addition of an oxygen atom to the double bond, forming an epoxide. The epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene) is stereospecific and produces a racemic mixture of the trans-epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** The opening of an epoxide ring with aqueous acid is an anti-addition. Water attacks the protonated epoxide from the side opposite the oxygen bridge.\n    *   The hydrolysis of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane results in (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The hydrolysis of (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane also results in (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    These two products are the same meso compound, which has a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the sole product of Reaction 1 is the meso-diol.\n\n### Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The epoxidation of (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene) is also a stereospecific syn-addition. This reaction forms the cis-epoxide, (Z)-4,5-epoxyoctane, which is a meso compound because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** The subsequent anti-addition of water to the meso-epoxide opens the ring.\n    *   Attack at one carbon of the epoxide results in (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon results in (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    Since the starting material is achiral and the attacks are equally probable, a racemic mixture of the two enantiomers, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, is formed.\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions, resulting in a mixture containing three stereoisomers:\n*   **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the meso compound from Reaction 1)\n*   **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n*   **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is that the meso compound is a diastereomer to both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers.\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated.

This is a trans-alkene. It is symmetrical, with a propyl group on each side of the double bond.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA:** This reagent performs epoxidation. The addition of the oxygen atom is a **syn-addition**, meaning it adds to the same face of the double bond. For a trans-alkene, syn-addition results in a racemic mixture of trans-epoxides. In this case, (E)-oct-4-ene will form a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This causes the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The nucleophile (water) attacks one of the epoxide carbons in an Sₙ2 fashion, leading to **anti-addition** of the two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the original double bond.\n*   **Overall Stereochemistry of Reaction 1:** The two-step sequence (epoxidation followed by acid hydrolysis) is equivalent to an **anti-dihydroxylation** of the alkene.\n    *   The rule for stereospecific reactions on symmetrical alkenes is: **(E)-alkene + anti-addition → meso compound.**\n    *   Therefore, the product of Reaction 1 is a single, achiral compound: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. This compound has two chiral centers (C4 and C5) but is achiral due to a center of inversion. Let's call this **Product M**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (Z)-oct-4-ene.

This reaction is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond. Starting with (E)-oct-4-ene (a *trans*-alkene), this results in a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting material is symmetrical, the product is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening.** The epoxide is then treated with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This is a ring-opening reaction where water acts as a nucleophile. The mechanism proceeds via *anti*-addition, meaning the water attacks from the side opposite to the epoxide oxygen.\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome.** The overall two-step process is equivalent to an *anti*-dihydroxylation of the starting alkene. An *anti*-dihydroxylation of a *trans*-alkene results in a single *meso* compound. In this case, the product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, which has a plane of symmetry and is achiral.\n\n*   **Product of Reaction 1: One meso diol.**\n\n### Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The *syn*-addition of mCPBA to (Z)-oct-4-ene (a *cis*-alkene) produces a *cis*-epoxide. Because the starting alkene is symmetrical, the resulting *cis*-4,5-epoxyoctane is a *meso* compound (it has an internal plane of symmetry).\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed ring-opening.** The *meso*-epoxide then undergoes *anti*-addition of water.\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome.** An *anti*-dihydroxylation of a *cis*-alkene produces a racemic mixture of enantiomers. The attack of water on the *meso*-epoxide results in a 50:50 mixture of (4R,4R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n*   **Product of Reaction 2: A racemic mixture of two enantiomeric diols.**\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the single *meso* diol from Reaction 1 with the racemic mixture of two enantiomers from Reaction 2. The final mixture therefore contains three distinct chemical compounds (stereoisomers):\n*   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (*meso* compound)\n*   (4R,4R)-octane-4,5-diol (enantiomer A)\n*   (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (enantiomer B)\n\nThe *meso* compound is a diastereomer of both enantiomer A and enantiomer B.\n\n### Chromatographic Observation\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   Standard HPLC columns use an achiral stationary phase. Such columns can separate compounds with different physical properties, like diastereomers.\n    *   However, enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated. They will elute at the same time.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **two peaks**:\n        *   **Peak 1:** The *meso*-diol.\n        *   **Peak 2:** The co-eluting enantiomers (racemic mixture).\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC columns use a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment.\n    *   This allows the column to distinguish between enantiomers, as they will interact differently with the stationary phase, leading to different retention times.\n    *   A chiral column can also separate diastereomers.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will resolve all three stereoisomers in the mixture, showing **three peaks**:\n        *   **Peak 1:** The *meso*-diol.\n        *   **Peak 2:** One enantiomer (e.g., (4R,4R)-diol).\n        *   **Peak 3:** The other enantiomer (e.g., (4S,5S)-diol).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** The core of the problem is to determine the number and types of stereoisomers produced from two separate reactions and then figure out how these isomers will behave when analyzed by two different types of HPLC (achiral and chiral).\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. The \"(E)\" designation means it's a trans-alkene. It's symmetric, so it's an achiral molecule.\n    *   **Reagents:**\n        1.  mCPBA: This reagent performs epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n        2.  Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺): This reagent catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. This ring-opening is an *anti*-addition (the incoming nucleophile, water, attacks from the side opposite the protonated epoxide oxygen).\n    *   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step sequence (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) results in an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n    *   **Stereochemical Outcome:** There's a well-known rule for stereospecific reactions:\n        *   `trans-alkene` + `anti-addition` -> `meso product`\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The product is a single compound, meso-octane-4,5-diol. Let's call this compound **M**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. The \"(Z)\" designation means it's a cis-alkene. It's also symmetric and achiral.\n    *   **Reagents:** Same as Reaction 1 (mCPBA, then H₃O⁺).\n    *   **Overall Transformation:** This is also an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   **Stereochemical Outcome:** We apply the other part of the rule:\n        *   `cis-alkene` + `anti-addition` -> `racemic mixture` (a 50:50 mixture of two enantiomers).\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The products are a pair of enantiomers: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Let's call them **E1** and **E2**.\n\n4.  **Combine the Products:** The chemist mixes the results of both reactions. The final mixture contains:\n    *   **M** (meso-octane-4,5-diol) from Reaction 1.\n    *   **E1** and **E2** (the enantiomeric pair) from Reaction 2.\n    *   Total distinct molecules in the flask: 3.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Chromatography:**\n    *   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:**\n        *   **Principle:** An achiral column separates compounds based on properties like polarity, size, etc. It *cannot* distinguish between enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. However, it *can* separate diastereomers, which have different physical properties.\n        *   **Application:**\n            *   **E1** and **E2** are enantiomers. They will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n            *   **M** is a diastereomer of both **E1** and **E2**. It has different physical properties and will be separated from them, resulting in a distinct peak.\n        *   **Result:** Peak 1 (for **M**) + Peak 2 (for **E1** + **E2**) = **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Chiral HPLC:**\n        *   **Principle:** A chiral column has a chiral stationary phase. This chiral environment interacts differently with each enantiomer of a pair, allowing them to be separated. It will also separate diastereomers.\n        *   **Application:**\n            *   **E1** and **E2** are enantiomers. The chiral column will resolve them into two separate peaks.\n            *   **M** is a diastereomer of **E1** and **E2**, and it will also have its own unique retention time, resulting in a third peak. (Note: Since **M** is achiral, it cannot be resolved further, it's just one peak).\n        *   **Result:** Peak 1 (for **M**) + Peak 2 (for **E1**) + Peak 3 (for **E2**) = **3 peaks**.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion & Matching:**\n    *   Standard HPLC: 2 peaks\n    *   Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks\n    *   This matches option D.\n\n7.  **Construct the Python Code:** The code will not execute a chemical simulation but will use `print` statements to lay out the logical steps derived above, leading to the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Helper function to print the thinking process\ndef explain_reasoning():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the step-by-step reasoning to solve the stereochemistry problem.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Thinking Process:\")\n    print(\"1.

This overall sequence results in the **anti-dihydroxylation** of the starting alkene.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Addition:** The key is to correctly determine the stereochemistry of the products resulting from an *anti*-addition to both a *cis* ((Z)) and a *trans* ((E)) alkene.\n*   **Symmetry of Molecules:** Both the starting alkenes (oct-4-ene) and the final products (octane-4,5-diol) are symmetrically substituted (a propyl group on each side of the central functional group). This symmetry is crucial for determining whether meso compounds are possible.\n*   **Product Identification:** We need to identify all unique stereoisomers formed in the two reactions.\n*   **Chromatography Principles:** It's essential to understand the difference between standard (achiral) and chiral HPLC.\n    *   **Standard HPLC** separates compounds based on differences in physical properties (like polarity). It can separate diastereomers, but it cannot separate enantiomers. Enantiomers will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Chiral HPLC** uses a chiral stationary phase and can separate enantiomers, as well as diastereomers.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene.\n*   **Reaction:** Anti-dihydroxylation (mCPBA, then H3O+).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The rule for a symmetrically substituted alkene is: **trans-alkene + anti-addition → meso compound**.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The reaction produces a single product, the meso stereoisomer of octane-4,5-diol. This compound is achiral and has the configuration (4R, 5S), which is identical to (4S, 5R). Let's call this compound **Meso-Diol**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene.\n*   **Reaction:** Anti-dihydroxylation (mCPBA, then H3O+).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The rule for a symmetrically substituted alkene is: **cis-alkene + anti-addition → racemic mixture**.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The reaction produces a 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers: (4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Let's call these enantiomers **(R,R)-Diol** and **(S,S)-Diol**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\n*   The chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n    1.  **Meso-Diol** (from Reaction 1)\n    2.  **(R,R)-Diol** (from Reaction 2)\n    3.  **(S,S)-Diol** (from Reaction 2)\n*   **Stereochemical Relationships:**\n    *   **(R,R)-Diol** and **(S,S)-Diol** are a pair of **enantiomers**.\n    *   **Meso-Diol** is a **diastereomer** of both **(R,R)-Diol** and **(S,S)-Diol**.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the Chromatogram on the Standard (Achiral) HPLC Column**\n\n*   An achiral HPLC column separates diastereomers but not enantiomers.\n*   The **Meso-Diol** is a diastereomer of the other two compounds, so it will have a unique retention time and produce one peak.\n*   The enantiomers, **(R,R)-Diol** and **(S,S)-Diol**, are inseparable on an achiral column and will co-elute, producing a second single peak.\n*   **Total Peaks on Standard HPLC: 2**\n\n**Step 5: Predict the Chromatogram on the Chiral HPLC Column**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column can separate both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   The three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will all interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n*   The **Meso-Diol** will produce one peak.\n*   The **(R,R)-Diol** will produce a second, separate peak.\n*   The **(S,S)-Diol** will produce a third, separate peak.\n*   **Total Peaks on Chiral HPLC: 3**\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard HPLC chromatogram and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. The molecule is symmetric.\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process:\n    1.  Treatment with mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid) results in epoxidation. This is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    2.  Treatment with aqueous acid (H3O+) causes acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. This occurs via a backside attack by a water molecule, which is an *anti*-addition.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The combination of these two steps (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene, meaning two hydroxyl (-OH) groups are added to the opposite faces of the original double bond.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** There is a well-established rule for the stereochemistry of anti-additions to alkenes: a *trans*-alkene undergoing an *anti*-addition results in a *meso* product (if the substituents on the alkene are identical, which they are here - both are propyl groups). A useful mnemonic for this is **TAM: Trans-Anti-Meso**.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The product is meso-octane-4,5-diol. A meso compound is achiral and has stereocenters, typically with an (R,S) or (S,R) configuration that are the same molecule due to internal symmetry.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. This molecule is also symmetric.\n*   **Reagents:** The reagents are the same as in Reaction 1, so the overall transformation is also *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The stereochemical rule for anti-addition to a *cis*-alkene is that it produces a *racemic mixture* of enantiomers. A useful mnemonic for this is **CAR: Cis-Anti-Racemic**.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The product is a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other (enantiomers).\n\n**Step 3: Characterize the Final Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct chemical species (stereoisomers):\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is important:\n*   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the Chromatogram for Standard (Achiral) HPLC**\n\n*   Standard HPLC columns are achiral. They separate compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity, size, and boiling point.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties (in an achiral environment) and therefore cannot be separated by an achiral column. They will elute at the same time and appear as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated by an achiral column. They will elute at different times and appear as separate peaks.\n*   In our mixture, the enantiomeric pair ((4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol) will produce **one peak**. The meso-diol is a diastereomer to them and will produce a **second peak**.\n*   **Conclusion for standard HPLC: 2 peaks.**\n\n**Step 5: Predict the Chromatogram for Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC columns have a chiral stationary phase. This allows the column to interact differently with each enantiomer of a chiral compound.\n*   Chiral HPLC can separate **both diastereomers and enantiomers**.\n*   Each of the three stereoisomers in the mixture will have a unique interaction with the chiral stationary phase and will elute at a different time.\n*   Therefore, (4R,5R)-diol will be one peak, (4S,5S)-diol will be a second peak, and meso-octane-4,5-diol will be a third peak.\n*   **Conclusion for chiral HPLC: 3 peaks.**\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe analysis shows that the combined product mixture will exhibit **2 peaks** on a standard (achiral) HPLC column and **3 peaks** on a chiral HPLC column. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reactions**\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n    *   **Step 1 (Epoxidation):** The reaction of a trans-alkene like (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid) is a stereospecific *syn*-addition, which forms a trans-epoxide. Because the alkene is symmetrical, the mCPBA can attack from either face of the double bond, resulting in a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides, ((4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n    *   **Step 2 (Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening):** The subsequent treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) opens the epoxide ring via an *anti*-addition mechanism. The opening of this racemic mixture of trans-epoxides results in the formation of a single, achiral meso compound: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n    *   **Step 1 (Epoxidation):** The reaction of a cis-alkene like (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA is also a *syn*-addition. This stereospecific reaction produces a single, achiral meso-epoxide (cis-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n    *   **Step 2 (Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening):** The acid-catalyzed *anti*-addition of water to this meso-epoxide opens the ring. Because the nucleophilic attack can occur with equal probability at either of the two epoxide carbons, this step produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Composition of the Final Product Mixture**\n\nAfter combining the products of both reactions, the final mixture contains three distinct compounds:\n1.  **Meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1).\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2).\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2).\n\nThe (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are enantiomers of each other. The meso-diol is a diastereomer of the other two compounds.\n\n### **Chromatographic Analysis**\n\nThe combined product mixture is analyzed using two different HPLC techniques.\n\n*   **Standard (Achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. Therefore, the meso-diol will be separated from the other two compounds.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated by a standard HPLC column. Consequently, the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP) to create a chiral environment inside the column.\n    *   This chiral environment allows for the separation of enantiomers because they form transient diastereomeric complexes with the CSP that have different stabilities. Therefore, the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n    *   The meso-compound, being a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, will also have a different retention time and will elute as a distinct, third peak.\n    *   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions and the subsequent chromatographic separation.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reactions**\n\nThe overall reaction sequence involves the epoxidation of an alkene with mCPBA, followed by acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide with water. This two-step process results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the starting alkene, meaning the two hydroxyl (-OH) groups are added to opposite faces of the original double bond. The stereochemical outcome depends on the stereochemistry of the starting alkene.\n\n**Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene)**\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** The reaction of (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to both carbons of the double bond from the same face. Since the starting alkene is achiral, the attack can occur from the top or bottom face with equal probability, producing a racemic mixture of trans-epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Acid-catalyzed Hydrolysis:** The subsequent ring-opening by water is an *anti*-attack.\n    *   Attack on the (4R,5R)-epoxide leads to the formation of (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack on the (4S,5S)-epoxide also leads to the formation of (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    This product has two stereocenters but possesses a plane of symmetry, making it a **meso compound**.\n\nA general rule for stereochemistry is that an *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene yields a meso product. Therefore, Reaction 1 produces a single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene)**\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** The *syn*-addition of mCPBA to the *cis*-alkene produces a single *cis*-epoxide ((4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane), which is a meso compound.\n2.  **Acid-catalyzed Hydrolysis:** The *anti*-attack of water on this meso-epoxide opens the ring.\n    *   Attack at one carbon center results in the (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol enantiomer.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon center results in the (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol enantiomer.\n    Since both attacks are equally likely, the reaction produces a **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\nA general rule for stereochemistry is that an *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene yields a racemic mixture. Therefore, Reaction 2 produces two products that are enantiomers of each other.\n\n### **Analysis of the Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe meso compound is a diastereomer of the two enantiomers.\n\n### **Chromatographic Analysis**\n\n**1. Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n*   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   Diastereomers (like the meso compound and the enantiomers) have different physical properties and will be separated, eluting at different times.\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated. They will co-elute, appearing as a single peak.\n*   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **two peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair.\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC:**\n*   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n*   It can separate all three stereoisomers in the mixture because the meso compound is a diastereomer of the other two, and the chiral column will resolve the two enantiomers from each other.\n*   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **three distinct peaks**: one for the meso compound, one for the (4R,5R) enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S) enantiomer.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nTo determine the final composition of the product mixture, we must analyze the stereochemical outcome of each reaction. The overall reaction in both cases is an anti-dihydroxylation, which proceeds via a two-step mechanism: 1) syn-epoxidation with mCPBA, and 2) anti-addition of water via acid-catalyzed ring-opening. The stereochemistry of the final diol product depends on the stereochemistry of the starting alkene.\n\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\n*   **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene)**\n    The rule for anti-dihydroxylation of a symmetrical trans-alkene is that it yields a meso compound.\n    *   **Step 1 (Epoxidation):** (E)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA in a syn-addition to form a racemic mixture of the trans-epoxides, (4R,5S)-epoxyoctane and (4S,5R)-epoxyoctane.\n    *   **Step 2 (Hydrolysis):** The acid-catalyzed ring-opening of this racemic epoxide mixture proceeds via backside attack (anti-addition) of water. This specific sequence (anti-addition on a trans-alkene) results in the formation of a single, achiral meso compound: **meso-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene)**\n    The rule for anti-dihydroxylation of a symmetrical cis-alkene is that it yields a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   **Step 1 (Epoxidation):** (Z)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA in a syn-addition to form the achiral meso-epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   **Step 2 (Hydrolysis):** The acid-catalyzed ring-opening involves a backside attack by water. This sequence (anti-addition on a cis-alkene) produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### Composition of the Final Mixture\n\nAfter combining the products of both reactions, the final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomeric compounds:\n1.  **meso-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe meso-compound is a diastereomer to each of the two enantiomers. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) compounds are an enantiomeric pair.\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\nThe chemist analyzes this three-component mixture using two different HPLC techniques.\n\n*   **Standard (Achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    This technique separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. The meso-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have a different retention time.\n    *   Consequently, the standard HPLC chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso-compound and one for the racemic pair.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    This technique uses a chiral stationary phase to differentiate between enantiomers.\n    *   The chiral column can resolve the enantiomeric pair, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, into two separate peaks.\n    *   The meso-compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated and appear as a distinct peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **3 peaks**: one for the meso-compound, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis predicts 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the outcome of the reactions and the subsequent HPLC analysis.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. The molecule is symmetrical about the double bond, with a propyl group (CH3CH2CH2-) and a hydrogen atom attached to each carbon of the double bond.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction on the alkene. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to both carbons of the double bond from the same face. For a trans-alkene, this results in a trans-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is achiral, the attack of mCPBA can occur from the top face or the bottom face with equal probability, producing a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H3O+):** This reagent causes the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The mechanism involves the protonation of the epoxide oxygen, followed by a backside (SN2-type) attack by a water molecule on one of the carbons of the epoxide. This backside attack results in an *anti*-dihydroxylation relative to the original alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The overall reaction is an *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene. There is a well-established stereochemical rule: the *anti*-addition to a **trans-alkene** (like (E)-oct-4-ene) results in a **meso** compound (if the alkene is symmetric).\n    *   The product of Reaction 1 is the meso compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. This is a single, achiral compound despite having two stereocenters.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene, also symmetrical.\n*   **Reagents:** The same as in Reaction 1 (mCPBA, followed by H3O+).\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The overall reaction is again an *anti*-dihydroxylation. The stereochemical rule for this case is: the *anti*-addition to a **cis-alkene** (like (Z)-oct-4-ene) results in a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers (if the alkene is symmetric).\n    *   The products of Reaction 2 are (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other (enantiomers) and are formed in equal amounts.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the meso compound, let's call it **M**)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (one enantiomer from the racemic pair, let's call it **E1**)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the other enantiomer, let's call it **E2**)\n\nLet's examine the relationship between these isomers:\n*   **E1** and **E2** are enantiomers.\n*   **M** is a diastereomer of **E1**.\n*   **M** is also a diastereomer of **E2**.\n\n### Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms\n\n**1. Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n*   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** (like E1 and E2) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore **cannot be separated**. They will elute at the same time and appear as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** (like M and E1, or M and E2) have different physical properties and **can be separated**.\n*   Therefore, the chromatogram will show two peaks:\n    *   **Peak 1:** The meso compound (M).\n    *   **Peak 2:** The co-eluting enantiomers (E1 + E2).\n*   **Result: 2 peaks.**\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC:**\n*   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment.\n*   In a chiral environment, enantiomers interact differently with the stationary phase and thus **can be separated**.\n*   Since all three compounds in the mixture (M, E1, and E2) are stereoisomers, they will all interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n    *   The meso compound (M) will have its own unique retention time.\n    *   The enantiomer E1 will have a different retention time.\n    *   The enantiomer E2 will have a retention time different from both M and E1.\n*   Therefore, the chromatogram will show three distinct peaks, one for each stereoisomer.\n*   **Result: 3 peaks.**\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Standard (achiral) HPLC will show **2 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **3 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\nLet me re-evaluate my step-by-step thinking.\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene (trans) + anti-addition -> meso product. Correct. One compound.\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene (cis) + anti-addition -> racemic product. Correct. Two enantiomers.\nMixture: One meso compound + one racemic pair (two enantiomers). Total of three stereoisomers. Correct.\nStandard HPLC: Separates diastereomers, not enantiomers. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. The two enantiomers are not separated from each other. So, one peak for the meso compound and one peak for the racemic pair. Total = 2 peaks. Correct.\nChiral HPLC: Separates all stereoisomers, including enantiomers. The three different stereoisomers (meso, R,R, and S,S) will all be resolved. Total = 3 peaks. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC. This matches option C.\n\nLet's check the options again.\nA) 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\nB) 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC\nC) 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC\nD) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\n\nMy conclusion matches C. My previous text saying \"This corresponds to option B\" was a typo.\n\nFinal check of the reasoning.\n- Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA -> (rac)-trans-epoxide. Then H3O+ opens the epoxide via anti-attack. Trans-epoxide + anti-attack gives the meso-diol. Correct.\n- Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA -> meso-cis-epoxide. Then H3O+ opens the epoxide via anti-attack. Cis-epoxide + anti-attack gives the racemic-diol. Correct.\n- Mixture: (meso-diol) + (racemic-diol).\n- Standard HPLC of (meso-diol) + (racemic-diol): 2 peaks. Correct.\n- Chiral HPLC of (meso-diol) + (racemic-diol): 3 peaks. Correct.\n\nThe reasoning is solid. The answer is 2 peaks (standard) and 3 peaks (chiral).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is achiral.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs epoxidation on the alkene. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reagent performs acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. This is an *anti*-addition, meaning the nucleophile (H₂O) attacks from the side opposite to the epoxide oxygen, resulting in an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** A general rule in stereochemistry is that an *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a *meso* compound.\n    *   **Detailed Path:**\n        1.  The epoxidation of the achiral (E)-alkene with the achiral mCPBA can occur from either face of the double bond with equal probability. This produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric *trans*-epoxides: (4R,5R)-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-epoxyoctane.\n        2.  The acid-catalyzed opening of an epoxide involves a backside attack by water.\n        3.  When (4R,5R)-epoxyoctane is opened by water, the attack at C4 inverts its configuration to S, yielding (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. Attack at C5 would yield (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These are the same molecule.\n        4.  When (4S,5S)-epoxyoctane is opened, it also yields (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        5.  The molecule (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol has a center of inversion (in its anti-periplanar conformation) and is therefore a *meso* compound. It is achiral.\n\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single compound, **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** The same as in Reaction 1 (mCPBA, then H₃O⁺), leading to an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** A general rule is that an *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene results in a *racemic mixture* of enantiomers.\n    *   **Detailed Path:**\n        1.  Epoxidation of the (Z)-alkene is a *syn*-addition, which produces a *cis*-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is symmetrical, the resulting epoxide, (4R,5S)-epoxyoctane, is a *meso* compound (it has a plane of symmetry).\n        2.  The acid-catalyzed opening of this meso-epoxide involves a backside attack by water.\n        3.  Attack at C4 (which is R) inverts the configuration to S, yielding **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        4.  Attack at C5 (which is S) inverts the configuration to R, yielding **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        5.  These two products, (4S,5S)- and (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol, are enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images). Since the starting materials and reagents are all achiral, the two enantiomers must be formed in equal amounts.\n\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is:\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n*   The (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers** of each other.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\nThe mixture of these three compounds is analyzed by two types of HPLC.\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   This type of chromatography separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will interact differently with the stationary and mobile phases. Therefore, they can be separated. The meso-diol will be separated from the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will not be separated by an achiral column. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols will elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The achiral HPLC will show **two peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This type of chromatography uses a chiral stationary phase, which allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   The chiral stationary phase interacts differently with each of the three stereoisomers.\n    *   It will separate the meso-diol from the other two (as they are diastereomers).\n    *   It will also separate the two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, from each other.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The chiral HPLC will resolve all three stereoisomers, resulting in **three distinct peaks**.\n\n### **Final Answer Summary**\n\n*   **Standard HPLC:** 2 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nThis is an excellent problem that combines stereospecific reactions with the principles of chromatography. Let's break down the process step-by-step.\n\n### **Step-by-step Reasoning**\n\n**1. Analyze Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene. It is also symmetrically substituted.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The two-step process of epoxidation with mCPBA followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis (H₃O⁺) results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene. This means two -OH groups are added across the double bond, one from the top face and one from the bottom face.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** There is a fundamental rule for such additions: the *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene yields a *meso* compound (assuming the alkene is symmetric, which it is).\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The reaction produces a single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. This compound is achiral because it has a plane of symmetry, even though it contains two chiral centers (4R, 5S).\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene, also symmetrically substituted.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction is the same: *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The corresponding rule for a *cis*-alkene is that *anti*-addition yields a *racemic mixture* (a 1:1 mixture of enantiomers).\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The reaction produces a racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other (enantiomers).\n\n**3. Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationships between these are:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols.\n\n**4. Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity) but *cannot* distinguish between enantiomers.\n    *   Enantiomers (the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) pair) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute at the exact same time, appearing as a **single peak**.\n    *   Diastereomers (the meso-diol vs. the enantiomeric pair) have different physical properties and will be separated. The meso-diol will produce a **second, separate peak**.\n    *   **Result:** 2 peaks will be observed.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   The enantiomers ((4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol) will interact differently with the chiral column and will be resolved into **two separate peaks**.\n    *   The meso-diol is a diastereomer of the other two and will also have a unique interaction with the chiral column, eluting as a **third distinct peak**.\n    *   **Result:** 3 peaks will be observed.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe combined product mixture will show **2 peaks** on a standard HPLC column and **3 peaks** on a chiral HPLC column.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the stereochemical outcome of Reaction 1.**\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a trans-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process: 1. mCPBA, 2. aqueous acid (H3O+). This sequence achieves anti-dihydroxylation of the alkene, meaning two hydroxyl (-OH) groups are added across the double bond, one from the top face and one from the bottom face (anti-addition).\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-addition of two identical groups to a trans-alkene results in the formation of a meso compound. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** Therefore, the reaction of (E)-oct-4-ene yields a single product: meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the stereochemical outcome of Reaction 2.**\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a cis-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is the same anti-dihydroxylation sequence (mCPBA, then H3O+).\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-addition of two identical groups to a cis-alkene results in the formation of a racemic mixture of enantiomers. A racemic mixture contains equal amounts of two molecules that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** Therefore, the reaction of (Z)-oct-4-ene yields a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 3: Characterize the combined product mixture.**\n*   The chemist combines the product from Reaction 1 (the meso-diol) and the product from Reaction 2 (the racemic pair of (R,R)- and (S,S)-diols).\n*   The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n    1.  meso-octane-4,5-diol\n    2.  (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n    3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n*   The relationship between these isomers is important:\n    *   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are enantiomers.\n    *   The meso-diol is a diastereomer of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the outcome of the standard (achiral) HPLC analysis.**\n*   A standard HPLC column has an achiral stationary phase. This type of chromatography separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity and size.\n*   **Enantiomers**, like the (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diols, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated on a standard HPLC column and will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers**, like the meso-diol and the enantiomeric pair, have different physical properties. They will interact differently with the stationary phase and will be separated into distinct peaks.\n*   **Conclusion for Standard HPLC:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso-diol and one for the co-eluting racemic pair.\n\n**Step 5: Predict the outcome of the chiral HPLC analysis.**\n*   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase. This creates a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n*   The chiral stationary phase will interact differently with the (4R,5R)-diol and its mirror image, the (4S,5S)-diol, causing them to have different retention times. Thus, they will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n*   The meso-diol, being a diastereomer of the other two compounds, will also have a unique interaction with the chiral stationary phase and will elute as a separate peak.\n*   **Conclusion for Chiral HPLC:** The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**: one for the meso-diol, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n*   Standard (achiral) HPLC: 2 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions and the resulting chromatograms.\n\n### Reaction Analysis\n\n*   **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n    1.  **Epoxidation:** (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene) is treated with mCPBA. This is a syn-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond. This reaction is stereospecific, and the trans configuration of the starting material is maintained in the product. This results in the formation of a trans-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is achiral, the product is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening:** The epoxide ring is then opened by an aqueous acid. This is an anti-addition, where the water molecule attacks from the opposite side of the epoxide oxygen. The attack on either the (4R,5R) or (4S,5S) enantiomer results in the formation of the same single, achiral meso compound: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. This compound has two stereocenters but is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n    1.  **Epoxidation:** (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene) reacts with mCPBA. The syn-addition of oxygen results in a cis-epoxide. Because the starting alkene is symmetrical, this cis-epoxide is a meso compound (meso-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n    2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening:** The subsequent anti-addition of water opens the meso-epoxide. This process leads to the formation of a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Product Mixture\nThe final mixture that is analyzed contains the products from both reactions:\n1.  **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (a meso compound from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (an enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (an enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n\nThese three molecules are stereoisomers. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are enantiomers of each other. The meso diol is a diastereomer of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols.\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\n*   **Standard (Achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. The meso diol will have a different retention time than the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC will show **two peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This method uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The chiral column will be able to resolve the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers into two separate peaks.\n    *   The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the enantiomers, will also be separated and will appear as a distinct peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC will show **three peaks**.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms.\n\n### Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a trans-alkene. Its reaction with mCPBA is a syn-addition, which results in a trans-epoxide. Because the starting alkene is symmetric, the product is a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Acid-catalyzed ring-opening:** The subsequent treatment with aqueous acid opens the epoxide ring. This is an anti-addition, meaning the water molecule attacks from the side opposite the epoxide oxygen. This reaction proceeds with an inversion of stereochemistry at the carbon atom that is attacked.\n    *   The ring-opening of the (4R,5R)-epoxide results in (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The ring-opening of the (4S,5S)-epoxide also results in (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (which is identical to (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol).\n3.  **Product of Reaction 1:** The final product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, which is a single, achiral meso compound. This is because the anti-dihydroxylation of a symmetric trans-alkene yields a meso compound.\n\n### Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a cis-alkene. Its syn-addition reaction with mCPBA produces a cis-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is symmetric, the resulting cis-4,5-epoxyoctane is a meso compound.\n2.  **Acid-catalyzed ring-opening:** The acid-catalyzed ring-opening of this meso-epoxide is an anti-addition. The water molecule can attack either of the two carbons of the epoxide with equal probability.\n    *   Attack at one carbon leads to (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon leads to (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 2:** The products, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are a pair of enantiomers. Since they are formed in equal amounts, the product is a racemic mixture.\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the single meso compound from Reaction 1 with the racemic mixture of two enantiomers from Reaction 2. The final mixture therefore contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n*   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (a meso compound)\n*   (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (an enantiomer)\n*   (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (an enantiomer)\n\nThe meso compound and the enantiomers are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### Chromatographic Observation\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. Therefore, the meso-diol will be separated from the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will not be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Consequently, the chemist will observe **two peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the co-eluting pair of enantiomers.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:** This method uses a chiral stationary phase to separate enantiomers.\n    *   The chiral stationary phase interacts differently with the two enantiomers, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diol, allowing them to be separated into two distinct peaks.\n    *   The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also have a different retention time and will appear as a separate peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chemist will observe **three peaks**: one for the meso compound, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct observation is 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation.** The reaction of (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene) with mCPBA results in a *syn*-addition of the oxygen atom. This stereospecific reaction produces a trans-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is achiral, the product is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening.** The subsequent treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) opens the epoxide ring via an *anti*-addition mechanism. The nucleophile (water) attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the opposite face of the oxygen atom, causing an inversion of stereochemistry at the carbon being attacked.\n    *   Opening the (4R,5R)-epoxide leads to the (4S,5R)-diol.\n    *   Opening the (4S,5S)-epoxide leads to the (4R,5S)-diol.\n    *   Both (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol are the same achiral meso compound due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction 1 produces a single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation.** The reaction of (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene) with mCPBA involves a *syn*-addition of oxygen, which produces a cis-epoxide. This cis-epoxide has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a single meso compound: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening.** The acid-catalyzed opening of this meso-epoxide is an *anti*-addition.\n    *   Attack of water at one carbon (e.g., C4) results in the (4S,5S)-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other equivalent carbon (C5) results in the (4R,5R)-diol.\n    *   These two products, (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol and (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol, are enantiomers. Since the attack at either carbon is equally likely, they are formed in equal amounts.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction 2 produces a **racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n*   **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n*   **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n*   **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe meso-compound is a diastereomer of the two enantiomers.\n\n### **Chromatographic Observation**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   Standard HPLC columns separate compounds based on physical properties like polarity but cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will therefore elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated.\n    *   The chromatogram will show **two peaks**: one for the meso-compound and one for the co-eluting pair of enantiomers.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC columns contain a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The column will also separate the meso-compound from the enantiomers, as they are diastereomers.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **three distinct peaks**: one for the meso-compound, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a trans-alkene.\n*   **Reagents:** mCPBA followed by aqueous acid (H3O+). This two-step sequence results in the **anti-dihydroxylation** of the alkene, meaning two -OH groups are added across the double bond, one from the top face and one from the bottom face.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The anti-addition of two identical groups to a trans-alkene stereospecifically produces a **meso compound**.\n    *   Let's trace this:\n        1.  (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA → A racemic mixture of trans-epoxides ((4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n        2.  Acid-catalyzed ring-opening of either of these enantiomeric epoxides with water (an anti-attack) leads to the same single product: meso-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single compound, meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a cis-alkene.\n*   **Reagents:** mCPBA followed by aqueous acid (H3O+). This is also an **anti-dihydroxylation**.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The anti-addition of two identical groups to a cis-alkene stereospecifically produces a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.\n    *   Let's trace this:\n        1.  (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA → A single meso-epoxide ((4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n        2.  Acid-catalyzed ring-opening of this meso-epoxide with water (an anti-attack) results in two products. Attack at one carbon gives the (4R,5R)-diol, and attack at the other carbon gives the (4S,5S)-diol. Since both attacks are equally probable, a 50:50 mixture is formed.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different molecules (stereoisomers):\n1.  meso-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n2.  (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\nNow let's examine the relationships between these three isomers:\n*   The (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol (they are stereoisomers but not mirror images).\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This column separates compounds based on physical properties like polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore **cannot be separated**. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and **can be separated**. They will elute at different times, giving distinct peaks.\n    *   In our mixture, the enantiomeric pair ((4R,5R) and (4S,5S)-diols) will produce one peak. The meso-diol, being a diastereomer, will produce a second, separate peak.\n    *   **Result: 2 peaks.**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This column has a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment.\n    *   **Enantiomers** interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, forming temporary diastereomeric complexes of different stabilities. This allows them to be separated.\n    *   **Diastereomers** are also readily separated.\n    *   In our mixture, the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol will be separated into two distinct peaks. The meso-diol will be separated from both of them, producing a third peak.\n    *   **Result: 3 peaks.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks on the standard HPLC column and 3 peaks on the chiral HPLC column.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\n### Analysis of the Chromatograms\n\nThe chemist performs two reactions, combines the products, and analyzes the mixture using both standard and chiral High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). A detailed stereochemical analysis of each reaction is necessary to predict the resulting chromatograms.\n\n#### **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Starting Material**: (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene. It is symmetrical and achiral.\n2.  **Epoxidation with mCPBA**: The reaction of an alkene with a peroxy acid like mCPBA is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom to the double bond, forming an epoxide. The epoxidation of a *trans*-alkene results in a racemic mixture of *trans*-epoxides. In this case, (E)-oct-4-ene will yield a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-epoxyoctane.\n3.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening**: The subsequent treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) opens the epoxide ring. This is an *anti*-addition, where a water molecule attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite to the oxygen atom. This results in the formation of a 1,2-diol (a glycol).\n    *   The acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the (4R,5R)-epoxide enantiomer involves an SN2-like attack by water, causing an inversion of configuration at the attacked carbon. Attack at C4 produces (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol, and attack at C5 produces (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Both of these are the same *meso* compound.\n    *   Similarly, the hydrolysis of the (4S,5S)-epoxide also yields the same *meso* compound.\n4.  **Product of Reaction 1**: The final product is a single, achiral compound: *meso*-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\nA general rule for such two-step *anti*-dihydroxylation is that a *trans*-alkene yields a *meso*-diol.\n\n#### **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Starting Material**: (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene. It is also symmetrical and achiral.\n2.  **Epoxidation with mCPBA**: The *syn*-addition of oxygen to a *cis*-alkene produces a *meso*-epoxide. (Z)-oct-4-ene gives *meso*-(4R,5S)-epoxyoctane.\n3.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening**: The *anti*-addition of water to the *meso*-epoxide opens the ring to form a diol.\n    *   Attack at the C4 carbon of the *meso*-epoxide results in the (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the C5 carbon results in the (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n4.  **Product of Reaction 2**: Since attack at either carbon is equally probable, a 1:1 mixture of the two enantiomers is formed. This is a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\nA general rule for *anti*-dihydroxylation is that a *cis*-alkene yields a racemic mixture of diols.\n\n### **The Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n*   *Meso*-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n*   (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n*   (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe *meso* compound is a diastereomer of the two enantiomers.\n\n### **Chromatographic Analysis**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC**:\n    *   Standard HPLC columns separate compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity and size, but they cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will therefore elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and are separable on an achiral column.\n    *   Thus, the chemist will observe two peaks: one for the racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diols, and a separate peak for the diastereomeric *meso*-diol.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC**:\n    *   Chiral HPLC columns contain a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The enantiomers, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diol, will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n    *   The *meso* compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also be separated and will appear as a third distinct peak.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Standard HPLC**: **2 peaks** (one for the racemic pair, one for the *meso* compound).\n*   **Chiral HPLC**: **3 peaks** (one for each enantiomer and one for the *meso* compound).\n\nThis corresponds to the option predicting 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions and the resulting chromatographic separations.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reactant:** (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a symmetrical trans-alkene.\n    *   **Reagents:** First, mCPBA for epoxidation, then aqueous acid (H3O+) for epoxide opening. This two-step sequence results in an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The anti-addition of two hydroxyl groups to a *trans*-alkene results in the formation of a *meso* compound.\n    *   **Product 1:** meso-octane-4,5-diol. This is a single, achiral compound.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reactant:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a symmetrical cis-alkene.\n    *   **Reagents:** Same as Reaction 1, resulting in an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The anti-addition of two hydroxyl groups to a *cis*-alkene results in the formation of a *racemic mixture* (an equal mixture of two enantiomers).\n    *   **Product 2:** A racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n3.  **Combine the Products:**\n    *   The chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n        1.  meso-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n        2.  (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n        3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the other two. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) compounds are enantiomers of each other.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Standard (Achiral) HPLC Chromatogram:**\n    *   A standard HPLC column separates compounds based on physical properties like polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n    *   However, it can separate diastereomers, which have different physical properties.\n    *   Therefore, the two enantiomers ((4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol) will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   The meso-diol, being a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair, will have different properties and will elute at a different time, creating a second peak.\n    *   **Result:** 2 peaks are observed.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Chiral HPLC Chromatogram:**\n    *   A chiral HPLC column has a stationary phase that is itself chiral. This allows it to interact differently with each enantiomer, leading to their separation.\n    *   It will also separate diastereomers.\n    *   Therefore, all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved into separate peaks.\n    *   **Result:** 3 peaks are observed (one for the meso compound, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer).\n\n### Conclusion\nThe analysis shows there will be **2 peaks in standard HPLC** and **3 peaks in chiral HPLC**.

This molecule is achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step sequence: 1) mCPBA, followed by 2) aqueous acid (H3O+). This sequence results in the anti-dihydroxylation of the alkene, meaning two hydroxyl (-OH) groups are added across the double bond, one from the top face and one from the bottom face.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** There's a useful mnemonic for stereospecific reactions: **\"TAM\"** which stands for **T**rans + **A**nti -> **M**eso.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** According to this rule, the anti-dihydroxylation of a trans-alkene yields a meso compound. A meso compound is a single, achiral molecule that contains chiral centers. In this case, the product is meso-octane-4,5-diol. Let's call this compound **M**.

A racemic mixture contains equal amounts of two enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images). The products are (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Let's call these enantiomers **E1** and **E2**.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the Products and Analyze the Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **M**: meso-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **E1**: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **E2**: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\nNow let's determine the relationship between these three molecules:\n*   **E1** and **E2** are **enantiomers** of each other.\n*   **M** is a **diastereomer** of **E1**.\n*   **M** is also a **diastereomer** of **E2**.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the Chromatogram on a Standard (Achiral) HPLC Column**\n\nA standard, achiral HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers**, like E1 and E2, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by an achiral column. They will elute at the same time and appear as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers**, like M and the pair (E1, E2), have different physical properties. Therefore, they can be separated by an achiral column and will elute at different times.\n\nBased on this, the standard HPLC chromatogram will show:\n*   **Peak 1:** The meso compound (M).\n*   **Peak 2:** The co-eluting racemic mixture of enantiomers (E1 + E2).\n\nTotal peaks observed: **2**.\n\n**Step 5: Predict the Chromatogram on a Chiral HPLC Column**\n\nA chiral HPLC column has a stationary phase that is itself chiral. This allows it to interact differently with enantiomers, enabling their separation.\n*   **Enantiomers**, like E1 and E2, will form transient diastereomeric complexes with the chiral stationary phase. These complexes have different stabilities, causing E1 and E2 to elute at different times, resulting in two separate peaks.\n*   **Diastereomers**, like M and (E1, E2), are already separable on any column, including a chiral one.\n\nBased on this, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show three separate peaks for the three distinct molecules in the mixture:\n*   **Peak 1:** The meso compound (M).\n*   **Peak 2:** One enantiomer (e.g., E1).\n*   **Peak 3:** The other enantiomer (e.g., E2).\n\nTotal peaks observed: **3**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Step 1: Reaction with mCPBA.** m-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA) is a peroxyacid used for epoxidation. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to both carbons of the double bond from the same face.\n    *   The *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom to a *trans*-alkene results in a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides.\n    *   For (E)-oct-4-ene, this reaction produces (4R, 5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S, 5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane in a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n*   **Step 2: Reaction with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The mechanism involves the attack of a water molecule on the protonated epoxide. This attack occurs from the side opposite to the C-O bond, resulting in an *anti*-addition of the two hydroxyl (-OH) groups across the original double bond.\n*   **Overall Transformation for Reaction 1:** The two-step process (syn-epoxidation followed by anti-opening) is equivalent to an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n    *   We can use the mnemonic **TAM**: **T**rans-**A**lkene + **A**nti-addition = **M**eso compound.\n    *   Therefore, the product of Reaction 1 is the meso compound, (4R, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol. It is a single, achiral product.\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Step 1: Reaction with mCPBA.** Again, this is a *syn*-epoxidation.\n    *   The *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom to a *cis*-alkene results in a meso epoxide.\n    *   For (Z)-oct-4-ene, this reaction produces the single meso compound (4R, 5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n*   **Step 2: Reaction with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This is an *anti*-opening of the epoxide.\n*   **Overall Transformation for Reaction 2:** This is also an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   We can use the mnemonic **CAR**: **C**is-**A**lkene + **A**nti-addition = **R**acemic mixture.\n    *   The attack of water on the meso-epoxide can occur at either of the two carbons (C4 or C5) with equal probability, leading to the formation of two enantiomers.\n    *   Attack at C4 (with R configuration) leads to the (4S, 5S)-diol.\n    *   Attack at C5 (with S configuration) leads to the (4R, 5R)-diol.\n    *   Therefore, the product of Reaction 2 is a racemic mixture of (4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**3. Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three stereoisomers of octane-4,5-diol:\n*   **(4R, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the meso compound from Reaction 1)\n*   **(4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (one enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n*   **(4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the other enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationships between these isomers:\n*   The (4R, 5R) and (4S, 5S) isomers are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   The meso (4R, 5S) isomer is a **diastereomer** to both the (4R, 5R) isomer and the (4S, 5S) isomer (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n**4. Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by a standard HPLC column and will elute together as a single peak. The racemic mixture of (4R, 5R) and (4S, 5S) diols will produce one peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will be separated. The meso diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It will have a different retention time and elute as a separate peak.\n    *   **Conclusion for standard HPLC:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   A chiral column can separate all stereoisomers.\n    *   It will resolve the enantiomeric pair, (4R, 5R)-diol and (4S, 5S)-diol, into two distinct peaks.\n    *   It will also separate the meso diol from the other two isomers because it is a diastereomer.\n    *   **Conclusion for chiral HPLC:** The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**, one for each of the three stereoisomers in the mixture.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   Standard HPLC: 2 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, then H₃O⁺\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene. The reaction with mCPBA is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to one face of the double bond. This stereospecific reaction converts the *trans*-alkene into a *trans*-epoxide. Because the starting alkene is achiral, the mCPBA can attack from either the top or bottom face, producing an equal mixture of the two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane. This 50:50 mixture is called a racemic mixture.\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Hydrolysis:** The epoxide ring is then opened by adding aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This reaction proceeds via an *anti*-attack, where the water molecule (nucleophile) attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite the C-O bond.\n    *   The attack on the (4R,5R)-epoxide results in (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The attack on the (4S,5S)-epoxide also results in (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    This product, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a meso compound. A meso compound is achiral despite having chiral centers. Thus, Reaction 1 yields a single product: the meso-diol.\n\n### Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, then H₃O⁺\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene. The *syn*-addition of mCPBA converts the *cis*-alkene into a *cis*-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is symmetrical and achiral, this reaction produces a single meso compound: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Hydrolysis:** The *anti*-attack of water on the meso-epoxide leads to the formation of two different products.\n    *   Attack at one carbon inverts its stereocenter, leading to (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon leads to the other enantiomer, (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    Since the attack is equally likely at both carbons, the products of Reaction 2 are a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three stereoisomers of octane-4,5-diol:\n*   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (the meso compound from Reaction 1)\n*   (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n*   (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe meso compound is a diastereomer of the two enantiomers.\n\n### Chromatographic Observation\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity. Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. Enantiomers, however, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will therefore elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Peak 1:** The meso-diol, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   **Peak 2:** The co-eluting racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    Therefore, the standard HPLC chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment. This allows for the separation of enantiomers because they interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n    *   The meso compound will be separated from the enantiomers because it is a diastereomer.\n    *   The two enantiomers, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diol, will also be separated from each other.\n    Therefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **3 peaks**: one for the meso compound, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms.\n\n### Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, then H₃O⁺\n\nThis two-step process results in the **anti-dihydroxylation** of the alkene. The stereochemical rule for the anti-addition to a trans (E) alkene is that it forms a **meso** compound.\n\n1.  **(E)-oct-4-ene to epoxide:** The first step is the epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA. This is a syn-addition, creating a trans-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is symmetric, this reaction produces a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Epoxide to diol:** The acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide by water is an anti-addition. The attack of water on either epoxide enantiomer from the side opposite the epoxide ring leads to the formation of a single, achiral meso-compound: **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. This compound has a plane of symmetry and is therefore not optically active.\n\nSo, Reaction 1 yields one product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, then H₃O⁺\n\nThis is also an **anti-dihydroxylation**. The stereochemical rule for the anti-addition to a cis (Z) alkene is that it forms a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.\n\n1.  **(Z)-oct-4-ene to epoxide:** The epoxidation of (Z)-oct-4-ene is a syn-addition that forms a cis-epoxide. Because the starting alkene is symmetric, the resulting epoxide is a meso compound: (4R,5S)-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Epoxide to diol:** The acid-catalyzed anti-addition of water to the meso-epoxide results in the formation of a racemic mixture. Attack at one carbon gives (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol, and attack at the other gives (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These two products are enantiomers.\n\nSo, Reaction 2 yields a racemic mixture of two products: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe final mixture that is injected into the HPLC contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n*   **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n*   **A racemic pair of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe meso-diol is a diastereomer of both of the enantiomers from Reaction 2.\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\n**Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n*   Standard HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, like polarity.\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated; they will elute at the same time, producing a single peak.\n*   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n*   The racemic pair from Reaction 2 will elute together as **one peak**.\n*   The meso-diol from Reaction 1 is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair and will have a different retention time, eluting as a **separate peak**.\n*   Therefore, the standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC:**\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase to separate enantiomers. The enantiomers interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, leading to different retention times.\n*   It will also separate the diastereomers.\n*   The enantiomeric pair from Reaction 2, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diol, will be resolved into **two separate peaks**.\n*   The meso-compound from Reaction 1 is achiral. It will not be resolved into multiple peaks and will elute as a **single peak**.\n*   Therefore, the chiral HPLC will show a total of **3 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\n### Analysis of the Reactions and Products\n\nThe problem describes two sequential reactions starting from geometric isomers of oct-4-ene. Let's analyze each reaction step-by-step to determine the final products.\n\n**Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The starting material is (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a *trans*-alkene. The epoxidation of an alkene with a peroxy acid like mCPBA is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond. A *trans*-alkene undergoing *syn*-addition results in a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting material is achiral, the product will be a racemic mixture of the two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-diethyloxirane and (4S,5S)-4,5-diethyloxirane.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** The epoxide ring is then opened by treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This is an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, which occurs via an Sₙ2-like mechanism with *anti*-addition. The water molecule attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite to the C-O bond, causing an inversion of stereochemistry at the attacked carbon.\n    *   Opening of the (4R,5R)-epoxide results in (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Opening of the (4S,5S)-epoxide also results in (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (which is identical to (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol).\n    This product has two stereocenters but possesses a plane of symmetry, making it a single, achiral *meso* compound.\n\n**Product of Reaction 1:** (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (a *meso* compound).\n\n**Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The starting material is (Z)-oct-4-ene, a *cis*-alkene. *Syn*-addition to a *cis*-alkene produces a *cis*-epoxide. Since (Z)-oct-4-ene is a symmetrical *cis*-alkene, the resulting epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-diethyloxirane, is a *meso* compound.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** The *meso*-epoxide undergoes acid-catalyzed ring opening, which is an *anti*-addition.\n    *   Attack of water at one carbon (e.g., C4, which is R) inverts its configuration to S, leaving the other (C5, which is S) unchanged. This forms (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon (C5, which is S) inverts its configuration to R, leaving C4 as R. This forms (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    The two products, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are enantiomers. Since the reaction starts with achiral materials, they are formed in equal amounts, creating a racemic mixture.\n\n**Products of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis of the Combined Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the single *meso* product from Reaction 1 with the racemic mixture from Reaction 2. The final mixture therefore contains three stereoisomers:\n*   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (*meso*)\n*   (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (*enantiomer A*)\n*   (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (*enantiomer B*)\n\nThe relationship between the *meso* compound and each of the enantiomers is that of diastereomers.\n\n**1. Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\nThis technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers**, like (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers**, such as the *meso* compound and the enantiomeric pair, have different physical properties and will be separated by the column.\nTherefore, the standard HPLC chromatogram will show **two peaks**: one for the *meso* compound and a second for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair.\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC:**\nThis technique uses a chiral stationary phase that can differentiate between enantiomers.\n*   The enantiomers, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n*   The *meso* compound is a diastereomer of the other two and is achiral. It will also be separated from them and will appear as its own distinct peak.\nTherefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will resolve all three stereoisomers, resulting in **three peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Part 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** The starting material is (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule as it possesses a C2 axis of symmetry.\n    ```\n       CH3CH2CH2     H\n              \\   /\n               C=C\n              /   \\\n             H     CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n\n2.  **Reaction Sequence:** The reaction is a two-step process that results in anti-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n    *   **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** This is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond. The reaction of a *trans*-alkene via *syn*-addition on its two faces (top and bottom) produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric *trans*-epoxides. In this case, it yields a racemic mixture of (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis (H3O+).** This step opens the epoxide ring. The nucleophile (H₂O) attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite to the C-O bond (a backside attack). This is an *anti*-opening of the ring.\n\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** The overall reaction is an anti-dihydroxylation. The stereochemical rule for this reaction is:\n    *   **Trans-alkene + Anti-addition → Meso compound**\n\n    Therefore, the product of Reaction 1 is a single compound: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. A meso compound is achiral despite having chiral centers (in this case, (4R,5S) configuration).\n\n### **Part 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** The starting material is (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a *cis*-alkene. This molecule is also achiral (it has a plane of symmetry).\n    ```\n       CH3CH2CH2     CH2CH2CH3\n              \\       /\n               C=C\n              /   \\\n             H     H\n    ```\n\n2.  **Reaction Sequence:** This is the same anti-dihydroxylation sequence as in Reaction 1.\n\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** We apply the stereochemical rule for the anti-dihydroxylation of a *cis*-alkene:\n    *   **Cis-alkene + Anti-addition → Racemic mixture**\n\n    Therefore, the product of Reaction 2 is a racemic mixture (a 50:50 mixture of two enantiomers): **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Part 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationships between these compounds:\n*   Compound 1 is a meso compound (achiral).\n*   Compounds 2 and 3 are enantiomers (chiral molecules that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other).\n*   Compound 1 is a diastereomer of Compound 2 and Compound 3 (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n### **Part 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This type of chromatography separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties like polarity and size.\n    *   Enantiomers (like compounds 2 and 3) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated and will elute at the same time, appearing as a **single peak**.\n    *   Diastereomers (like compound 1 and the pair of 2/3) have different physical properties. Therefore, they will be separated and will elute at different times.\n    *   So, the chromatogram will show one peak for the meso compound (1) and another peak for the unresolved enantiomeric pair (2 + 3).\n    *   **Total peaks on standard HPLC = 2.**\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This type of chromatography uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment. This allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   Since the three compounds in the mixture are all distinct stereoisomers, they will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n    *   The meso compound (1) will be separated from the enantiomers (2 and 3).\n    *   The enantiomers (2 and 3) will also be separated from each other.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show three distinct peaks, one for each stereoisomer.\n    *   **Total peaks on chiral HPLC = 3.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. It is an achiral molecule as it possesses a C2 rotational axis of symmetry.\n*   **Reagent 1: mCPBA.** This reagent performs epoxidation, which is a syn-addition reaction (both C-O bonds are formed on the same face of the alkene double bond).\n    *   The reaction of mCPBA (an achiral reagent) with the achiral (E)-alkene can occur from two faces (top or bottom) with equal probability.\n    *   Attack on a trans-alkene yields a trans-epoxide.\n    *   Attack from the top face yields (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   Attack from the bottom face yields (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   These two products, (4R,5R) and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane, are enantiomers. Since they are formed in equal amounts, the product of this step is a racemic mixture of the two enantiomeric epoxides.\n*   **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This reagent causes the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The mechanism involves the nucleophilic attack of water on the protonated epoxide, which proceeds with inversion of stereochemistry at the attacked carbon (an Sₙ2-like, anti-addition process).\n    *   Let's consider the ring-opening of the (4R,5R)-epoxide. Water can attack either C4 or C5.\n        *   Attack at C5 results in inversion at C5 (R → S), while C4 remains R. The product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Attack at C4 results in inversion at C4 (R → S), while C5 remains R. The product is (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Now, let's analyze the product stereoisomers. (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol has an internal plane of symmetry (when rotated into the correct conformation), making it a *meso* compound. A meso compound is achiral despite having chiral centers. (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol is the same meso compound.\n    *   Similarly, the ring-opening of the other enantiomer, (4S,5S)-epoxide, will also exclusively yield the same meso-diol, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The sole product is the meso compound, **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is an achiral molecule as it possesses a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reagent 1: mCPBA.** The syn-addition epoxidation of a cis-alkene yields a cis-epoxide.\n    *   Because the starting (Z)-alkene is achiral and symmetrical, epoxidation from either the top or bottom face results in the same single product: the meso epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n*   **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This causes the anti-addition ring-opening of the meso-epoxide.\n    *   Let's consider the ring-opening of the meso (4R,5S)-epoxide. Water can attack either C4 or C5.\n        *   Attack at C5 results in inversion at C5 (S → R), while C4 remains R. The product is **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        *   Attack at C4 results in inversion at C4 (R → S), while C5 remains S. The product is **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n    *   The two products, (4R,5R) and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, meaning they are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since attack at C4 and C5 on the symmetrical protonated epoxide is equally probable, the products are formed in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The product is a **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the meso compound from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's examine the relationships between these isomers:\n*   (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso compound (4R,5S) is a **diastereomer** of both (4R,5R) and (4S,5S).\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This technique separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore **cannot be separated**. They will elute together as a single peak. So, the racemic mixture of (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols will produce one peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and **can be separated**. The meso diol is a diastereomer of the other two and will have a different retention time.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the pair of enantiomers.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   It can separate all stereoisomers with different spatial arrangements.\n    *   The three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture—(4R,5R)-diol, (4S,5S)-diol, and the meso (4R,5S)-diol—will all interact differently with the chiral column.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC will resolve all three compounds, showing **3 peaks**.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Standard HPLC: 2 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the outcome of the HPLC analyses.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene, which is an achiral molecule.\n2.  **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process:\n    *   **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** This is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond. A *trans*-alkene undergoing *syn*-addition results in a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting material is achiral, the chiral epoxide product, trans-4,5-epoxyoctane, is formed as a racemic mixture of (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers.\n    *   **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** The epoxide ring is opened by a backside (*anti*) attack of a water molecule. This step results in the inversion of stereochemistry at the site of attack.\n3.  **Overall Stereochemistry:** The overall transformation is an *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene. A reliable stereochemical rule is that the **anti-addition** to a **trans-alkene** produces a **meso** compound (if the substitution pattern allows for one, as it does here).\n4.  **Product of Reaction 1:** The reaction produces a single product, **meso-octane-4,5-diol**, which is an achiral compound despite having two chiral centers.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene, which is also an achiral molecule.\n2.  **Reagents:** The reagents are the same as in Reaction 1, so the overall transformation is also an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n3.  **Overall Stereochemistry:** The stereochemical rule for this case is that **anti-addition** to a **cis-alkene** produces a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.\n    *   The first step (epoxidation) produces the meso-epoxide (cis-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n    *   The second step (hydrolysis) involves backside attack by water on the meso-epoxide. Attack at the two different carbons of the epoxide ring leads to the formation of two products that are mirror images of each other.\n4.  **Product of Reaction 2:** The reaction produces a 50:50 racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. These two products are enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n*   **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n*   **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n*   **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is crucial:\n*   The **(4R,5R)** and **(4S,5S)** diols are **enantiomers**.\n*   The **meso-diol** is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties. Therefore, the meso-diol will be separated from the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   **Result:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment inside the column.\n    *   This chiral environment allows for the separation of **enantiomers**, as they will interact differently with the stationary phase.\n    *   Chiral columns can also separate **diastereomers**.\n    *   **Result:** All three unique stereoisomers—the meso compound, the (4R,5R) enantiomer, and the (4S,5S) enantiomer—will be resolved into separate peaks. The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** on the standard HPLC and **3 peaks** on the chiral HPLC. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of stereochemical outcomes of two reactions and the subsequent analysis of the product mixture by two different types of High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n        Pr   H\n         \\ /\n          C=C\n         / \\\n        H   Pr  (where Pr = propyl group, -CH2CH2CH3)\n    ```\n*   **Reagents and Transformation:** The reaction involves two steps:\n    1.  **Epoxidation with mCPBA:** This is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond. A *syn*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting material is achiral, the reaction produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R, 5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S, 5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Acid-catalyzed ring-opening:** The epoxide is treated with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This is a nucleophilic ring-opening reaction where water acts as the nucleophile. The mechanism is an Sₙ2-like attack that proceeds with *anti*-addition (the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the C-O bond), causing an inversion of stereochemistry at the attacked carbon.\n*   **Overall Transformation for Reaction 1:** The two-step sequence (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) is equivalent to an *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The rule for *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene is that it produces a *meso* compound.\n    *   Starting with the racemic mixture of (4R, 5R) and (4S, 5S) epoxides, the *anti*-opening leads to the same single product for both enantiomers.\n    *   Opening of (4R, 5R)-epoxide gives *meso*-(4R, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Opening of (4S, 5S)-epoxide also gives *meso*-(4R, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single compound, *meso*-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a *cis*-alkene. This is also an achiral molecule.\n    ```\n        Pr Pr\n         \\ /\n          C=C\n         / \\\n        H   H\n    ```\n*   **Reagents and Transformation:** The reaction sequence is the same: *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    1.  **Epoxidation with mCPBA:** *Syn*-addition to a *cis*-alkene produces a *cis*-epoxide. The resulting (Z)-4,5-epoxyoctane is a *meso* compound because it has a plane of symmetry.\n    2.  **Acid-catalyzed ring-opening:** The *meso*-epoxide undergoes *anti*-addition of water.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The rule for *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene (or its meso epoxide derivative) is that it produces a *racemic* mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   Attack of water at one carbon of the *meso*-epoxide gives (4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other equivalent carbon gives the enantiomer, (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the products of both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  *meso*-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n2.  (4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n3.  (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe stereochemical relationships between these compounds are:\n*   Compounds 2 and 3 are **enantiomers**.\n*   Compound 1 is a **diastereomer** of compound 2.\n*   Compound 1 is also a **diastereomer** of compound 3.\n\n### Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms\n\n**A) Standard (Achiral) HPLC:**\n*   A standard HPLC column has an achiral stationary phase.\n*   It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated and will elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak. The racemic pair of (4R, 5R) and (4S, 5S)-diol will produce one peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties. Therefore, they can be separated and will elute at different times. The *meso*-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will produce a separate peak.\n*   **Conclusion for Standard HPLC:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n**B) Chiral HPLC:**\n*   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase. This creates a chiral environment.\n*   In a chiral environment, enantiomers interact differently with the stationary phase, which allows for their separation. The (4R, 5R) and (4S, 5S) enantiomers will elute at different times, producing two separate peaks.\n*   Diastereomers are also separated. The *meso*-diol will elute separately from the two enantiomers.\n*   **Conclusion for Chiral HPLC:** The chromatogram will show **3 peaks** (one for each unique stereoisomer in the mixture).\n\n### Final Summary:\n\n*   **Standard HPLC:** 2 peaks (one for the meso compound, one for the racemic pair).\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 3 peaks (one for the meso compound, one for the R,R enantiomer, and one for the S,S enantiomer).\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the subsequent chromatographic observations:\n\n### **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of an alkene with a peroxyacid like mCPBA is a *syn*-addition, meaning both oxygen-carbon bonds form on the same face of the double bond. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene is retained in the product. Treating (E)-oct-4-ene (a *trans*-alkene) with mCPBA results in a *trans*-epoxide. Because the attack can occur from either face of the alkene with equal probability, a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane, is formed.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening.** The subsequent treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) opens the epoxide ring. This ring-opening is an *anti*-addition, meaning the nucleophile (water) attacks from the side opposite the epoxide oxygen.\n    *   Attack on the (4R,5R)-epoxide results in the formation of (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack on the (4S,5S)-epoxide also results in (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    This product, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a single, achiral *meso* compound.\n\n### **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The *syn*-addition of mCPBA to (Z)-oct-4-ene (a *cis*-alkene) forms a *cis*-epoxide. Due to the symmetry of the starting material and the nature of the addition, the resulting epoxide is a *meso* compound, (4R,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening.** The *anti*-addition of water to this *meso*-epoxide results in a racemic mixture of two enantiomers.\n    *   Attack at one carbon of the meso-epoxide yields (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon yields (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    These two products are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, forming a racemic mixture.\n\n### **Combined Product Mixture Analysis**\n\nThe chemist combines the product of Reaction 1 (the *meso*-diol) with the products of Reaction 2 (the racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diols). The final mixture therefore contains three stereoisomers:\n*   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (*meso*)\n*   (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (*enantiomer*)\n*   (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (*enantiomer*)\n\n### **Chromatographic Observation**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties like polarity, but it cannot differentiate between enantiomers.\n    *   The enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will co-elute, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   The *meso*-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Diastereomers have different physical properties and are separable on an achiral column.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **two peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the unresolved enantiomeric pair.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:** This method uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The chiral column will resolve the (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-enantiomers into two separate peaks.\n    *   The *meso* compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also elute separately.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **three peaks**: one for the meso compound, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist observes 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms.\n\n### Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of a trans-alkene, (E)-oct-4-ene, with mCPBA is a syn-addition. This stereospecific reaction results in the formation of a trans-epoxide. Specifically, it produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** The epoxide ring is opened by aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This is an anti-addition, where a water molecule attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite the oxygen bridge.\n    *   The attack of water on either enantiomer of the trans-epoxide [(4R,5R) or (4S,5S)] leads to the formation of a single product: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   This product molecule has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a meso compound. It is achiral.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The sole product is the meso-diol, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of a cis-alkene, (Z)-oct-4-ene, with mCPBA is also a syn-addition. This produces a cis-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is symmetrical and achiral, the resulting cis-epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane, is a meso compound.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** The acid-catalyzed opening of this meso-epoxide ring occurs via anti-addition.\n    *   Attack of water on one of the epoxide carbons (e.g., C4) results in one enantiomer, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack on the other carbon (C5) results in the other enantiomer, (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Because the attacks on both carbons are equally likely, the reaction produces a racemic mixture (a 50:50 mixture) of the two enantiomers.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The products are a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers of octane-4,5-diol:\n\n1.  **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the meso-diol from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (an enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the other enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n\nThe meso-diol is a diastereomer to both of the enantiomers from Reaction 2.\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.

The stereochemical outcome of this sequence depends on the stereochemistry of the starting alkene.\n\n**Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene)**\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of a trans-alkene with a peroxyacid like mCPBA is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to one face of the double bond. This process stereospecifically converts the *trans*-alkene into a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, the product is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Step 2: Aqueous acid hydrolysis.** The acid-catalyzed opening of an epoxide is an *anti*-addition; the incoming water molecule attacks from the side opposite the epoxide oxygen. The anti-addition to a racemic mixture of *trans*-epoxides results in the formation of a single, achiral *meso* compound: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. This product is achiral because it possesses a plane of symmetry.\n\n**Product of Reaction 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol.**\n\n**Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene)**\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The *syn*-addition of oxygen to a *cis*-alkene stereospecifically produces a *cis*-epoxide. In this case, cis-4,5-epoxyoctane is formed. This molecule has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a *meso* compound.\n2.  **Step 2: Aqueous acid hydrolysis.** The *anti*-addition of water to the *meso*-epoxide leads to a racemic mixture of enantiomers. Attack on the two carbons of the epoxide ring results in the formation of both (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol in equal amounts.\n\n**Product of Reaction 2: A racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.**\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis of the Combined Products\n\nThe final mixture contains three stereoisomers of octane-4,5-diol:\n*   **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n*   **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n*   **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe meso-diol is a diastereomer of the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are enantiomers of each other.\n\n**1. Standard (Achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   Standard HPLC columns use an achiral stationary phase. In an achiral environment, enantiomers have identical physical and chemical properties and therefore cannot be separated. They will elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n*   Diastereomers have different physical properties (e.g., polarity, boiling point) and can be separated by standard chromatography.\n*   Therefore, the racemic pair of (4R,5R) and (4S,5S)-diols will co-elute as one peak. The meso-diol, being a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, will have a different retention time and will appear as a separate peak.\n*   **Result: 2 peaks.**\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC columns use a chiral stationary phase. This creates a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers. The chiral stationary phase forms transient, diastereomeric complexes with each enantiomer, which have different stabilities and thus different retention times.\n*   Diastereomers are also readily separated on a chiral column.\n*   Consequently, all three stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved: the meso-diol, the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and the (4S,5S)-enantiomer will each produce a distinct peak.\n*   **Result: 3 peaks.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
