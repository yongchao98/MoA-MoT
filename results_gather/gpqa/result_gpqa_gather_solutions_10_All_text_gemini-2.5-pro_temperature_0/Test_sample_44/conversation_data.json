Understand the System and Principles**\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. This means they are fermions.\n*   **Potential Well:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n*   **Single-Particle Energy Levels:** The energy levels for a single particle in this potential well are given by the formula:\n    $E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\n    where n = 1, 2, 3, ... is the principal quantum number.\n*   **Given Energy Unit:** The problem defines $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. So, the single-particle energy levels can be written as:\n    $E_n = n^2 E$\n    *   $E_1 = 1^2 E = E$\n    *   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n    *   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n    *   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n    *   and so on.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Since the particles are fermions, they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This means no two particles can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state is defined by the principal quantum number (n) and the spin quantum number ($m_s$, which can be +1/2 or -1/2). Therefore, each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n**2. Calculate the Ground State Energy ($E_{GS}$)**\n\nTo find the ground state energy, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles, following the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   Place the first two particles in the lowest energy level, n=1.\n*   Place the next two particles in the second lowest energy level, n=2.\n\nThe total energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n$E_{GS} = (\\text{2 particles in n=1}) + (\\text{2 particles in n=2})$\n$E_{GS} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2)$\n$E_{GS} = (2 \\times E) + (2 \\times 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E$\n\n**3. Calculate the First Excited State Energy ($E_{1st}$)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (n=3).\n\n*   The new configuration is: 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, and 1 particle in n=3.\n\nThe total energy for this state is:\n$E_{1st} = (\\text{2 particles in n=1}) + (\\text{1 particle in n=2}) + (\\text{1 particle in n=3})$\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3)$\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$\n\n**4. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy ($E_{2nd}$)**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We need to consider different ways to excite the system from the ground state and find the one with the lowest energy (that isn't the first excited state).\n\n*   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3.\n    *   Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n\n*   **Possibility B:** Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=3.\n    *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times E) + (2 \\times 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n\n*   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=4.\n    *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = (2 \\times E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n\nComparing the energies (18E, 20E, 22E), the lowest one is 18E. This is the energy of the second excited state.\n$E_{2nd} = 18E$\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we must apply the principles of quantum mechanics, specifically the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\nThe energy levels for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L are given by the formula:\nE_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)\n\nFor simplicity, we use the given energy unit E = π²ħ² / 2mL², so the single-particle energy levels are:\n*   E₁ = 1²E = 1E\n*   E₂ = 2²E = 4E\n*   E₃ = 3²E = 9E\n*   E₄ = 4²E = 16E\n*   and so on, where n is the principal quantum number (n=1, 2, 3, ...).\n\nThe particles are spin-1/2 fermions, which means they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. In this system, a quantum state is defined by the energy level (n) and the spin (up or down). Consequently, each energy level can hold a maximum of two particles, one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n**Ground State Energy**\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles.\n*   Two particles occupy the n=1 level.\n*   The remaining two particles occupy the n=2 level.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of the four particles:\nE_ground = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\n**First Excited State Energy**\nThe first excited state is the lowest-energy configuration achievable by moving one particle from the ground state arrangement to a higher, unoccupied energy level. The least energetic promotion is to move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   Two particles remain in the n=1 level.\n*   One particle remains in the n=2 level.\n*   One particle is promoted to the n=3 level.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\nE_first = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\n**Second Excited State Energy**\nFor the second excited state, we must find the next lowest energy configuration. There are a few possibilities for excitation from the ground state:\n1.  Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3. The configuration would be: one particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (1 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n2.  Promote two particles from n=2 to n=3. The configuration would be: two particles in n=1 and two in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₃) = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n3.  Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4. The configuration would be: two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4.\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₄) = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n\nComparing these energies, the lowest value is 18E. Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is 18E.\n\nThe energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the System:** The problem involves four identical spin-1/2 particles. These particles are fermions, which means they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. They are confined to a 1D infinite potential well.\n\n2.  **Single-Particle Energy Levels:** The energy for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well is given by `E_n = n^2 * (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2mL^2)`. The problem defines a base energy unit `E = (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2mL^2)`, so the energy of the n-th level is simply `E_n = n^2 * E`.\n\n3.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. For this system, a quantum state is defined by the principal quantum number `n` (energy level) and the spin quantum number `m_s` (spin up or spin down). This means each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n4.  **Calculate Ground State Energy (E_ground):** To find the ground state energy, we must fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles.\n    *   The lowest level is `n=1`. We can place two particles here (one spin up, one spin down). Their combined energy is `2 * E_1 = 2 * (1^2 * E) = 2E`.\n    *   The next lowest level is `n=2`. We place the remaining two particles here. Their combined energy is `2 * E_2 = 2 * (2^2 * E) = 8E`.\n    *   The total ground state energy is the sum: `E_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n\n5.  **Calculate First Excited State Energy (E_first):** To get the first excited state, we promote one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state to the next available unoccupied level.\n    *   The ground state configuration has particles in `n=1` and `n=2`.\n    *   We promote one particle from `n=2` to the next level, `n=3`.\n    *   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, and one in `n=3`.\n    *   The total energy is: `(2 * 1^2 * E) + (1 * 2^2 * E) + (1 * 3^2 * E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n6.  **Calculate Second Excited State Energy (E_second):** This is the state with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We must consider different possible promotions from the ground state.\n    *   **Possibility 1:** Promote a particle from `n=1` to `n=3`. The configuration becomes: one particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, and one in `n=3`.\n        *   Energy = `(1 * 1^2 * E) + (2 * 2^2 * E) + (1 * 3^2 * E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n    *   **Possibility 2:** Promote both particles from `n=2` to `n=3`. The configuration becomes: two particles in `n=1` and two in `n=3`.\n        *   Energy = `(2 * 1^2 * E) + (2 * 3^2 * E) = 2E + 18E = 20E`.\n    *   The lower of these energies is 18E. Therefore, the second excited state energy is `18E`.\n\n7.  **Final Result:** The energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively. This corresponds to option B.

According to the spin-statistics theorem, particles with half-integer spin are **fermions**.\n    *   **Governing Principle:** The behavior of these fermions is governed by the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state is defined by a complete set of quantum numbers, which in this case includes the energy level quantum number (*n*) and the spin magnetic quantum number (*m_s*).\n    *   **Potential Well:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n\n2.  **Single-Particle Energy States:**\n    *   The energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well are given by the formula:\n        $E_n = n^2 * (pi^2 * \\hbar^2) / (2mL^2)$\n        where *n* = 1, 2, 3, ... is the principal quantum number.\n    *   The problem defines a base energy unit $E = (pi^2 * \\hbar^2) / (2mL^2)$.\n    *   Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed in terms of E:\n        *   $E_1 = 1^2 * E = E$\n        *   $E_2 = 2^2 * E = 4E$\n        *   $E_3 = 3^2 * E = 9E$\n        *   $E_4 = 4^2 * E = 16E$\n        *   and so on.\n    *   **Spin States:** Since the particles are spin-1/2, the spin quantum number *m_s* can be either +1/2 (spin up, ↑) or -1/2 (spin down, ↓).\n    *   **State Occupancy:** Due to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, each energy level *n* can hold a maximum of **two** particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Ground State Energy ($E_{ground}$)**\n\nTo find the ground state, we must place the four fermions into the lowest possible energy levels without violating the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   The lowest energy level is n=1 (energy E). We can place two particles here (one spin up, one spin down).\n*   We have two particles remaining. The next lowest energy level is n=2 (energy 4E). We can place the remaining two particles here (one spin up, one spin down).\n*   All four particles are now placed in the lowest possible configuration.\n\nThe configuration is:\n*   2 particles in the n=1 state.\n*   2 particles in the n=2 state.\n\nThe total energy is the sum of the energies of the individual particles:\n$E_{ground} = (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_2)$\n$E_{ground} = (2 * E) + (2 * 4E)$\n$E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = 10E$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the First Excited State Energy ($E_{1st\\_excited}$)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy that is higher than the ground state. We achieve this by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n*   Ground state configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2.\n*   The highest occupied level is n=2. The lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n*   Promote one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n\nThe new configuration is:\n*   2 particles in the n=1 state.\n*   1 particle in the n=2 state.\n*   1 particle in the n=3 state.\n\nThe total energy is:\n$E_{1st\\_excited} = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_3)$\n$E_{1st\\_excited} = (2 * E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E)$\n$E_{1st\\_excited} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Second Excited State Energy ($E_{2nd\\_excited}$)**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We need to consider all possible single-particle promotions from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy increase.\n\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E (achieved by promoting a particle from n=2 to n=3).\n\nLet's consider other possible excitations from the ground state:\n*   **Possibility A:** Promote a particle from n=2 to n=4.\n    *   Configuration: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4.\n    *   Energy = (2 * E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n*   **Possibility B:** Promote a particle from n=1 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 * E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n\nComparing the energies of the excited states we have found:\n*   First excited state: 15E\n*   Next possible energy: 18E\n*   Another possible energy: 22E\n\nThe state with the next lowest energy after 15E is 18E. Therefore, this is the second excited state.\n\n$E_{2nd\\_excited} = 18E$\n\n### **Final Answer Summary**\n\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State Energy:** 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe problem asks for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n**1. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nThe energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well of length L are given by:\n$E_n = n^2 \\frac{h^2}{8mL^2}$, where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nThe problem defines a base energy unit $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. We can express $E_n$ in terms of E.\nSince $\\hbar = \\frac{h}{2\\pi}$, we have $h = 2\\pi\\hbar$. Substituting this into the energy formula:\n$E_n = n^2 \\frac{(2\\pi\\hbar)^2}{8mL^2} = n^2 \\frac{4\\pi^2\\hbar^2}{8mL^2} = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2\\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\nSo, the energy of the n-th level is simply $E_n = n^2 E$.\n\n**2. Pauli Exclusion Principle**\n\nThe particles are spin-1/2 particles, which means they are fermions. According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state is defined by the principal quantum number `n` and the spin quantum number $m_s$ (spin-up or spin-down). This means each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles.\n\n**3. Ground State Energy ($E_{gs}$)**\n\nTo find the ground state energy, we fill the lowest energy levels with the four particles, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n*   **Level n=1 ($E_1 = 1^2E = E$):** Place 2 particles.\n*   **Level n=2 ($E_2 = 2^2E = 4E$):** Place the remaining 2 particles.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all particles:\n$E_{gs} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) = (2 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E$.\n\n**4. First Excited State Energy ($E_{1st}$)**\n\nThe first excited state is the state with the next lowest possible energy. We achieve this by promoting one particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied level (n=3).\n*   **Configuration:** 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1^2E) + (1 \\times 2^2E) + (1 \\times 3^2E)$\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$.\n\n**5. Second Excited State Energy ($E_{2nd}$)**\n\nThe second excited state is the state with the next lowest energy. We must consider the possible excitations from the ground state and find the one with the lowest energy after the first excited state.\n*   **Possibility 1:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3.\n    *   Energy: $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n*   **Possibility 2:** Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=3.\n    *   Energy: $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n\nComparing the possible energies (18E, 20E, etc.), the lowest energy after the first excited state (15E) is 18E.\nTherefore, the second excited state energy is $E_{2nd} = 18E$.\n\nThe energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we must apply the principles of quantum mechanics, specifically the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\nThe energy for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L is given by:\nE_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)\n\nThe problem defines the base energy unit as E = π²ħ² / 2mL². Therefore, the single-particle energy levels are:\nE_n = n²E, where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nSince the particles are spin-1/2, they are fermions and must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle dictates that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. For this system, a quantum state is defined by the energy level (n) and the spin (up or down). Consequently, each energy level 'n' can hold a maximum of two particles, one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation for the total energy of the system in its lowest energy states:\n\n**1. Ground State Energy (Lowest Total Energy)**\nTo achieve the ground state, the particles must fill the lowest available energy levels.\n*   **Level n=1:** Can hold two particles. Their combined energy is 2 * E₁ = 2 * (1²E) = 2E.\n*   **Level n=2:** Can hold the remaining two particles. Their combined energy is 2 * E₂ = 2 * (2²E) = 2 * 4E = 8E.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of these energies:\nE_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\n**2.

The energy for a given quantum state 'n' is:\n\nE_n = (n² * π² * ħ²) / (2mL²)\n\nThe problem defines a base energy unit E = (π² * ħ²) / (2mL²). Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as:\n\nE_n = n² * E, where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\n### Pauli Exclusion Principle\n\nSince the particles are spin-1/2 particles (fermions), they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle dictates that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. For this system, a quantum state is defined by the energy level 'n' and the spin projection (spin up or spin down). Consequently, each energy level 'n' can hold a maximum of two particles, one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n### Calculating the System Energies\n\nWe will now fill the energy levels with the four particles to find the total energy for the ground and excited states.\n\n**Ground State (Lowest Energy)**\n\nTo achieve the lowest possible total energy, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up:\n*   **n=1 (Energy E₁ = 1²E = 1E):** We place two particles in this level (one spin up, one spin down).\n*   **n=2 (Energy E₂ = 2²E = 4E):** We place the remaining two particles in this level (one spin up, one spin down).\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\nE_ground = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) = 2E + 8E = **10E**\n\n**First Excited State**\n\nTo find the first excited state, we move one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state configuration to the next available unoccupied energy level. This corresponds to promoting one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   **n=1 (Energy E₁ = 1E):** Two particles.\n*   **n=2 (Energy E₂ = 4E):** One particle.\n*   **n=3 (Energy E₃ = 3²E = 9E):** One particle.\n\nThe total energy for the first excited state is:\nE_1st_excited = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**\n\n**Second Excited State**\n\nFor the second excited state, we must find the next lowest energy configuration. There are a few possibilities for excitation from the ground state:\n1.  Promote the other particle from n=2 to n=3: (2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=3).\n    *   Energy = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n2.  Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4: (2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4).\n    *   Energy = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 4²E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n3.  Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3: (1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3).\n    *   Energy = (1 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n\nComparing these energies, the lowest energy configuration after the first excited state is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the energies are:\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine the energies of the system, we must first understand the behavior of the four identical spin-1/2 particles within the one-dimensional infinite potential well. These particles are fermions and therefore must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n\nThe energy levels for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L are quantized and given by the formula:\nE_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)\n\nThe problem defines the ground state energy unit as E = π²ħ² / 2mL². Thus, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as:\nE_n = n²E, where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nFor spin-1/2 particles, each energy level 'n' can hold a maximum of two particles, one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n**Ground State Energy**\n\nTo find the ground state energy of the four-particle system, we fill the lowest available energy levels first.\n*   Two particles will occupy the n=1 energy level. The energy for these two particles is 2 * E₁ = 2 * (1²E) = 2E.\n*   The remaining two particles will occupy the n=2 energy level. The energy for these two particles is 2 * E₂ = 2 * (2²E) = 2 * 4E = 8E.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\nE_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\n**First Excited State Energy**\n\nTo obtain the first excited state, we promote one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (n=3).\n*   The configuration becomes: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n*   The total energy for this configuration is:\n    E_first = (2 * E₁) + (1 * E₂) + (1 * E₃)\n    E_first = (2 * 1²E) + (1 * 2²E) + (1 * 3²E)\n    E_first = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\n**Second Excited State Energy**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest total energy above the first excited state. We must consider the possible single-particle promotions from the ground state that result in the lowest energy increase after the first excited state.\n*   **Possibility 1:** Promote a particle from n=2 to n=3 (as in the first excited state) and another from n=2 to n=3. This is not possible as it would mean exciting the same particle twice. A better way to think about it is exciting the second particle from n=2 to n=3. The configuration would be two particles in n=1 and two particles in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (2 * E₁) + (2 * E₃) = (2 * 1²E) + (2 * 3²E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n*   **Possibility 2:** Promote a particle from a lower level, n=1, to the lowest available level, n=3. The configuration would be one particle in n=1, two particles in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 * E₁) + (2 * E₂) + (1 * E₃)\n    *   Energy = (1 * 1²E) + (2 * 2²E) + (1 * 3²E)\n    *   Energy = E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n\nComparing the possible excitation energies (15E, 18E, 20E), the second lowest energy after the ground state is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the energies are:\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo determine the energies of the system, we must consider the properties of the particles and the potential well.\n\n### 1. Single-Particle Energy Levels\n\nFor a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L, the allowed energy levels are quantized. The energy for each level `n` (where `n` = 1, 2, 3, ...) is given by:\n\nE_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)\n\nThe problem defines a base energy unit E = π²ħ² / 2mL². Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as:\n*   E₁ = 1²E = E\n*   E₂ = 2²E = 4E\n*   E₃ = 3²E = 9E\n*   E₄ = 4²E = 16E\n*   and so on.\n\n### 2. Pauli Exclusion Principle\n\nThe particles are specified as spin-1/2, which means they are fermions. Fermions are subject to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. In this system, a quantum state is defined by the energy level `n` and the spin state (spin-up or spin-down). This means each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles, one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n### 3. Calculating the System Energies\n\nTo find the total energy of the four-particle system, we sum the energies of the individual particles.\n\n*   **Ground State (Lowest Energy):**\n    To achieve the lowest possible total energy, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up.\n    *   Two particles go into the n=1 level (one spin-up, one spin-down). Their combined energy is 2 × E₁ = 2E.\n    *   The remaining two particles go into the n=2 level (one spin-up, one spin-down). Their combined energy is 2 × E₂ = 2 × 4E = 8E.\n    *   **Total Ground State Energy** = 2E + 8E = **10E**.\n\n*   **First Excited State (Next Lowest Energy):**\n    To get the first excited state, we must promote one particle from the ground state configuration to the lowest available energy level. The lowest energy excitation involves moving a particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied level (n=3).\n    *   The new configuration is: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n    *   Energy from n=1 level: 2 × E₁ = 2E.\n    *   Energy from n=2 level: 1 × E₂ = 4E.\n    *   Energy from n=3 level: 1 × E₃ = 9E.\n    *   **Total First Excited State Energy** = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**.\n\n*   **Second Excited State (Third Lowest Energy):**\n    There are two possibilities for the next lowest excitation from the ground state:\n    1.  Promote a particle from the n=1 level to the n=3 level.\n    2.  Promote a particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level (this was the first excited state), and then promote the second particle from n=2 to n=3.\n\n    Let's calculate the energy for the first possibility, which is the most likely candidate for the second excited state:\n    *   The configuration becomes: one particle in n=1, two particles in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n    *   Energy from n=1 level: 1 × E₁ = E.\n    *   Energy from n=2 level: 2 × E₂ = 2 × 4E = 8E.\n    *   Energy from n=3 level: 1 × E₃ = 9E.\n    *   **Total Second Excited State Energy** = E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n\n    Let's check other possibilities to be certain. For instance, moving one particle from n=2 to n=4 would result in a total energy of 2E (from n=1) + 4E (from n=2) + 16E (from n=4) = 22E, which is higher. Moving both particles from n=2 to n=3 gives 2E + 2*(9E) = 20E, also higher. Therefore, 18E is the correct energy for the second excited state.\n\nThe energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step calculation to determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for the system.\n\n**1. Understand the System**\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Since they are identical and have half-integer spin, they are fermions.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. For a particle in a 1D potential well, a quantum state is defined by its principal quantum number (n) and its spin projection quantum number (m_s).\n*   **Energy Levels:** The energy levels for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L are given by:\n    $E_n = n^2 * (\\frac{π^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2})$\n    where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n*   **Given Energy Unit (E):** The problem defines $E = \\frac{π^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. So, the single-particle energy levels can be written as:\n    $E_n = n^2 E$\n*   **State Occupancy:** Since the particles are spin-1/2, their spin can be either \"up\" (m_s = +1/2) or \"down\" (m_s = -1/2). According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, each energy level *n* can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n**2. Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_gs)**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four fermions, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **n = 1 level (Energy E₁ = 1²E = E):** We can place two particles in this level (one spin up, one spin down).\n*   **n = 2 level (Energy E₂ = 2²E = 4E):** We have two particles remaining, so we place them in this next available level (one spin up, one spin down).\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n$E_{gs} = (1E + 1E) + (4E + 4E) = 2 \\times E_1 + 2 \\times E_2$\n$E_{gs} = 2(E) + 2(4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E$\n\n**3. Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n\nTo get the first excited state, we need to create the lowest-energy excitation from the ground state. This is done by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n*   **Ground state configuration:** 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2.\n*   **Highest occupied level:** n = 2.\n*   **Lowest unoccupied level:** n = 3.\n*   **Excitation:** Move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n\nThe new configuration for the first excited state is:\n*   2 particles in n=1 (Energy E₁ = E)\n*   1 particle in n=2 (Energy E₂ = 4E)\n*   1 particle in n=3 (Energy E₃ = 3²E = 9E)\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n$E_{1st} = 2 \\times E_1 + 1 \\times E_2 + 1 \\times E_3$\n$E_{1st} = 2(E) + 1(4E) + 1(9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$\n\n**4. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\n\nTo find the second excited state, we must find the next-lowest energy configuration above the first excited state. We must consider all possible low-energy excitations from the ground state.\n\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E (from configuration: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3).\n*   Let's consider other possible single-particle promotions from the ground state:\n    *   **Option 1: Promote a particle from n=1 to n=3.**\n        *   Configuration: 1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3.\n        *   Energy = $1 \\times E_1 + 2 \\times E_2 + 1 \\times E_3 = 1(E) + 2(4E) + 1(9E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n    *   **Option 2: Promote a particle from n=2 to n=4.**\n        *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=4.\n        *   Energy = $2 \\times E_1 + 1 \\times E_2 + 1 \\times E_4 = 2(E) + 1(4E) + 1(16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n    *   **Option 3: Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3 (a two-particle excitation).**\n        *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=3.\n        *   Energy = $2 \\times E_1 + 2 \\times E_3 = 2(E) + 2(9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n\nComparing the energies of the possible excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E, ...), the second lowest energy after the ground state (10E) is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the second excited state energy is **18E**.\n\n**Summary of Energies:**\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nThis problem involves calculating the energy states of four identical spin-1/2 particles within a one-dimensional infinite potential well.

Understand the System and Key Principles**\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin (like spin-1/2) are **fermions**.\n*   **Potential:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** A crucial rule for identical fermions is the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state is defined by all its quantum numbers.\n*   **Quantum Numbers:** For a particle in a 1D well, the state is defined by the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (which can be +1/2 for spin-up or -1/2 for spin-down).\n\n**2. Determine the Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\n*   The energy of a single particle in the n-th state of a 1D infinite potential well is given by the formula:\n    `E_n = (n² * π² * ħ²) / (2 * m * L²)` where `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`\n*   The problem defines a base energy unit `E = (π² * ħ²) / (2 * m * L²)`.\n*   Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed simply as:\n    `E_n = n² * E`\n*   So, the first few energy levels are:\n    *   `E₁ = 1² * E = 1E`\n    *   `E₂ = 2² * E = 4E`\n    *   `E₃ = 3² * E = 9E`\n    *   `E₄ = 4² * E = 16E`\n    *   and so on.\n\n**3. Apply the Pauli Exclusion Principle to Fill the Levels**\n\n*   According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, each energy level `E_n` can hold a maximum of **two** fermions: one with spin-up (`m_s` = +1/2) and one with spin-down (`m_s` = -1/2).\n\n**4. Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_ground)**\n\n*   The ground state is the state with the lowest possible total energy. To achieve this, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up with our four fermions.\n    *   **Level n=1 (E₁ = 1E):** We can place two fermions here (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n    *   **Level n=2 (E₂ = 4E):** We can place the remaining two fermions here (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n*   The total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n    `E_ground = (2 * E₁) + (2 * E₂)`\n    `E_ground = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 4E)`\n    `E_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E`\n\n**5. Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st_excited)**\n\n*   The first excited state is the configuration with the next lowest possible energy. We can find this by taking the ground state configuration and promoting one particle to the lowest available empty state.\n    *   **Ground State Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=2.\n    *   **Excitation:** The highest energy particle is in the n=2 level. The lowest available empty level is n=3. We move one particle from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   **New Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n*   The total energy of the first excited state is:\n    `E_1st_excited = (2 * E₁) + (1 * E₂) + (1 * E₃)`\n    `E_1st_excited = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E)`\n    `E_1st_excited = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`\n\n**6. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd_excited)**\n\n*   The second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy after the first excited state. We need to consider all possible low-energy excitations from the ground state and find the second lowest one.\n    *   **Ground State Energy:** 10E (Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2)\n    *   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E (Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3)\n*   Let's consider other possible excited configurations and their energies:\n    *   **Possibility A:** Promote a particle from n=1 to n=3 (instead of from n=2 to n=3).\n        *   Configuration: One particle in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3.\n        *   Energy = `(1 * E₁) + (2 * E₂) + (1 * E₃) = (1 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E`\n    *   **Possibility B:** Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n        *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, two in n=3.\n        *   Energy = `(2 * E₁) + (2 * E₃) = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E`\n    *   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n        *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4.\n        *   Energy = `(2 * E₁) + (1 * E₂) + (1 * E₄) = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`\n*   Comparing the energies of the excited states we've found: 15E, 18E, 20E, 22E...\n*   The lowest excited state energy is 15E.\n*   The second lowest excited state energy is **18E**.\n\n### **Summary of Results**\n\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State Energy:** 18E\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) 4E, 10E, 15E\nB) 10E, 15E, 18E\nC) 4E, 10E, 50E\nD) 30E, 39E, 50E\n\nThe calculated energies match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nThe energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system have been calculated through a step-by-step reasoning process and verified using a Python script.\n\n**1.

Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as:\n*   E_n = n²E\n\nThis gives us the following energy levels for increasing `n`:\n*   E₁ = 1²E = 1E\n*   E₂ = 2²E = 4E\n*   E₃ = 3²E = 9E\n*   E₄ = 4²E = 16E\n*   and so on.\n\n### Multi-Particle System (Fermions)\n\nThe particles are described as identical and having spin-1/2, which means they are fermions. According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. For a particle in this potential well, a quantum state is defined by its energy level `n` and its spin (either up or down). This means each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n### Calculation of System Energies\n\nTo find the total energy of the four-particle system, we sum the energies of the individual particles.\n\n**Ground State:**\nTo achieve the lowest possible total energy (the ground state), we fill the energy levels from the bottom up.\n*   Two particles fill the n=1 level.

A particle's state in this system is defined by its principal quantum number (n) and its spin projection (m_s), which can be either spin-up (+1/2) or spin-down (-1/2). This means each energy level *n* can hold a maximum of two particles, one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\nHere's the step-by-step calculation for the required energy states:\n\n### Ground State Energy\nFor the ground state, the four particles must fill the lowest possible energy levels.\n*   **Level n=1:** Can hold two particles (one spin-up, one spin-down). The energy for these two particles is 2 × E₁ = 2 × (1²E) = 2E.\n*   **Level n=2:** Can hold the remaining two particles (one spin-up, one spin-down).

Key Principles**\n\n*   **Particles:** The particles are spin-1/2, which classifies them as fermions.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions are subject to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. For this system, a quantum state is defined by its principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and its spin (up or down). Therefore, each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of two particles.\n*   **Single-Particle Energy Levels:** The energy for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well is given by `E_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)`. The problem defines the base unit of energy as `E = π²ħ² / 2mL²`. So, the energy of a particle in the nth level is simply `E_n = n²E`.\n\n**2. Ground State Energy (Lowest Energy State)**\n\nTo find the ground state energy, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up with the four particles, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **n = 1 level (Energy E₁ = 1²E = E):** Place the first two particles here.\n*   **n = 2 level (Energy E₂ = 2²E = 4E):** Place the remaining two particles here.\n\nThe total energy for the ground state is the sum of the individual particle energies:\nE_ground = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) = (2 × E) + (2 × 4E) = 2E + 8E = **10E**.\n\n**3. First Excited State Energy**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (n=3).\n\n*   The particle configuration becomes:\n    *   Two particles in the n=1 level (Energy: 2 × E₁ = 2E)\n    *   One particle in the n=2 level (Energy: 1 × E₂ = 4E)\n    *   One particle in the n=3 level (Energy: 1 × E₃ = 3²E = 9E)\n\nThe total energy for the first excited state is:\nE_first = (2E) + (4E) + (9E) = **15E**.\n\n**4. Second Excited State Energy**\n\nThe second excited state has the next lowest energy. We need to find the excitation from the ground state that requires the second-smallest amount of energy.\n\n*   **First Excitation (already found):** Promoting a particle from n=2 to n=3 gives the first excited state with energy 15E (an increase of 5E from the ground state).\n*   **Next Lowest Excitation:** Consider promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3.\n    *   The new configuration is: one particle in n=1, two particles in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n    *   Total Energy = (1 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (1 × E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n\nWe can check other possibilities to confirm this is the correct state. For example, promoting a particle from n=2 to n=4 would result in an energy of 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E, which is higher than 18E. Promoting two particles from n=2 to n=3 gives an energy of 2E + 18E = 20E, also higher.\n\nTherefore, the second excited state has an energy of 18E.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nThe problem asks for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n### **1.

The problem defines the energy unit `E = (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2mL^2)`, so the single-particle energy levels are `En = n^2 * E`, where `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`.\n2.  **Identical Spin-1/2 Particles:** These particles are fermions.\n3.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** No two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. For a particle in this potential well, a quantum state is defined by its energy quantum number `n` and its spin projection (`ms = +1/2` for spin up or `ms = -1/2` for spin down). This means each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles, one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n### Calculation of System Energies\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the four individual particles. To find the energies of the different states, we must fill the single-particle energy levels according to the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **Single-particle energy levels:**\n    *   `E1 = 1^2 * E = 1E`\n    *   `E2 = 2^2 * E = 4E`\n    *   `E3 = 3^2 * E = 9E`\n    *   `E4 = 4^2 * E = 16E`\n    *   and so on...\n\n#### Ground State Energy\n\nTo achieve the ground state (the lowest possible total energy), we fill the lowest available energy levels first.\n\n*   Two particles go into the `n=1` level (one spin up, one spin down).\n*   The remaining two particles go into the `n=2` level (one spin up, one spin down).\n\nThe total ground state energy is:\n`E_ground = (2 * E1) + (2 * E2) = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E`\n\n#### First Excited State Energy\n\nTo get the first excited state, we need to make the smallest possible energy jump from the ground state configuration. This is achieved by moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (`n=3`).\n\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n\nThe total first excited state energy is:\n`E_first_excited = (2 * E1) + (1 * E2) + (1 * E3) = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`\n\n#### Second Excited State Energy\n\nTo find the second excited state, we consider the next possible low-energy excitations from the ground state. There are two primary possibilities to create a state with energy higher than the first excited state:\n\n1.  **Promote a particle from `n=2` to `n=4`**:\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, one in `n=4`.\n    *   Energy = `(2 * E1) + (1 * E2) + (1 * E4) = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`.\n\n2.  **Promote a particle from `n=1` to `n=3`**:\n    *   Configuration: One particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, one in `n=3`.\n    *   Energy = `(1 * E1) + (2 * E2) + (1 * E3) = (1 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n\nComparing the possible energies, the lower value is 18E. Thus, this is the energy of the second excited state.\n\n### Summary of Energies:\n\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step calculation of the energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system.\n\n### 1. Single-Particle Energy Levels\n\nFor a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L, the allowed energy levels are given by:\nE_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)\n\nWhere:\n*   `n` is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...)\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck's constant\n*   `m` is the mass of the particle\n*   `L` is the length of the well\n\nThe problem defines E = π²ħ² / 2mL², so the single-particle energy levels can be written as:\n**E_n = n²E**\n\n### 2. The Pauli Exclusion Principle\n\nThe system consists of four identical spin-1/2 particles. These particles are fermions and must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle.

Understand the System**\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. This means they are fermions and must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** No two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. For a particle in a 1D well, a quantum state is defined by its energy level (principal quantum number `n`) and its spin projection (`m_s`, which can be spin-up or spin-down). This implies that each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles (one spin-up and one spin-down).\n*   **Energy Levels:** The energy levels for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L are given by:\n    $E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\n    where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n*   **Energy Unit:** The problem defines the base energy unit as $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. We can express the single-particle energy levels in terms of E:\n    *   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n    *   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n    *   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n    *   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n    *   and so on.\n\n**2. Calculate the Ground State Energy ($E_{GS}$)**\n\nTo find the ground state, we place the four fermions into the lowest possible energy levels according to the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   Place the first two particles in the n=1 level (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n*   Place the remaining two particles in the next available level, n=2 (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n$E_{GS} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2)$\n$E_{GS} = (2 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E)$\n$E_{GS} = 2E + 8E = 10E$\n\n**3. Calculate the First Excited State Energy ($E_{1st}$)**\n\nTo get the first excited state, we take the ground state configuration and promote one particle to the lowest possible unoccupied energy level. The highest energy particle in the ground state is in the n=2 level. We promote it to the next available level, which is n=3.\n\n*   The configuration becomes: Two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3)$\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E)$\n$E_{1st} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$\n\n**4. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy ($E_{2nd}$)**\n\nThe second excited state is the state with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We must consider all possible one-particle promotions that result in an energy higher than the first excited state.\n\n*   **Option A:** Promote the other particle from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=3.\n    *   Energy: $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = 2E + 2(9E) = 20E$.\n*   **Option B:** Promote a particle from the n=1 level of the ground state to the n=3 level.\n    *   Configuration: 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3.\n    *   Energy: $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = 1E + 2(4E) + 9E = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n*   **Option C:** Promote a particle from the n=2 level of the ground state to the n=4 level.\n    *   Configuration: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4.\n    *   Energy: $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n\nComparing the energies (18E, 20E, 22E), the lowest one after the first excited state (15E) is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the second excited state is:\n$E_{2nd} = 18E$\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively.

According to the spin-statistics theorem, particles with half-integer spin are fermions. A key property of fermions is that they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n2.  **Define Quantum States:** For a particle in a 1D infinite potential well, a quantum state is defined by its principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and its spin quantum number `m_s` (spin-up, +1/2, or spin-down, -1/2).\n3.  **Energy Levels:** The energy of a single particle in a 1D infinite well is given by `E_n = n^2 * (pi^2 * h_bar^2) / (2mL^2)`. The problem defines the base energy unit as `E = (pi^2 * h_bar^2) / (2mL^2)`, so the single-particle energy levels are simply `E_n = n^2 * E`.\n4.  **Apply Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Since each energy level `n` can accommodate two fermions (one with spin-up and one with spin-down), we will fill these levels starting from the lowest energy (`n=1`) to find the total energy of the multi-particle system.\n5.  **Calculate Ground State Energy (E_g):** To find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four fermions.\n    *   Place two fermions in the `n=1` level (E_1 = 1²E = 1E).\n    *   Place the remaining two fermions in the `n=2` level (E_2 = 2²E = 4E).\n    *   The total ground state energy is the sum: E_g = 2 * E_1 + 2 * E_2.\n6.  **Calculate First Excited State Energy (E_1st):** To get the first excited state, we promote one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state to the next available empty level.\n    *   Move one particle from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n    *   The configuration becomes: two particles in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, and one in `n=3`.\n    *   The total energy is: E_1st = 2 * E_1 + 1 * E_2 + 1 * E_3.\n7.  **Calculate Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd):** This is the state with the next lowest energy. We must consider different possibilities for excitation from the ground state:\n    *   **Case a):** Promote one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`. The configuration is: one in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, one in `n=3`.\n    *   **Case b):** Promote the second particle from `n=2` to `n=3`. The configuration is: two in `n=1`, zero in `n=2`, two in `n=3`.\n    *   **Case c):** Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`. The configuration is: two in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, one in `n=4`.\n    *   Calculate the energy for each case and the lowest of these will be the second excited state energy.\n8.  **Final Comparison:** Compare the calculated energies (E_g, E_1st, E_2nd) with the given options to find the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_particle_energy_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the energies of the ground state, first excited state,\n    and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in\n    a 1D infinite potential well.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The energy of a single particle in level n is n^2 * E.\n    # We will calculate the total energy in units of E.\n    \n    # --- Ground State ---\n    # To get the lowest total energy (ground state), we fill the lowest\n    # available energy levels.

For an electron in a 1D box, a quantum state is defined by both its energy level (principal quantum number *n*) and its spin state (*m_s* = +1/2 or -1/2).\n4.  **State Occupancy:** As a consequence of the Pauli principle, each energy level *n* can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n5.  **Energy Levels:** The energy for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well is given by E_n = n² * (π²ħ²/2mL²). The problem conveniently defines the base energy unit as E = π²ħ²/2mL², so the energy of the n-th level is simply E_n = n²E.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n**Step 1: List the single-particle energy levels.**\nUsing the formula E_n = n²E, we can list the first few energy levels:\n*   E₁ (n=1) = 1²E = 1E\n*   E₂ (n=2) = 2²E = 4E\n*   E₃ (n=3) = 3²E = 9E\n*   E₄ (n=4) = 4²E = 16E\n*   ...and so on.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Ground State Energy.**\nTo find the ground state, we must place the four fermions into the lowest possible energy levels without violating the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n*   The n=1 level can hold two particles.\n*   The n=2 level can hold two particles.\n*   We place two particles in the n=1 level and the remaining two particles in the n=2 level.\n*   The total energy of the ground state (E_gs) is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n    E_gs = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₂)\n    E_gs = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) = 2E + 8E = **10E**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the First Excited State Energy.**\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state.

First Excited State Energy**\n\nTo find the first excited state, we promote one particle from the highest occupied energy level (n=2) in the ground state to the lowest unoccupied energy level (n=3). This represents the smallest possible increase in total energy.\n*   The n=1 level remains filled with two particles (Energy: 2 × E₁ = 2E).\n*   One particle remains in the n=2 level (Energy: 1 × E₂ = 4E).\n*   One particle is excited to the n=3 level (Energy: 1 × E₃ = 9E).\n\nThe total first excited state energy is the sum:\nE_first = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**\n\n**5.

These particles are fermions.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** No two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state is defined by its set of quantum numbers, which in this case are the energy level quantum number (n) and the spin quantum number (m_s = +1/2 or -1/2). This means each energy level can hold a maximum of two particles, one with spin up and one with spin down.\n*   **Energy Levels:** For a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L, the allowed energy levels are given by E_n = n² * E, where E = (π²ħ²)/(2mL²) and n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\n### Calculation of Energy States\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the individual particles.\n\n**1. Ground State Energy (E₀)**\n\nTo achieve the lowest possible total energy (the ground state), the four fermions are placed in the lowest available energy levels, following the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n*   Two particles fill the n=1 energy level (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n*   The remaining two particles fill the n=2 energy level (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n\nThe total ground state energy is:\nE₀ = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₂)\nE₀ = (2 × 1²E) + (2 × 2²E)\nE₀ = 2E + 2(4E) = 2E + 8E\n**E₀ = 10E**\n\n**2. First Excited State Energy (E₁)**\n\nTo find the energy of the first excited state, one particle is promoted from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n*   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is n=2 and the lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n*   Therefore, one particle moves from n=2 to n=3.\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\nE₁ = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃)\nE₁ = (2 × 1²E) + (1 × 2²E) + (1 × 3²E)\nE₁ = 2E + 4E + 9E\n**E₁ = 15E**\n\n**3. Second Excited State Energy (E₂)**\n\nFor the second excited state, we must find the next lowest energy configuration starting from the ground state. There are a few possibilities for excitation:\n*   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: One particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (1 × 1²E) + (2 × 2²E) + (1 × 3²E) = E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n*   **Possibility B:** Promote the second particle from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, zero in n=2, and two in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₃) = (2 × 1²E) + (2 × 3²E) = 2E + 18E = **20E**.\n*   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4.\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₄) = (2 × 1²E) + (1 × 2²E) + (1 × 4²E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = **22E**.\n\nComparing the possible energies (18E, 20E, and 22E), the lowest energy after the first excited state (15E) is 18E.\n\n**E₂ = 18E**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is the step-by-step calculation for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state.\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n1.  **Infinite Potential Well:** For a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L, the allowed energy levels are given by `En = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)`, where `n` is a positive integer (n=1, 2, 3, ...). The problem defines `E = π²ħ² / 2mL²`, so the single-particle energy levels are `En = n²E`.\n2.  **Spin-1/2 Particles:** The particles are fermions.\n3.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Since the particles are identical fermions, no two particles can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state is defined by its energy level (n) and its spin (up or down). This means each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n### Single-Particle Energy Levels\n\n*   n=1: E₁ = 1²E = 1E\n*   n=2: E₂ = 2²E = 4E\n*   n=3: E₃ = 3²E = 9E\n*   n=4: E₄ = 4²E = 16E\n\n### Calculation of System Energies\n\n#### Ground State\n\nTo find the ground state energy, we fill the lowest available single-particle energy levels with the four particles, following the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\n*   Two particles go into the `n=1` level (one spin up, one spin down).\n*   The remaining two particles go into the `n=2` level (one spin up, one spin down).\n\nThe total energy is the sum of the energies of the four particles:\n*   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₂)\n*   Energy = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) = 2E + 8E = **10E**\n\n#### First Excited State\n\nTo find the energy of the first excited state, we promote one particle from the ground state configuration to the next available higher energy level. This means moving one particle from the `n=2` level to the `n=3` level.\n\n*   Two particles remain in the `n=1` level.\n*   One particle remains in the `n=2` level.\n*   One particle is promoted to the `n=3` level.\n\nThe total energy is:\n*   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃)\n*   Energy = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**\n\n#### Second Excited State\n\nTo find the second excited state, we look for the next lowest energy configuration after the first excited state. There are a few possibilities starting from the ground state configuration:\n\n1.  Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4.\n    *   Energy = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n2.  Promote both particles from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n3.  Promote one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`.\n    *   Configuration: 1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n\nComparing the possible energies (18E, 20E, 22E), the lowest value is 18E. Therefore, this is the energy of the second excited state.\n\n### Summary\n\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State Energy:** 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nThis problem requires us to determine the energies of the three lowest states for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n### 1. Fundamental Principles\n\n*   **Particles:** The particles are spin-1/2, which means they are **fermions**.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** As fermions, no two particles can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state is defined by its full set of quantum numbers.\n*   **Quantum States in a 1D Well:** For a particle in a 1D infinite potential well of length L, the quantum state is defined by two numbers:\n    1.  The principal quantum number `n`, where `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`\n    2.  The spin magnetic quantum number `m_s`, which can be `+1/2` (spin up) or `-1/2` (spin down).\n*   **Energy Levels:** The energy of a single particle in the `n`-th level is given by:\n    `E_n = n^2 * (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2mL^2)`\n    The problem defines a base energy unit `E = (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2mL^2)`. Therefore, the energy of a single particle in level `n` is simply `E_n = n^2 * E`.\n\n### 2. State Configurations\n\nBecause of the Pauli Exclusion Principle, each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down. To find the total energy of the system, we sum the energies of the four individual particles. We must fill the energy levels in a way that corresponds to the ground state (lowest total energy), the first excited state (next lowest total energy), and so on.\n\nLet's list the single-particle energies:\n*   `E_1 = 1^2 * E = 1E`\n*   `E_2 = 2^2 * E = 4E`\n*   `E_3 = 3^2 * E = 9E`\n*   `E_4 = 4^2 * E = 16E`\n*   ...and so on.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Energies\n\nTo make this systematic, we can think of having a pool of available single-particle states, defined by their energy level `n`. Since each level can hold two particles, our pool of levels to choose from is `{1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, ...}`. We need to pick four levels for our four particles.\n\n**A) Ground State (E_gs)**\n\nTo obtain the lowest possible total energy, we must occupy the lowest available energy levels. We place two particles in the `n=1` level and two particles in the `n=2` level.\n\n*   Two particles in `n=1`: Energy = `2 * E_1 = 2 * (1E) = 2E`\n*   Two particles in `n=2`: Energy = `2 * E_2 = 2 * (4E) = 8E`\n*   **Total Ground State Energy:** `E_gs = 2E + 8E = 10E`\n\nThe configuration is (2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2).\n\n**B) First Excited State (E_1st)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest energy above the ground state. We create this state by promoting one particle from the ground state configuration to the next available higher energy level. The lowest-energy promotion is to move a particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n\n*   Configuration: One particle is moved from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n    *   Two particles in `n=1`: Energy = `2 * E_1 = 2E`\n    *   One particle in `n=2`: Energy = `1 * E_2 = 4E`\n    *   One particle in `n=3`: Energy = `1 * E_3 = 9E`\n*   **Total First Excited State Energy:** `E_1st = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`\n\n**C) Second Excited State (E_2nd)**\n\nThis is the state with the next lowest energy. We must consider all possible excitations from the ground state and find the second-cheapest one in terms of energy cost.\n\n1.  **First Excitation (already found):** Move a particle from `n=2` to `n=3`. Energy cost `ΔE = E_3 - E_2 = 9E - 4E = 5E`. Total Energy = `10E + 5E = 15E`.\n2.  **Second-Lowest Excitation:** Let's compare other possibilities:\n    *   **Option 1: Move a particle from `n=1` to `n=3`**.\n        *   Energy cost `ΔE = E_3 - E_1 = 9E - 1E = 8E`.\n        *   New configuration: One particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, one in `n=3`.\n        *   Total Energy = `(1*E_1) + (2*E_2) + (1*E_3) = 1E + 2*(4E) + 9E = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n    *   **Option 2: Move a particle from `n=2` to `n=4`**.\n        *   Energy cost `ΔE = E_4 - E_2 = 16E - 4E = 12E`.\n        *   Total Energy = `10E + 12E = 22E`.\n    *   **Option 3: Move two particles from `n=2` to `n=3`**.\n        *   Energy cost `ΔE = 2 * (E_3 - E_2) = 2 * (5E) = 10E`.\n        *   Total Energy = `10E + 10E = 20E`.\n\nComparing the total energies of these excited states (`15E`, `18E`, `20E`, `22E`), the lowest is `15E` (the first excited state), and the next lowest is `18E`.\n\n*   **Total Second Excited State Energy:** `E_2nd = 18E`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nThis problem requires us to determine the energies of the ground state and the first two excited states for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n**1.

Therefore, we can express the single-particle energy levels as:\nE_n = n^2 * E\n\nLet's list the first few energy levels:\n*   E_1 = 1^2 * E = 1E\n*   E_2 = 2^2 * E = 4E\n*   E_3 = 3^2 * E = 9E\n*   E_4 = 4^2 * E = 16E\n*   ...and so on.\n\n**2. Pauli Exclusion Principle**\n\nThe particles are spin-1/2 particles, which means they are fermions. Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state here is defined by the principal quantum number `n` and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (which can be +1/2 for spin up or -1/2 for spin down).\n\nThis principle implies that each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n**3. Ground State Energy (E_gs)**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles.\n*   We place the first two particles in the lowest energy level, n=1. One will have spin up, and the other will have spin down.\n*   We place the remaining two particles in the next lowest energy level, n=2. Again, one will be spin up, and the other spin down.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\nE_gs = (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_2)\nE_gs = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 4E)\nE_gs = 2E + 8E = 10E\n\n**4. First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. We achieve this by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n*   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is n=2.\n*   The lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n*   We move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n\nThe new configuration is:\n*   Two particles in n=1.\n*   One particle in n=2.\n*   One particle in n=3.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\nE_1st = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_3)\nE_1st = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E)\nE_1st = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E\n\n**5. Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We need to consider all possible excitations from the ground state and find the second lowest total energy (after the first excited state).\n\nLet's list the energies of the lowest possible configurations:\n*   **Ground State:** 2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2. Energy = 2*E1 + 2*E2 = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n*   **Excitation A (First Excited State):** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=3. Configuration: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3.

Understand the Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nFor a single particle of mass `m` in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length `L`, the allowed energy levels are given by the formula:\n`E_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)`, where `n` is a positive integer (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n\nThe problem conveniently defines the base unit of energy `E = π²ħ² / 2mL²`. We can therefore express the energy of each single-particle level as a simple multiple of `E`:\n*   Level `n=1`: `E₁ = 1² * E = 1E`\n*   Level `n=2`: `E₂ = 2² * E = 4E`\n*   Level `n=3`: `E₃ = 3² * E = 9E`\n*   Level `n=4`: `E₄ = 4² * E = 16E`\n*   and so on.\n\n**2. Apply the Pauli Exclusion Principle**\n\nThe problem states that the particles are identical spin-1/2 particles. This means they are **fermions** and must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n\nIn this system, a quantum state is defined by two numbers: the energy level `n` and the spin (either spin-up or spin-down).

Being spin-1/2 particles, they are fermions.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** As fermions, they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state is defined by all its quantum numbers, in this case, the energy level `n` and the spin `m_s`.\n*   **Potential Well:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The energy levels for a single particle in this potential are given by:\n    `E_n = n^2 * (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2mL^2)` where `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`\n*   **Energy Unit:** The problem defines the base energy unit as `E = (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2mL^2)`. Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as `E_n = n^2 * E`.\n*   **Spin States:** For each energy level `n`, there are two possible spin states (spin-up, `m_s = +1/2`, and spin-down, `m_s = -1/2`). This means each energy level `n` can hold at most two fermions.\n\n### **1.

We can place two fermions in this level, one with spin-up and one with spin-down. The energy contributed by these two particles is `2 * E_1 = 2 * (1^2 * E) = 2E`.\n2.  The next two fermions go into the `n=2` energy level, again with opposite spins. The energy contributed by these two particles is `2 * E_2 = 2 * (2^2 * E) = 8E`.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n**E_ground** = 2E + 8E = **10E**\n\n### **2. First Excited State Energy**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (`n=3`).\n\n*   The particle configuration becomes: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n\nThe total energy for the first excited state is:\n**E_first** = (2 * E₁) + (1 * E₂) + (1 * E₃) = (2 * 1² * E) + (1 * 2² * E) + (1 * 3² * E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**\n\n### **3. Second Excited State Energy**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We must consider the possible transitions that lead to the next lowest total energy:\n\n*   **Possibility A:** Promote the second particle from `n=2` (from the ground state) to `n=3`. The configuration would be two particles in `n=1` and two particles in `n=3`.\n    *   Energy = (2 * E₁) + (2 * E₃) = (2 * 1² * E) + (2 * 3² * E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n*   **Possibility B:** Promote the particle from `n=3` (in the first excited state) to the next level, `n=4`. The configuration would be two particles in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, and one in `n=4`.\n    *   Energy = (2 * E₁) + (1 * E₂) + (1 * E₄) = (2 * 1² * E) + (1 * 2² * E) + (1 * 4² * E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n*   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from `n=1` (from the ground state) to `n=3`. This leaves one particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, and one in `n=3`.\n    *   Energy = (1 * E₁) + (2 * E₂) + (1 * E₃) = (1 * 1² * E) + (2 * 2² * E) + (1 * 3² * E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n\nComparing the energies of these possible excited states (20E, 22E, 18E), the lowest energy is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the second excited state energy is:\n**E_second** = **18E**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe energies for the three states are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis sequence matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\n### Analysis of the System\n\n1.  **Single-Particle Energy Levels**: For a particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L, the allowed energy levels are given by E_n = n² * E, where E = π²ħ² / (2mL²) and n is a positive integer (n=1, 2, 3, ...).\n\n2.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle**: The system consists of four identical spin-1/2 particles, which are fermions. According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state for a particle in this well is defined by its energy level 'n' and its spin orientation (up or down).

This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. In this system, a quantum state is defined by the energy level (n) and the spin (up or down). Consequently, each energy level can hold a maximum of two particles, one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n**Ground State Energy**\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles.\n*   Two particles occupy the n=1 level.\n*   The remaining two particles occupy the n=2 level.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of the four particles:\nE_ground = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\n**First Excited State Energy**\nThe first excited state is the lowest-energy configuration achievable by moving one particle from the ground state arrangement to a higher, unoccupied energy level. The least energetic promotion is to move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   Two particles remain in the n=1 level.\n*   One particle remains in the n=2 level.\n*   One particle is promoted to the n=3 level.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\nE_first = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\n**Second Excited State Energy**\nFor the second excited state, we must find the next lowest energy configuration. There are a few possibilities for excitation from the ground state:\n1.  Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3. The configuration would be: one particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (1 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n2.  Promote two particles from n=2 to n=3. The configuration would be: two particles in n=1 and two in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₃) = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n3.  Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4. The configuration would be: two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4.\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₄) = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n\nComparing these energies, the lowest value is 18E. Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is 18E.\n\nThe energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the System:** The problem involves four identical spin-1/2 particles. These particles are fermions, which means they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. They are confined to a 1D infinite potential well.\n\n2.  **Single-Particle Energy Levels:** The energy for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well is given by `E_n = n^2 * (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2mL^2)`. The problem defines a base energy unit `E = (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2mL^2)`, so the energy of the n-th level is simply `E_n = n^2 * E`.\n\n3.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. For this system, a quantum state is defined by the principal quantum number `n` (energy level) and the spin quantum number `m_s` (spin up or spin down). This means each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n4.  **Calculate Ground State Energy (E_ground):** To find the ground state energy, we must fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles.\n    *   The lowest level is `n=1`. We can place two particles here (one spin up, one spin down). Their combined energy is `2 * E_1 = 2 * (1^2 * E) = 2E`.\n    *   The next lowest level is `n=2`. We place the remaining two particles here. Their combined energy is `2 * E_2 = 2 * (2^2 * E) = 8E`.\n    *   The total ground state energy is the sum: `E_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n\n5.  **Calculate First Excited State Energy (E_first):** To get the first excited state, we promote one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state to the next available unoccupied level.\n    *   The ground state configuration has particles in `n=1` and `n=2`.\n    *   We promote one particle from `n=2` to the next level, `n=3`.\n    *   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, and one in `n=3`.\n    *   The total energy is: `(2 * 1^2 * E) + (1 * 2^2 * E) + (1 * 3^2 * E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n6.  **Calculate Second Excited State Energy (E_second):** This is the state with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We must consider different possible promotions from the ground state.\n    *   **Possibility 1:** Promote a particle from `n=1` to `n=3`. The configuration becomes: one particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, and one in `n=3`.\n        *   Energy = `(1 * 1^2 * E) + (2 * 2^2 * E) + (1 * 3^2 * E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n    *   **Possibility 2:** Promote both particles from `n=2` to `n=3`. The configuration becomes: two particles in `n=1` and two in `n=3`.\n        *   Energy = `(2 * 1^2 * E) + (2 * 3^2 * E) = 2E + 18E = 20E`.\n    *   The lower of these energies is 18E. Therefore, the second excited state energy is `18E`.\n\n7.  **Final Result:** The energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively.

Consequently, each energy level 'n' can hold a maximum of two particles, one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n### Calculating the System Energies\n\nWe will now fill the energy levels with the four particles to find the total energy for the ground and excited states.\n\n**Ground State (Lowest Energy)**\n\nTo achieve the lowest possible total energy, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up:\n*   **n=1 (Energy E₁ = 1²E = 1E):** We place two particles in this level (one spin up, one spin down).\n*   **n=2 (Energy E₂ = 2²E = 4E):** We place the remaining two particles in this level (one spin up, one spin down).\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\nE_ground = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) = 2E + 8E = **10E**\n\n**First Excited State**\n\nTo find the first excited state, we move one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state configuration to the next available unoccupied energy level. This corresponds to promoting one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   **n=1 (Energy E₁ = 1E):** Two particles.\n*   **n=2 (Energy E₂ = 4E):** One particle.\n*   **n=3 (Energy E₃ = 3²E = 9E):** One particle.\n\nThe total energy for the first excited state is:\nE_1st_excited = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**\n\n**Second Excited State**\n\nFor the second excited state, we must find the next lowest energy configuration. There are a few possibilities for excitation from the ground state:\n1.  Promote the other particle from n=2 to n=3: (2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=3).\n    *   Energy = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n2.  Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4: (2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4).\n    *   Energy = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 4²E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n3.  Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3: (1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3).\n    *   Energy = (1 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n\nComparing these energies, the lowest energy configuration after the first excited state is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the energies are:\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo determine the energies of the system, we must first understand the behavior of the four identical spin-1/2 particles within the one-dimensional infinite potential well. These particles are fermions and therefore must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n\nThe energy levels for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L are quantized and given by the formula:\nE_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)\n\nThe problem defines the ground state energy unit as E = π²ħ² / 2mL². Thus, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as:\nE_n = n²E, where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nFor spin-1/2 particles, each energy level 'n' can hold a maximum of two particles, one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n**Ground State Energy**\n\nTo find the ground state energy of the four-particle system, we fill the lowest available energy levels first.\n*   Two particles will occupy the n=1 energy level. The energy for these two particles is 2 * E₁ = 2 * (1²E) = 2E.\n*   The remaining two particles will occupy the n=2 energy level. The energy for these two particles is 2 * E₂ = 2 * (2²E) = 2 * 4E = 8E.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\nE_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\n**First Excited State Energy**\n\nTo obtain the first excited state, we promote one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (n=3).\n*   The configuration becomes: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n*   The total energy for this configuration is:\n    E_first = (2 * E₁) + (1 * E₂) + (1 * E₃)\n    E_first = (2 * 1²E) + (1 * 2²E) + (1 * 3²E)\n    E_first = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\n**Second Excited State Energy**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest total energy above the first excited state. We must consider the possible single-particle promotions from the ground state that result in the lowest energy increase after the first excited state.\n*   **Possibility 1:** Promote a particle from n=2 to n=3 (as in the first excited state) and another from n=2 to n=3. This is not possible as it would mean exciting the same particle twice. A better way to think about it is exciting the second particle from n=2 to n=3. The configuration would be two particles in n=1 and two particles in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (2 * E₁) + (2 * E₃) = (2 * 1²E) + (2 * 3²E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n*   **Possibility 2:** Promote a particle from a lower level, n=1, to the lowest available level, n=3. The configuration would be one particle in n=1, two particles in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 * E₁) + (2 * E₂) + (1 * E₃)\n    *   Energy = (1 * 1²E) + (2 * 2²E) + (1 * 3²E)\n    *   Energy = E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n\nComparing the possible excitation energies (15E, 18E, 20E), the second lowest energy after the ground state is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the energies are:\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo determine the energies of the system, we must consider the properties of the particles and the potential well.\n\n### 1. Single-Particle Energy Levels\n\nFor a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L, the allowed energy levels are quantized. The energy for each level `n` (where `n` = 1, 2, 3, ...) is given by:\n\nE_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)\n\nThe problem defines a base energy unit E = π²ħ² / 2mL². Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as:\n*   E₁ = 1²E = E\n*   E₂ = 2²E = 4E\n*   E₃ = 3²E = 9E\n*   E₄ = 4²E = 16E\n*   and so on.\n\n### 2. Pauli Exclusion Principle\n\nThe particles are specified as spin-1/2, which means they are fermions. Fermions are subject to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. In this system, a quantum state is defined by the energy level `n` and the spin state (spin-up or spin-down). This means each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles, one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n### 3. Calculating the System Energies\n\nTo find the total energy of the four-particle system, we sum the energies of the individual particles.\n\n*   **Ground State (Lowest Energy):**\n    To achieve the lowest possible total energy, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up.\n    *   Two particles go into the n=1 level (one spin-up, one spin-down). Their combined energy is 2 × E₁ = 2E.\n    *   The remaining two particles go into the n=2 level (one spin-up, one spin-down). Their combined energy is 2 × E₂ = 2 × 4E = 8E.\n    *   **Total Ground State Energy** = 2E + 8E = **10E**.\n\n*   **First Excited State (Next Lowest Energy):**\n    To get the first excited state, we must promote one particle from the ground state configuration to the lowest available energy level. The lowest energy excitation involves moving a particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied level (n=3).\n    *   The new configuration is: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n    *   Energy from n=1 level: 2 × E₁ = 2E.\n    *   Energy from n=2 level: 1 × E₂ = 4E.\n    *   Energy from n=3 level: 1 × E₃ = 9E.\n    *   **Total First Excited State Energy** = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**.\n\n*   **Second Excited State (Third Lowest Energy):**\n    There are two possibilities for the next lowest excitation from the ground state:\n    1.  Promote a particle from the n=1 level to the n=3 level.\n    2.  Promote a particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level (this was the first excited state), and then promote the second particle from n=2 to n=3.\n\n    Let's calculate the energy for the first possibility, which is the most likely candidate for the second excited state:\n    *   The configuration becomes: one particle in n=1, two particles in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n    *   Energy from n=1 level: 1 × E₁ = E.\n    *   Energy from n=2 level: 2 × E₂ = 2 × 4E = 8E.\n    *   Energy from n=3 level: 1 × E₃ = 9E.\n    *   **Total Second Excited State Energy** = E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n\n    Let's check other possibilities to be certain. For instance, moving one particle from n=2 to n=4 would result in a total energy of 2E (from n=1) + 4E (from n=2) + 16E (from n=4) = 22E, which is higher. Moving both particles from n=2 to n=3 gives 2E + 2*(9E) = 20E, also higher. Therefore, 18E is the correct energy for the second excited state.\n\nThe energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step calculation to determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for the system.\n\n**1.

Since they are identical and have half-integer spin, they are fermions.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. For a particle in a 1D potential well, a quantum state is defined by its principal quantum number (n) and its spin projection quantum number (m_s).\n*   **Energy Levels:** The energy levels for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L are given by:\n    $E_n = n^2 * (\\frac{π^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2})$\n    where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n*   **Given Energy Unit (E):** The problem defines $E = \\frac{π^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. So, the single-particle energy levels can be written as:\n    $E_n = n^2 E$\n*   **State Occupancy:** Since the particles are spin-1/2, their spin can be either \"up\" (m_s = +1/2) or \"down\" (m_s = -1/2). According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, each energy level *n* can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n**2. Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_gs)**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four fermions, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **n = 1 level (Energy E₁ = 1²E = E):** We can place two particles in this level (one spin up, one spin down).\n*   **n = 2 level (Energy E₂ = 2²E = 4E):** We have two particles remaining, so we place them in this next available level (one spin up, one spin down).\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n$E_{gs} = (1E + 1E) + (4E + 4E) = 2 \\times E_1 + 2 \\times E_2$\n$E_{gs} = 2(E) + 2(4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E$\n\n**3.

Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\n\nTo find the second excited state, we must find the next-lowest energy configuration above the first excited state. We must consider all possible low-energy excitations from the ground state.\n\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E (from configuration: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3).\n*   Let's consider other possible single-particle promotions from the ground state:\n    *   **Option 1: Promote a particle from n=1 to n=3.**\n        *   Configuration: 1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3.\n        *   Energy = $1 \\times E_1 + 2 \\times E_2 + 1 \\times E_3 = 1(E) + 2(4E) + 1(9E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n    *   **Option 2: Promote a particle from n=2 to n=4.**\n        *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=4.\n        *   Energy = $2 \\times E_1 + 1 \\times E_2 + 1 \\times E_4 = 2(E) + 1(4E) + 1(16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n    *   **Option 3: Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3 (a two-particle excitation).**\n        *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=3.\n        *   Energy = $2 \\times E_1 + 2 \\times E_3 = 2(E) + 2(9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n\nComparing the energies of the possible excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E, ...), the second lowest energy after the ground state (10E) is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the second excited state energy is **18E**.\n\n**Summary of Energies:**\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nThis problem involves calculating the energy states of four identical spin-1/2 particles within a one-dimensional infinite potential well.

A quantum state is defined by all its quantum numbers.\n*   **Quantum Numbers:** For a particle in a 1D well, the state is defined by the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (which can be +1/2 for spin-up or -1/2 for spin-down).\n\n**2.

Key Principles**\n\n*   **Particles:** The particles are spin-1/2, which classifies them as fermions.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions are subject to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. For this system, a quantum state is defined by its principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and its spin (up or down). Therefore, each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of two particles.\n*   **Single-Particle Energy Levels:** The energy for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well is given by `E_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)`. The problem defines the base unit of energy as `E = π²ħ² / 2mL²`. So, the energy of a particle in the nth level is simply `E_n = n²E`.\n\n**2. Ground State Energy (Lowest Energy State)**\n\nTo find the ground state energy, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up with the four particles, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **n = 1 level (Energy E₁ = 1²E = E):** Place the first two particles here.\n*   **n = 2 level (Energy E₂ = 2²E = 4E):** Place the remaining two particles here.\n\nThe total energy for the ground state is the sum of the individual particle energies:\nE_ground = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) = (2 × E) + (2 × 4E) = 2E + 8E = **10E**.\n\n**3. First Excited State Energy**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (n=3).\n\n*   The particle configuration becomes:\n    *   Two particles in the n=1 level (Energy: 2 × E₁ = 2E)\n    *   One particle in the n=2 level (Energy: 1 × E₂ = 4E)\n    *   One particle in the n=3 level (Energy: 1 × E₃ = 3²E = 9E)\n\nThe total energy for the first excited state is:\nE_first = (2E) + (4E) + (9E) = **15E**.\n\n**4. Second Excited State Energy**\n\nThe second excited state has the next lowest energy. We need to find the excitation from the ground state that requires the second-smallest amount of energy.\n\n*   **First Excitation (already found):** Promoting a particle from n=2 to n=3 gives the first excited state with energy 15E (an increase of 5E from the ground state).\n*   **Next Lowest Excitation:** Consider promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3.\n    *   The new configuration is: one particle in n=1, two particles in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n    *   Total Energy = (1 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (1 × E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n\nWe can check other possibilities to confirm this is the correct state. For example, promoting a particle from n=2 to n=4 would result in an energy of 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E, which is higher than 18E. Promoting two particles from n=2 to n=3 gives an energy of 2E + 18E = 20E, also higher.\n\nTherefore, the second excited state has an energy of 18E.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nThe problem asks for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n### **1.

The problem defines the energy unit `E = (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2mL^2)`, so the single-particle energy levels are `En = n^2 * E`, where `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`.\n2.  **Identical Spin-1/2 Particles:** These particles are fermions.\n3.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** No two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. For a particle in this potential well, a quantum state is defined by its energy quantum number `n` and its spin projection (`ms = +1/2` for spin up or `ms = -1/2` for spin down). This means each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles, one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n### Calculation of System Energies\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the four individual particles. To find the energies of the different states, we must fill the single-particle energy levels according to the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **Single-particle energy levels:**\n    *   `E1 = 1^2 * E = 1E`\n    *   `E2 = 2^2 * E = 4E`\n    *   `E3 = 3^2 * E = 9E`\n    *   `E4 = 4^2 * E = 16E`\n    *   and so on...\n\n#### Ground State Energy\n\nTo achieve the ground state (the lowest possible total energy), we fill the lowest available energy levels first.\n\n*   Two particles go into the `n=1` level (one spin up, one spin down).\n*   The remaining two particles go into the `n=2` level (one spin up, one spin down).\n\nThe total ground state energy is:\n`E_ground = (2 * E1) + (2 * E2) = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E`\n\n#### First Excited State Energy\n\nTo get the first excited state, we need to make the smallest possible energy jump from the ground state configuration. This is achieved by moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (`n=3`).\n\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n\nThe total first excited state energy is:\n`E_first_excited = (2 * E1) + (1 * E2) + (1 * E3) = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`\n\n#### Second Excited State Energy\n\nTo find the second excited state, we consider the next possible low-energy excitations from the ground state. There are two primary possibilities to create a state with energy higher than the first excited state:\n\n1.  **Promote a particle from `n=2` to `n=4`**:\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, one in `n=4`.\n    *   Energy = `(2 * E1) + (1 * E2) + (1 * E4) = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`.\n\n2.  **Promote a particle from `n=1` to `n=3`**:\n    *   Configuration: One particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, one in `n=3`.\n    *   Energy = `(1 * E1) + (2 * E2) + (1 * E3) = (1 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n\nComparing the possible energies, the lower value is 18E. Thus, this is the energy of the second excited state.\n\n### Summary of Energies:\n\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step calculation of the energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system.\n\n### 1.

According to the spin-statistics theorem, particles with half-integer spin are fermions. A key property of fermions is that they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n2.  **Define Quantum States:** For a particle in a 1D infinite potential well, a quantum state is defined by its principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and its spin quantum number `m_s` (spin-up, +1/2, or spin-down, -1/2).\n3.  **Energy Levels:** The energy of a single particle in a 1D infinite well is given by `E_n = n^2 * (pi^2 * h_bar^2) / (2mL^2)`. The problem defines the base energy unit as `E = (pi^2 * h_bar^2) / (2mL^2)`, so the single-particle energy levels are simply `E_n = n^2 * E`.\n4.  **Apply Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Since each energy level `n` can accommodate two fermions (one with spin-up and one with spin-down), we will fill these levels starting from the lowest energy (`n=1`) to find the total energy of the multi-particle system.\n5.  **Calculate Ground State Energy (E_g):** To find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four fermions.\n    *   Place two fermions in the `n=1` level (E_1 = 1²E = 1E).\n    *   Place the remaining two fermions in the `n=2` level (E_2 = 2²E = 4E).\n    *   The total ground state energy is the sum: E_g = 2 * E_1 + 2 * E_2.\n6.  **Calculate First Excited State Energy (E_1st):** To get the first excited state, we promote one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state to the next available empty level.\n    *   Move one particle from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n    *   The configuration becomes: two particles in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, and one in `n=3`.\n    *   The total energy is: E_1st = 2 * E_1 + 1 * E_2 + 1 * E_3.\n7.  **Calculate Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd):** This is the state with the next lowest energy. We must consider different possibilities for excitation from the ground state:\n    *   **Case a):** Promote one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`. The configuration is: one in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, one in `n=3`.\n    *   **Case b):** Promote the second particle from `n=2` to `n=3`. The configuration is: two in `n=1`, zero in `n=2`, two in `n=3`.\n    *   **Case c):** Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`. The configuration is: two in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, one in `n=4`.\n    *   Calculate the energy for each case and the lowest of these will be the second excited state energy.\n8.  **Final Comparison:** Compare the calculated energies (E_g, E_1st, E_2nd) with the given options to find the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_particle_energy_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the energies of the ground state, first excited state,\n    and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in\n    a 1D infinite potential well.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The energy of a single particle in level n is n^2 * E.\n    # We will calculate the total energy in units of E.\n    \n    # --- Ground State ---\n    # To get the lowest total energy (ground state), we fill the lowest\n    # available energy levels.

For an electron in a 1D box, a quantum state is defined by both its energy level (principal quantum number *n*) and its spin state (*m_s* = +1/2 or -1/2).\n4.  **State Occupancy:** As a consequence of the Pauli principle, each energy level *n* can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n5.  **Energy Levels:** The energy for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well is given by E_n = n² * (π²ħ²/2mL²). The problem conveniently defines the base energy unit as E = π²ħ²/2mL², so the energy of the n-th level is simply E_n = n²E.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n**Step 1: List the single-particle energy levels.**\nUsing the formula E_n = n²E, we can list the first few energy levels:\n*   E₁ (n=1) = 1²E = 1E\n*   E₂ (n=2) = 2²E = 4E\n*   E₃ (n=3) = 3²E = 9E\n*   E₄ (n=4) = 4²E = 16E\n*   ...and so on.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Ground State Energy.**\nTo find the ground state, we must place the four fermions into the lowest possible energy levels without violating the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n*   The n=1 level can hold two particles.\n*   The n=2 level can hold two particles.\n*   We place two particles in the n=1 level and the remaining two particles in the n=2 level.\n*   The total energy of the ground state (E_gs) is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n    E_gs = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₂)\n    E_gs = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) = 2E + 8E = **10E**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the First Excited State Energy.**\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level (in the ground state) to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n*   Ground state configuration: Two particles in n=1, two in n=2.\n*   Highest occupied level is n=2.\n*   Lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n*   Promote one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n*   The total energy of the first excited state (E_1st) is:\n    E_1st = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃)\n    E_1st = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Second Excited State Energy.**\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state.

This is the first excited state.\n*   **Possibility 2:** Excite one particle from a lower level, n=1, to the lowest unoccupied level, n=3.\n    *   Configuration: One particle in n=1, two particles in n=2, one particle in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (1 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n*   **Possibility 3:** Excite one particle from n=2 to the next unoccupied level, n=4.\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4.\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₄) = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n*   **Possibility 4 (two-particle excitation):** Excite both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₃) = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n\nComparing the possible excitation energies (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E), the lowest is 15E (first excited state) and the next lowest is 18E.

The energy would be (2×E₁) + (1×E₂) + (1×E₄) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n    *   **Possibility B**: Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3. This is a valid excitation because the n=2 level is not fully occupied in the resulting state. The configuration becomes: one particle in n=1, two particles in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n    *   The total energy for Possibility B is:\n        E₂ = (1 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (1 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n    *   Comparing the possible excitation energies (15E, 18E, 22E, etc.), the second lowest energy above the ground state is 18E.\n\n7.  **Final Results and Conclusion**:\n    *   Ground State Energy = 10E\n    *   First Excited State Energy = 15E\n    *   Second Excited State Energy = 18E\n    These values match option D.

First Excited State Energy (E₁)**\n\nTo find the energy of the first excited state, one particle is promoted from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n*   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is n=2 and the lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n*   Therefore, one particle moves from n=2 to n=3.\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\nE₁ = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃)\nE₁ = (2 × 1²E) + (1 × 2²E) + (1 × 3²E)\nE₁ = 2E + 4E + 9E\n**E₁ = 15E**\n\n**3. Second Excited State Energy (E₂)**\n\nFor the second excited state, we must find the next lowest energy configuration starting from the ground state. There are a few possibilities for excitation:\n*   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: One particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (1 × 1²E) + (2 × 2²E) + (1 × 3²E) = E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n*   **Possibility B:** Promote the second particle from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, zero in n=2, and two in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₃) = (2 × 1²E) + (2 × 3²E) = 2E + 18E = **20E**.\n*   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4.\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₄) = (2 × 1²E) + (1 × 2²E) + (1 × 4²E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = **22E**.\n\nComparing the possible energies (18E, 20E, and 22E), the lowest energy after the first excited state (15E) is 18E.\n\n**E₂ = 18E**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is the step-by-step calculation for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state.\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n1.  **Infinite Potential Well:** For a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L, the allowed energy levels are given by `En = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)`, where `n` is a positive integer (n=1, 2, 3, ...). The problem defines `E = π²ħ² / 2mL²`, so the single-particle energy levels are `En = n²E`.\n2.  **Spin-1/2 Particles:** The particles are fermions.\n3.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Since the particles are identical fermions, no two particles can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state is defined by its energy level (n) and its spin (up or down). This means each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n### Single-Particle Energy Levels\n\n*   n=1: E₁ = 1²E = 1E\n*   n=2: E₂ = 2²E = 4E\n*   n=3: E₃ = 3²E = 9E\n*   n=4: E₄ = 4²E = 16E\n\n### Calculation of System Energies\n\n#### Ground State\n\nTo find the ground state energy, we fill the lowest available single-particle energy levels with the four particles, following the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\n*   Two particles go into the `n=1` level (one spin up, one spin down).\n*   The remaining two particles go into the `n=2` level (one spin up, one spin down).\n\nThe total energy is the sum of the energies of the four particles:\n*   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₂)\n*   Energy = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) = 2E + 8E = **10E**\n\n#### First Excited State\n\nTo find the energy of the first excited state, we promote one particle from the ground state configuration to the next available higher energy level. This means moving one particle from the `n=2` level to the `n=3` level.\n\n*   Two particles remain in the `n=1` level.\n*   One particle remains in the `n=2` level.\n*   One particle is promoted to the `n=3` level.\n\nThe total energy is:\n*   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃)\n*   Energy = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**\n\n#### Second Excited State\n\nTo find the second excited state, we look for the next lowest energy configuration after the first excited state. There are a few possibilities starting from the ground state configuration:\n\n1.  Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4.\n    *   Energy = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n2.  Promote both particles from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n3.  Promote one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`.\n    *   Configuration: 1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n\nComparing the possible energies (18E, 20E, 22E), the lowest value is 18E. Therefore, this is the energy of the second excited state.\n\n### Summary\n\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State Energy:** 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nThis problem requires us to determine the energies of the three lowest states for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n### 1. Fundamental Principles\n\n*   **Particles:** The particles are spin-1/2, which means they are **fermions**.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** As fermions, no two particles can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state is defined by its full set of quantum numbers.\n*   **Quantum States in a 1D Well:** For a particle in a 1D infinite potential well of length L, the quantum state is defined by two numbers:\n    1.  The principal quantum number `n`, where `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`\n    2.  The spin magnetic quantum number `m_s`, which can be `+1/2` (spin up) or `-1/2` (spin down).\n*   **Energy Levels:** The energy of a single particle in the `n`-th level is given by:\n    `E_n = n^2 * (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2mL^2)`\n    The problem defines a base energy unit `E = (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2mL^2)`. Therefore, the energy of a single particle in level `n` is simply `E_n = n^2 * E`.\n\n### 2. State Configurations\n\nBecause of the Pauli Exclusion Principle, each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down. To find the total energy of the system, we sum the energies of the four individual particles. We must fill the energy levels in a way that corresponds to the ground state (lowest total energy), the first excited state (next lowest total energy), and so on.\n\nLet's list the single-particle energies:\n*   `E_1 = 1^2 * E = 1E`\n*   `E_2 = 2^2 * E = 4E`\n*   `E_3 = 3^2 * E = 9E`\n*   `E_4 = 4^2 * E = 16E`\n*   ...and so on.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Energies\n\nTo make this systematic, we can think of having a pool of available single-particle states, defined by their energy level `n`. Since each level can hold two particles, our pool of levels to choose from is `{1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, ...}`. We need to pick four levels for our four particles.\n\n**A) Ground State (E_gs)**\n\nTo obtain the lowest possible total energy, we must occupy the lowest available energy levels. We place two particles in the `n=1` level and two particles in the `n=2` level.\n\n*   Two particles in `n=1`: Energy = `2 * E_1 = 2 * (1E) = 2E`\n*   Two particles in `n=2`: Energy = `2 * E_2 = 2 * (4E) = 8E`\n*   **Total Ground State Energy:** `E_gs = 2E + 8E = 10E`\n\nThe configuration is (2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2).\n\n**B) First Excited State (E_1st)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest energy above the ground state. We create this state by promoting one particle from the ground state configuration to the next available higher energy level. The lowest-energy promotion is to move a particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n\n*   Configuration: One particle is moved from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n    *   Two particles in `n=1`: Energy = `2 * E_1 = 2E`\n    *   One particle in `n=2`: Energy = `1 * E_2 = 4E`\n    *   One particle in `n=3`: Energy = `1 * E_3 = 9E`\n*   **Total First Excited State Energy:** `E_1st = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`\n\n**C) Second Excited State (E_2nd)**\n\nThis is the state with the next lowest energy. We must consider all possible excitations from the ground state and find the second-cheapest one in terms of energy cost.\n\n1.  **First Excitation (already found):** Move a particle from `n=2` to `n=3`. Energy cost `ΔE = E_3 - E_2 = 9E - 4E = 5E`. Total Energy = `10E + 5E = 15E`.\n2.  **Second-Lowest Excitation:** Let's compare other possibilities:\n    *   **Option 1: Move a particle from `n=1` to `n=3`**.\n        *   Energy cost `ΔE = E_3 - E_1 = 9E - 1E = 8E`.\n        *   New configuration: One particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, one in `n=3`.\n        *   Total Energy = `(1*E_1) + (2*E_2) + (1*E_3) = 1E + 2*(4E) + 9E = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n    *   **Option 2: Move a particle from `n=2` to `n=4`**.\n        *   Energy cost `ΔE = E_4 - E_2 = 16E - 4E = 12E`.\n        *   Total Energy = `10E + 12E = 22E`.\n    *   **Option 3: Move two particles from `n=2` to `n=3`**.\n        *   Energy cost `ΔE = 2 * (E_3 - E_2) = 2 * (5E) = 10E`.\n        *   Total Energy = `10E + 10E = 20E`.\n\nComparing the total energies of these excited states (`15E`, `18E`, `20E`, `22E`), the lowest is `15E` (the first excited state), and the next lowest is `18E`.\n\n*   **Total Second Excited State Energy:** `E_2nd = 18E`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nThis problem requires us to determine the energies of the ground state and the first two excited states for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n**1. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nThe energy levels for a single particle of mass `m` in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length `L` are given by:\nE_n = (n^2 * pi^2 * h_bar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)\nwhere `n` is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n\nThe problem defines a unit of energy E = (pi^2 * h_bar^2) / (2 * m * L^2). Therefore, we can express the single-particle energy levels as:\nE_n = n^2 * E\n\nLet's list the first few energy levels:\n*   E_1 = 1^2 * E = 1E\n*   E_2 = 2^2 * E = 4E\n*   E_3 = 3^2 * E = 9E\n*   E_4 = 4^2 * E = 16E\n*   ...and so on.\n\n**2. Pauli Exclusion Principle**\n\nThe particles are spin-1/2 particles, which means they are fermions. Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state here is defined by the principal quantum number `n` and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (which can be +1/2 for spin up or -1/2 for spin down).\n\nThis principle implies that each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n**3. Ground State Energy (E_gs)**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles.\n*   We place the first two particles in the lowest energy level, n=1. One will have spin up, and the other will have spin down.\n*   We place the remaining two particles in the next lowest energy level, n=2. Again, one will be spin up, and the other spin down.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\nE_gs = (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_2)\nE_gs = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 4E)\nE_gs = 2E + 8E = 10E\n\n**4. First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. We achieve this by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n*   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is n=2.\n*   The lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n*   We move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n\nThe new configuration is:\n*   Two particles in n=1.\n*   One particle in n=2.\n*   One particle in n=3.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\nE_1st = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_3)\nE_1st = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E)\nE_1st = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E\n\n**5. Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We need to consider all possible excitations from the ground state and find the second lowest total energy (after the first excited state).\n\nLet's list the energies of the lowest possible configurations:\n*   **Ground State:** 2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2. Energy = 2*E1 + 2*E2 = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n*   **Excitation A (First Excited State):** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=3. Configuration: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3. Energy = 2*E1 + 1*E2 + 1*E3 = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n*   **Excitation B:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3. Configuration: 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3. Energy = 1*E1 + 2*E2 + 1*E3 = 1E + 2*(4E) + 9E = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n*   **Excitation C:** Promote two particles from n=2 to n=3. Configuration: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=3. Energy = 2*E1 + 2*E3 = 2E + 2*(9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n*   **Excitation D:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4. Configuration: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4. Energy = 2*E1 + 1*E2 + 1*E4 = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n\nComparing the total energies of these excited states:\n1.  15E (This is the First Excited State)\n2.  18E (This is the Second Excited State)\n3.  20E (This is the Third Excited State)\n...and so on.\n\nThe energy of the second excited state is 18E.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: 10E\n*   First Excited State: 15E\n*   Second Excited State: 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nFor a single particle of mass `m` in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length `L`, the allowed energy levels are given by the formula:\n`E_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)`, where `n` is a positive integer (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n\nThe problem conveniently defines the base unit of energy `E = π²ħ² / 2mL²`. We can therefore express the energy of each single-particle level as a simple multiple of `E`:\n*   Level `n=1`: `E₁ = 1² * E = 1E`\n*   Level `n=2`: `E₂ = 2² * E = 4E`\n*   Level `n=3`: `E₃ = 3² * E = 9E`\n*   Level `n=4`: `E₄ = 4² * E = 16E`\n*   and so on.\n\n**2. Apply the Pauli Exclusion Principle**\n\nThe problem states that the particles are identical spin-1/2 particles. This means they are **fermions** and must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n\nIn this system, a quantum state is defined by two numbers: the energy level `n` and the spin (either spin-up or spin-down). Therefore, each energy level `E_n` can hold a maximum of **two** particles.\n\n**3.

A quantum state is defined by all its quantum numbers, in this case, the principal quantum number `n` and the spin quantum number `ms`.\n*   **Potential:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The single-particle energy levels for this potential are given by:\n    $E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\n    where `n = 1, 2, 3, ...` is the principal quantum number.\n*   **Energy Unit:** The problem defines a base energy unit $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.

This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. Since spin is a quantum number, each energy level 'n' can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n### Calculation of State Energies\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the individual particles.\n\n**1. Ground State Energy**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles.\n*   **Level n=1:** Can hold two particles (spin up and spin down). Their combined energy is 2 × E₁ = 2 × (1²E) = 2E.\n*   **Level n=2:** Can hold the remaining two particles (spin up and spin down). Their combined energy is 2 × E₂ = 2 × (2²E) = 2 × 4E = 8E.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum:\nE_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\n**2. First Excited State Energy**\n\nTo get the first excited state, we promote one particle from the highest occupied level in the ground state (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied level (n=3).\n*   **Level n=1:** Still holds two particles. Energy = 2 × E₁ = 2E.\n*   **Level n=2:** Now holds one particle. Energy = 1 × E₂ = 1 × (2²E) = 4E.\n*   **Level n=3:** Now holds one particle. Energy = 1 × E₃ = 1 × (3²E) = 9E.\n\nThe total first excited state energy is the sum:\nE_first_excited = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\n**3. Second Excited State Energy**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest total energy above the first excited state. We must consider the different possibilities for exciting particles from the ground state:\n*   **Possibility A:** Excite a particle from n=2 to n=4. The configuration would be: two particles in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4.\n    *   Energy = (2 × 1²E) + (1 × 2²E) + (1 × 4²E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n*   **Possibility B:** Excite both particles from n=2 to n=3. The configuration would be: two particles in n=1, two in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (2 × 1²E) + (2 × 3²E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n*   **Possibility C:** Excite one particle from n=1 to n=3. The configuration would be: one particle in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 × 1²E) + (2 × 2²E) + (1 × 3²E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n\nComparing the energies of these excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E), the third lowest energy for the system corresponds to the second excited state.\nE_second_excited = 18E.\n\nThus, the energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a step-by-step calculation for the energies of the system.\n\n### **Understanding the System**\n\n*   **Particles:** The system contains four identical spin-1/2 particles. Being spin-1/2 particles, they are fermions.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** As fermions, they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state is defined by all its quantum numbers, in this case, the energy level `n` and the spin `m_s`.\n*   **Potential Well:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The energy levels for a single particle in this potential are given by:\n    `E_n = n^2 * (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2mL^2)` where `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`\n*   **Energy Unit:** The problem defines the base energy unit as `E = (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2mL^2)`. Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as `E_n = n^2 * E`.\n*   **Spin States:** For each energy level `n`, there are two possible spin states (spin-up, `m_s = +1/2`, and spin-down, `m_s = -1/2`). This means each energy level `n` can hold at most two fermions.\n\n### **1. Ground State Energy**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four fermions, following the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n1.  The lowest energy level is `n=1`. We can place two fermions in this level, one with spin-up and one with spin-down. The energy contributed by these two particles is `2 * E_1 = 2 * (1^2 * E) = 2E`.\n2.  The next two fermions go into the `n=2` energy level, again with opposite spins. The energy contributed by these two particles is `2 * E_2 = 2 * (2^2 * E) = 8E`.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n**E_ground** = 2E + 8E = **10E**\n\n### **2. First Excited State Energy**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (`n=3`).\n\n*   The particle configuration becomes: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n\nThe total energy for the first excited state is:\n**E_first** = (2 * E₁) + (1 * E₂) + (1 * E₃) = (2 * 1² * E) + (1 * 2² * E) + (1 * 3² * E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**\n\n### **3. Second Excited State Energy**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We must consider the possible transitions that lead to the next lowest total energy:\n\n*   **Possibility A:** Promote the second particle from `n=2` (from the ground state) to `n=3`. The configuration would be two particles in `n=1` and two particles in `n=3`.\n    *   Energy = (2 * E₁) + (2 * E₃) = (2 * 1² * E) + (2 * 3² * E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n*   **Possibility B:** Promote the particle from `n=3` (in the first excited state) to the next level, `n=4`. The configuration would be two particles in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, and one in `n=4`.\n    *   Energy = (2 * E₁) + (1 * E₂) + (1 * E₄) = (2 * 1² * E) + (1 * 2² * E) + (1 * 4² * E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n*   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from `n=1` (from the ground state) to `n=3`. This leaves one particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, and one in `n=3`.\n    *   Energy = (1 * E₁) + (2 * E₂) + (1 * E₃) = (1 * 1² * E) + (2 * 2² * E) + (1 * 3² * E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n\nComparing the energies of these possible excited states (20E, 22E, 18E), the lowest energy is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the second excited state energy is:\n**E_second** = **18E**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe energies for the three states are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis sequence matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\n### Analysis of the System\n\n1.  **Single-Particle Energy Levels**: For a particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L, the allowed energy levels are given by E_n = n² * E, where E = π²ħ² / (2mL²) and n is a positive integer (n=1, 2, 3, ...).\n\n2.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle**: The system consists of four identical spin-1/2 particles, which are fermions. According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state for a particle in this well is defined by its energy level 'n' and its spin orientation (up or down). Consequently, each energy level 'n' can hold a maximum of two particles, one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n### Calculation of Energy States\n\n*   **Ground State Energy**:\n    To find the ground state, we fill the lowest energy levels first.\n    *   The n=1 level can hold two particles. Their combined energy is 2 * E₁ = 2 * (1² * E) = 2E.\n    *   The remaining two particles will occupy the next lowest energy level, n=2. Their combined energy is 2 * E₂ = 2 * (2² * E) = 8E.\n    *   The total ground state energy is the sum of these energies: 2E + 8E = **10E**.\n\n*   **First Excited State Energy**:\n    The first excited state is achieved by moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level of the ground state to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n    *   In the ground state, the particles occupy the n=1 and n=2 levels. The highest occupied level is n=2.\n    *   The lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n    *   Promoting one particle from n=2 to n=3 results in the following configuration: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n    *   The total energy for this state is: (2 * E₁) + (1 * E₂) + (1 * E₃) = (2 * 1² * E) + (1 * 2² * E) + (1 * 3² * E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**.\n\n*   **Second Excited State Energy**:\n    To find the second excited state, we must identify the next possible energy configuration above the first excited state. Let's consider the possible excitations from the ground state:\n    1.  Promote one particle from n=2 to n=3: This gives the first excited state with energy 15E.\n    2.  Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3: The configuration is one particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. The energy is (1 * E₁) + (2 * E₂) + (1 * E₃) = (1 * E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n    3.  Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3: The configuration is two particles in n=1 and two in n=3. The energy is (2 * E₁) + (2 * E₃) = (2 * E) + (2 * 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n    4.  Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4: The configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. The energy is (2 * E₁) + (1 * E₂) + (1 * E₄) = (2 * E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n\n    Comparing the energies of these excited configurations (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E), the lowest is the first excited state (15E), and the next lowest is **18E**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated energies for the system are:\n*   **Ground State**: 10E\n*   **First Excited State**: 15E\n*   **Second Excited State**: 18E\n\nThis sequence matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
