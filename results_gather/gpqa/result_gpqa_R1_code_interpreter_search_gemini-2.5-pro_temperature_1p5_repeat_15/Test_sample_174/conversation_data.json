    "An oscillating charge distribution acts as a source of electromagnetic radiation. The properties of this radiation depend on the nature of the oscillation, which can be described by a multipole expansion. The lowest order and typically dominant form of radiation is electric dipole radiation, unless the oscillating electric dipole moment is zero by symmetry.\n\n**1. Physical Model Selection**\n\nThe problem describes an \"oscillating charge distribution\" with a spheroidal shape and a symmetry axis (the z-axis). A simple and direct interpretation of this is that charge is oscillating along the z-axis. For instance, positive and negative charges could be oscillating relative to each other. This creates a time-varying electric dipole moment, `p_z(t)`. In the absence of specific constraints that would cancel out the dipole contribution (like certain shape oscillations that only generate quadrupole moments), we assume the radiation is dominated by the lowest-order term, which is the electric dipole radiation.\n\n**2. Angular Distribution of Radiated Power**\n\nFor an oscillating electric dipole aligned with the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle `(dP/dΩ)` is given by the formula:\n`dP/dΩ = K * sin²(θ)`\nwhere `θ` is the angle measured from the z-axis, and `K` is a factor that depends on the amplitude of the dipole moment and the frequency of oscillation.\n\nThe function `f(\\lambda, θ)` mentioned in the problem is this `dP/dΩ`.\n\nThe maximum radiated power per unit solid angle, `A`, occurs when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\nSo, `A = (dP/dΩ)_max = K * sin²(90°) = K * 1 = K`.\n\nWe need to find the fraction of `A` that is radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. We can calculate the power at this angle using the same formula:\n`P_30 = dP/dΩ` at `θ = 30° = K * sin²(30°)`.\n\nSince `A = K`, we have:\n`P_30 = A * sin²(30°)`.\n\nThe value of `sin(30°)` is 1/2. Therefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\nSo, the power radiated at 30° is `P_30 = A * (1/4) = A/4`.\nThe fraction of `A` radiated at this angle is `(A/4) / A = 1/4`.\n\nTo confirm this simple calculation, we can use Python:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Angle in degrees\ntheta_deg = 30\n\n# Convert angle to radians for use in math functions\ntheta_rad = math.radians(theta_deg)\n\n# Calculate sin^2(theta)\n# The maximum value is 1 (at 90 degrees), so the fraction is simply sin^2(theta).\nfraction = math.sin(theta_rad)**2\n\nprint(f\"{fraction=}\")\n```\n>>>\nfraction=0.25\n>>>\n\nThe code confirms that the fraction is 0.25, which is 1/4.\n\n**3. Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power**\n\nThe factor `K` in the power formula is not a constant with respect to frequency or wavelength. For electric dipole radiation, the total radiated power is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency `ω`.\n`P_total ∝ ω⁴`\n\nThe power per unit solid angle, `f(\\lambda, θ) = dP/dΩ`, also shares this frequency dependence:\n`f(\\lambda, θ) ∝ ω⁴`\n\nThe angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` and the speed of light `c` by the equation `ω = 2πf = 2πc/λ`.\nSubstituting this into the proportionality for `f`, we get:\n`f(\\lambda, θ) ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`.\n\nThus, a possible form for the dependence of the function `f` on wavelength `λ` is `λ⁻⁴`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining our two findings:\n*   The fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n*   A possible form of the function `f`'s dependence on `λ` is **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nMatching these results with the given options:\nA) 1/4, λ⁻⁴\nB) 3/4, λ⁻⁶\nC) 1/4, λ⁻³\nD) 1/2, λ⁻⁴\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical System:** The problem describes an \"oscillating charge distribution\" with a spheroid shape and a symmetry axis (the z-axis). The simplest and most dominant form of radiation from such a system is electric dipole radiation. This occurs when there's a net oscillating electric dipole moment. An oscillation along the symmetry axis (z-axis) creates an electric dipole moment `p(t)` aligned with the z-axis.\n\n2.  **Angular Distribution of Power (Finding the fraction):**\n    *   For an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle, `dP/dΩ`, is given by the Larmor formula for a dipole:\n        `dP/dΩ = K * sin²(θ)`\n        where `θ` is the angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis) and `K` is a constant that depends on the frequency and amplitude of the oscillation. The function `f(λ, θ)` in the problem corresponds to this `dP/dΩ`.\n\n    *   The maximum radiated power per unit solid angle, `A`, occurs where `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which happens at `θ = 90°` (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n        `A = (dP/dΩ)_max = K * sin²(90°) = K * 1 = K`\n\n    *   We need to find the power radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`.\n        `P_at_30° = dP/dΩ (at θ=30°) = K * sin²(30°)`\n\n    *   To find the fraction of `A` radiated at 30°, we compute the ratio `P_at_30° / A`:\n        Fraction = `(K * sin²(30°)) / K = sin²(30°)`\n\n    *   The value of `sin(30°)` is `1/2`.\n    *   Therefore, the fraction is `(1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\n3.  **Wavelength Dependence of Power (Finding the form of f):**\n    *   The constant `K` in the power formula is not independent of frequency or wavelength. The total power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency (`ω⁴`).\n        `P_total ∝ ω⁴`\n\n    *   The power per unit solid angle, `f(λ, θ) = dP/dΩ`, also has this same frequency dependence:\n        `f(λ, θ) ∝ ω⁴`\n\n    *   The angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by the formula `ω = 2πc/λ`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n\n    *   Substituting this into the proportionality for `f`, we get:\n        `f(λ, θ) ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n\n    *   So, a possible form for the wavelength dependence of the function `f` is `λ⁻⁴`. This dependence is characteristic of Rayleigh scattering, which is based on the same dipole radiation principle.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The fraction of the maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n    *   A possible form of the function `f`'s dependence on wavelength is **λ⁻⁴**.\n\n    *   Comparing these results with the given options:\n        A) 1/4, λ⁻⁴\n        B) 3/4, λ⁻⁶\n        C) 1/4, λ⁻³\n        D) 1/2, λ⁻⁴\n\n    *   The correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
