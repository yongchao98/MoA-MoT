    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the two reactions.\n\n### **Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is a Michael addition reaction. The bulky strong base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), will create an enolate from the ketone. This enolate will then act as a nucleophile and attack the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate), which is the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate:**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   We need to identify the acidic α-protons that can be removed by the base. The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   The C2 carbon is quaternary, bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1, and C3. It has no α-protons.\n    *   The C6 carbon is tertiary, bonded to a methyl group, a hydrogen atom, C1, and C5. It has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the base t-BuOK can only abstract the proton from C6, leading to the formation of a single enolate with the double bond between C1 and C6.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The enolate is the nucleophile. The C6 carbon of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon (the CH₂ group) of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The resulting adduct, after protonation (during workup), will have a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group attached to C6.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The product molecule is a substituted cyclohexanone. The substituents are:\n        *   An oxo group (=O) at C1.\n        *   An ethyl group and a methyl group at C2.\n        *   A methyl group at C6.\n        *   A new `-(CH₂)-CH₂-COOEt` group also at C6.\n    *   The options provide IUPAC names where the product is named as a derivative of ethyl propanoate. Let's follow this convention.\n    *   The side chain is `-(CH₂)-CH₂-COOEt`. This is an ethyl propanoate backbone substituted at carbon 3.\n    *   The substituent at C3 is the entire cyclohexanone ring.\n    *   When a ring is a substituent, its numbering starts from the point of attachment (let's call it C1').\n    *   The attachment point is the C6 of the original ketone. So, C6 becomes C1'.\n    *   Following the ring from C1':\n        *   C1' (original C6) has a methyl group.\n        *   C2' (original C1) has the oxo group.\n        *   C3' (original C2) has an ethyl and a methyl group.\n    *   Combining these pieces, the name of the substituent ring is (3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl).\n    *   The full name of the product is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This matches the name for product A in options A and D.\n\n---\n\n### **Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify the type of reaction:** This is also a Michael addition reaction. The base KOH deprotonates the nitroalkane to form a nucleophilic nitronate anion. This anion attacks the α,β-unsaturated nitrile ((E)-but-2-enenitrile).\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:**\n    *   The starting material is 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂).\n    *   The protons on the carbon α to the electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic (pKa ≈ 10).\n    *   The base KOH deprotonates the α-carbon (C1 of the propane chain) to form the carbanion [CH₃-CH₂-⁻CH-NO₂], which is stabilized by resonance with the nitro group. This is the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The Michael acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile, which has the structure CH₃-CH=CH-CN.\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon from the 1-nitropropane anion attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile (the carbon atom of the double bond that is further from the -CN group). The β-carbon is the one bonded to the methyl group.\n    *   The new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon (C3) of the but-2-enenitrile chain.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:**\n    *   Let's assemble the product structure:\n        *   The 1-nitropropane part is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)−`.\n        *   The but-2-enenitrile part becomes `−CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN` after the addition and protonation (from H₂O).\n    *   Connecting these two fragments gives the final structure:\n        `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`\n    *   To name this molecule using IUPAC rules, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The carbon of the nitrile group is C1.\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes C1. The chain has 6 carbons. So, the parent alkane is hexane, and the suffix is -nitrile, giving **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Now, we number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon (C1) and locate the substituents:\n        `CH₃(6)-CH₂(5)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH₂(2)-CN(1)`\n    *   There is a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full name of the product is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   This matches the name for product B in options B and D.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options, only option D contains both correct product names.\n\n<<<D>>>"
