    "An elegant problem solving approach. I will now generate the reasoning and the final answer.\n**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star. The formula is:\n    T_eq = T_star * [R_star / (2a)]^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n    where:\n    *   T_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n    *   R_star is the radius of the star.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   `A` is the planet's Bond albedo.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a1))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)]\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** The problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are the same for both. It is also given that both planets have the same albedo (`A`). Therefore, these terms will cancel out in the ratio.\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [(1 / a1)^(1/2)] / [(1 / a2)^(1/2)]\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a2 / a1)^(1/2)\n    This simplifies the problem to finding the square root of the ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n5.  **Find the Semi-Major Axes (a1 and a2):** The information about the radial velocity (RV) method is key here. The periodic Doppler shift is used to measure the star's \"wobble\" caused by the orbiting planet. The maximum radial velocity, or semi-amplitude (K), is related to the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ) by:\n    K = c * (Δλ / λ₀)\n    where `c` is the speed of light and `λ₀` is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\n    The semi-amplitude `K` is related to the planet's mass (M_p), the star's mass (M_star), and the semi-major axis (`a`) by the following formula for a circular orbit:\n    K = [M_p * sin(i) / M_star] * sqrt[G * M_star / a]\n    where `i` is the inclination of the orbit and `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n6.  **Address the Inclination (i):** The problem mentions that the planets were detected by the transit method. Transits can only be observed when the planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, which means the orbital inclination `i` must be very close to 90°. For i ≈ 90°, sin(i) ≈ 1. We can therefore assume sin(i) is 1 for both planets.\n\n7.  **Solve for `a` in terms of `K`:**\n    K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n    Square both sides:\n    K^2 ≈ (M_p^2 / M_star^2) * (G * M_star / a)\n    K^2 ≈ (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * a)\n    Rearrange to solve for `a`:\n    a ≈ (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K^2)\n\n8.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a2 / a1):**\n    a2 / a1 = [(G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K2^2)] / [(G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K1^2)]\n    The terms `G` and `M_star` cancel out.\n    a2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) * (K1^2 / M_p1^2)\n    a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2\n\n9.  **Calculate the Constituent Ratios:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio (M_p2 / M_p1):**\n        M_p1 = 7 M_earth\n        M_p2 = 5 M_earth\n        M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n\n    *   **RV Semi-Amplitude Ratio (K1 / K2):**\n        Since K is proportional to Δλ, the ratio K1 / K2 is equal to the ratio Δλ_1 / Δλ_2.\n        Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å\n        Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å\n        K1 / K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n10. **Substitute Ratios to find a2 / a1:**\n    a2 / a1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (3 / 4)^2\n    a2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\n    a2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\n11. **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:**\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a2 / a1)^(1/2)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (225 / 784)^(1/2)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225) / sqrt(784)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\n12. **Compute the Numerical Value:**\n    I will use a Python script for the final calculation to ensure accuracy.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given mass ratio M_p2/M_p1\nmass_ratio = 5 / 7\n\n# Given RV semi-amplitude ratio K1/K2 (from Doppler shift ratio)\nk_ratio = 0.03 / 0.04\n\n# Calculate the ratio of semi-major axes a2/a1\na_ratio = (mass_ratio**2) * (k_ratio**2)\n\n# Calculate the ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq1/T_eq2\ntemp_ratio = np.sqrt(a_ratio)\n\nprint(temp_ratio)\n```\n\nThe computed value is ~0.5357. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 1.30\nB) ~ 0.98\nC) ~ 1.05\nD) ~ 0.53\n\nThe result 0.5357 is closest to 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>",
