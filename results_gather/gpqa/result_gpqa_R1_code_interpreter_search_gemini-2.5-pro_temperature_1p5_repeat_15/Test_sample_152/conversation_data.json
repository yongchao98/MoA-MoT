These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions. In this case, when a nucleophile attacks the β position, it produces a resonance-stabilized intermediate. When a nucleophile attacking the β-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.\nWhat are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?\ndimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) -->(A)\n1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\nC + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nA) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\nB) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\nC) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione\nD) A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning for each reaction:\n\n### Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)\n\n1.  **Identify Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates the α-carbon which is acidic because it is situated between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups. This forms a resonance-stabilized enolate, `⁻CH(CO₂Me)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The structure is `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-CO₂Me`. The β-carbon is the electrophilic site for conjugate addition.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The resulting enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent (ethanol, EtOH) to yield the final adduct.\n    *   The overall reaction is:\n        `⁻CH(CO₂Me)₂ + p-Tolyl-CH=CH-CO₂Me  →  (MeO₂C)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-C⁻H-CO₂Me`\n        `(MeO₂C)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-C⁻H-CO₂Me + EtOH  →  (MeO₂C)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-CO₂Me + EtO⁻`\n\n3.  **Identify Product A:**\n    *   The product structure is `(MeO₂C)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-CO₂Me`.\n    *   Let's name this structure according to the options. Consider a propane chain as the backbone: C1-C2-C3.\n    *   Let C1 be the carbon from the malonate (`CH(CO₂Me)₂`), C2 be the original β-carbon of the acrylate (`CH(p-tolyl)`), and C3 be the original α-carbon of the acrylate (`CH₂`), which is now attached to the third ester group.\n    *   The structure can be drawn as: `(MeO₂C)₂-C¹H - C²H(p-tolyl) - C³H₂-CO₂Me`.\n    *   Let's check the name \"trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\":\n        *   \"propane\" indicates a 3-carbon chain (C1, C2, C3).\n        *   \"1,1,3-tricarboxylate\" means three trimethyl ester groups at positions 1, 1, and 3.\n        *   \"2-(p-tolyl)\" means a p-tolyl group is on carbon 2.\n    *   This name corresponds to the structure `MeOOC-C³H₂ - C²H(p-tolyl) - C¹H(COOMe)₂`, which matches our derived product.\n    *   Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)\n\n1.  **Identify Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at the α-carbon (C2 of the cyclohexene ring). This is a Stork enamine alkylation, which is a type of Michael addition.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile with the structure `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`. The β-carbon is the electrophilic site.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Stork Enamine Alkylation):**\n    *   The nucleophilic enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n    *   This forms an iminium ion intermediate.\n    *   The subsequent workup with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a ketone.\n\n3.  **Identify Product B:**\n    *   The original enamine was derived from cyclohexanone, so hydrolysis regenerates the cyclohexanone ring.\n    *   A new C-C bond is formed between C2 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n    *   The fragment from butenenitrile is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring with a `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group at position 2.\n    *   Let's name this structure. We can consider the butanenitrile as the parent chain: `CN(C1)-CH₂(C2)-CH(C3)-CH₃(C4)`.\n    *   The substituent at C3 is the `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group.\n    *   So, the name is **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The alternative name `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile` represents the enol form, which is not the major, most stable product after acidic workup.\n\n### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n1.  **Identify Reactant C by Retrosynthesis:**\n    *   This is a Michael addition where we need to find the donor (reactant C).\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. The main ring is cyclohexane-1,3-dione. The substituent at C2 is a \"3-oxobutyl\" group: `-CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n    *   **Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK). Its structure is `CH₂(β)=CH(α)-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n    *   The bond formed during a Michael addition is between the nucleophilic carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    *   The β-carbon of MVK is the `CH₂` group. In the product, this corresponds to the first `CH₂` of the 3-oxobutyl side chain.\n    *   Therefore, the bond that was formed is between C2 of the cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring and the β-carbon of MVK.\n    *   This means the Michael donor (C) must have been **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The base (KOH) deprotonates the highly acidic proton at C2 (between the two carbonyls) to form the nucleophilic enolate which then attacks MVK.\n    *   The other possibility listed, 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione, is not a standard representation for a stable reactant. Cyclohexane-1,3-dione is the correct starting material.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nThis set of reactants and products matches option B exactly.\n\n<<<B>>>"
