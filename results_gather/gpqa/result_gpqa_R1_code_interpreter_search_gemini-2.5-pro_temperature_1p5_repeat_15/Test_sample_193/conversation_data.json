    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Define the System and its States**\nThe system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3.\nEach spin can take a value of +1 (spin up) or -1 (spin down).\nThe total number of possible configurations (microstates) of the system is 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.\nLet's list all 8 possible states:\n1.  (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1)\n2.  (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, -1)\n3.  (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, +1)\n4.  (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, +1)\n5.  (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, -1)\n6.  (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, -1)\n7.  (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, +1)\n8.  (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1)\n\n**2. Calculate the Energy for Each State**\nThe energy of the system is given by the formula E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3].\nWe need to calculate the energy for each of the 8 states. It is easier to first calculate the value of the sum S = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 for each state.\n\n*   **State 1:** (+1, +1, +1)\n    S = (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n    E = -J(3) = -3J\n\n*   **State 8:** (-1, -1, -1)\n    S = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n    E = -J(3) = -3J\n\nThese two states have the same energy, E = -3J. The degeneracy (number of states with the same energy) for this energy level is 2.\n\nNow let's consider states with two spins up (+1) and one spin down (-1):\n*   **State 2:** (+1, +1, -1) -> S = (+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1\n*   **State 3:** (+1, -1, +1) -> S = (+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1\n*   **State 4:** (-1, +1, +1) -> S = (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1\nFor all these 3 states, S = -1, so the energy is E = -J(-1) = +J.\n\nNow let's consider states with one spin up (+1) and two spins down (-1):\n*   **State 5:** (+1, -1, -1) -> S = (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1\n*   **State 6:** (-1, +1, -1) -> S = (-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1\n*   **State 7:** (-1, -1, +1) -> S = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1\nFor all these 3 states, S = -1, so the energy is E = -J(-1) = +J.\n\nIn total, there are 3 + 3 = 6 states that have the energy E = +J. The degeneracy for this energy level is 6.\n\n**3. Define and Calculate the Partition Function (Z)**\nThe partition function Z is the sum over all possible states (i) of the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE_i), where β = 1/kT.\nZ = Σ_i e^(-βE_i)\nSince we have multiple states with the same energy (degeneracy), we can group them:\nZ = (degeneracy of E1) * e^(-βE1) + (degeneracy of E2) * e^(-βE2)\n\nFrom our calculations in step 2, we have two distinct energy levels:\n*   E1 = -3J, with degeneracy g1 = 2.\n*   E2 = +J, with degeneracy g2 = 6.\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the formula for Z:\nZ = (2) * e^(-β * (-3J)) + (6) * e^(-β * (+J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n**4. Compare with the Given Options**\nThe calculated partition function is Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ).\nLet's check the options:\nA) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\nB) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\nC) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\nD) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\n\nOur result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
