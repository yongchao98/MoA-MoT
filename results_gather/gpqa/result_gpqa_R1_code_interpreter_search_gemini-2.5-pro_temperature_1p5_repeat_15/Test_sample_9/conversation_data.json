    "This question requires understanding the relationship between a planet's mass, composition, and density.\n\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which planet has the highest density:\n\n1.  **Analyze the base case (Option a and b):**\n    *   **Option a:** An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. By definition, this planet has the same density as Earth, which is approximately 5.51 g/cm³. Let's call this density ρ_Earth.\n    *   **Option b:** A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. This density is very close to Earth's density. So, ρ_b ≈ ρ_Earth.\n\n2.  **Analyze the effect of mass on density for a constant composition (Option c and d):**\n    *   The key principle here is **gravitational compression**. For planets with the same composition, the overall density is not constant but depends on the planet's mass. A more massive planet has stronger gravity, which compresses its constituent materials more, leading to a higher average density.\n    *   **Option c:** A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Because it is significantly more massive than Earth, its internal gravitational forces will be much stronger. This increased gravity will compress the rock and metal in its interior to a much greater degree than in Earth. Therefore, its average density will be **higher** than Earth's density (ρ_c > ρ_Earth).\n    *   **Option d:** A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth. This planet is less massive than Earth, so its self-gravity is weaker. The materials will be less compressed than they are inside Earth. Consequently, its average density will be **lower** than Earth's density (ρ_d < ρ_Earth).\n\n3.  **Compare all options:**\n    *   Density(a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Density(b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n    *   Density(c) > 5.51 g/cm³ (due to high mass and compression)\n    *   Density(d) < 5.51 g/cm³ (due to low mass and less compression)\n\nBy comparing these, it is clear that the planet described in option (c) has the highest density.\n\n<<<B>>>"
