    "Here is the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the RV Method and Doppler Shift:** The problem states that the planets are detected using the Radial Velocity (RV) method. This method measures the periodic change in the radial velocity of a star as it \"wobbles\" due to the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. This velocity change causes a periodic Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines. The magnitude of the wavelength shift, $\\Delta \\lambda$, is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity, $v_{r,star}$:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_{r,star}}{c}$\n    where $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n    The \"periodic shift\" of 5 and 7 miliangstroms refers to the amplitude of this shift. This amplitude corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as $K$. Therefore, $K$ is directly proportional to the observed wavelength shift amplitude.\n    $K \\propto \\Delta \\lambda$\n\n2.  **Relate the Given Data:**\n    Let $K_1$ and $K_2$ be the radial velocity semi-amplitudes for star 1 and star 2, respectively.\n    We are given $\\Delta \\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstrom and $\\Delta \\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstrom.\n    The ratio of the semi-amplitudes is:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_1}{\\Delta \\lambda_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n3.  **Formulate the Physical Relationship:** The radial velocity semi-amplitude, $K$, for a star with a planet in a circular orbit is given by the formula:\n    $K = \\left(\\frac{2 \\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$\n    where:\n    *   $P$ is the orbital period of the planet.\n    *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n    *   $m_p$ is the mass of the planet.\n    *   $M_{star}$ is the mass of the star.\n    *   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between the orbital plane and the line of sight).\n\n4.  **Simplify the Relationship Based on the Problem Statement:**\n    The problem states:\n    *   The stars have the same masses: $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: $m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$. We will treat them as equal.\n    *   The problem does not provide information about the orbital inclinations ($i$). In such cases, it is a standard assumption that either the systems are viewed edge-on ($i=90^\\circ$, so $\\sin i = 1$) or that the inclinations are the same for both systems ($i_1 = i_2$). With this assumption, the $\\sin i$ term is a constant factor for both systems.\n\n    Under these conditions, all terms in the equation for $K$ are constant for both systems, except for the period $P$. The relationship simplifies to:\n    $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Ratio of Orbital Periods:**\n    From the proportionality $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$, we can establish a relationship between the periods and the semi-amplitudes:\n    $P^{-1/3} \\propto K$\n    Raise both sides to the power of -3:\n    $(P^{-1/3})^{-3} \\propto K^{-3}$\n    $P \\propto K^{-3}$\n\n    Now we can write the ratio of the periods ($P_2/P_1$):\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^{-3} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^{3}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    Substitute the known ratio of $K_1/K_2 = 5/7$ into the equation:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3$\n\n    Now, let's compute the numerical value.\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343}$\n\n    I will use a simple python script to get the decimal value.\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods\n# P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3\nratio = (5/7)**3\nprint(ratio)\n```\n\n<execute_output>\n0.3644314868804665\n</execute_output>\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.3644. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.36\nB) ~ 0.85\nC) ~ 1.96\nD) ~ 1.40\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The reasoning is as follows:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Physics**: The problem uses the Radial Velocity (RV) method, which measures the Doppler shift in a star's light caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The magnitude of the observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta \\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$).\n\n2.  **Formulating Ratios**: We are given the wavelength shifts for two systems:\n    *   $\\Delta \\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstrom\n    *   $\\Delta \\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstrom\n\n    Since $K \\propto \\Delta \\lambda$, the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes is:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_1}{\\Delta \\lambda_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n3.  **Applying the RV Equation**: For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude is given by:\n    $K = \\left(\\frac{2 \\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$\n    where $P$ is the orbital period, $m_p$ is the planet mass, $M_{star}$ is the star mass, and $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n\n4.  **Simplifying based on Problem Statement**:\n    *   The stars have the same mass ($M_{star1} = M_{star2}$).\n    *   The planets have similar masses ($m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$).\n    *   We can assume the viewing inclinations are similar ($i_1 \\approx i_2$), as is common when this information is not provided.\n\n    With these conditions, most terms in the equation are constant for both systems. The relationship between $K$ and the orbital period $P$ simplifies to:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}}$ or $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n5.  **Solving for the Period Ratio**: From the proportionality $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$, we can solve for $P$:\n    $P^{-1/3} \\propto K$\n    $P \\propto (K)^{-3}$\n\n    Therefore, the ratio of the orbital periods is:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^{-3} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^{3}$\n\n6.  **Calculating the Final Value**: We substitute the ratio of the semi-amplitudes we found in step 2:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^{3} = \\frac{125}{343}$\n\n    The python code calculated this value as approximately 0.3644. This value is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
