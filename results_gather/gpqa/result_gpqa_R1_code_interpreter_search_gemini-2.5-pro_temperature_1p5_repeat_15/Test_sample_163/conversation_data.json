    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** I first need to identify all the given information and what the question is asking for.\n\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude 1 (K1_1) = 10 km/s\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude 2 (K1_2) = 5 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude 1 (K2_1) = 15 km/s\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude 2 (K2_2) = 10 km/s\n    *   **Goal:** Find the ratio of the total mass of system 1 to the total mass of system 2 (M1_total / M2_total).\n    *   **Key Information:** Both systems are eclipsing binaries. This is a crucial piece of information.\n\n2.  **Identify the Relevant Physics and Formulas:** The problem involves binary stars, their orbital periods, and radial velocities. This points towards Kepler's Third Law, adapted for spectroscopic binaries.\n\n    *   For a binary system, Kepler's Third Law is: `G * (M1 + M2) = (4 * π² * a³) / P²`, where `a` is the semi-major axis of the relative orbit, `P` is the period, and `M1`, `M2` are the star masses.\n    *   For a double-lined spectroscopic binary, the semi-major axis `a` is not directly observed, but it can be related to the radial velocity amplitudes (`K1`, `K2`).\n    *   The orbital velocities (`v1`, `v2`) are related to the observed radial velocity amplitudes by `K = v * sin(i)`, where `i` is the inclination of the orbit to our line of sight.\n    *   The semi-major axes of the individual orbits are `a1 = (P * v1) / (2 * π)` and `a2 = (P * v2) / (2 * π)`.\n    *   Substituting `v = K / sin(i)`, we get `a1 = (P * K1) / (2 * π * sin(i))` and `a2 = (P * K2) / (2 * π * sin(i))`.\n    *   The total semi-major axis is `a = a1 + a2 = (P * (K1 + K2)) / (2 * π * sin(i))`.\n    *   Now, I substitute this expression for `a` back into Kepler's Third Law:\n        `M_total = M1 + M2 = (4 * π² / (G * P²)) * [ (P * (K1 + K2)) / (2 * π * sin(i)) ]³`\n    *   Simplifying this expression:\n        `M_total = (4 * π² / (G * P²)) * [ P³ * (K1 + K2)³ / (8 * π³ * sin³(i)) ]`\n        `M_total = (1 / (2 * π * G)) * (P * (K1 + K2)³) / sin³(i)`\n\n3.  **Apply the Key Information:** The problem states both systems are eclipsing. For an eclipse to happen, the orbital plane must be very close to edge-on from our perspective. This means the inclination `i` is approximately 90°. Therefore, `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and `sin³(i) ≈ 1`.\n\n    *   This simplifies the mass formula significantly: `M_total ≈ (1 / (2 * π * G)) * P * (K1 + K2)³`\n    *   The term `1 / (2 * π * G)` is a constant. Therefore, the total mass of a system is directly proportional to its period and the cube of the sum of its velocity amplitudes:\n        `M_total ∝ P * (K_total)³` where `K_total = K1 + K2`.\n\n4.  **Set up the Ratio:** The question asks for the factor by which system 1 is more massive than system 2, which is the ratio `M1_total / M2_total`.\n\n    *   `M1_total / M2_total = [ P1 * (K1_1 + K1_2)³ ] / [ P2 * (K2_1 + K2_2)³ ]`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Values:** Now I plug in the numbers from the problem.\n\n    *   P1 = 2 years\n    *   P2 = 1 year\n    *   K_total for system 1 = K1_1 + K1_2 = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n    *   K_total for system 2 = K2_1 + K2_2 = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n6.  **Perform the Final Calculation:** I will use a python script to ensure accuracy. The calculation is:\n    `Ratio = (2 / 1) * (15 / 25)³`\n\n```python\n# System 1 parameters\np1 = 2  # years\nk1_1 = 10  # km/s\nk1_2 = 5   # km/s\n\n# System 2 parameters\np2 = 1   # year\nk2_1 = 15  # km/s\nk2_2 = 10  # km/s\n\n# Calculate the sum of velocity amplitudes for each system\nk_total_1 = k1_1 + k1_2\nk_total_2 = k2_1 + k2_2\n\n# The total mass is proportional to P * (K_total)^3.\n# We need to find the ratio M1_total / M2_total.\n# The proportionality constant cancels out in the ratio.\nmass_ratio = (p1 / p2) * (k_total_1 / k_total_2)**3\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.432\n</execute_result>\n\n7.  **Compare with Options and Conclude:** The calculated ratio is 0.432. Now I compare this result with the given options:\n    A) ~ 0.6\n    B) ~ 0.4\n    C) ~ 1.2\n    D) ~ 0.7\n\n    The value 0.432 is closest to 0.4. Therefore, option B is the correct answer. The factor is less than 1, indicating that system 1 is actually less massive than system 2.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical laws:** The problem deals with the mass of binary star systems, their orbital periods, and the radial velocities of the stars. The key formula for the total mass (M_total = M1 + M2) of a double-lined spectroscopic binary is derived from Kepler's Third Law:\n    `M1 + M2 = (P * (K1 + K2)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))`\n    where:\n    *   `P` is the orbital period.\n    *   `K1` and `K2` are the amplitudes of the radial velocities for the two stars.\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n    *   `i` is the inclination of the orbit to our line of sight.\n\n2.  **Use the \"eclipsing\" information:** The problem states that both systems are eclipsing. For an eclipse to occur, our line of sight must be very close to the orbital plane of the stars. This means the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°.\n    *   When `i ≈ 90°`, then `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and `sin³(i) ≈ 1`.\n    *   This simplifies the mass formula significantly, as the `sin³(i)` term can be treated as 1.\n\n3.  **Establish the proportionality:** With `sin³(i) = 1`, and since `2`, `π`, and `G` are constants, the total mass of the system is directly proportional to the period and the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes:\n    `M_total ∝ P * (K1 + K2)³`\n\n4.  **Set up the ratio:** The question asks for the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, which is the ratio of their total masses (M_total_1 / M_total_2).\n    `M_total_1 / M_total_2 = [ P1 * (K1_1 + K1_2)³ ] / [ P2 * (K2_1 + K2_2)³ ]`\n\n5.  **Plug in the values:**\n    *   For system_1:\n        *   `P1 = 2` years\n        *   `K1_1 + K1_2 = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s`\n    *   For system_2:\n        *   `P2 = 1` year\n        *   `K2_1 + K2_2 = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s`\n\n6.  **Calculate the ratio:**\n    `Ratio = (2 / 1) * (15 / 25)³`\n    `Ratio = 2 * (3 / 5)³`\n    `Ratio = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n    `Ratio = 54 / 125`\n    `Ratio = 0.432`\n\n7.  **Compare with the options:** The calculated value `0.432` is closest to the option `~ 0.4`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
