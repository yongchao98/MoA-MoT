    "This problem requires us to deduce the identity of two C10H14 isomers in a 1:1 mixture by interpreting their combined 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Information from the 1H NMR Spectrum\n\nFirst, let's break down the data provided in the problem description:\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds. All four options are isomers of tetramethylbenzene or diethylbenzene, and all have this formula.\n    *   Tetramethylbenzene: C6H2(CH3)4 = C6H2 + C4H12 = C10H14.\n    *   Diethylbenzene: C6H4(C2H5)2 = C6H4 + C4H10 = C10H14.\n2.  **Mixture:** The two compounds are present in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n3.  **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   This implies that there are two distinct types of aromatic protons in the mixture.\n    *   The 1:1 ratio, combined with the 1:1 molar ratio of the compounds, means that the number of protons contributing to each singlet is the same.\n    *   Since both are singlets, the aromatic protons are not coupled to any adjacent protons (or they are equivalent to the protons they would couple with).\n4.  **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   The signals are singlets, which suggests they come from methyl (CH3) groups not adjacent to any protons. This is consistent with tetramethylbenzene isomers but rules out diethylbenzene (which would show coupled ethyl group signals - a quartet and a triplet).\n    *   Let's determine the number of protons corresponding to this ratio. Since both compounds are tetramethylbenzene isomers, each molecule has 4 methyl groups, totaling 12 aliphatic protons. In a 1:1 mixture, there are 12 + 12 = 24 total aliphatic protons.\n    *   The ratio is 2:1:1. The total parts in the ratio are 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.\n    *   Protons for signal 1 (ratio 2): (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n    *   Protons for signal 2 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Protons for signal 3 (ratio 1): (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Therefore, the mixture's aliphatic region must contain three singlets corresponding to environments with 12 protons, 6 protons, and 6 protons.\n\n### Step 2: Predict the Individual 1H NMR Spectra for Each Candidate Compound\n\nLet's predict the number and integration of signals for each possible compound. We can immediately eliminate **1,4-diethylbenzene** because its ethyl groups would produce a quartet and a triplet, not singlets, in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent and isolated. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Summary:** Aliphatic Signals: {12H}\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the carbons C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent due to the symmetry plane. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H). The methyl groups at C2 (3H) and C5 (3H) are each unique. This results in **three singlets**.\n    *   **Summary:** Aliphatic Signals: {6H, 3H, 3H}\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are adjacent but chemically equivalent, so they appear as **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H). The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent to each other (6H). This results in **two singlets**.\n    *   **Summary:** Aliphatic Signals: {6H, 6H}\n\n### Step 3: Test the Combinations (Options) Against the Spectral Data\n\nNow we combine the predicted signals for each pair of compounds in a 1:1 ratio and see which combination matches the observed spectrum.\n\n**Observed Spectrum:**\n*   Aromatic: Two singlets (1:1 ratio)\n*   Aliphatic: Three singlets with integrations {12H, 6H, 6H}\n\n**A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n*   **Aliphatic signals:** Durene contributes {12H}. Isodurene contributes {6H, 3H, 3H}.\n*   **Combined:** {12H, 6H, 3H, 3H}. This is four signals, not three. This option is incorrect (unless there's an unlikely accidental overlap of the two 3H signals to form a 6H signal, which would lead to a {12H, 6H, 6H} pattern. But we should prefer a more direct explanation).\n\n**B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n*   **Aliphatic signals:** Durene contributes {12H}. Prehnitene contributes {6H, 6H}.\n*   **Combined:** {12H, 6H, 6H}. This combination provides exactly three singlets with the required 12H:6H:6H integration. This is a perfect match for the aliphatic region.\n*   **Aromatic signals:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. Since the chemical environments of these protons are different in the two molecules, they will appear at different chemical shifts. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This is a perfect match for the aromatic region.\n\n**C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene) + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n*   **Aliphatic signals:** Prehnitene contributes {6H, 6H}. Isodurene contributes {6H, 3H, 3H}.\n*   **Combined:** {6H, 6H, 6H, 3H, 3H}. This results in at least three unique signal sets, likely more. It does not match the observed {12H, 6H, 6H} pattern.\n\n**D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n*   This is incorrect because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only combination that perfectly explains both the aliphatic and aromatic regions of the described 1H NMR spectrum is the mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
