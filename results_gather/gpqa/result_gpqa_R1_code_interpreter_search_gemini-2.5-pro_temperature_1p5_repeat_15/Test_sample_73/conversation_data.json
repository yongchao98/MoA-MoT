    "This is a classic problem involving the memoryless property of exponential decay. Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Modeling the Decay:**\n    Radioactive decay is a random process that is well-described by the exponential distribution. The key characteristic of this distribution is that it is \"memoryless\". This means the probability of the atom decaying in a future time interval does not depend on how long it has already existed. The process essentially \"resets\" at every moment.\n\n2.  **Defining the Math:**\n    Let T be the lifetime of the atom. The probability that the atom survives past time *t* is given by the survival function S(t):\n    S(t) = P(T > t) = e^(-λt)\n    where λ is the decay constant.\n\n    The probability that the atom decays by time *t* is given by the cumulative distribution function F(t):\n    F(t) = P(T ≤ t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\n3.  **Using the Given Information to find the Decay Constant (λ):**\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%.\n    P(T ≤ 100) = 0.32\n    Using the formula:\n    1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32\n    e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32\n    e^(-100λ) = 0.68\n\n    We don't need to solve for λ explicitly. This relationship is sufficient.\n\n4.  **Formulating the Question:**\n    We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\n    This is a conditional probability: P(T ≤ 50 + 150 | T > 50), which simplifies to P(T ≤ 200 | T > 50).\n\n5.  **Applying the Memoryless Property:**\n    Because the decay process is memoryless, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future behavior. The probability of it decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of a brand-new atom decaying in 150 minutes.\n    Therefore:\n    P(T ≤ 200 | T > 50) = P(T ≤ 150)\n\n6.  **Calculating the Final Probability:**\n    We need to calculate P(T ≤ 150).\n    P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)\n\n    We can rewrite e^(-150λ) using the relationship we found in step 3:\n    e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5\n\n    Now substitute the value we found:\n    e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5\n\n    Finally, the probability of decay is:\n    P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5\n\n7.  **Computation:**\n    To get the final numerical answer, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We need to calculate the value of 1 - (0.68)^1.5\nprobability = 1 - (0.68)**1.5\n\n# Convert to percentage for comparison with options\npercentage_probability = probability * 100\n\nprint(f\"{percentage_probability:.2f}\")\n```\n\nExecuting the code gives a result of approximately 43.93.\n\nMatching this result with the given options:\nA) 40%\nB) 44%\nC) 52%\nD) 48%\n\nThe calculated value of ~44% matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem describes a radioactive decay process, which is governed by the exponential distribution. A key feature of this distribution is its \"memoryless\" property. This means that the probability of the atom decaying in a future interval is independent of how long it has already survived.\n\n**Step 1: Define the survival and decay probabilities.**\n\nLet T be the random variable representing the lifetime of the atom. The probability that the atom survives beyond time *t* (the survival function) is given by:\nS(t) = P(T > t) = e^(-λt)\nwhere λ is the decay constant.\n\nThe probability that the atom decays by time *t* (the cumulative distribution function) is:\nF(t) = P(T ≤ t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\n**Step 2: Use the given information to find the decay parameter.**\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%.\nP(T ≤ 100) = 0.32\nThis means:\n1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32\ne^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32\ne^(-100λ) = 0.68\n\nThis equation gives us a relationship for the decay constant λ. `e^(-100λ)` is the probability that the atom survives for at least 100 minutes.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the question mathematically.**\n\nWe want to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes. This is a conditional probability:\nP(T ≤ 50 + 150 | T > 50) = P(T ≤ 200 | T > 50)\n\n**Step 4: Apply the memoryless property.**\n\nThe memoryless property of the exponential distribution states that:\nP(T > t + s | T > s) = P(T > t)\nIn our case, the probability that the atom, having survived for 50 minutes, will decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that a new atom will decay in 150 minutes.\nTherefore:\nP(T ≤ 200 | T > 50) = P(T ≤ 150)\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the required probability.**\n\nWe need to calculate P(T ≤ 150), which is equal to 1 - e^(-150λ).\nWe can express e^(-150λ) using the value we found in Step 2:\ne^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5\nNow substitute the value e^(-100λ) = 0.68:\ne^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5\n\nFinally, we calculate the probability of decay within 150 minutes:\nP(T ≤ 150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5\n\nUsing a calculator:\n(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607\nP(T ≤ 150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393\n\nThis probability, as a percentage, is 43.93%. This value is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<B>>>"
