    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the key physical principles and values:**\n    *   The problem involves the concept of cosmological redshift, where the wavelength of light from a distant object is stretched due to the expansion of the universe.\n    *   The formula for redshift `(z)` is: `λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + z)`, where `λ_observed` is the wavelength we detect on Earth, and `λ_rest` is the wavelength emitted by the source in its own reference frame.\n    *   The rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) transition of neutral hydrogen is given as `λ_rest ≈ 1216` Angstroms (Å). This is in the ultraviolet (UV) part of the spectrum.\n    *   \"Ground-based optical telescopes\" can only detect light that is able to pass through the Earth's atmosphere. The atmosphere absorbs most light with wavelengths shorter than about 3500-4000 Å. This atmospheric cutoff sets the shortest observable wavelength (`λ_observed_min`).\n\n2.  **Define the problem's goal:**\n    *   We need to find the *minimum* or *lower limit* on the redshift `(z)` such that the redshifted Lyman-alpha line becomes detectable by a ground-based telescope.\n    *   This means we need to find the redshift `z` that stretches the Lyα wavelength of 1216 Å to the minimum wavelength that can be observed from the ground.\n\n3.  **Establish the minimum observable wavelength:**\n    *   The Earth's atmosphere, primarily due to ozone, blocks deep ultraviolet radiation. The practical limit for ground-based astronomical observations—the shortest wavelength that can be reliably detected—is in the near-UV range, at approximately 3500 Å. This is the start of what astronomers call the \"U-band\" (Ultraviolet band) in photometry.\n    *   So, we set our minimum observed wavelength to `λ_observed_min = 3500 Å`.\n\n4.  **Set up the equation:**\n    *   We use the redshift formula: `λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + z)`\n    *   We want to find the redshift `z` when `λ_rest = 1216 Å` and `λ_observed = 3500 Å`.\n    *   Rearranging the formula to solve for `z`:\n        `1 + z = λ_observed / λ_rest`\n        `z = (λ_observed / λ_rest) - 1`\n\n5.  **Calculate the redshift:**\n    *   Substitute the values into the rearranged formula. I will use a simple Python script for the calculation.\n\n```python\n# The rest wavelength of Lyman-alpha in Angstroms\nlambda_rest = 1216\n\n# The minimum observable wavelength from the ground due to the atmospheric cutoff\n# A standard value for this is around 3500 Angstroms.\nlambda_observed_min = 3500\n\n# Calculate the redshift (z) using the formula: z = (lambda_observed / lambda_rest) - 1\nz = (lambda_observed_min / lambda_rest) - 1\n\nprint(f\"The calculated lower limit on the redshift is: {z}\")\n```\n\nExecution output:\n```\nThe calculated lower limit on the redshift is: 1.8782894736842104\n```\n\n6.  **Interpret the result and select the answer:**\n    *   The calculated minimum redshift is `z ≈ 1.88`.\n    *   Looking at the options provided:\n        A) 2.4\n        B) 3\n        C) 1.2\n        D) 1.9\n    *   The calculated value of 1.88 is extremely close to 1.9. This means that a quasar must have a redshift of at least ~1.9 for its Lyman-alpha absorption line to be shifted from the far-UV (1216 Å) into the near-UV/optical window (~3500 Å) and be detectable from the ground.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The reasoning is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the Rest Wavelength:** The problem states that the absorption occurs at the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) wavelength of neutral hydrogen, which is `λ_rest = 1216 Å`. This wavelength is in the far-ultraviolet part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n2.  **Identify the Observational Constraint:** The key constraint is that the object must be detected with \"optical ground-based telescopes.\" Earth's atmosphere, primarily due to ozone, is opaque to ultraviolet radiation. The atmosphere starts to become transparent at around 3500 Å to 4000 Å. Therefore, for a spectral line to be detected from the ground, its observed wavelength (`λ_observed`) must be greater than this atmospheric cutoff. We can take the lower limit for ground-based observation to be approximately `λ_observed_min ≈ 3500 Å`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Redshift Formula:** The relationship between the emitted (rest) wavelength and the observed wavelength is given by the cosmological redshift formula:\n    `λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + z)`\n    where `z` is the redshift.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Minimum Redshift:** We need to find the minimum redshift `z` that will stretch the 1216 Å line just enough to make it observable from the ground. So, we set `λ_observed` to our minimum observable wavelength, `3500 Å`, and solve for `z`:\n\n    `3500 Å = 1216 Å * (1 + z)`\n\n    To solve for `z`, we rearrange the equation:\n\n    `1 + z = 3500 / 1216`\n    `1 + z ≈ 2.878`\n    `z ≈ 2.878 - 1`\n    `z ≈ 1.878`\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options:** The calculated minimum redshift is approximately 1.88. We compare this value to the given choices:\n    A) 2.4\n    B) 3\n    C) 1.2\n    D) 1.9\n\n    The value `z ≈ 1.88` is closest to 1.9.\n\n<<<D>>>"
