    "This problem is governed by the energy-time uncertainty principle, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics.\n\n**1. Understand the Concept: Energy-Time Uncertainty Principle**\n\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle can be known. For energy (E) and time (t), this relationship is expressed as:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy.\n*   Δt is the uncertainty in time.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ = h/2π ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\nIn the context of an unstable quantum state, the lifetime (τ) of the state can be taken as the uncertainty in time, Δt. This means that a state with a finite lifetime does not have a perfectly defined energy. Instead, its energy is \"smeared\" out over a range ΔE. This range or \"width\" of the energy level is given by:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n**2. Calculate the Energy Width for Each State**\n\nWe are given the lifetimes for two states:\n*   State 1: τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n*   State 2: τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n\nNow, we calculate the energy width (ΔE) for each state using the value of ħ in electron-volts-seconds (eV·s), as the options are given in eV.\n\n*   **For State 1:**\n    ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\n    ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n    ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **For State 2:**\n    ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂\n    ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s)\n    ΔE₂ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n**3. Apply the Resolvability Criterion**\n\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their energies (|E₁ - E₂|) must be greater than their inherent energy widths. A common criterion is that the energy separation should be at least as large as the broader of the two energy widths.\n\n*   Width of State 1 (ΔE₁): ~6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n*   Width of State 2 (ΔE₂): ~6.6 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nThe broader width is ΔE₁, which is approximately 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Therefore, for the energy levels to be resolvable, their energy difference must be significantly greater than this value.\n\n|E₁ - E₂| > 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nLet's check which of the given options satisfies this condition:\n\n*   **A) 10⁻⁴ eV:** Is 10⁻⁴ eV > 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV? Yes, 10⁻⁴ is 1000 x 10⁻⁷, which is much larger.\n*   **B) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** Is 10⁻¹¹ eV > 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV? No, it's much smaller.\n*   **C) 10⁻⁹ eV:** Is 10⁻⁹ eV > 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV? No, it's smaller.\n*   **D) 10⁻⁸ eV:** Is 10⁻⁸ eV > 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV? No, it's smaller (10⁻⁸ eV = 0.1 x 10⁻⁷ eV).\n\n**5. Code Verification**\n\nTo be certain, we can use a Python script to perform the calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nh_bar_eVs = 6.582119569e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two quantum states\ntau1 = 1e-9  # sec\ntau2 = 1e-8  # sec\n\n# Calculate the energy width (Delta_E) for each state using Delta_E ≈ h_bar / tau\ndelta_E1 = h_bar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = h_bar_eVs / tau2\n\n# To resolve the levels, the energy difference must be greater than the widths.\n# We take the larger of the two widths as our minimum requirement.\nrequired_separation = max(delta_E1, delta_E2)\n\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 1 (ΔE₁): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 2 (ΔE₂): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"The minimum required energy difference for resolution is approximately: {required_separation:.3e} eV\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\n# Check the given options\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1e-4,\n    \"B\": 1e-11,\n    \"C\": 1e-9,\n    \"D\": 1e-8\n}\n\nprint(\"Evaluating the options:\")\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    if value > required_separation:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV): Is greater than {required_separation:.3e} eV. --> RESOLVABLE\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV): Is NOT greater than {required_separation:.3e} eV. --> NOT RESOLVABLE\")\n\n```\n```output\nEnergy width of state 1 (ΔE₁): 6.582e-07 eV\nEnergy width of state 2 (ΔE₂): 6.582e-08 eV\nThe minimum required energy difference for resolution is approximately: 6.582e-07 eV\n--------------------\nEvaluating the options:\nOption A (1.0e-04 eV): Is greater than 6.582e-07 eV. --> RESOLVABLE\nOption B (1.0e-11 eV): Is NOT greater than 6.582e-07 eV. --> NOT RESOLVABLE\nOption C (1.0e-09 eV): Is NOT greater than 6.582e-07 eV. --> NOT RESOLVABLE\nOption D (1.0e-08 eV): Is NOT greater than 6.582e-07 eV. --> NOT RESOLVABLE\n```\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly option A provides an energy difference (10⁻⁴ eV) that is sufficiently large to resolve the two energy levels, as it is the only value greater than the energy broadening (≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV) caused by the states' short lifetimes.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The analysis is based on the **Heisenberg Energy-Time Uncertainty Principle**, which states:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nHere, ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, Δt is the uncertainty in time, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\nFor a quantum state with a finite lifetime (τ), the lifetime is taken as the uncertainty in time (Δt ≈ τ). This implies that the energy of the state is not perfectly defined but has a natural \"width\" or uncertainty (ΔE) given by:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n**1. Calculate the Energy Width for Each State:**\n\n*   **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime (τ₁) = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy Width (ΔE₁) ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime (τ₂) = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy Width (ΔE₂) ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n**2. Determine the Condition for Resolution:**\n\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" the two energy levels, the energy difference between them must be greater than their energy widths. A common criterion for resolvability is that the separation must be at least as large as the broader of the two widths.\n\n*   The width of State 1 (ΔE₁) is ~6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   The width of State 2 (ΔE₂) is ~6.6 x 10⁻⁸ eV.\n\nThe larger of the two widths is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Therefore, for the two energy levels to be resolvable, their energy difference, |E₁ - E₂|, must be greater than this value.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options:**\n\nWe need to find the option that is greater than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   A) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is much greater than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   B) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is much smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   C) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   D) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is smaller than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly the energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is large enough to ensure that the two energy levels can be clearly resolved.\n\n<<<A>>>"
