    "The user wants to find the energy spectrum for a particle in a given potential.\n\n1.  **Analyze the potential:**\n    The potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ):\n    V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\n\n2.  **Convert to Cartesian coordinates:**\n    To simplify the problem, we should convert the potential to Cartesian coordinates (x, y). The relationships between polar and Cartesian coordinates are:\n    x = r cos(θ)\n    y = r sin(θ)\n    r^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\n    Substitute these into the potential expression:\n    The first term is `1/2 kr^2 = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2)`.\n    The second term is `3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)`. We can rewrite this as `3/2 k (r cos(θ))^2 = 3/2 k x^2`.\n\n    Now, combine the terms to get the full potential in Cartesian coordinates:\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k x^2\n    V(x, y) = 1/2 kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2 + 3/2 kx^2\n    V(x, y) = (1/2 + 3/2)kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n    V(x, y) = (4/2)kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n    V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n\n3.  **Identify the system:**\n    The potential `V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2` is a sum of two independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator potentials:\n    V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\n    where `V_x(x) = 2kx^2` and `V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2`.\n\n    This means the system is a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. The Schrödinger equation is separable in x and y, and the total energy E is the sum of the energies of the two independent oscillators, `E = E_x + E_y`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the energy for each oscillator:**\n    The energy levels of a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with potential `V(z) = 1/2 mω²z²` are given by `E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω`.\n\n    *   **For the x-direction:**\n        The potential is `V_x(x) = 2kx^2`.\n        We match this to the standard form `1/2 mω_x²x²`:\n        1/2 mω_x² = 2k\n        ω_x² = 4k/m\n        ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n        The energy levels for the x-oscillator are:\n        E_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n\n    *   **For the y-direction:**\n        The potential is `V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2`.\n        We match this to the standard form `1/2 mω_y²y²`:\n        1/2 mω_y² = 1/2 k\n        ω_y² = k/m\n        ω_y = sqrt(k/m)\n        The energy levels for the y-oscillator are:\n        E_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n5.  **Calculate the total energy spectrum:**\n    The total energy E is the sum of `E_{n_x}` and `E_{n_y}`:\n    E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}\n    E = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n    Now, factor out the common terms `ħ * sqrt(k/m)`:\n    E = [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ] ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n    E = [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n    E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    The calculated energy spectrum is `E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ħ * sqrt(k/m)`.\n    Let's check the options:\n    A) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    B) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n    C) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n    D) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n\n    The result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
