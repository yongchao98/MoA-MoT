    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition and Selection Rules**\n    The problem describes a two-step decay from the initial state $|n, l, m\\rangle = |3, 0, 0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1, 0, 0\\rangle$. The transitions are specified as electric dipole transitions. The selection rules for electric dipole transitions are:\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer.\n    *   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n\n2.  **Determine the Intermediate State**\n    Let the intermediate state be $|n', l', m'\\rangle$. The transition occurs in two steps:\n    *   **Step 1:** $|3, 0, 0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n', l', m'\\rangle$\n    *   **Step 2:** $|n', l', m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1, 0, 0\\rangle$\n\n    Let's apply the selection rules to both steps.\n\n    *   **For Step 1: $|3, 0, 0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n', l', m'\\rangle$**\n        *   Initial state has $l=0$.\n        *   The selection rule $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$ implies $l' - 0 = \\pm 1$, so the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n        *   The selection rule $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$ implies $m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$, so the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, +1,$ or $-1$.\n        *   Since this is a decay process, the principal quantum number must decrease, so $n' < 3$. Looking at the options provided, the intermediate state is always a state with $n'=2$.\n        *   Thus, the possible intermediate states are $|2, 1, -1\\rangle$, $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$, and $|2, 1, 1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **For Step 2: $|n' l' m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1, 0, 0\\rangle$**\n        *   Let's check if a transition from our possible intermediate states $|2, 1, m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|1, 0, 0\\rangle$ is allowed.\n        *   Initial state (for this step) has $l'=1$. Final state has $l_{final}=0$.\n        *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n        *   The $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m' = 0, \\pm 1$ rule must also be satisfied.\n        *   For the intermediate state $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$: $\\Delta m = 0 - 0 = 0$. Allowed.\n        *   For the intermediate state $|2, 1, 1\\rangle$: $\\Delta m = 0 - 1 = -1$. Allowed.\n        *   For the intermediate state $|2, 1, -1\\rangle$: $\\Delta m = 0 - (-1) = +1$. Allowed.\n\n    All the routes listed in the options are valid according to the selection rules. We must now determine the probabilities.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Transition Probabilities (Branching Ratios)**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific decay route. This is the product of the probabilities (branching ratios) of each step in the cascade.\n\n    *   **Probability of Step 1: $|3, 0, 0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2, 1, m'\\rangle$**\n        The initial state $|3, 0, 0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, which means it is spherically symmetric. In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, when the atom decays by emitting a photon, there is an equal probability of it transitioning to any of the magnetic sublevels ($m'$) of the final energy level.\n        The possible final states for the first step are $|2, 1, -1\\rangle$, $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$, and $|2, 1, 1\\rangle$. Since there are three equally probable destination states, the probability (branching ratio) for transitioning to any one of them is $1/3$.\n        *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n        *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = 1/3$\n        *   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n\n    *   **Probability of Step 2: $|2, 1, m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1, 0, 0\\rangle$**\n        Once the atom is in one of the intermediate states, say $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$, it will decay further. The only available energy level below the $n=2$ level is the $n=1$ level. The state is $|1,0,0\\rangle$. We have already established that the dipole transition $|2, 1, 0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1, 0, 0\\rangle$ is allowed. Since this is the only possible decay channel via a dipole transition to a lower energy state, the probability of this step occurring, given the atom is in the state $|2, 1, 0\\rangle$, is 1. The same logic applies to the other intermediate states, $|2, 1, 1\\rangle$ and $|2, 1, -1\\rangle$.\n        *   $P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$ for any $m'$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Overall Probability of the Route**\n    The total probability of a specific route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n    Let's evaluate the route given in option C: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   Probability = $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n    *   Probability = $(1/3) \\times 1 = 1/3$\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options**\n    *   A) Route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and probability $\\frac{2}{3}$. (Incorrect probability)\n    *   B) Route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and probability $\\frac{1}{4}$. (Incorrect probability, should be 1/3)\n    *   C) Route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and probability $\\frac{1}{3}$. (Correct route and probability)\n    *   D) Route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and probability $\\frac{1}{4}$. (Incorrect probability, should be 1/3)\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
