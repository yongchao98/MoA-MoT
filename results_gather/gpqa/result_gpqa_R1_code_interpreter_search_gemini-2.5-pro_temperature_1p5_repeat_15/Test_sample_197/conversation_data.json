    "This problem requires calculating the mole fraction of a specific complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) or [Co(SCN)₂], in a solution containing various cobalt-thiocyanate species. The total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co(II) ion and all its complexes with thiocyanate (SCN⁻).\n\nThe equilibria for the formation of the complexes are:\nCo²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺\nCo²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]\nCo²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻\nCo²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\nThe overall stability constants (β) are given:\nβ₁ = [[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) = 9\nβ₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) = 40\nβ₃ = [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) = 63\nβ₄ = [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) = 16\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt species is:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nWe can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free Co²⁺ concentration, [Co²⁺], and the thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻]:\n[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nSubstituting these into the equation for the total cobalt concentration:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\nFactoring out [Co²⁺]:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThe fraction (α₂) of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is the concentration of that complex divided by the total concentration of cobalt:\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\nα₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))\n\nBy canceling [Co²⁺] from the numerator and denominator, we get a formula that depends only on the ligand concentration [SCN⁻] and the stability constants:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\nβ₁ = 9\nβ₂ = 40\nβ₃ = 63\nβ₄ = 16\n\nThe following Python code calculates the exact value of α₂ and converts it to a percentage.\n```python\n# Given values\nSCN_conc = 0.1  # [SCN-] in M\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n\n# Calculate the terms in the denominator of the fraction formula\n# The denominator represents the sum of the relative proportions of all cobalt species.\n# Let X = SCN_conc\n# Denominator = 1 (for Co2+) + beta1*X (for [Co(SCN)]+) + beta2*X^2 (for [Co(SCN)2]) + beta3*X^3 (for [Co(SCN)3]-) + beta4*X^4 (for [Co(SCN)4]2-)\nterm_Co2_plus = 1\nterm_CoSCN = beta1 * (SCN_conc ** 1)\nterm_CoSCN2 = beta2 * (SCN_conc ** 2)\nterm_CoSCN3 = beta3 * (SCN_conc ** 3)\nterm_CoSCN4 = beta4 * (SCN_conc ** 4)\n\ndenominator = term_Co2_plus + term_CoSCN + term_CoSCN2 + term_CoSCN3 + term_CoSCN4\n\n# The numerator is the term corresponding to the species of interest, [Co(SCN)2].\nnumerator = term_CoSCN2\n\n# Calculate the fraction (alpha2) of the [Co(SCN)2] complex\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage)\n```\n<<<16.916180326482278\n\nThe calculation shows that the fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], is approximately 0.16916, which corresponds to 16.916%.

    "The problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], relative to the total amount of cobalt-containing species in the solution. This percentage is the mole fraction of [Co(SCN)₂] multiplied by 100.\n\nFirst, let's define the species present in the solution:\n- Free Co²⁺ ion\n- [Co(SCN)]⁺ (monothiocyanato cobalt(II))\n- [Co(SCN)₂] (dithiocyanato cobalt(II))\n- [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (trithiocyanato cobalt(II))\n- [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (tetrathiocyanato cobalt(II))\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\nThe formation of these complexes is governed by the overall stability constants (β):\n`[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]`\n`[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n`[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³`\n`[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴`\n\nWe can substitute these into the total concentration equation:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\nBy factoring out `[Co²⁺]`, we get:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nThe mole fraction (α₂) of the dithiocyanato complex [Co(SCN)₂] is the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration:\n`α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n\nSubstituting the expressions for `[[Co(SCN)₂]]` and `c(Co)`:\n`α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\nThe term `[Co²⁺]` cancels out, leaving an expression that depends only on the ligand concentration and the stability constants:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n- [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n- β₁ = 9\n- β₂ = 40\n- β₃ = 63\n- β₄ = 16\n\nCalculate the terms:\n- `β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9`\n- `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n- `β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n- `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\nNow, substitute these into the fraction formula:\nNumerator = `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4`\nDenominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n`α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo get the percentage, we multiply the fraction by 100:\nPercentage = `0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.92%`\n\nThis result matches the output from the code execution (16.916...). Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 42.3%\nB) 25.6%\nC) 16.9%\nD) 38.1%\n\nThe calculated percentage is closest to 16.9%.\n\n<<<C>>>"
