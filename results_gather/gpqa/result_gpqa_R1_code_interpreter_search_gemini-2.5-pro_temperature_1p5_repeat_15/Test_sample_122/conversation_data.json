    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n**1. Identify the reference frames:**\n*   **Frame S:** The Galaxy's reference frame (considered stationary).\n*   **Frame S':** The supernova ejecta's reference frame (considered moving).\n\n**2. Identify the given values:**\n*   The relative velocity between the two frames, **v**, is 60,000 km/s.\n*   The time elapsed in the moving frame (ejecta's frame), **Δt'** (this is the proper time), is 50 s.\n*   The speed of light, **c**, is approximately 300,000 km/s.\n\n**3. Determine the goal:**\n*   We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (Frame S). To do this, we need the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (**Δt**).\n\n**4. Apply the time dilation formula:**\nThe time measured in the stationary frame (S) is related to the time measured in the moving frame (S') by the Lorentz factor (γ).\nThe formula is:\n`Δt = γ * Δt'`\n\n**5. Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\nThe Lorentz factor is defined as:\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nFirst, let's calculate the ratio `v/c`:\n`v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\nNow, square this value:\n`(v/c)² = 0.2² = 0.04`\n\nSubstitute this into the Lorentz factor formula:\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n**6. Calculate the time in the Galaxy's frame (Δt):**\nNow, use the time dilation formula:\n`Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n**7. Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame:**\nThe distance (d) in the Galaxy's frame is its speed (v) multiplied by the time elapsed in its own frame (Δt).\n`d = v * Δt`\n`d = (60,000 km/s) * ( (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n`d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n`d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\nTo get the final numerical value, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nv = 60000  # km/s\ndt_prime = 50  # s\nc = 300000 # km/s\n\n# Calculate Lorentz factor\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v/c)**2)\n\n# Calculate time in Galaxy frame\ndt = gamma * dt_prime\n\n# Calculate distance in Galaxy frame\ndistance = v * dt\n\nprint(distance)\n```\n>>>\n3061862.1784789725\n\nThe calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km.

    "This problem is about special relativity, specifically time dilation. Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Define the frames of reference:**\n    *   **The Galaxy's reference frame (S):** We can consider this the \"stationary\" frame.\n    *   **The ejecta's reference frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame.\n\n2.  **Identify the given information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time that passes in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame) is `Δt' = 50 s`. This is known as the *proper time*.\n    *   The speed of light is `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance the ejecta travels *as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame*. Let's call this distance `d`.\n\n4.  **Apply the relevant physics principles:**\n    *   The distance `d` in the Galaxy's frame is calculated as `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   The time `Δt` in the stationary frame is different from the time `Δt'` in the moving frame due to *time dilation*. The formula for time dilation is:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    *   Here, `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n5.  **Perform the calculations:**\n\n    *   **First, calculate the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light (β):**\n        `β = v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n    *   **Next, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n    *   **Now, calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt):**\n        `Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n        `Δt ≈ (1 / 0.9798) * 50 s ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n        As expected, more time passes in the \"stationary\" frame than in the \"moving\" frame.\n\n    *   **Finally, calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (d):**\n        `d = v * Δt`\n        `d = (60,000 km/s) * ( (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n        `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n        `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n        `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 km ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n6.  **Compare the result with the given options:**\n    *   A) 3,000,000 km (This would be the answer without considering relativity)\n    *   B) 3,060,000 km\n    *   C) 2,940,000 km\n    *   D) 2,880,000 km\n\nOur calculated value of approximately 3,061,862 km is extremely close to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
