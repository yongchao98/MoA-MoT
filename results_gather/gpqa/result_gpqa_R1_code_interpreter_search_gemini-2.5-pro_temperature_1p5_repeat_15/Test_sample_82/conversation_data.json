    "**1. Initial Setup and Dilution**\n\n*   **Initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH):**\n    *   Volume = 20.00 cm³ = 0.0200 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.05 M\n    *   Moles = Volume × Concentration = 0.0200 L × 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 mol\n\n*   **Dilution:**\n    *   The 20.00 cm³ of acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n    *   New total volume (Va) = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L\n    *   New concentration of acetic acid (Ca) = Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M\n\n**2. pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH3COONa), and 75% of the acid remains. This creates a buffer solution.\n\n*   The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used to calculate the pH of a buffer:\n    pH = pKa + log ( [A⁻] / [HA] )\n    where:\n    *   [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate)\n    *   [HA] is the concentration of the acid (acetic acid)\n\n*   **Calculate pKa:**\n    *   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n\n*   **Determine the ratio [A⁻]/[HA]:**\n    *   At 25% titration, the ratio of moles of A⁻ to HA is 25:75 or 1:3.\n    *   Since both are in the same volume, the ratio of concentrations is the same: [A⁻]/[HA] = 1/3.\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.733 - log(3)\n    *   pH = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256\n\n**3. pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH3COONa). The solution contains only the salt of a weak acid and a strong base. The acetate ion (CH3COO⁻) will hydrolyze water, producing OH⁻ ions and making the solution basic.\n\n*   **Reaction:** CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n\n*   **Calculate the volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence (Ve):**\n    *   Moles of acid (na) = Moles of base (nb)\n    *   na = 0.001 mol (from step 1)\n    *   nb = Cb × Vb = 0.1 M × Vb\n    *   Ve = Vb = na / Cb = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n*   **Calculate the concentration of acetate ([A⁻]) at the equivalence point:**\n    *   Total volume = Va + Ve = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n    *   Moles of acetate formed = initial moles of acid = 0.001 mol\n    *   [A⁻] = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M\n\n*   **Calculate Kb for the acetate ion:**\n    *   Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ (at 25 °C)\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n\n*   **Calculate the [OH⁻] from the hydrolysis reaction:**\n    *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   Let [OH⁻] = x\n    *   Kb ≈ x² / [A⁻]\n    *   x² = Kb × [A⁻] = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) × (0.02) = 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\n*   **Calculate pOH and pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 = 8.517\n\nTo summarize the calculations:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\ninitial_moles_acid = 0.020 * 0.05\n\n# Part 1: pH at 25% titration\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n# Ratio [A-]/[HA] at 25% titration is 25/75 = 1/3\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# Part 2: pH at equivalence point\n# Volume of NaOH for equivalence\nV_naoh = initial_moles_acid / 0.1 # in L\n# Total volume at equivalence\nV_total = 0.040 + V_naoh # in L\n# Concentration of conjugate base at equivalence\nconc_A_minus = initial_moles_acid / V_total\n# Kb for the conjugate base\nKb = Kw / Ka\n# [OH-]^2 = Kb * conc_A_minus\n# We assume x is small so [A-] - x is approx [A-]\nOH_conc = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_A_minus)\n# pOH and pH\npOH = -math.log10(OH_conc)\npH_at_equivalence = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_at_equivalence:.2f}\")\n```\n**Execution Output:**\n```\npH at 25% titration: 4.26\npH at equivalence point: 8.52\n```\n\nThe calculated pH at 25% titration is **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "**Detailed Breakdown:**\n\n**1. Understand the initial state and the dilution.**\n\n*   We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n*   Number of moles of acetic acid = Concentration × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × (20.00 / 1000) L = 0.001 moles.\n*   This solution is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n*   The new total volume of the acid solution is 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³.\n*   The new concentration of acetic acid (Ca) is Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / (40.00 / 1000) L = 0.025 M.\n\n**2. Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n\n*   Titration involves the reaction: CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the initial acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). This means 75% of the acetic acid remains unreacted.\n*   We have a buffer solution containing a mixture of a weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻).\n*   The pH of a buffer solution can be calculated using the **Henderson-Hasselbalch equation**:\n    pH = pKa + log ( [Conjugate Base] / [Weak Acid] )\n*   First, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   At 25% titration, the ratio of the moles (and therefore concentrations) of the conjugate base to the weak acid is 25% to 75%, or 1 to 3.\n    [Conjugate Base] / [Weak Acid] = 25 / 75 = 1/3\n*   Now, plug the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - log(3) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256\n*   The pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid (0.001 moles) has been completely neutralized by NaOH.\n*   First, we need to find the volume of 0.1 M NaOH required to reach the equivalence point (Ve):\n    Moles of acid = Moles of base\n    0.001 moles = 0.1 mol/L × Ve\n    Ve = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   The solution now contains 0.001 moles of the salt, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa), in a total volume of:\n    Total Volume = Initial volume of acid solution + Volume of NaOH added = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n*   The concentration of the acetate ion ([CH₃COO⁻]) at the equivalence point is:\n    [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n*   The acetate ion is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so it will react with water (hydrolysis), producing OH⁻ ions and making the solution basic.\n    CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n*   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for the acetate ion:\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n*   Now we set up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis:\n    Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    Let x = [OH⁻] = [CH₃COOH]\n    5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    Since Kb is very small, we can assume x is negligible compared to 0.02.\n    5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.02\n    x² = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 = 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   Calculate the pOH and then the pH:\n    pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n*   The pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe pH at 25% titration is **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
