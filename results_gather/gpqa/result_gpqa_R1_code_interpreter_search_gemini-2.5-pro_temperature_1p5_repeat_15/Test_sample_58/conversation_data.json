    "This problem requires us to find the pH of a mixture containing a weak acid (CH3COOH), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)2). We need to perform a step-by-step neutralization calculation.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of each species.**\n\nThe number of moles is calculated by multiplying the molarity (M) by the volume (V) in liters.\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Moles = 0.1 mol/L * 0.500 L = **0.050 mol CH3COOH**\n\n*   **Moles of H+ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   HCl is a strong acid, so it completely dissociates: HCl -> H+ + Cl-.\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Moles of HCl = 0.2 mol/L * 0.400 L = 0.080 mol HCl\n    *   Therefore, moles of H+ = **0.080 mol H+**\n\n*   **Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**\n    *   Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that dissociates completely: Ba(OH)2 -> Ba2+ + 2OH-. Note that each mole of Ba(OH)2 produces two moles of OH-.\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 mol/L * 0.300 L = 0.090 mol Ba(OH)2\n    *   Therefore, moles of OH- = 0.090 mol * 2 = **0.180 mol OH-**\n\n### **Step 2: Neutralization Reactions**\n\nThe strong base (OH-) will first react with the strong acid (H+). Any remaining base will then react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n1.  **Reaction between Strong Acid and Strong Base:**\n    H+ + OH- -> H2O\n    *   Initial moles H+ = 0.080 mol\n    *   Initial moles OH- = 0.180 mol\n    *   Since there are more moles of OH-, all the H+ will be consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = **0.100 mol OH-**\n\n2.  **Reaction between Remaining Strong Base and Weak Acid:**\n    CH3COOH + OH- -> CH3COO- + H2O\n    *   Initial moles CH3COOH = 0.050 mol\n    *   Moles of OH- from previous step = 0.100 mol\n    *   Since there are still more moles of OH-, all the CH3COOH will be consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = **0.050 mol OH- (excess)**\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Final pH**\n\nThe final solution contains an excess of a strong base (OH-). The pH of the solution is determined by the concentration of this excess OH-.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the mixture:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.2 L**\n\n*   **Calculate the concentration of the excess OH-:**\n    *   [OH-] = (Moles of excess OH-) / (Total Volume)\n    *   [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L = 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log10([OH-])\n    *   pOH = -log10(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH + pOH = 14\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\nThe calculation can be verified using a script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Moles of reactants\nmoles_H_plus_strong = 0.2 * 0.400\nmoles_OH_minus_strong = 0.3 * 0.300 * 2\nmoles_weak_acid = 0.1 * 0.500\n\n# Neutralization\n# Strong acid vs strong base\nremaining_OH = moles_OH_minus_strong - moles_H_plus_strong\n# Remaining strong base vs weak acid\nexcess_OH = remaining_OH - moles_weak_acid\n\n# Final calculations\ntotal_volume = 0.500 + 0.400 + 0.300\nfinal_concentration_OH = excess_OH / total_volume\npOH = -math.log10(final_concentration_OH)\npH = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"{pH=:.2f}\")\n```\n```output\npH=12.62\n```\n\nThe pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This is a multistep acid-base neutralization problem. We need to determine the final composition of the solution to calculate the pH.\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of each acid and base component.**\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n    Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    Molarity = 0.1 M\n    Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = **0.050 mol CH3COOH**\n\n*   **Moles of H+ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    HCl is a strong acid and dissociates completely (HCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻).\n    Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    Molarity = 0.2 M\n    Moles of HCl = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.080 mol\n    Moles of H⁺ = **0.080 mol H⁺**\n\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**\n    Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base and dissociates completely, producing two moles of OH⁻ for every mole of Ba(OH)₂ (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻).\n    Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    Molarity = 0.3 M\n    Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol\n    Moles of OH⁻ = 0.090 mol × 2 = **0.180 mol OH⁻**\n\n**2. Perform the neutralization reactions.**\n\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will react completely with any available acid. It will react with the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) first, and then with the weak acid (CH₃COOH).\n\n*   **Total moles of acid =** Moles of H⁺ (from HCl) + Moles of CH₃COOH = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol acid**\n*   **Total moles of base =** Moles of OH⁻ (from Ba(OH)₂) = **0.180 mol base**\n\nSince there are more moles of base than acid, the base will be in excess.\n\n*   **Reaction:** Acid + Base → Products\n*   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = Total moles of OH⁻ - Total moles of acid\n*   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol OH⁻**\n\n**3. Calculate the pH of the final solution.**\n\nThe final solution contains an excess of a strong base (OH⁻). The pH is determined by the concentration of this excess hydroxide.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the mixture:**\n    Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.2 L**\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:**\n    [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻])\n    pOH = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    In an aqueous solution at 25°C, pH + pOH = 14.\n    pH = 14 - pOH\n    pH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\nThe final pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<A>>>"
