  "response_list": [
    "*   **Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material (Compound X) from the provided spectroscopic data.**\n\n    *   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   The very broad absorption between 3400 cm⁻¹ and 2500 cm⁻¹ is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid dimer.\n        *   The sharp, strong absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n        *   The absorptions at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This is a very downfield, broad singlet. This chemical shift is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, indicate a para (1,4)-disubstituted benzene ring. The doublet at 8.0 ppm is significantly downfield, suggesting these protons are adjacent to a strong electron-withdrawing group (the -COOH). The doublet at 7.2 ppm is further upfield, suggesting these protons are adjacent to an electron-donating group (an alkyl group).\n        *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:** Let's piece together the remaining signals to identify the second substituent on the ring.\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3H is a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This gives us an ethyl fragment starter: -CH₂-CH₃.\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet integrating to 3H is a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methine group (-CH-).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet integrating to 2H corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-) from our ethyl fragment. It is a multiplet because it is coupled to both the adjacent CH₃ (from the triplet) and a CH group.\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet integrating to 1H is the methine proton (-CH-). This proton is attached to the aromatic ring, the methyl group (at 1.4 ppm), and the methylene group (at 1.7 ppm), which explains why it is a multiplet.\n            *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** Combining the pieces (-CH₂CH₃ and -CH(CH₃)-) at the CH group gives us a **sec-butyl** group: -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Based on all the data, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option D.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the reaction and predict the product.**\n\n    *   **Reaction:** Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) is treated with red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   **Reagents' Function:** The combination of red phosphorus and HI is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The sec-butyl group, being an alkane substituent, will not be affected by these reagents.\n    *   **Transformation:**\n        *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n        *   The -COOH group is reduced to a -CH₃ group.\n        *   The sec-butyl group at position 4 remains unchanged.\n    *   **Final Product:** The resulting molecule is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Match the predicted product with the given options.**\n\n    *   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect.\n    *   B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect alkyl group isomer.\n    *   C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches our predicted product.\n    *   D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material, not the final product.\n\nThe final product of the reaction is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
