    "SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory. It is a theoretical framework that extends the Standard Model (SM) by including higher-dimensional operators. These operators are constructed from the SM fields and are suppressed by a high-energy scale, often denoted as Λ. The key question is which fundamental symmetries must these operators respect.\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry & Poincaré Symmetry**: The Standard Model is a relativistic quantum field theory, which means it must be invariant under the transformations of the Poincaré group. The Poincaré group includes Lorentz transformations (boosts and rotations) and spacetime translations. SMEFT is built upon this foundation. All terms in the SMEFT Lagrangian, including the higher-dimensional operators, must be constructed as Lorentz scalars to ensure the laws of physics are the same for all inertial observers. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry (1) and the full Poincaré symmetry (2) must be respected.\n\n2.  **CP Symmetry**: CP (Charge-Parity) symmetry is the combination of charge conjugation (C) and parity inversion (P). It is well-known that the Standard Model itself violates CP symmetry, most notably through a complex phase in the CKM matrix of the weak interaction. Since SMEFT is an extension of the SM, it not only incorporates the SM's CP violation but can also introduce new sources of CP violation through the higher-dimensional operators. Therefore, CP symmetry (3) is *not* a required symmetry in SMEFT. In fact, studying the coefficients of CP-violating operators is a major goal of SMEFT-related phenomenology.\n\n3.  **CPT Symmetry**: The CPT theorem is a cornerstone of quantum field theory. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the combined action of Charge conjugation (C), Parity inversion (P), and Time reversal (T). Since SMEFT is constructed as a local and Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory, it must respect CPT symmetry (4). A violation of CPT would imply a breakdown of one of the fundamental assumptions of modern particle physics.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- Lorentz symmetry (1) must be respected.\n- Poincaré symmetry (2) must be respected.\n- CP symmetry (3) is not necessarily respected.\n- CPT symmetry (4) must be respected due to the CPT theorem.\n\nTherefore, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\nThis corresponds to options 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
