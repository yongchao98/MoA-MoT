    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, assuming a uniform distribution of stars in space.\n\n1.  **Define a Uniform Distribution of Stars:**\n    A uniform distribution means that the number density of stars, denoted by ρ (rho), is constant everywhere in space.\n    ρ = (Number of stars) / (Volume) = constant.\n\n2.  **Number of Stars up to a Distance d:**\n    The number of stars, `N(d)`, within a spherical volume of radius `d` from the observer is given by the density multiplied by the volume of the sphere.\n    The volume of a sphere of radius `d` is `V(d) = (4/3)πd³`.\n    Therefore, `N(d) = ρ * V(d) = ρ * (4/3)πd³`.\n\n3.  **Number of Stars in a Thin Shell:**\n    We are interested in the number of stars per unit range, which means we need to find the number of stars in a small interval. Let's consider a thin spherical shell at a distance `d` with a small thickness `dd`.\n    The number of stars in this shell, `dN`, can be found by differentiating `N(d)` with respect to `d`.\n    `dN = (dN(d)/dd) * dd`\n    `dN = d/dd [ρ * (4/3)πd³] * dd`\n    `dN = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n    This tells us that the number of stars in a shell of thickness `dd` at distance `d` is proportional to `d²`.\n\n4.  **Relate Distance (d) to Parallax (plx):**\n    Stellar parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (d) to the star. The relationship is:\n    `plx = 1/d`\n    (Assuming `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds).\n    This can be rearranged to express distance in terms of parallax:\n    `d = 1/plx`\n\n5.  **Relate the Distance Interval (dd) to the Parallax Interval (d(plx)):**\n    To find how the number of stars varies with parallax, we need to transform the interval `dd` into an interval of parallax, `d(plx)`. We can do this by differentiating the expression for `d` with respect to `plx`:\n    `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [1/plx] = -1/plx²`\n    So, `dd = (-1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n    The negative sign simply indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. Since we are concerned with the number of stars in an interval, we are interested in the magnitude of the relationship:\n    `|dd| = (1/plx²) * |d(plx)|`\n\n6.  **Combine the Expressions:**\n    Now we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` in terms of `plx` into our equation for `dN`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n    Substitute `d = 1/plx` and `dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    `dN = (ρ * 4π / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n7.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Range of Parallax:**\n    The quantity we are looking for is the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/d(plx)`. From the equation above, we can see:\n    `dN/d(plx) = ρ * 4π / plx⁴`\n\n8.  **Conclusion:**\n    Since ρ, 4, and π are constants, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis result means that there are far more stars at small parallax values (large distances) per unit parallax interval than there are at large parallax values (small distances).\n\nFinal Answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
