    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of peaks in the HPLC chromatograms.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   Let's draw the structure: `CH3-CH(OCH3)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   This molecule has one stereocenter at carbon C-5, and its configuration is specified as (S).\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols.\n    *   The ketone at C-3 will be reduced to a hydroxyl group (-OH). This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C-3.\n    *   The attack of the hydride ion (H⁻) on the planar carbonyl group can occur from two different faces, leading to two possible configurations at the new stereocenter C-3: (R) or (S).\n*   **Products:**\n    *   The original stereocenter at C-5 remains unchanged.\n    *   The two products formed are:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two molecules have two stereocenters. The configuration is the same at one center (C-5) but different at the other (C-3). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n    *   Reaction I produces **two** distinct compounds.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`.\n    *   This is a symmetric and achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n    *   NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups.\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: `CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3`.\n*   **Products:**\n    *   The product molecule has two stereocenters, at C-2 and C-4. The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   Let's analyze the relationships between these isomers:\n        *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They form a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the starting material is achiral, they will be produced in equal amounts as a racemic mixture.\n        *   Consider (2R, 4S). Due to the symmetry of the molecule, it has an internal plane of symmetry and is achiral. This is a **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration is identical to the (2R, 4S) configuration (you can see this by flipping the molecule over).\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces **three** distinct stereoisomers: a racemic pair of enantiomers ((2R,4R)- and (2S,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and one meso compound ((2R,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the mixture on a normal-phase HPLC column\n\n*   **Total Compounds:** The final mixture contains the 5 stereoisomers produced in both reactions.\n*   **Separation Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, primarily polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment, so they elute together and show a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and are separable.\n*   **Peak Prediction:**\n    1.  The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. They have different polarities and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n    2.  From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) will co-elute, giving **one peak**.\n    3.  The meso compound ((2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has different physical properties and will be separated from them, giving another **one peak**.\n    4.  The products of Reaction I (C6 ether-alcohols) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C5 diols). They have different molecular weights, functional groups, and polarities, so they will not co-elute with each other.\n*   **Total Peaks:** The total number of peaks will be the sum of peaks from the separated groups: 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (from Rxn II enantiomers) + 1 (from Rxn II meso) = **4 peaks** in normal-phase HPLC.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the mixture on a chiral HPLC column\n\n*   **Separation Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP). A CSP can interact differently with enantiomers, allowing them to be separated. It can also separate diastereomers.\n*   **Peak Prediction:** A chiral column has the ability to resolve all stereochemically distinct compounds. Our mixture contains 5 unique stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n*   Since all five of these compounds are stereochemically different, a chiral HPLC system can, in principle, separate all of them.\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be resolved (**2 peaks**).\n    *   The enantiomeric pair from Reaction II will now be resolved into two separate peaks (**2 peaks**).\n    *   The meso compound from Reaction II is diastereomeric to the others and will be resolved as its own peak (**1 peak**).\n*   **Total Peaks:** The total number of peaks observed will be 2 + 2 + 1 = **5 peaks** in chiral HPLC.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC:** 4 peaks.\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
