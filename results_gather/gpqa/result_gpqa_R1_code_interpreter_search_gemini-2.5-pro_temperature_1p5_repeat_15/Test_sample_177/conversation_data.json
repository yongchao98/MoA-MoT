    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Determine the Mass Dimensions of Fields and Operators\n\nThe analysis is performed in natural units where $\\hbar = c = 1$. In these units, mass, energy, and momentum have dimensions of mass ($M$), while length and time have dimensions of inverse mass ($M^{-1}$).\n\n*   **Lagrangian Density ($\\mathcal{L}$):**\n    The action, $S = \\int d^4x \\, \\mathcal{L}$, is a dimensionless quantity ($[S] = M^0$). The four-dimensional spacetime volume element $d^4x$ has mass dimension $[d^4x] = [(\\text{length})^4] = (M^{-1})^4 = M^{-4}$. Therefore, the Lagrangian density must have a mass dimension of 4 to make the action dimensionless:\n    $[\\mathcal{L}] = M^4$.\n\n*   **Fermion Field ($\\psi$):**\n    The kinetic term for a Dirac fermion is given by $\\mathcal{L}_{kin} = \\bar{\\psi}(i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu - m)\\psi$. Let's analyze the dimension of the kinetic part, $\\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu \\psi$.\n    *   The gamma matrices $\\gamma^\\mu$ are dimensionless.\n    *   The partial derivative $\\partial_\\mu = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^\\mu}$ has a mass dimension of $[\\partial_\\mu] = M^1$.\n    *   The term $\\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu \\psi$ must have the same dimension as the Lagrangian density, $M^4$.\n    *   So, $[\\bar{\\psi}][\\psi][\\partial_\\mu] = M^4$.\n    *   Since $\\bar{\\psi} = \\psi^\\dagger \\gamma^0$, the dimensions of $\\bar{\\psi}$ and $\\psi$ are the same: $[\\bar{\\psi}] = [\\psi]$.\n    *   This gives $[\\psi]^2 M^1 = M^4$, which leads to $[\\psi]^2 = M^3$, and therefore $[\\psi] = M^{3/2}$.\n\n*   **Field Strength Tensor ($F^{\\mu\\nu}$):**\n    The kinetic term for a gauge field (like the photon) is $\\mathcal{L}_{kin} = -\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\n    *   This term must also have a mass dimension of $M^4$.\n    *   So, $[F^{\\mu\\nu}]^2 = M^4$.\n    *   This implies that the field strength tensor has a mass dimension of $[F^{\\mu\\nu}] = M^2$.\n\n*   **Sigma Matrix ($\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$):**\n    The operator $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$ is defined as $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{i}{2}[\\gamma_\\mu, \\gamma_\\nu]$, where $\\gamma_\\mu$ and $\\gamma_\\nu$ are the Dirac gamma matrices. The gamma matrices are constant matrices and are dimensionless in mass units. Therefore, $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$ is also dimensionless:\n    $[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] = M^0$.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Mass Dimension of the Coupling Constant ($\\kappa$)\n\nNow we analyze the interaction term given in the Lagrangian:\n$\\mathcal{L}_{int} = \\kappa \\bar{\\psi} \\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} \\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\n\nThe dimension of this interaction term must also be $M^4$, consistent with the dimension of the Lagrangian density.\n$[\\mathcal{L}_{int}] = [\\kappa] [\\bar{\\psi}] [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] [\\psi] [F^{\\mu\\nu}] = M^4$.\n\nSubstituting the dimensions we found:\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot (M^{3/2}) \\cdot (M^0) \\cdot (M^{3/2}) \\cdot (M^2) = M^4$.\n\nCombining the exponents for the mass dimension $M$:\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot M^{(3/2 + 3/2 + 2)} = M^4$.\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot M^{(3 + 2)} = M^4$.\n$[\\kappa] \\cdot M^5 = M^4$.\n\nSolving for the dimension of $\\kappa$:\n$[\\kappa] = \\frac{M^4}{M^5} = M^{-1}$.\n\nSo, the mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is -1.\n\n### 3. Determine if the Theory is Renormalizable\n\nThe renormalizability of a quantum field theory can be determined (by power-counting) from the mass dimensions of its coupling constants:\n*   **Renormalizable:** If the mass dimension of the coupling constant is zero ($[g] = M^0$). Example: the electric charge $e$ in QED.\n*   **Non-renormalizable:** If the mass dimension of the coupling constant is negative ($[g] < M^0$). Example: the Fermi constant $G_F$ in the four-fermion theory of weak interactions.\n*   **Super-renormalizable:** If the mass dimension of the coupling constant is positive ($[g] > M^0$). Example: the coupling in $\\phi^3$ theory in 4D.\n\nIn this case, the coupling constant $\\kappa$ has a mass dimension of $[\\kappa]_M = -1$. Since the mass dimension is negative, the interaction is non-renormalizable. Higher-order loop corrections in the perturbation series would lead to divergences that become progressively worse at each order, requiring an infinite number of new counterterms to cancel them, which makes the theory lose its predictive power.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is $[\\kappa]_M = -1$.\n*   Because the coupling constant has a negative mass dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
