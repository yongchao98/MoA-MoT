    "To solve this problem, we need to understand how different types of mutations affect the final protein product. The goal is to find the mutation that is most likely to make the protein non-functional, thereby eliminating the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Intact Gene:**\n    The intact gene sequence starts with `5’-ATG...`. `ATG` is the universal start codon, which codes for the amino acid Methionine (Met). This establishes the reading frame for translation. We will translate the beginning of the sequence by reading it in triplets (codons).\n\n    *   **Intact sequence:** `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...`\n    *   **Translation:**\n        *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Met)\n        *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (Phe)\n        *   `CTC` -> Leucine (Leu)\n        *   `GCT` -> Alanine (Ala)\n        *   ... and so on.\n\n    The protein produced from this gene is functional and synthesizes the unwanted compound. To stop this, we need a \"knockout\" mutation that incapacitates the protein. The most effective knockout mutations are those that cause a drastic change in the protein's structure, such as introducing a premature stop codon (a nonsense mutation) or shifting the entire reading frame (a frameshift mutation).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Mutant Genes:**\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATGTTC**TA**CGCTGGTACT...`\n        *   Original: `...TTT CTC GCT...` -> Phe-Leu-Ala\n        *   Mutant: `...TTC TAC GCT...` -> Phe-Tyr-Ala\n        *   The change is `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, where one amino acid is swapped for another. While this *could* potentially inactivate the protein if the original Leucine was critical, it often results in a protein that is still partially or fully functional. It is not the most reliable way to knock out a gene.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATGTTCT**AA**GCTGGTACT...`\n        *   Original: `...TTT CTC GCT...` -> Phe-Leu-Ala\n        *   Mutant: `...TTC TAA GCT...` -> Phe-**Stop**\n        *   The change is `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. It will cause the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely, right after the second amino acid (Phenylalanine). The resulting protein will be extremely short and almost certainly non-functional. This is a very strong candidate for eliminating the compound.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATGTTT**TA**CGCTGGT**GTCAC**T...`\n        *   This sequence has multiple changes compared to the original. Let's compare codon by codon.\n        *   Original: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG`\n        *   Mutant 3: `ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT`\n        *   This introduces several **missense mutations**: `CTC` (Leu) -> `TAC` (Tyr), `ACT` (Thr) -> `GTC` (Val), `TCT` (Ser) -> `ACT` (Thr). Similar to Mutant 1, these changes might not be enough to completely inactivate the protein.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATGTTT**TA**CGCT**A**CTTCTGT...`\n        *   Let's align this with the intact gene.\n        *   Intact:   `ATGTTTCTCGCT**GGT**ACTTCTGT...`\n        *   Mutant 4: `ATGTTTTACGCT**---**ACTTCTGT...`\n        *   There are two changes here. First, `CTC` is changed to `TAC` (a missense mutation, Leu -> Tyr). Second, the codon `GGT` has been deleted entirely. This is a **3-base pair deletion**. Because an entire codon (3 bases) is removed, the reading frame after the deletion remains intact. This is called an **in-frame deletion**. It results in a protein that is missing one amino acid (Glycine in this case). Like a missense mutation, this may or may not inactivate the protein, depending on the importance of that specific amino acid.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    Comparing the effects, the nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most devastating to protein synthesis. By introducing a stop codon at the very beginning of the gene (the third codon), it ensures that only a tiny, non-functional peptide fragment is produced. This is the most probable mutation to successfully eliminate the function of the gene and, therefore, the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<C>>>"
