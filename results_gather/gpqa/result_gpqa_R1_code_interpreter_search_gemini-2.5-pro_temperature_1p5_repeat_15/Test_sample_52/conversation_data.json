    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given spectroscopic data to identify key structural features and fragments of the molecule.**\n\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\":** This indicates the core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two substituents attached, having the base formula C6H4. A benzene ring accounts for a degree of unsaturation of 4 (one ring and three double bonds).\n\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group\":** This confirms the presence of a -COO- functional group. An ester group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which adds one degree of unsaturation.\n\n    *   **\"1H NMR spectrum shows six signals\":** This tells us there are six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n        *   **\"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\":** A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) has 4 aromatic protons. The fact that they appear as two signals suggests an ortho or meta substitution pattern, where protons are in at least two different chemical environments.\n        *   **\"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\":** This splitting pattern is highly characteristic of a propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3). The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by both the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and the three methyl protons (creating a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq). The other vinyl proton is split only by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet (d). This fragment has the formula C3H5 and contains one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), adding another degree of unsaturation.\n        *   **\"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\":** One of these methyl signals comes from the propenyl group (–CH=CH–**CH3**). The presence of a second, distinct –CH3 signal indicates another methyl group is present elsewhere in the molecule.\n        *   **\"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\":** This is a crucial constraint. It eliminates possibilities such as ethyl (–CH2CH3), propyl (–CH2CH2CH3), or any other group containing a methylene (–CH2–) unit.\n\n2.  **Assemble the identified fragments into a complete structure.**\n\n    We have the following pieces to assemble:\n    *   A C6H4 benzene ring core.\n    *   An ester linkage (–COO–).\n    *   A propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3).\n    *   A second methyl group (–CH3).\n\n    The compound is di-substituted, meaning two groups are attached to the C6H4 ring. These two substituent groups must be formed from the remaining fragments: the ester, the propenyl group, and the methyl group. There are two primary ways to assemble this:\n\n    *   **Possibility A:** The two substituents are a propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3) and an acetoxy group (–O–CO–CH3). The structure would be a propenylphenyl acetate isomer (e.g., 4-propenylphenyl acetate). This structure is consistent with all the NMR data.\n\n    *   **Possibility B:** The two substituents are a propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH3) and a methoxycarbonyl group (–CO–O–CH3). The structure would be a methyl propenylbenzoate isomer (e.g., methyl 4-propenylbenzoate). This structure is also consistent with all the NMR data.\n\n3.  **Calculate the molecular formula for the proposed structure(s).**\n\n    Let's calculate the formula for either possibility, as they are composed of the same atoms. We sum the atoms from the constituent parts:\n    *   Benzene ring: C6H4\n    *   Propenyl group: C3H5\n    *   Ester portion (either acetoxy –O–CO–CH3 or methoxycarbonyl –CO–O–CH3): C2H3O2\n    *   **Total Carbon (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n    *   **Total Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n    *   **Total Oxygen (O):** 2\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the other given options.**\n\n    *   **C11H14O2:** Degree of unsaturation is 5. Compared to C11H12O2 (degree of unsaturation = 6), this formula implies the loss of one double bond. This would contradict the presence of either the C=C (no vinyl signals) or C=O (no ester) bond. Incorrect.\n    *   **C12H12O2:** Degree of unsaturation is 7. This requires an additional double bond or ring compared to our derived structure. It is not possible to add another carbon and maintain the \"no -CH2-\" rule and the specific NMR splitting patterns described. Incorrect.\n    *   **C12H14O2:** Degree of unsaturation is 6. This formula contains an extra CH2 group compared to our C11H12O2 structure. The presence of a CH2 group is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data. Incorrect.\n\nThe only formula that perfectly matches all the detailed spectroscopic evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
