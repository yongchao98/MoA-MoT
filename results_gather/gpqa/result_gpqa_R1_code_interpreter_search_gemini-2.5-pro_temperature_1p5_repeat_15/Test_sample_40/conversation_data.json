    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   Let the laboratory frame be the stationary frame, which we'll call **S**. The observer is in this frame.\n    *   Let the rest frame of the glass be the moving frame, which we'll call **S'**. This frame is moving with a velocity **v** relative to the laboratory frame **S**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Velocities:**\n    *   **v**: The velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the laboratory (frame S). The problem states it's moving in the same direction as the light beam.\n    *   **u'**: The velocity of the light beam *relative to the glass* (in frame S'). The speed of light in a medium with a refractive index *n* is given by `c/n`. Since the problem states the speed of light in a vacuum `c=1`, the speed of light in the glass is `u' = 1/n`.\n    *   **u**: The velocity of the light beam as measured by the observer in the laboratory (in frame S). This is the quantity we need to find.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    The problem involves adding velocities at speeds where relativistic effects are significant. The formula for adding two velocities, `u'` and `v`, that are in the same direction is:\n\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u' * v / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the Known Values into the Formula:**\n    We have the following values:\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    Substituting these into the formula gives:\n\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n) * v / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    First, simplify the denominator:\n\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To clear the fractions within the main fraction, find a common denominator for the terms in the numerator and the denominator, which is *n*:\n\n    *   Numerator: `1/n + v = 1/n + vn/n = (1 + nv) / n`\n    *   Denominator: `1 + v/n = n/n + v/n = (n + v) / n`\n\n    Now, substitute these back into the expression for *u*:\n\n    `u = [ (1 + nv) / n ] / [ (n + v) / n ]`\n\n    We can cancel the `n` in the denominator of both the numerator and the denominator:\n\n    `u = (1 + nv) / (n + v)`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is `(1 + nv) / (n + v)`. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
