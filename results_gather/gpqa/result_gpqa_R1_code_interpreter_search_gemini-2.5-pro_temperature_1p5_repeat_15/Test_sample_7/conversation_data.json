    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Analyze the phenotypes of single mutants.\n-   **Wild-type (Control):** 100% resistance. This is our baseline.\n-   **g1 mutant (G1 knockout):** 75% resistance. This means G1 contributes to resistance, but its absence is not catastrophic. The loss of function leads to a 25% drop in resistance.\n-   **g2 mutant (G2 knockout):** 0% resistance. The absence of G2 leads to a complete loss of resistance. This indicates that G2 plays a critical and essential role in the resistance pathway.\n-   **g3 mutant (G3 knockout):** 50% resistance. The absence of G3 has a more significant impact than the absence of G1, leading to a 50% drop in resistance.\n\nFrom this, G2 appears to be the most crucial gene in the pathway.\n\n### 2. Identify the Transcription Factor.\nThe problem states that \"at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s).\" A common characteristic of a mutation in an upstream master-regulator gene (like a key transcription factor) is that its phenotype is the most severe and can mask the phenotypes of downstream genes it regulates.\n\nThe `g2` mutant shows a complete loss of resistance (0%). This is the most severe phenotype observed. This makes G2 the strongest candidate for the upstream transcription factor that regulates other genes in this pathway.\n\n### 3. Analyze the double mutants to determine epistasis.\nEpistasis occurs when the effect of one gene's mutation masks the effect of another gene's mutation. In a double mutant, if the phenotype is the same as one of the single mutants, the gene corresponding to that single mutant is said to be \"epistatic\" to the other gene. This often implies the epistatic gene acts earlier (upstream) in the pathway.\n\n-   **g1g2 double mutant:** Resistance is 0%.\n    -   The `g1` single mutant has 75% resistance.\n    -   The `g2` single mutant has 0% resistance.\n    -   Since the `g1g2` phenotype (0%) is identical to the `g2` phenotype, **G2 is epistatic to G1**. This supports the model where G2 is upstream of G1 (G2 → G1).\n\n-   **g2g3 double mutant:** Resistance is 0%.\n    -   The `g2` single mutant has 0% resistance.\n    -   The `g3` single mutant has 50% resistance.\n    -   Since the `g2g3` phenotype (0%) is identical to the `g2` phenotype, **G2 is epistatic to G3**. This supports the model where G2 is upstream of G3 (G2 → G3).\n\nThese epistasis results strongly confirm that G2 is an upstream regulator of both G1 and G3, which is consistent with G2 being a transcription factor that activates them.\n\n### 4. Analyze the interaction between G1 and G3.\n-   **g1g3 double mutant:** Resistance is 10%.\n-   Let's compare this to the single mutants. If the genes acted in completely separate, additive pathways, we might expect the resistance to be somewhere around `100% - (loss from g1) - (loss from g3) = 100% - 25% - 50% = 25%`.\n-   The observed resistance of 10% is much lower than the individual resistances (75% and 50%) and also lower than a simple additive effect. This much stronger-than-expected effect when both genes are knocked out is called a **synergistic interaction**.\n-   Synergistic interactions often point to **gene redundancy**. This means G1 and G3 perform similar or parallel functions (likely downstream of G2). While neither is absolutely essential on its own, the organism relies on having at least one of them partially functional. Losing both is far more detrimental than losing just one. Therefore, the statement that \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\" is a very good interpretation of the data.\n\n### 5. Evaluate the given options based on the conclusions.\nWe have concluded:\n1.  **G2 is a transcription factor.**\n2.  **G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.**\n3.  **G1 and G3 have a synergistic relationship, best described as partial gene redundancy.**\n\nLet's check the options:\n-   **A) G1 is a transcription factor...**: Incorrect. Our evidence points to G2.\n-   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**: \"G2 is a TF\" is correct. \"Pleiotropy\" (one gene affecting multiple traits) is not the best term for this interaction. \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" is incorrect because the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%).\n-   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**: \"G2 is a TF\" is correct. \"Same promoter\" is plausible if they are both regulated by G2, but we cannot conclude this from the data. \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\" is incorrect because the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g3` phenotype (50%).\n-   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**:\n    -   \"G2 is a transcription factor\": **Correct.**\n    -   \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\": **Correct.** This explains their synergistic interaction.\n    -   \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\": Incorrect, as explained for option B.\n\nDespite the final clause in option D being incorrect, it is the best possible answer. It correctly identifies the transcription factor (G2) and the relationship between the other two genes (gene redundancy), which are the two most significant and well-supported conclusions from the experimental data. The error in the final clause is likely a mistake in the question's construction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
