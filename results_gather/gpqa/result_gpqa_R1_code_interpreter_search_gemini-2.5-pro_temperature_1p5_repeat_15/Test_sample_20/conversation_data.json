    "*   **Analysis of Tautomerism (Compound A)**\n    *   Tautomerism, specifically keto-enol tautomerism, requires the presence of an α-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group). The proton can migrate from the α-carbon to the carbonyl oxygen, forming an enol.\n    *   **Benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone):** The structure consists of a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two C=O groups. The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached to them. Since there are no α-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This is a cyclic compound with three keto groups. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha to the carbonyls and each has two hydrogen atoms. The presence of these α-hydrogens allows for keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it exists in equilibrium with its highly stable aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene).\n    *   Therefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**. So, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Compound B)**\n    *   Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature leading to chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's analyze the central carbon atom (C2):\n        1.  It is bonded to a hydrogen atom (-H).\n        2.  It is bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n        3.  It is bonded to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n        4.  It is bonded to a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃).\n        Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This is the *trans* isomer of an alkene with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry (inversion center). Molecules with a plane or center of symmetry are achiral and thus do not show optical isomerism.\n    *   Therefore, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. So, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n    *   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is benzoquinone.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n    *   This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
