    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Products of Decomposition**\n\nThe problem states that a mixture of salts A and B is heated, and the resulting gases are passed through a series of tubes. We can identify the products and their quantities from the changes in the tubes' weights.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The weight increase is 3.60 g. Therefore, mass of H₂O produced = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂, NO₂).\n    *   The weight did not change. This is a crucial piece of information: **no acidic gases were produced** in the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO.\n    *   The weight increase is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted. Therefore, mass of O₂ produced = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 L of a gas C remained at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Gas C did not react with a drying agent, a base, or hot copper. The most likely candidate for such an unreactive gas formed from the decomposition of salts is nitrogen (N₂). We will proceed with this assumption.\n\nSo, the decomposition of the 7.20 g mixture yielded:\n*   0.20 mol H₂O\n*   0.025 mol O₂\n*   0.10 mol N₂\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Salts**\n\nSince the salts completely decomposed into gases, we can find the elemental composition of the original mixture by calculating the moles of each element in the products.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All H comes from H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × Moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** All N comes from N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × Moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in both H₂O and O₂.\n    *   Moles of O = (1 × Moles of H₂O) + (2 × Moles of O₂) = (1 × 0.20) + (2 × 0.025) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\nNow, let's check if the total mass of these elements matches the initial mass of the mixture.\n*   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1 g/mol = 0.40 g\n*   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16 g/mol = 4.00 g\n*   Total Mass = 0.40 + 2.80 + 4.00 = 7.20 g.\n\nThe calculated mass matches the initial mass of the mixture. This confirms that salts A and B are composed only of nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe salts are made of N, H, and O. This points to ammonium salts of nitrogen-based oxoacids. The most common are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\nLet's find the overall empirical formula for the mixture. The molar ratio of the elements is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n\nTo get integers, we can multiply by 20:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\n\nSo, the combined formula of the (A+B) unit from the equimolar mixture is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nNow let's see if our candidate salts fit this combined formula.\n*   Formula of ammonium nitrate (Salt A): NH₄NO₃ → **N₂H₄O₃**\n*   Formula of ammonium nitrite (Salt B): NH₄NO₂ → **N₂H₄O₂**\n\nLet's add them together: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**.\nThis is a perfect match! Therefore, the two salts are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n**4. Verify the Quantities**\n\nLet's confirm this identification by calculating the moles of each salt. The mixture is equimolar, so let 'n' be the moles of each salt.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = n × M(NH₄NO₃) + n × M(NH₄NO₂) = 7.20 g\n*   n × (80 + 64) = 7.20\n*   n × 144 = 7.20\n*   n = 7.20 / 144 = 0.05 mol.\n\nSo, the mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂. The decomposition reactions must be:\n*   Decomposition of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n    *   Products: 0.05 mol N₂ and 2 × 0.05 = 0.10 mol H₂O.\n*   This leaves the remaining products to come from the decomposition of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃.\n    *   Remaining N₂ = 0.10 (total) - 0.05 = 0.05 mol\n    *   Remaining H₂O = 0.20 (total) - 0.10 = 0.10 mol\n    *   Remaining O₂ = 0.025 (total) - 0 = 0.025 mol\n*   So, the reaction for ammonium nitrate must be:\n    *   0.05 NH₄NO₃ → 0.05 N₂ + 0.10 H₂O + 0.025 O₂\n    *   Multiplying by 20 gives the molar ratio: 1 NH₄NO₃ → 1 N₂ + 2 H₂O + 0.5 O₂\n    *   Or, balanced with integers: **2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + 4H₂O + O₂**. This is a known decomposition reaction for ammonium nitrate under strong heating.\nEverything is consistent.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to answer the question: \"Indicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\" This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of A and one formula unit of B.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Atoms = 1 N (in NH₄) + 4 H + 1 N (in NO₃) + 3 O = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Atoms = 1 N (in NH₄) + 4 H + 1 N (in NO₂) + 2 O = 8 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
