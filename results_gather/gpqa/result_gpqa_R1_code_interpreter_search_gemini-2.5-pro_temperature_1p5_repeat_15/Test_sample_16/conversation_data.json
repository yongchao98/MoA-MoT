    "This problem requires us to calculate the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) from the dissociation of a Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Write the dissociation reaction:** The Ca-EDTA complex ($[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$) dissociates into calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) and EDTA ions ($Y^{4-}$). The problem states the initial stoichiometric concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. The equilibrium for this process is:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Determine the equilibrium constant:** The problem provides the formation constant ($K_f$) for the complex, which is $K_{Ca-EDTA} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$.\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}$\n\n    The dissociation constant ($K_d$) is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE table:** We can track the concentrations of the species from the initial state to the equilibrium state. Let 'x' be the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ that dissociates from the complex.\n\n| Species               | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| --------------------- | :---------: | :--------: | :---------------: |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$     |    0.02     |     -x     |      0.02 - x     |\n| $Ca^{2+}$             |      0      |     +x     |         x         |\n| $Y^{4-}$              |      0      |     +x     |         x         |\n\n4.  **Apply the dissociation constant expression:**\n    $K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{(0.02 - x)}$\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{x^2}{0.02 - x}$\n\n5.  **Simplify and solve for x:** Since $K_d$ is extremely small, the amount of complex that dissociates, 'x', will be negligible compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. Thus, we can make the approximation that $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$.\n\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n\n    Now, we solve for x:\n    $x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times (0.02)$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\n    To solve for x, we can use a python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate x from the equation x^2 = 4e-13\nx_squared = 4e-13\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\nprint(f\"The concentration of Ca2+ ions is: {x:.1e} M\")\n```\nThe python script calculates the square root of $4 \\times 10^{-13}$.\n\n$x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-14}} = 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is equal to x.\n\nTherefore, $[Ca^{2+}] = 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.

    "The problem asks for the concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) in a solution where the initial stoichiometric concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M.\n\n1.  **Chemical Equilibrium:** The Ca-EDTA complex, denoted as $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$, is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, $Ca^{2+}$ and $EDTA^{4-}$ (represented as $Y^{4-}$). The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction.\n\n    Dissociation reaction: $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Constant:** The problem gives the formation constant ($K_f$ or $K_{Ca-EDTA}$) for the complex, which describes the formation equilibrium:\n    $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n    For the dissociation reaction, we use the dissociation constant ($K_d$), which is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n3.  **ICE Table:** We can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ ions formed from the dissociation of the complex.\n\n| Species               | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| --------------------- | :---------: | :--------: | :---------------: |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$     |    0.02     |     -x     |      0.02 - x     |\n| $Ca^{2+}$             |      0      |     +x     |         x         |\n| $Y^{4-}$              |      0      |     +x     |         x         |\n\n4.  **Equilibrium Expression and Calculation:** Now, we plug the equilibrium concentrations into the expression for the dissociation constant, $K_d$:\n    $K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{(0.02 - x)}$\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{x^2}{0.02 - x}$\n\n    Since the formation constant ($K_f$) is very large, the complex is very stable. This means the amount that dissociates ('x') will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). Therefore, we can make the simplifying assumption that $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$.\n\n    The equation simplifies to:\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n\n    Now, we solve for x:\n    $x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times 0.02$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\n    We will use python to find the value of x.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the value of x from x^2 = 4e-13\nx_squared = 4e-13\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\n# The concentration of calcium ions is x\nprint(f\"The concentration of Ca2+ ions is: {x:.2e} M\")\n```\nThe result of the calculation shows that $x = 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\nSince we defined x as the equilibrium concentration of $Ca^{2+}$, we have:\n$[Ca^{2+}] = x = 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\nThis value corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n1.  **Reaction and Equilibrium Constant:** The problem involves the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. The formation of the complex is highly favorable, as indicated by the large formation constant, $K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$. The dissociation is the reverse reaction:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n    The equilibrium constant for this dissociation ($K_d$) is the reciprocal of the formation constant ($K_f$):\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n2.  **Setting up the ICE Table:** We use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the concentrations of each species at equilibrium. The initial concentration of the complex is given as 0.02 M. Let 'x' be the change in concentration due to dissociation.\n\n| Species               | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| --------------------- | :---------: | :--------: | :---------------: |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$     |    0.02     |     -x     |      0.02 - x     |\n| $Ca^{2+}$             |      0      |     +x     |         x         |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$           |      0      |     +x     |         x         |\n\n3.  **Solving for x:** We write the equilibrium expression using the dissociation constant, $K_d$:\n    $K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{0.02 - x}$\n\n    Substituting the value of $K_d$:\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{x^2}{0.02 - x}$\n\n    Because $K_d$ is very small, the amount of complex that dissociates (x) is negligible compared to the initial concentration (0.02 M). We can simplify the equation by approximating $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$.\n\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n\n    Now, we solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times (0.02)$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\n    Finally, we take the square root to find x, which represents the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ ions:\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\n    The concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Comparing this result with the given options, it matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
