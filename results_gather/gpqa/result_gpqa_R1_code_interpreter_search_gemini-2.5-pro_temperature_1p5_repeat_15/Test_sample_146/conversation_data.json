    "This problem involves the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) into four new particles, two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. We can solve this by applying the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Initial State Analysis:**\n    *   The reaction begins with a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving.\" This implies its kinetic energy is negligible. In the center-of-mass frame of the system, we can assume both the proton and the antiproton are effectively at rest before annihilation.\n    *   **Initial Momentum ($P_i$):** Since the particles are at rest in the center-of-mass frame, the total initial momentum is zero. $P_i = 0$.\n    *   **Initial Energy ($E_i$):** The total initial energy is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton. The rest mass of a proton and an antiproton are identical.\n        *   Rest energy of a proton, $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.27 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n        *   Therefore, $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$.\n        *   $E_i = 2 \\times 938.27 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876.54 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n\n2.  **Final State Analysis:**\n    *   The final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n    *   All four final particles have the same mass, $m_A$, with a rest energy of $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n    *   **Final Momentum ($P_f$):** By the law of conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero. $P_f = P_i = 0$. This means the four A particles must fly off in directions such that their total vector momentum cancels out.\n    *   **Final Energy ($E_f$):** The total final energy is the sum of the total relativistic energies of the four A particles. Due to momentum and energy conservation, all four particles will have the same speed, $v$.\n        *   The total energy of a single A particle is given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n        *   Therefore, the total final energy for the four particles is $E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n\n3.  **Applying Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   We equate the initial and final energies: $E_i = E_f$.\n    *   $2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n\n4.  **Solving for the Velocity ($v$):**\n    *   First, we solve the energy equation for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n    *   Now, we substitute the known values:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{938.27 \\, \\text{MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\, \\text{MeV}} = \\frac{938.27}{600} \\approx 1.5638$\n    *   Next, we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to solve for the velocity. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n    *   Rearranging the formula to solve for $\\beta$:\n        $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n        $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   Now, we plug in our calculated value for $\\gamma$:\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n        $\\beta \\approx 0.7688$\n    *   Since $\\beta = v/c$, the velocity of particle A is $v \\approx 0.77c$.\n\nFor a more precise calculation, we can use a script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nm_p_c2 = 938.272  # Rest energy of a proton in MeV\nm_A_c2 = 300      # Rest energy of particle A in MeV\n\n# From conservation of energy: E_initial = E_final\n# 2 * m_p * c^2 = 4 * gamma * m_A * c^2\n# Solve for the Lorentz factor, gamma\ngamma = m_p_c2 / (2 * m_A_c2)\n\n# Now solve for beta (v/c) from the definition of gamma\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2)  =>  beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\nbeta = math.sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma**2))\n\nprint(f\"The calculated value for gamma is: {gamma}\")\nprint(f\"The calculated value for beta (v/c) is: {beta}\")\nprint(f\"The velocity of particle A is approximately {beta:.2f}c\")\n```\nThe calculation confirms that the velocity is approximately 0.77c.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The annihilation process is given by $p+\\bar{p}\\rightarrow2A^{+}+2A^{-}$.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after the annihilation.\n    *   **Initial Energy ($E_i$):** The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which means we can approximate its kinetic energy as zero. Assuming the proton is also at rest in the lab frame (or we are in the center-of-mass frame), the total initial energy is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n        *   The rest mass of a proton ($m_p$) is equal to the rest mass of an antiproton ($m_{\\bar{p}}$). The rest energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n        *   Therefore, the total initial energy is $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938.3 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876.6 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n\n    *   **Final Energy ($E_f$):** After the annihilation, there are four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. Since $A^+$ and $A^-$ are a particle-antiparticle pair, they have the same mass, $m_A$. The problem gives $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n        *   Due to the conservation of momentum (initial momentum is zero), the four resulting particles must move off in such a way that their total vector momentum is zero. By symmetry, all four particles will have the same speed, $v$, and thus the same total energy.\n        *   The total relativistic energy of a single particle A is $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n        *   The total final energy for the four particles is $E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n\n2.  **Equating Energies:** Now, we apply the conservation of energy principle, $E_i = E_f$.\n    $2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n3.  **Solving for the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** We can rearrange the equation to solve for $\\gamma$.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n    Plugging in the given values:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{938.3 \\, \\text{MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\, \\text{MeV}} = \\frac{938.3}{600} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n4.  **Solving for the Velocity ($v$):** The Lorentz factor is related to the velocity by the formula $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$. Let $\\beta = v/c$. We can rearrange this to solve for $\\beta$.\n    $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n    $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    Substituting the value of $\\gamma$ we calculated:\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$\n\nTherefore, the velocity of particle A is $v = \\beta c \\approx 0.77c$. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
