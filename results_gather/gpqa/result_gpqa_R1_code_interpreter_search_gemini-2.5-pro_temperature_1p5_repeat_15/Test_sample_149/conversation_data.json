    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting compound from the given molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    DoU = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    A DoU of 5 typically indicates the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DoU) and one additional double bond or ring.\n\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern is a triplet (t), which means it is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-) according to the n+1 rule (1+1=2 neighbours -> triplet, so n=2). This confirms the presence of a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. Two doublets, each integrating to two protons, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet in this region for 2 protons is typical for a primary amine group (-NH2).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This is a doublet integrating to 2 protons. This corresponds to the -CH2- group which is adjacent to the aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting is consistent, as the CH2 protons are split by the single CHO proton into a doublet (n+1 = 1+1 = 2). The chemical shift is consistent with a benzylic methylene group adjacent to a carbonyl.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    We have the following fragments:\n    1.  A para-substituted benzene ring (-C6H4-).\n    2.  An amine group (-NH2).\n    3.  An ethanal group (-CH2CHO).\n    The only way to assemble these fragments to satisfy the formula C8H9NO and the NMR data is to have the -NH2 and -CH2CHO groups at the para (1 and 4) positions of the benzene ring.\n\n    The structure of the starting compound is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the sequence of reactions.**\n\n*   **Reaction 1: NaNO₂ + HCl**\n    This set of reagents is used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH₂ group on the benzene ring is converted into a diazonium salt group (-N₂⁺).\n    The product is 4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride: [⁺N≡N-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO]Cl⁻.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: H₂O**\n    Adding water to a diazonium salt and warming (which is implicit in step 3's \"Heat\") causes the diazonium group to be replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH). This is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction (hydrolysis of the diazonium salt).\n    The product after this step is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**: HO-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO.\n\n*   **Reaction 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    This step involves a strong base (KOH) and heat. 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde has an aldehyde group and acidic α-protons (the protons on the -CH₂- group). These are the classic conditions for an **aldol condensation**.\n\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH⁻) removes an α-proton from one molecule to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide gives the aldol addition product.\n        *   Nucleophile: [HO-C₆H₄-CH-CHO]⁻\n        *   Electrophile: HO-C₆H₄-CH₂-CHO\n        *   Addition Product: After protonation, the product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option (D).\n\n            ```\n                  CHO\n                  |\n            HO-Ar-CH  -  CH(OH)  -  CH₂-Ar-OH\n                  (C2)      (C3)       (C4)\n            (where Ar = a phenylene ring)\n            ```\n\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The term \"Heat\" in the reaction conditions indicates that the aldol addition product will likely undergo dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a more stable product. Dehydration of the aldol product involves removing the -OH group from C3 and a proton from an adjacent carbon (C2 or C4).\n        *   Removal of the acidic α-proton from C2 and the -OH from C3 is strongly favored because it results in an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The resulting double bond is conjugated with both the carbonyl group and the adjacent phenyl ring, creating a very stable, extended conjugated system.\n        *   The product of this dehydration is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This corresponds to option (C).\n\n            ```\n                  CHO\n                  |\n            HO-Ar-C   =   C   -   CH₂-Ar-OH\n                  (C2)  (C3)    (C4)\n            ```\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Final Product.**\n\nThe question asks for the **final product**. In an aldol reaction performed with heat, the reaction generally does not stop at the addition stage (product D). The dehydration step is thermodynamically driven, especially with heating, to form the stable conjugated condensation product (product C). Therefore, 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal is the final major product of the reaction sequence.\n\n<<<C>>>"
