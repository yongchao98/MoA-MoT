    "This problem requires us to compare the photometric signal produced by stellar spots with that of a transiting exoplanet. We need to find the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would cause a transit depth equal to the brightness variation caused by the spots.\n\n**1. Calculate the amplitude of brightness variation due to stellar spots.**\n\nThe brightness of a star, or its flux (F), is governed by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the flux is proportional to the effective temperature to the fourth power (F ∝ T⁴). We are interested in the flux from the visible stellar disk.\n\n*   Let F_max be the flux when the immaculate (unspotted) hemisphere is facing the observer. The entire visible disk has the star's effective temperature, T_eff. We can normalize this flux to 1.\n    F_max ∝ A_disk * T_eff⁴, where A_disk = π * R_star².\n\n*   Let F_min be the flux when the spotty hemisphere is facing the observer. This hemisphere has a fraction `f` of its area covered by cool, dark spots.\n    *   Fraction of the disk that is unspotted = (1 - f)\n    *   Fraction of the disk that is spotted = f\n    *   Temperature of the unspotted photosphere = T_eff = 6000 K\n    *   Temperature of the spots = T_spot = T_eff - 1000 K = 5000 K\n\nThe total flux from this spotty disk is the sum of the flux from the hot and cool parts:\nF_min ∝ A_disk * [(1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴]\n\n*   The relative amplitude of the variation (ΔF / F_max) is the difference in flux divided by the maximum flux:\n    Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\n    Amplitude = 1 - (F_min / F_max)\n    Amplitude = 1 - [((1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴]\n    Amplitude = 1 - [(1 - f) + f * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]\n    Amplitude = 1 - 1 + f - f * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴\n    Amplitude = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]\n\n**2. Relate the spot-induced amplitude to a transiting exoplanet.**\n\nFor a transiting exoplanet, the depth of the transit (the dip in brightness) is the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\nTransit Depth = (Area_planet) / (Area_star) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n**3. Equate the two signals and solve for R_pl / R_star.**\n\nWe want the transit depth to be equal to the amplitude of the spot-induced variation.\n(R_pl / R_star)² = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n*   Filling factor, f = 0.20\n*   Star's effective temperature, T_eff = 6000 K\n*   Spot temperature, T_spot = 5000 K\n\n(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.20 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴]\n(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.20 * [1 - (5/6)⁴]\n\nTo get the final value, we will solve this equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given parameters\nf = 0.20  # Filling factor of spots\nT_eff = 6000  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\nT_spot = 5000  # Temperature of the spots in Kelvin\n\n# Calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation due to spots\n# Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\namplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\n\n# The amplitude is equal to the transit depth, which is (R_pl / R_star)**2\n# So, R_pl / R_star = sqrt(amplitude)\nRpl_Rstar_ratio = math.sqrt(amplitude)\n\nprint(Rpl_Rstar_ratio)\n```\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.3218. This value is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem asks us to find the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet (Rpl/Rstar) that would produce the same dip in brightness as the rotational modulation caused by a large spotted region on the star.\n\n### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Calculate the Flux Variation Due to Stellar Spots:**\n    The brightness of a star, or its flux (F), is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the energy radiated per unit area is proportional to the fourth power of the effective temperature (T_eff).\n    *   Flux ∝ T⁴\n\n    We need to compare the star's brightness in two scenarios as it rotates:\n    *   **Maximum Brightness (F_max):** This occurs when the immaculate (unspotted) hemisphere is facing the observer. The flux is proportional to the star's effective temperature. Let's normalize the projected area of the star's disk to 1.\n        F_max ∝ T_eff⁴\n\n    *   **Minimum Brightness (F_min):** This occurs when the spotty hemisphere faces the observer. This hemisphere has a fraction `f` (the filling factor) of its area covered by cooler spots and a fraction `(1-f)` at the normal effective temperature.\n        *   Star's effective temperature, T_eff = 6000 K\n        *   Spot temperature, T_spot = T_eff - 1000 K = 5000 K\n        *   Filling factor, f = 20% = 0.20\n\n        The total flux from this hemisphere is a weighted average of the flux from the hot photosphere and the cool spots:\n        F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴\n\n    The relative amplitude of the brightness variation is the fractional change in flux:\n    Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\n    Amplitude = 1 - (F_min / F_max)\n    Amplitude = 1 - [((1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴]\n    Amplitude = 1 - [(1 - f) + f * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]\n    Amplitude = 1 - 1 + f - f * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴\n    Amplitude = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]\n\n2.  **Calculate the Signal from a Transiting Exoplanet:**\n    When an exoplanet transits its star, it blocks a portion of the star's light.
