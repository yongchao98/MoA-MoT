    "This problem involves the concepts of special relativity, specifically time dilation, and radioactive decay.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the decay process:** The decay of unstable particles follows an exponential law. The number of particles `N(t)` remaining after a time `t` from an initial sample `N₀` is given by `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / T)`, where `T` is the mean lifetime of the particles in the frame of reference where time `t` is measured.\n\n2.  **Identify the frame of reference:** The problem is described from the perspective of the laboratory (the detector). The distance `L` (30 m) and the survival fractions (1/3 and 2/3) are measured in this lab frame. Therefore, we must use the particle's lifetime as measured in the lab frame.\n\n3.  **Apply time dilation:** Due to relativistic effects, a moving particle's internal clock runs slower as observed from the lab frame. This effect is called time dilation. The particle's mean lifetime in the lab frame, `T_lab`, is related to its proper lifetime `τ` (the lifetime in its own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n    `T_lab = γ * τ`\n\n4.  **Determine the time of flight:** The particles travel from the center of the detector to its inner wall, a distance `L = 30 m`. The time this takes in the lab frame is `t_lab = L / v`, where `v` is the particle's speed.\n    The problem states the particles are ultra-relativistic with a Lorentz factor of `~20`. A high Lorentz factor implies that the speed `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`. For `γ=20`, `v` is about 99.875% of `c`. For the purpose of calculating the time of flight, the approximation `v ≈ c` is excellent and standard practice in such problems.\n    So, `t_lab ≈ L / c`.\n\n5.  **Combine the equations:** Now we can write the formula for the fraction of particles `P = N/N₀` that survive the journey to the detector wall:\n    `P = N(t_lab) / N₀ = exp(-t_lab / T_lab)`\n    Substituting the expressions for `t_lab` and `T_lab`:\n    `P = exp(-(L/c) / (γτ))`\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    `P = exp(-L / (γcτ))`\n\n6.  **Set up the equations for the two scenarios:**\n    Let's group the constants together. The term `L / (cτ)` is a constant value for this specific particle and detector setup. Let `K = L / (cτ)`.\n    The relationship is `P = exp(-K / γ)`.\n\n    *   **Scenario 1:** `γ₁ = 20`, and the survival fraction `P₁ = 1/3`.\n        `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\n    *   **Scenario 2:** `γ₂` is unknown, and the desired survival fraction `P₂ = 2/3`.\n        `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\n7.  **Solve for the unknown Lorentz factor `γ₂`:**\n    We can solve this system of two equations. First, let's take the natural logarithm of both equations:\n    1) `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`  => `-ln(3) = -K / 20` => `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n    2) `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂` => `γ₂ = -K / ln(2/3)`\n\n    Now, substitute the expression for `K` from the first equation into the second one:\n    `γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3)`\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b)`:\n    `γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / (ln(2) - ln(3))`\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n\n8.  **Calculate the numerical value:**\n    We can now compute the value of `γ₂`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values from the problem\ngamma_1 = 20\nP_1 = 1/3\nP_2 = 2/3\n\n# From the relationship P = exp(-K / gamma), we derive that gamma * ln(P) is constant.\n# So, gamma_2 * ln(P_2) = gamma_1 * ln(P_1)\n# gamma_2 = gamma_1 * ln(P_1) / ln(P_2)\n\n# Calculation\nln_P_1 = math.log(P_1)  # ln(1/3) = -ln(3)\nln_P_2 = math.log(P_2)  # ln(2/3) = ln(2) - ln(3)\n\ngamma_2 = gamma_1 * ln_P_1 / ln_P_2\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n>54.18510526364843\n\nThe calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19.

    "The problem relates the survival fraction of decaying particles to their Lorentz factor. The survival fraction `P` of a particle traveling a distance `L` is given by `P = exp(-t_lab / T_lab)`, where `t_lab` is the time of flight in the lab frame and `T_lab` is the particle's mean lifetime in the lab frame.\n\n1.  **Time of Flight in the Lab Frame (`t_lab`)**:\n    The particles are ultra-relativistic, so their speed `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`. The time it takes for them to travel the detector radius `L` is `t_lab = L / v ≈ L / c`.\n\n2.  **Mean Lifetime in the Lab Frame (`T_lab`)**:\n    Due to time dilation, the lifetime of a moving particle is extended in the lab frame. `T_lab = γ * τ`, where `τ` is the proper mean lifetime (in the particle's rest frame) and `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Survival Fraction Formula**:\n    Substituting the expressions for `t_lab` and `T_lab` into the survival equation:\n    `P = exp(-(L/c) / (γτ))`\n    This can be rewritten as `P = exp(-K / γ)`, where `K = L / (cτ)` is a constant that depends on the particle type and the detector size.\n\n4.  **Solving for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (`γ₂`)**:\n    We have two scenarios:\n    *   **Scenario 1**: `P₁ = 1/3` when `γ₁ = 20`.\n        `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n    *   **Scenario 2**: `P₂ = 2/3` when `γ₂` is unknown.\n        `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\n    We can solve for `γ₂` by first taking the natural logarithm of both equations:\n    1.  `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`  => `K = -20 * ln(1/3) = 20 * ln(3)`\n    2.  `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`  => `γ₂ = -K / ln(2/3)`\n\n    Now substitute the expression for `K` from the first equation into the second:\n    `γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3)`\n    Using logarithm properties `ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b)` and `ln(1/a) = -ln(a)`:\n    `γ₂ = - (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(2) - ln(3))`\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n\n5.  **Calculation**:\n    Using the values `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(2) ≈ 0.6931`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * 1.0986 / (1.0986 - 0.6931)`\n    `γ₂ = 21.972 / 0.4055`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 54.185`\n\n    The Python code provided in the thinking process confirms this calculation, yielding `~54.19`.\n\n    Comparing this result to the given options:\n    A) 28\n    B) 40\n    C) 54\n    D) 68\n\n    The closest value is 54.\n\n<<<C>>>"
