    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understanding Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between successive collisions. The general formula for a particle moving through a field of target particles is:\n\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\n\n*   `n` is the number density of the target particles.\n*   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective \"area\" that the particle presents for a collision.\n\n**2. Analyzing the Two Scenarios**\n\n*   **Scenario 1: Gas-Gas Collisions (λ1)**\n    *   This is the mean free path of a gas molecule moving through other identical gas molecules.\n    *   In this case, both the projectile and the target molecules are moving. The kinetic theory of gases shows that this relative motion introduces a factor of √2 into the denominator.\n    *   The formula is: **λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)**\n    *   Here, `n` is the number density of gas molecules, and `σ_gg` is the gas-gas kinetic collision cross-section, which is related to the physical size of the molecules.\n\n*   **Scenario 2: Electron-Gas Collisions (λ2)**\n    *   This is the mean free path of a high-energy electron from the beam scattering off a gas molecule.\n    *   The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, meaning they have very high kinetic energy (1 MeV) and travel at relativistic speeds (over 94% of the speed of light).\n    *   Compared to these ultra-fast electrons, the gas molecules (at room temperature) are essentially stationary targets. Therefore, the √2 factor for relative motion is not used.\n    *   The formula is: **λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)**\n    *   Here, `n` is the same number density of gas molecules, and `σ_eg` is the electron-gas scattering cross-section.\n\n**3. Comparing λ1 and λ2**\n\nTo compare the two mean free paths, we can take their ratio:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]\nλ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)\n**λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)**\n\n**4. Comparing the Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg)**\n\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis.\n\n*   **σ_gg (Gas-Gas Cross-Section):** This is determined by the physical radius of the gas molecules. Think of it as a \"billiard ball\" collision. This value is relatively constant and independent of energy in this context.\n\n*   **σ_eg (Electron-Gas Scattering Cross-Section):** This is not a physical contact collision. It's an interaction between the electric field of the incoming electron and the electric field of the atom (its nucleus and electron cloud). The cross-section for this interaction is highly dependent on the energy of the incoming electron.\n    *   For low-energy electrons (around 100 eV), the interaction probability is high, and `σ_eg` is at its maximum.\n    *   However, the problem specifies a **1000 kV (1 MeV)** accelerating voltage. At such extremely high, relativistic energies, the electron travels past the gas molecule so quickly that the interaction time is minuscule. This results in a very low probability of the electron being significantly scattered. For high-energy charged particles, the scattering cross-section generally decreases as energy increases (roughly proportional to 1/E²).\n    *   Therefore, for the 1000 keV electrons in the TEM, the scattering cross-section `σ_eg` is **much smaller** than the gas-gas kinetic cross-section `σ_gg`.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nSince `σ_gg` is much larger than `σ_eg`, the ratio `(σ_gg / σ_eg)` is a large number (>> 1).\n\nLet's plug this back into our ratio formula:\nλ2 / λ1 = √2 * (a large number)\nλ2 / λ1 >> √2\nλ2 >> 1.414 * λ1\n\nThis means that the mean free path of the high-energy electrons (`λ2`) is significantly **longer** than the mean free path of the gas molecules (`λ1`). The electrons travel much farther, on average, before being scattered.\n\n**6. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   A) λ2 = λ1 -> False.\n*   B) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 -> **True**. Our analysis shows that λ2 is much larger than λ1, so it is certainly greater than 1.22*λ1.\n*   C) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 -> False.\n*   D) λ2 < λ1 -> False. This would only be true if the electrons had low energy.\n\nThe number 1.22 is a specific value, but the general physical principle for high-energy electrons provides a clear conclusion that only aligns with option B. Even a simplified model where one might mistakenly assume the cross-sections are equal (`σ_gg ≈ σ_eg`) would yield λ2 ≈ √2 * λ1 ≈ 1.414 * λ1, which also satisfies the condition in B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
