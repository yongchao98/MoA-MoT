    "The user wants me to identify the immunological process responsible for high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating B cells in Peyer's patches following oral antigen administration.\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental setup:**\n    *   **Antigen:** Rotavirus inner capsid proteins tagged with GFP.\n    *   **Delivery:** Oral gavage in mice. This means the antigen will primarily interact with the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT).\n    *   **Observation Site:** Peyer's patches, which are a key component of GALT and are secondary lymphoid organs.\n    *   **Cell Population:** Proliferating cells are isolated. In a secondary lymphoid organ, following antigen encounter, this proliferation is characteristic of a germinal center reaction.\n    *   **Key Finding:** Sequencing of the variable heavy chain (VH) gene from these cells shows *high variability*.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the options based on the findings:**\n\n    *   **A) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process alters the *constant* region of the heavy chain (e.g., switching from IgM to IgA or IgG). It does *not* affect the variable region. While CSR is likely happening in these B cells (especially a switch to IgA in the gut), it doesn't explain the variability observed in the *variable* heavy chain gene.\n\n    *   **B) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that initially creates the diverse repertoire of B cell receptors. It occurs in *developing* B cells in the *primary* lymphoid organs (bone marrow). The experiment is looking at mature B cells that have already encountered an antigen and are proliferating in a *secondary* lymphoid organ. VDJ recombination has already occurred and is not the active process generating new variability in this context.\n\n    *   **C) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This process specifically introduces point mutations at a high rate into the rearranged variable region genes (including the VH gene) of activated B cells that are proliferating within germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). The goal of SHM is to fine-tune the antibody response by generating variants, some of which will have a higher affinity for the antigen. This process perfectly matches the observation of *high variability in the variable heavy chain gene* in a *proliferating cell population* within the *Peyer's patches* after antigen stimulation.\n\n    *   **D) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system (and can be activated by antibodies in the adaptive response). It involves a cascade of serum proteins that helps clear pathogens. It has no role in altering the genetic makeup of B cells.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The high variability observed in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating B cells in a germinal center reaction is the hallmark of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
