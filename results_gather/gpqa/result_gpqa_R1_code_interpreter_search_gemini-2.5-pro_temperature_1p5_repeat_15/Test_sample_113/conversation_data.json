    "*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reaction:** `butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile`\n    *   **Type of Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic addition reaction, specifically the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  The cyanide ion (CN⁻), from the dissociation of NaCN, acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n        2.  This forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate: `CH₃CH₂C(O⁻)(CN)CH₃`.\n        3.  This intermediate needs to be protonated by an acid to form the final product, a cyanohydrin, which has a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    *   **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺). In a laboratory setting, this is typically achieved by adding a mineral acid like HCl or H₂SO₄ after the initial addition of cyanide. The notation `H₃O⁺` represents a strong acid in an aqueous solution. While adding a strong acid directly to a high concentration of NaCN can be dangerous (liberating toxic HCN gas), the reaction is often performed by generating HCN *in situ* under slightly acidic conditions or by an acidic workup. In the context of the choices provided, H₃O⁺ is the correct representation for the required acid catalyst/proton source. NaHSO₃ is used for bisulfite addition, not cyanohydrin formation.\n    *   Therefore, **A = H₃O⁺**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reaction:** `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`\n    *   **Type of Reaction:** This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-C≡N) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   **Mechanism:** The hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids is a common transformation in organic synthesis. It can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base, typically with heating.\n        *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** The reaction proceeds by protonation of the nitrogen atom, followed by nucleophilic attack by water. After a series of steps involving an amide intermediate, the final product is a carboxylic acid and an ammonium ion (NH₄⁺).\n        *   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** This involves the nucleophilic attack of a hydroxide ion (OH⁻) on the nitrile carbon, ultimately forming a carboxylate salt. A subsequent acidification step is required to obtain the carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B, along with water, is the catalyst for this hydrolysis. Looking at the options for B:\n        *   `HCl` (hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid and is a standard reagent used to effectively hydrolyze nitriles.\n        *   `CH₃COOH` (acetic acid) is a weak acid. While it could theoretically catalyze the reaction, it would be extremely slow and inefficient compared to a strong acid.\n    *   Since the goal is to perform the reaction effectively, a strong acid like HCl is the appropriate choice.\n    *   Therefore, **B = HCl**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   For the first reaction, A = H₃O⁺.\n    *   For the second reaction, B = HCl.\n    *   Combining these, the correct option is the one where A is H₃O⁺ and B is HCl.\n\n*   **Matching with Options:**\n    *   A) A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH (Incorrect)\n    *   B) A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl (Correct)\n    *   C) A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl (Incorrect)\n    *   D) A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH (Incorrect)\n\nThe correct combination of reagents is given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
