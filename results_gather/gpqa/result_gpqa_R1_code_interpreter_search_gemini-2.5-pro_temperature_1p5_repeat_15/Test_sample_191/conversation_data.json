    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial setup:** We have an uncharged spherical conductor with an off-center spherical cavity. A positive point charge, `+q`, is placed inside this cavity. We need to find the electric field at a point P outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Principle of Electrostatic Induction:** The presence of the charge `+q` inside the cavity will cause the mobile charges (electrons) within the conductor to redistribute themselves. This is called electrostatic induction.\n    *   **Inner Surface:** The positive charge `+q` will attract negative charges. A total charge of `-q` will be induced on the inner surface of the cavity. This is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law: if we imagine a Gaussian surface within the conducting material that encloses the cavity, the electric field on this surface must be zero (since it's inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium). For the net flux to be zero, the total enclosed charge must be zero. Thus, the charge on the inner wall must be `-q` to cancel the `+q` charge.\n    *   **Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a corresponding positive charge of `+q` must appear elsewhere to maintain the overall neutrality of the conductor. As charges in a conductor can only reside on its surfaces in equilibrium, this `+q` charge will distribute itself on the *outer surface* of the main spherical conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage effect):** A crucial concept here is that a conducting shell shields its exterior from the electric fields of any charges placed inside it.\n    *   The combined electric field produced by the point charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface is exactly zero everywhere *outside* the cavity.\n    *   Therefore, for an observer at point P (which is outside the main conductor and thus definitely outside the cavity), the electric field contribution from the original charge `+q` and the induced charge `-q` is zero.\n\n4.  **Field from the Outer Charge:**\n    *   Based on the shielding principle, the only charge that contributes to the electric field at point P is the `+q` charge distributed on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n    *   How is this `+q` charge distributed? The inner cavity and its contents (`+q` and the induced `-q`) are completely shielded from the outside. The outer surface \"sees\" no net charge inside. Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere and there are no other external fields, the charge `+q` will distribute itself **uniformly** over the surface to achieve the lowest energy state (electrostatic equilibrium).\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:**\n    *   The problem is now simplified to finding the electric field at point P due to a charge `+q` distributed uniformly on the surface of a sphere of radius `R` centered at O.\n    *   According to the Shell Theorem (or by applying Gauss's Law), the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as the field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude (`+q`) located at the center of the sphere (point O).\n    *   The distance from the center O to the point P is given as `L`.\n    *   Using Coulomb's Law for a point charge, the magnitude of the electric field at P is:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{Total Charge}}{\\text{distance}^2}$\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n6.  **Evaluate the given options:**\n    *   A) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$: Incorrect. This ignores the shielding and charge redistribution effect of the conductor. The distance `l` (from the cavity center) is irrelevant for the external field.\n    *   B) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$: Correct. This matches our derivation. The external field is as if the charge `q` is at the center of the conductor.\n    *   C) & D): Incorrect. These options use complex distance formulas derived from the geometry of the cavity's position, which is made irrelevant by electrostatic shielding.\n\n**Conclusion:** The internal configuration of the charge and the cavity does not affect the electric field outside the conductor. The external field is determined solely by the total charge induced on the outer surface (`+q`) and its geometry (a sphere centered at O).\n\n<<<B>>>"
