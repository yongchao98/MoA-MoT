    "*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n    Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism where molecules have the same molecular formula and connectivity but are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. Such molecules are called enantiomers. A key condition for a molecule to exhibit optical isomerism is that it must be **chiral**, meaning it lacks an internal plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound for chirality.\n\n*   **1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl compound. The two phenyl rings are joined by a single bond.\n    *   **Atropisomerism:** Free rotation around the single bond between the two phenyl rings is severely restricted by the presence of large, bulky groups at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). In this molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups: two nitro groups (-NO2) and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n    *   **Chirality:** This restricted rotation (hindered rotation) leads to a stable, non-planar conformation. For such an atropisomer to be chiral, the molecule must not be superimposable on its mirror image. This is the case here because each ring is asymmetrically substituted (e.g., ring 1 has a -COOCH3 group at position 2 and a -NO2 group at position 6). The molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Therefore, it is chiral and will exist as a pair of enantiomers. It exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. It is also known as methyl lactate.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** A carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups is called a chiral center or an asymmetric carbon atom. Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is attached to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n    *   **Chirality:** Since the carbon at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. The presence of a single chiral center in a molecule makes it chiral (unless it's a meso compound, which is not applicable here). Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **3. benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is (C6H5)2C=O. It is a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule is achiral. It has a plane of symmetry that contains the carbonyl group (C=O) and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   **Chirality:** Since benzophenone is achiral, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **4. dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the two -COOCH3 groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule is planar. It possesses a center of inversion (also called a center of symmetry) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. Any molecule with a center of inversion is achiral.\n    *   **Chirality:** Since dimethyl fumarate is achiral, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n    Based on the analysis, compounds **1** (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate) and **2** (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) are chiral and therefore show optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and do not.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is D, which includes 1 and 2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
