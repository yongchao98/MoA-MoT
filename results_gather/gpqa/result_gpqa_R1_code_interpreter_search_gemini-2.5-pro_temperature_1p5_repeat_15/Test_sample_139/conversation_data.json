    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B and the heavy isotope.**\n    The problem states that substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\".\n    277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    This is very close to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    This strongly suggests that **B is heavy water, D₂O**.\n    This also means the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the first clue is Deuterium (D or ²H). Therefore, Substance X must contain Deuterium.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W.**\n    The gas W, released in the reaction, has a molecule containing the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's examine some small gas molecules that could be formed:\n    *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (p≠n)\n    *   **D₂ (Deuterium gas):** Contains two Deuterium atoms. Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So, the D₂ molecule has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. (p=n). This is a perfect match.\n    *   N₂: Contains two ¹⁴N atoms. Each has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. The molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. (p=n). This is a possibility.\n    *   CO: Contains ¹²C (6p, 6n) and ¹⁶O (8p, 8n). The molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. (p=n). This is also a possibility.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X.**\n    We know X contains Deuterium (D) and reacts to produce D₂ gas. It is also mentioned that X and its \"very close analog\" are used as reagents in organic chemistry. This points towards common deuterated reagents.\n    Let's consider powerful reducing agents, as they can react with certain substances to produce hydrogen (or deuterium) gas.\n    A prime candidate is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   Its \"very close analog\" is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄), a very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. This fits the clue.\n    *   It contains the heavier isotope, Deuterium. This fits the clue.\n\n4.  **Verify the reaction.**\n    Let's test the hypothesis that X is LiAlD₄.\n    X (LiAlD₄) reacts \"violently with liquid Y\" to release gas W (D₂) and form precipitate G.\n    LiAlH₄ is known to react violently with water. The reaction of LiAlD₄ with heavy water (D₂O) would be analogous and violent. Let's assume **Y is D₂O**.\n    *   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂\n    *   **Gas W:** The reaction produces D₂ gas. As established in step 2, D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits perfectly.\n    *   **Precipitate G:** The products are LiOD (soluble) and Al(OD)₃ (Aluminum deuteroxide). Aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is a gelatinous precipitate. Thus, **Al(OD)₃ would be the precipitate G**. This fits.\n    *   **Heating G to get B:** When Aluminum hydroxide is heated, it decomposes to aluminum oxide and water (2 Al(OH)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3 H₂O). Similarly, heating G (Al(OD)₃) would yield B (D₂O): 2 Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O. We already identified B as D₂O. This confirms the reaction sequence.\n\n5.  **Verify the final clue.**\n    \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    *   A keto acid has a general structure R-C(=O)-COOH, containing one ketone group and one carboxylic acid group (3 oxygen atoms total).\n    *   Substance X (LiAlD₄) is a strong reducing agent. It reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols.\n    *   R-C(=O)-COOH + LiAlD₄ (followed by workup) → R-CD(OH)-CD₂(OH)\n    *   The final product is a diol, which contains **2 atoms of oxygen**. This clue is also satisfied.\n\n6.  **Calculate the final answer.**\n    Having confidently identified **Substance X as LiAlD₄**, we can perform the calculation.\n    *   The elements present in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1, in the form of Deuterium isotope D).\n    *   The **lightest element** (by atomic number) is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** (by atomic number) is Aluminum.\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present\". We must sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the formula. We will use integer atomic masses (mass numbers) as suggested by the integer options.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The formula contains four atoms of Hydrogen, specifically the Deuterium (²H) isotope. The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        Cumulative mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The formula contains one atom of Aluminum. The most common stable isotope is ²⁷Al. The mass number of Aluminum is 27.\n        Cumulative mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Total Sum:** 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
