    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **Part 1: Determine the Molecular Formula and Bond Count**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the structure of the molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2 to determine its molecular formula and the number of each type of bond.\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula (C_x H_y):**\n    *   (CH3)2C= group: 1 C on the backbone + 2 C in methyl groups = 3 C; 2 * 3 = 6 H.\n    *   =CH- group: 1 C; 1 H.\n    *   -CH2- group: 1 C; 2 H.\n    *   -CH(CH3)- group: 1 C on the backbone + 1 C in the methyl group = 2 C; 1 H + 3 H = 4 H.\n    *   -CH2- group: 1 C; 2 H.\n    *   -CH= group: 1 C; 1 H.\n    *   =C(CH3)2 group: 1 C on the backbone + 2 C in methyl groups = 3 C; 2 * 3 = 6 H.\n\n    Summing these up:\n    *   Total Carbon (C) atoms = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12.\n    *   Total Hydrogen (H) atoms = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22.\n    *   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n2.  **Bond Count:**\n    Let's visualize the connectivity to count the bonds:\n    (Me)2C=CH-CH2-CH(Me)-CH2-CH=C(Me)2\n    *   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n    *   **C=C bonds:** There are two double bonds indicated in the formula: (C=CH) and (CH=C). So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   **C-C bonds:** We count the single bonds between carbon atoms.\n        *   Bonds from the backbone carbons to methyl group carbons: 2 (on the left) + 1 (in the middle) + 2 (on the right) = 5.\n        *   Bonds within the main carbon backbone: C=C-C-C-C-C-C=C. The single bonds are between C2-C3, C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6. This seems complex. Let's use a more reliable method based on the fragments.\n        *   (CH3)2C=: 2 C-C bonds.\n        *   =CH-CH2-: 1 C-C bond.\n        *   -CH2-CH(CH3)-: 1 C-C bond.\n        *   -CH(CH3)-: 1 C-C bond to the methyl group.\n        *   CH-CH2-: 1 C-C bond.\n        *   -CH2-CH=: 1 C-C bond.\n        *   =C(CH3)2: 2 C-C bonds.\n        *   Let's sum them carefully:\n            *   Bonds connecting groups: C=C(1)-C(2), C(2)-C(3), C(3)-C(4), C(4)-C(5), C(5)=C(6) --> 4 C-C bonds.\n            *   Bonds to methyl groups: 2 on C(1), 1 on C(3), 2 on C(6) --> 5 C-C bonds.\n            *   Total C-C bonds = 4 + 5 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n### **Part 2: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is calculated using the following thermodynamic cycle (Hess's Law):\n\nΔHf = (Sum of enthalpies of atomization of reactants in standard state) - (Sum of bond energies of the product)\n\nThe formation reaction is: 12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\n1.  **Calculate the enthalpy of atomization of the compound (ΔHat(compound))**:\n    This is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the molecule.\n    ΔHat(C12H22) = (9 × BE(C-C)) + (2 × BE(C=C)) + (22 × BE(C-H))\n    ΔHat(C12H22) = (9 × 200 kJ/mol) + (2 × 300 kJ/mol) + (22 × 400 kJ/mol)\n    ΔHat(C12H22) = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n2.  **Calculate the sum of enthalpies of atomization for the elements (ΣΔHat(elements))**:\n    This is the energy required to convert the elements from their standard states (C(s) and H2(g)) to gaseous atoms (C(g) and H(g)).\n    *   For Carbon: 12 C(s) → 12 C(g)\n        ΔH_C = 12 mol × ΔHat(C) = 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ.\n    *   For Hydrogen: 11 H2(g) → 22 H(g)\n        ΔH_H = 11 mol × BE(H-H) = 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ.\n    *   Total ΣΔHat(elements) = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf) in kJ/mol**:\n    ΔHf = ΣΔHat(elements) - ΔHat(compound)\n    ΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n### **Part 3: Convert to kJ/g and Final Answer**\n\nThe calculated value is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's check the options. One option is 11.44 kJ/g. We need to convert our result to these units to compare.\n\n1.  **Molar Mass of C12H22**:\n    Using atomic masses C ≈ 12 g/mol and H ≈ 1 g/mol.\n    M = (12 × 12) + (22 × 1) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n\n2.  **Convert ΔHf to kJ/g**:\n    ΔHf (kJ/g) = ΔHf (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\n    ΔHf (kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol ≈ **11.4457... kJ/g**.\n\nThis value matches option A.\n\nLet's use a Python script to verify the arithmetic.\n```python\n# Given data from the problem\nenthalpy_atomization_C = 1000  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_H_H = 100         # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_C_C = 200         # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_C_double_C = 300  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_C_H = 400         # kJ/mol\n\n# From our analysis of the molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\nnum_C = 12\nnum_H = 22\nnum_C_C_bonds = 9\nnum_C_double_C_bonds = 2\nnum_C_H_bonds = 22\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the enthalpy of atomization of the compound\nenthalpy_atomization_compound = (num_C_C_bonds * bond_energy_C_C) + \\\n                                (num_C_double_C_bonds * bond_energy_C_double_C) + \\\n                                (num_C_H_bonds * bond_energy_C_H)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the total enthalpy of atomization of the constituent elements\nnum_H2_moles = num_H / 2\ntotal_enthalpy_atomization_elements = (num_C * enthalpy_atomization_C) + \\\n                                      (num_H2_moles * bond_energy_H_H)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol\nenthalpy_formation_kJ_per_mol = total_enthalpy_atomization_elements - enthalpy_atomization_compound\n\n# Step 4: Convert the enthalpy of formation to kJ/g\nmolar_mass_C12H22 = (num_C * 12) + (num_H * 1)\nenthalpy_formation_kJ_per_g = enthalpy_formation_kJ_per_mol / molar_mass_C12H22\n\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation (kJ/mol): {enthalpy_formation_kJ_per_mol}\")\nprint(f\"Molar Mass (g/mol): {molar_mass_C12H22}\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation (kJ/g): {enthalpy_formation_kJ_per_g}\")\n```\n> Enthalpy of formation (kJ/mol): 1900.0\n> Molar Mass (g/mol): 166\n> Enthalpy of formation (kJ/g): 11.44578313253012\n\nThe calculated result is approximately 11.44 kJ/g.

    "### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Objective:** Calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) of the given organic molecule.\n\n2.  **Strategy:** The enthalpy of formation is defined as the enthalpy change when one mole of a compound is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states. The reaction is:\n    12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\n    We can calculate this using Hess's Law and bond energies via a thermodynamic cycle:\n    *   **Step A:** Atomize the elements from their standard states into gaseous atoms.\n        *   12 C(s) → 12 C(g)\n        *   11 H2(g) → 22 H(g)\n    *   **Step B:** Form the compound from the gaseous atoms. This is the reverse of atomizing the compound, so its enthalpy change is the negative of the sum of all bond energies in the molecule.\n        *   12 C(g) + 22 H(g) → C12H22(g)\n\n    The enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) will be the sum of the enthalpy changes of Step A and Step B.\n    ΔH_f = [ΔH_atomization(elements)] - [ΔH_atomization(compound)]\n    ΔH_f = [ΔH_atomization(elements)] - [Sum of bond energies of the compound]\n\n3.  **Step-by-step Calculation:**\n\n    *   **Part 1: Analyze the molecule to find the number and type of atoms and bonds.**\n        *   **Molecule:** (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\n        *   **Molecular Formula (Count atoms):**\n            *   Carbons (C): 2(from (CH3)2) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1(from CH3) + 1 + 1 + 2(from (CH3)2) = 12 Carbons.\n            *   Hydrogens (H): 2*3(from (CH3)2) + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3(from CH3) + 2 + 1 + 2*3(from (CH3)2) = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 Hydrogens.\n            *   Formula: **C12H22**\n        *   **Bond Count:**\n            *   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n            *   **C=C bonds:** There are two double bonds explicitly shown: C=C and C=C. Total is **2**.\n            *   **C-C bonds:** We count the single bonds between carbon atoms. The total number of bonds between the 12 carbon atoms must be 11 for an acyclic structure. Since 2 are double bonds, the remaining must be single bonds. So, 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n                *   Let's verify by counting:\n                    *   (CH3)2**C**=: 2 bonds to methyl groups.\n                    *   =C-**C**: 1 bond.\n                    *   -C-**C**: 1 bond.\n                    *   -C-**C**(CH3): 1 bond to the next C in the chain and 1 bond to the methyl group. (Total 2)\n                    *   C-**C**: 1 bond.\n                    *   -C-**C**: 1 bond.\n                    *   =**C**(CH3)2: 2 bonds to methyl groups.\n                    *   Let's draw the backbone: C1=C2-C3-C4-C5-C6=C7. Single bonds are C2-C3, C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6. (4 single bonds).\n                    *   Methyl groups attached: 2 on C1, 1 on C4, 2 on C7. (5 single bonds).\n                    *   Total C-C single bonds = 4 + 5 = 9. The count is correct.\n\n    *   **Part 2: Calculate the enthalpy of atomization of the elements in their standard state.**\n        *   This is the energy needed to form 12 moles of C(g) and 22 moles of H(g).\n        *   Energy for Carbon: 12 mol * ΔH_atomization(C) = 12 * 1000 kJ = 12000 kJ.\n        *   Energy for Hydrogen: We start with H2(g). We need 11 moles of H2 to get 22 moles of H. The energy is to break the H-H bond.\n        *   Energy for Hydrogen: 11 mol * BE(H-H) = 11 * 100 kJ = 1100 kJ.\n        *   **Total enthalpy of atomization for elements = 12000 + 1100 = 13100 kJ.**\n\n    *   **Part 3: Calculate the enthalpy of atomization of the compound (Sum of all bond energies).**\n        *   Energy from C-C bonds = 9 * BE(C-C) = 9 * 200 kJ = 1800 kJ.\n        *   Energy from C=C bonds = 2 * BE(C=C) = 2 * 300 kJ = 600 kJ.\n        *   Energy from C-H bonds = 22 * BE(C-H) = 22 * 400 kJ = 8800 kJ.\n        *   **Total bond energy = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = 11200 kJ/mol.** (Note: This matches option C, which is a potential trap.

    "This problem requires calculating the enthalpy of formation for the molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. We can solve this using the principles of thermochemistry, specifically Hess's Law, combined with bond energy data.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula and Bond Counts**\n\nFirst, let's analyze the structure of the molecule to find the total number of each type of atom and bond.\n\n*   **Molecule:** (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\n*   **Counting Carbon (C) atoms:** 2 (from the first (CH3)2) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 (from the CH(CH3) group) + 1 + 1 + 2 (from the second (CH3)2) = **12 C atoms**.\n*   **Counting Hydrogen (H) atoms:** 2\\*3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 2\\*3 = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = **22 H atoms**.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C12H22\n\nNow, we count the number of each type of covalent bond:\n\n*   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n*   **C=C bonds:** There are two double bonds explicitly shown in the structure (C=C). So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds:** For a non-cyclic (acyclic) molecule with 'n' carbon atoms, there are a total of (n-1) carbon-carbon bonds. Here, n=12, so there are 12-1 = 11 C-C bonds in total. Since 2 of these are double bonds, the number of single C-C bonds is 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n### **Step 2: Apply Hess's Law**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) is the enthalpy change for the reaction:\n12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nWe can calculate this using the following formula derived from Hess's law:\nΔH_f = [Sum of enthalpies of atomization of reactants] - [Sum of bond energies of the product]\n\n**Part A: Calculate the enthalpy of atomization of the reactants.**\nThis is the energy required to break the elements in their standard states into individual gaseous atoms.\n*   **For Carbon:** 12 C(s) → 12 C(g)\n    Energy = 12 mol × ΔH_atomization(C) = 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   **For Hydrogen:** 11 H2(g) → 22 H(g)\n    This involves breaking 11 moles of H-H bonds.\n    Energy = 11 mol × BE(H-H) = 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n*   **Total enthalpy of atomization of reactants:** 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**\n\n**Part B: Calculate the sum of bond energies of the product (enthalpy of atomization of C12H22).**\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the C12H22 molecule.\n*   **Energy from C-C bonds:** 9 × BE(C-C) = 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   **Energy from C=C bonds:** 2 × BE(C=C) = 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n*   **Energy from C-H bonds:** 22 × BE(C-H) = 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   **Total bond energy of the product:** 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**Part C: Calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) in kJ/mol.**\n*   ΔH_f = (Total enthalpy of atomization of reactants) - (Total bond energy of product)\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n### **Step 3: Convert to kJ/g and Choose the Correct Option**\n\nThe question provides options in different units. We must convert our result to kJ/g to compare with option A.\n\n*   **Calculate the Molar Mass of C12H22:**\n    Molar Mass = (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**\n*   **Convert ΔH_f to kJ/g:**\n    ΔH_f (kJ/g) = (ΔH_f in kJ/mol) / (Molar Mass in g/mol)\n    ΔH_f (kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol ≈ **11.4457 kJ/g**\n\nThis value is approximately 11.44 kJ/g, which matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
