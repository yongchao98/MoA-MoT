    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Analysis:** This set of reagents corresponds to the Hell-Vollhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. This reaction selectively brominates the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group) of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Product 1:** Acetic acid has one α-carbon (the methyl group). Bromination at this position gives 2-bromoacetic acid.\n    *   Structure of Product 1: **BrCH2COOH**\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by the ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3) from ethanol.\n    *   Structure of Product 2: **BrCH2COOCH2CH3** (Ethyl 2-bromoacetate)\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (BrCH2COOCH2CH3) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction (SN2 type). The cyanide ion (CN⁻), a good nucleophile, displaces the bromide ion (Br⁻) from the α-carbon.\n*   **Product 3:** The bromine atom is replaced by a cyano group.\n    *   Structure of Product 3: **NCCH2COOCH2CH3** (Ethyl 2-cyanoacetate, or ethyl cyanoacetate)\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (NCCH2COOCH2CH3) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base. It removes one of the acidic α-protons from the CH2 group of ethyl cyanoacetate. These protons are acidic because the resulting carbanion is stabilized by resonance with both the adjacent cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOCH2CH3) groups.\n        `NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + H₂`\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion (enolate) is a strong nucleophile. It can react with the electrophile 1,5-dibromopentane. There are two competing pathways: an intramolecular cyclization after two alkylation steps, or an intermolecular dimerization.\n        *   **Path A (Cyclization):** The enolate attacks one end of the dibromopentane. A second deprotonation occurs at the α-carbon, followed by an intramolecular attack on the other end of the pentyl chain to form a 6-membered ring. This is the Thorpe-Ziegler reaction. While plausible, a rigorous NMR analysis of this cyclic product (Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate) leads to 7 distinct signals, which is not an option. A simplified analysis gives 5 signals (Option D).\n        *   **Path B (Dimerization):** Two molecules of the enolate react with one molecule of 1,5-dibromopentane, one at each end. This is favored by a high concentration of the enolate. The problem's wording (\"treated with\") does not specify high dilution, making this a very plausible outcome.\n            `2 Na⁺[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br(CH2)₅Br → EtOOC-CH(CN)-(CH2)₅-CH(CN)-COOEt + 2 NaBr`\n*   **Product 4:** Let's assume the dimer is the intended product, as its NMR analysis leads directly to one of the given options.\n    *   Structure of Product 4: **EtOOC-CH(CN)-(CH2)₅-CH(CN)-COOEt** (Diethyl 2,8-dicyanononanedioate)\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nThe product, Diethyl 2,8-dicyanononanedioate, is formed as a mixture of stereoisomers: a pair of enantiomers (dl-pair) and a meso compound. We need to determine the number of signals for a single one of these diastereomers (as enantiomers have identical NMR spectra, and diastereomers have different spectra). Let's analyze the symmetry of both the meso form and an enantiomer from the dl-pair.\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    `EtOOC-CH(a)-(CH₂)b-(CH₂)c-(CH₂)d-(CH₂)c-(CH₂)b-CH(a)-COOEt`\n*   **Symmetry of the meso form:** This (R,S) isomer possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the central methylene group (d).\n*   **Symmetry of the dl-pair:** These (R,R) and (S,S) isomers each possess a C₂ axis of rotation that passes through the central methylene group (d).\n*   **Signal Counting:** For both types of symmetry (plane or C₂ axis), the two halves of the molecule are chemically equivalent.\n\nLet's count the number of chemically distinct protons:\n1.  **Ethyl group protons:** The two ethyl groups (-OCH₂CH₃) are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry.\n    *   The two -OCH₂- groups give one signal.\n    *   The two -CH₃ groups give one signal.\n    *   Total from ethyl groups: **2 signals**.\n2.  **Methine protons (-CH(a)):** The two methine protons are equivalent by symmetry.\n    *   Total from methine protons: **1 signal**.\n3.  **Methylene protons (-CH₂-):** There are five CH₂ groups in the pentyl chain bridge.\n    *   **-CH₂(b)- groups:** The two (b) groups are equivalent by symmetry. The two protons within each (b) group are diastereotopic (because they are in a chiral molecule, adjacent to other prochiral centers). Thus, they are chemically distinct. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **-CH₂(c)- groups:** The two (c) groups are equivalent by symmetry. The two protons within each (c) group are also diastereotopic. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **-CH₂(d)- group:** This is the central, unique methylene group. The two protons on this carbon are rendered equivalent by the symmetry element (the plane of symmetry reflects one onto the other, and the C₂ axis rotates one onto the other). This gives **1 signal**.\n\n**Total Signal Count:**\nAdding them up: 2 (ethyl) + 1 (methine) + 2 (CH₂b) + 2 (CH₂c) + 1 (CH₂d) = **8 signals**.\n\nBoth the meso and the dl-pair isomers of the dimer product give 8 distinct signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<C>>>"
