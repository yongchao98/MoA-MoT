    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n*   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the molecule with the most abundant isotopes.\n*   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (the M+2 peak). The intensity ratio of the M+2 peak to the M+ peak is 32/100, which is approximately 1/3.\n*   This characteristic M+ and M+2 peak pattern with a ~3:1 ratio is a strong indicator for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of its isotopes, ~75% ³⁵Cl and ~25% ³⁷Cl).\n*   Therefore, the molecular weight of the compound containing the ³⁵Cl isotope is 156 g/mol.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   A very broad absorption peak is observed from 3500 cm⁻¹ down to 2700 cm⁻¹. This is a classic hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules (dimerization).\n*   A strong, sharp absorption peak is seen at 1720 cm⁻¹. This frequency is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration, specifically within the typical range for a carboxylic acid (1725-1700 cm⁻¹).\n*   Together, these two peaks strongly suggest the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). The integration (1H) confirms one such proton. It is a singlet because it does not typically couple with other protons.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The signals between 7 and 8.5 ppm indicate the presence of protons on a benzene ring.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H):** This signal represents two chemically equivalent protons on the benzene ring. The fact that it is a doublet means it is split by a single neighboring proton.\n    *   **7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** This signal represents another pair of two chemically equivalent protons. It is also a doublet, indicating it is split by a single neighboring proton.\n*   This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. In a para-substituted ring, there are two distinct sets of equivalent protons, and each set is adjacent to the other, causing them to split each other into doublets.\n\n**Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating the Options:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid containing a chlorine atom attached to a para-substituted benzene ring.\n\nLet's check the given options:\n\n*   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. Its ¹H NMR spectrum would show an aldehyde proton (~9-10 ppm) and a complex pattern for three aromatic protons, not the para-substitution pattern observed. This is incorrect.\n*   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a carboxylic acid with a chlorine atom, which matches the MS and IR. However, it is *ortho*-substituted. The four aromatic protons would not be equivalent in pairs and would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the ¹H NMR, not two simple doublets. This is incorrect.\n*   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   **MS:** Its formula is C₇H₅ClO₂. The molecular weight with ³⁵Cl is (7×12) + (5×1) + 35 + (2×16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol. This matches perfectly. The presence of one chlorine atom explains the M+2 peak.\n    *   **IR:** It is a carboxylic acid, matching the broad O-H and sharp C=O peaks.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** It is a *para*-substituted benzene ring, which gives the exact pattern of two doublets, each for 2H. The carboxylic acid proton matches the signal at 11.0 ppm. This structure is a perfect fit for all the provided data.\n*   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an acid chloroformate, not a carboxylic acid. It lacks the acidic O-H group, so it would not show the broad IR peak or the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm. This is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll pieces of spectral evidence point unequivocally to 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the identity of the unknown white solid.\n\n<<<C>>>"
