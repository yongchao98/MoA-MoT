    "The user wants to find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 in a system of five exoplanets.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of Equilibrium Temperature**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet depends on the energy it receives from its host star and its own properties. The formula is given by:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\cdot (1 - A)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}}$\nwhere:\n*   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n*   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n*   $A$ is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nIn this specific problem, all planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constant. The problem also states that all planets have the same albedo, $A$. Therefore, all terms except the semi-major axis ($a$) are constant for the planets being compared.\n\nThis simplifies the relationship to:\n$T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$ or $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\n\nThis means the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis.\n\n**2. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Orbital Period using Kepler's Third Law**\n\nKepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period ($P$) is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis ($a$):\n$P^2 \\propto a^3$\n\nTo express the semi-major axis ($a$) in terms of the orbital period ($P$), we can rearrange this relationship:\n$a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n\n**3. Combine the Relationships to find Temperature-Period Relation**\n\nNow, we substitute the relationship for $a$ from Kepler's Law into our simplified equilibrium temperature formula:\n$T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\n$T_{eq} \\propto (P^{2/3})^{-1/2}$\n\nUsing the rules of exponents, we multiply the powers:\n$T_{eq} \\propto P^{(2/3) \\times (-1/2)}$\n$T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\nThis shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n**4. Calculate the Ratio**\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 ($T_{eq,4}$) to that of Planet_2 ($T_{eq,2}$):\n$\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{k \\cdot P_4^{-1/3}}{k \\cdot P_2^{-1/3}}$ (where $k$ is a constant of proportionality)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{P_4}{P_2}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n**5.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Governing Principles:**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy absorbed from its host star and the energy it radiates away. For a planet in a circular orbit, this is given by the formula:\n\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\cdot (1 - A)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $T_{star}$ is the temperature of the star.\n*   $R_{star}$ is the radius of the star.\n*   $A$ is the planet's Bond albedo (its reflectivity).\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (the distance from the star).\n\nThe problem states that all five planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constant for all of them. It also specifies that they possess the same albedo, $A$. This means all terms in the equation are constant except for the semi-major axis, $a$. Therefore, the equilibrium temperature is solely dependent on the distance from the star:\n\n$T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$  or  $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\n\n**2. Relate Orbital Distance to Orbital Period:**\n\nKepler's Third Law of planetary motion provides the relationship between a planet's orbital period ($P$) and its semi-major axis ($a$). For planets orbiting the same star, the law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis:\n\n$P^2 \\propto a^3$\n\nTo use this in our temperature equation, we need to express the semi-major axis ($a$) in terms of the period ($P$):\n\n$a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n\n**3. Combine the Relationships:**\n\nNow, we can substitute the relationship for $a$ into our simplified temperature formula:\n\n$T_{eq} \\propto (P^{2/3})^{-1/2}$\n\nUsing the rules of exponents (multiplying the powers), we get:\n\n$T_{eq} \\propto P^{(2/3) \\times (-1/2)} = P^{-1/3}$\n\nThis gives us a direct relationship between the equilibrium temperature and the orbital period: the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n**4. Calculate the Temperature Ratio:**\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 to that of Planet_2 ($T_{eq,4} / T_{eq,2}$). Using the relationship derived above:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{P_4^{-1/3}}{P_2^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_4}{P_2}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n**5. Substitute the Given Values:**\n\nThe problem provides the ratio of orbital periods as $P_1:P_2:P_3:P_4:P_5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5$. We can use the relative values for the periods of Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n*   $P_2 = 2$\n*   $P_4 = 3.5$\n\nNow, we plug these into our ratio formula:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3.5}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n**6. Compute the Final Result:**\n\nPerforming the calculation:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Relative orbital periods for Planet 2 and Planet 4\nP2 = 2.0\nP4 = 3.5\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is the cube root of the ratio of the periods (P2/P4).\ntemperature_ratio = (P2 / P4)**(1/3)\n\nprint(f'{temperature_ratio=}')\n```\n<execute_return>\ntemperature_ratio=0.8298265333662435\n</execute_return>\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.8298.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the balance of incoming stellar radiation and the planet's own thermal emission. The formula is:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\cdot (1 - A)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}}$\n\nIn this system:\n*   $T_{star}$ (star's temperature) and $R_{star}$ (star's radius) are the same for all planets.\n*   The problem states that the albedo ($A$) is the same for all planets.\n*   Therefore, all terms are constant except for the semi-major axis ($a$), which is the planet's distance from the star.\n\nThis simplifies the relationship to:\n$T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\n**2. Relate Orbital Distance to Orbital Period using Kepler's Third Law**\n\nKepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis ($a$):\n$P^2 \\propto a^3$\n\nRearranging to solve for $a$, we get:\n$a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n\n**3. Combine the Two Relationships**\n\nNow we substitute the expression for $a$ into the simplified temperature relationship:\n$T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{P^{2/3}}}$\n$T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{(P^{2/3})^{1/2}}$\n$T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}}$ or $T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\nThis means the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n**4. Calculate the Specific Ratio**\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the temperature of Planet_4 to Planet_2:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{k \\cdot P_4^{-1/3}}{k \\cdot P_2^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_4}{P_2}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n**5. Substitute the Given Period Ratios**\n\nThe problem gives the orbital period ratios as $1:2:2.5:3.5:5$.\n*   Relative period of Planet 2, $P_2 = 2$\n*   Relative period of Planet 4, $P_4 = 3.5$\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3.5}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n**6. Compute the Result**\n\nThe calculation `(2 / 3.5)**(1/3)` gives approximately `0.8298`. This value is closest to `0.83`.\n\nComparing with the options:\nA) ~0.57\nB) ~0.75\nC) ~0.69\nD) ~0.83\n\nThe correct answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
