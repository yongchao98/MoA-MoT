    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\nThis is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. In this reaction, one of the alpha-hydrogens of cyclohexanone is replaced by a bromine atom. The two alpha-positions (C2 and C6) are equivalent.\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone\n*   **Reagent:** Bromine (Br₂)\n*   **Reaction:** Alpha-bromination\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-Bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\nThis is a reaction of an α-haloketone with a strong base. While an elimination reaction to form an α,β-unsaturated ketone is possible, a more common and important reaction under these conditions is the **Favorskii rearrangement**. This rearrangement leads to a ring contraction. The mechanism is as follows:\n1.  NaOH, a strong base, removes a proton from the α' carbon (C6), forming an enolate.\n2.  The enolate undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the carbon with the bromine (C2) and displacing the bromide ion. This forms a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-7-one).\n3.  The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) attacks the carbonyl carbon of the strained cyclopropanone ring.\n4.  The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, and the cyclopropane ring opens. The cleavage occurs to form the more stable carbanion, which in this symmetrical case, leads to the formation of a five-membered ring.\n5.  Protonation (during acidic workup, which is implied) of the resulting carboxylate anion yields a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Reactant:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), heat\n*   **Reaction:** Favorskii Rearrangement\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\n*Self-Correction Note:* If we assumed a simple elimination reaction, the product would be cyclohex-2-en-1-one. Subsequent reactions would lead to cyclohexa-1,3-diene, which has 4 distinct types of hydrogens. Since 4 is not an option, the Favorskii rearrangement pathway is the intended one.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\nThis is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride (or acid chloride). Thionyl chloride replaces the -OH group of the carboxylic acid with a -Cl group. Pyridine is used as a base to neutralize the HCl gas produced as a byproduct.\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n*   **Reagent:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine\n*   **Reaction:** Conversion of carboxylic acid to acyl chloride\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃)**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acyl chlorides to aldehydes without continuing the reduction to the primary alcohol.\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of acyl chloride to aldehyde\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\nNow we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms (which corresponds to the number of signals in a ¹H NMR spectrum) in the final product, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\nThe structure is a cyclopentane ring bonded to a -CHO (aldehyde) group.\nLet's analyze the symmetry and the chemical environments of the hydrogens:\n1.  **The Aldehyde Proton:** The single hydrogen atom of the aldehyde group (-CHO) is in a unique chemical environment. This is **1** distinct type of hydrogen.\n2.  **The C1 Proton:** The hydrogen atom on the carbon of the ring that is attached to the aldehyde group (C1) is also in a unique environment. This is a **second** distinct type of hydrogen.\n3.  **The Ring Protons:** The cyclopentane ring has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C1-H bond and the C-CHO bond, and bisects the C3-C4 bond of the ring.\n    *   This symmetry makes the two protons on C2 equivalent to the two protons on C5.\n    *   This symmetry also makes the two protons on C3 equivalent to the two protons on C4.\n4.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** C1 is a chiral center (or more accurately, a prochiral center in the context of the ring). Because C2 is adjacent to this center, its two hydrogens are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent. Let's call them H₂ₐ and H₂ₑ. The same applies to the two hydrogens on C5. Due to the plane of symmetry, the H₂ₐ proton is equivalent to the H₅ₐ proton, and the H₂ₑ proton is equivalent to the H₅ₑ proton. Therefore, the four protons on C2 and C5 give rise to **two** distinct signals.\n5.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** The two hydrogens on C3 are also diastereotopic because of the chirality at C1. The same applies to C4. Due to the plane of symmetry, the two hydrogens on C3 are equivalent to the two hydrogens on C4 as a set. This means the four protons on C3 and C4 also give rise to **two** distinct signals.\n\n**Total Count:**\n*   Aldehyde H: 1 type\n*   C1-H: 1 type\n*   C2/C5 protons: 2 types\n*   C3/C4 protons: 2 types\n*   Total distinct hydrogen atoms = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6**\n\nThus, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
