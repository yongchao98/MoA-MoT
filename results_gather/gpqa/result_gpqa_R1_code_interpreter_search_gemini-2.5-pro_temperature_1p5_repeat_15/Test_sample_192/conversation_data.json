    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   The core information given is the relationship between the number of stars and parallax. Let's denote the number of stars as `N` and parallax as `plx`.\n    *   The problem states that \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\". This phrasing usually refers to the number of stars found within a specific interval of parallax, `d(plx)`. So, we can write this as a differential relationship: `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`.\n    *   The question asks for how the number of stars changes with distance, `r`, per unit range of distance. This is asking for the form of `dN/dr`.\n    *   So, the goal is to convert the given relationship `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵` into a new relationship for `dN/dr` as a function of `r`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Key Physical Relationship:**\n    *   The fundamental connection between parallax (`plx`) and distance (`r`) is that they are inversely proportional.\n    *   The formula is `plx = 1/r`.\n\n3.  **Apply Calculus (Chain Rule):**\n    *   We want to find `dN/dr`, and we know `dN/d(plx)`. We can relate these two derivatives using the chain rule:\n        `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n4.  **Execute the Steps:**\n    *   **Step a:** Find the derivative `d(plx)/dr`.\n        *   Since `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`, we can differentiate with respect to `r`.\n        *   `d(plx)/dr = d/dr(r⁻¹) = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`.\n        *   When considering how the number of stars *changes* or its *distribution*, we are usually interested in the magnitude of the relationship, not the sign. The negative sign simply indicates that as distance `r` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. So, we'll use the magnitude: `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`.\n\n    *   **Step b:** Substitute the known parts back into the chain rule equation.\n        *   We have `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`.\n        *   We have `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`.\n        *   Substituting these into `dN/dr ∝ (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|` gives:\n            `dN/dr ∝ (plx⁻⁵) * (1/r²)`.\n\n    *   **Step c:** Express the entire right-hand side in terms of `r`.\n        *   We know `plx = 1/r`. Let's substitute this into the expression.\n        *   `dN/dr ∝ ((1/r)⁻⁵) * (1/r²)`.\n        *   `(1/r)⁻⁵ = (r⁻¹)⁻⁵ = r⁵`.\n        *   So, `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²)`.\n\n    *   **Step d:** Simplify the final expression.\n        *   `dN/dr ∝ r⁵ * r⁻²`\n        *   `dN/dr ∝ r⁽⁵⁻²⁾`\n        *   `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The number of stars per unit range of distance (`dN/dr`) varies as the cube of the distance (`r³`).\n    *   This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
