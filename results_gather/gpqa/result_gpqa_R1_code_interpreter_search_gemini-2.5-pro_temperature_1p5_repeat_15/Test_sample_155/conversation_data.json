    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene and is symmetrical about the double bond.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reagent catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The water molecule acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the epoxide carbons in an Sₙ2-like fashion. This attack occurs from the side opposite the C-O bond, resulting in an *anti*-dihydroxylation overall.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The overall reaction is an *anti*-dihydroxylation of an alkene. There's a useful mnemonic for predicting the stereochemistry of such reactions: **\"Trans-Anti-Meso\"**.\n    *   Starting with a **trans**-alkene ((E)-oct-4-ene).\n    *   Performing an **anti**-addition (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed opening).\n    *   On a symmetrical alkene, this yields a **meso** compound.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The product is a single meso compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. A meso compound is achiral but contains stereocenters.\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene and is also symmetrical.\n*   **Reagents:** The same as in Reaction 1 (mCPBA, then H₃O⁺), leading to an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** We can use another mnemonic: **\"Cis-Anti-Racemic\"**.\n    *   Starting with a **cis**-alkene ((Z)-oct-4-ene).\n    *   Performing an **anti**-addition.\n    *   This yields a **racemic** mixture of enantiomers.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The product is a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**3. Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the meso compound from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (one enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the other enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's analyze the relationships between these isomers:\n*   (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   The meso compound (4R,5S) is a **diastereomer** of both (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n**4. Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on properties like polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers because enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n    *   However, it *can* separate diastereomers, as they have different physical properties.\n    *   Therefore, the two enantiomers ((4R,5R) and (4S,5S)-diol) will co-elute and appear as a single peak.\n    *   The meso diol, being a diastereomer of the other two, will elute at a different time and produce a separate peak.\n    *   **Result:** **2 peaks** will be observed on the standard HPLC.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment. This allows the column to interact differently with each enantiomer of a racemic pair.\n    *   It will separate the two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, into two distinct peaks.\n    *   The meso compound is also a unique chemical entity (a diastereomer to the others) and will produce its own, third peak.\n    *   **Result:** **3 peaks** will be observed on the chiral HPLC.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 2 peaks on the standard HPLC and 3 peaks on the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
