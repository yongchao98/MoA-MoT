    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, consistent with a carboxylic acid (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four given options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the class of compound but doesn't differentiate between the choices.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Data\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in the complex splitting patterns described.\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This confirms the absence of C=C double bonds with attached protons. All four structures are saturated, so this is consistent with all options.\n*   **Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).** This means a single proton is being split by three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   A set of one proton (n=1), leading to a doublet (1+1=2).\n    *   A set of two protons (n=2), leading to a triplet (2+1=3).\n    *   A set of three protons (n=3), leading to a quartet (3+1=4).\n    *   The total number of neighboring protons for this signal is 1 + 2 + 3 = **6**.\n*   **Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).** This means a different single proton is being split by three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   A set of one proton (n=1), leading to a doublet (1+1=2).\n    *   A set of two protons (n=2), leading to a triplet (2+1=3).\n    *   Another set of two protons (n=2), leading to a triplet (2+1=3).\n    *   The total number of neighboring protons for this signal is 1 + 2 + 2 = **5**.\n\nOur task is to find the structure that has two specific methine (C-H) protons with exactly these environments.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Candidate Structure\n\nWe will now analyze the protons on the chiral centers (methine protons) for each option. We will assume the n+1 rule applies and that the COOH proton does not couple.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n`CH₃(a)-CH₂(b)-CH(c)(CH₃(e))-CH(d)(CH₃(f))-COOH`\n*   **H(c):** This proton is coupled to the `CH₂(b)` group (2 protons, gives a triplet), the `H(d)` proton (1 proton, gives a doublet), and the `CH₃(e)` group (3 protons, gives a quartet). Total neighbors = 2+1+3 = 6. The pattern is a **tdq** (or **dtq**). This matches one of the required signals.\n*   **H(d):** This proton is coupled to the `H(c)` proton (1 proton, gives a doublet) and the `CH₃(f)` group (3 protons, gives a quartet). Total neighbors = 1+3 = 4. The pattern is a **dq**. This does not match the `dtt` signal.\n*   **Conclusion:** Structure A is incorrect.\n\n**D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n`CH₃(a)-CH(b)(CH₃(e))-CH(c)(CH₃(f))-CH₂(d)-COOH`\n*   **H(b):** Coupled to `CH₃(a)` (3H, quartet), `H(c)` (1H, doublet), and `CH₃(e)` (3H, quartet). Total neighbors = 3+1+3 = 7. The pattern is a **qdq**. This matches neither required signal.\n*   **H(c):** Coupled to `H(b)` (1H, doublet), `CH₂(d)` (2H, triplet), and `CH₃(f)` (3H, quartet). Total neighbors = 1+2+3 = 6. The pattern is a **dtq**. This matches one signal, but the other signal (`qdq`) is wrong.\n*   **Conclusion:** Structure D is incorrect.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\nLet Et = CH₂CH₃.\n`CH₃(a)-CH₂(b)-CH(c)(Et)-CH(d)(Et)-COOH`\n*   **H(c):** Coupled to `CH₂(b)` (2H, triplet), `H(d)` (1H, doublet), and the `CH₂` of its ethyl group (2H, triplet). Total neighbors = 2+1+2 = 5. The pattern is a **tdt** (or **dtt**). This matches one of the required signals.\n*   **H(d):** Coupled to `H(c)` (1H, doublet) and the `CH₂` of its ethyl group (2H, triplet). Total neighbors = 1+2 = 3. The pattern is a **dt**. This does not match the `dtq` signal.\n*   **Conclusion:** Structure C is incorrect.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\nThis formula is best interpreted as the structure for 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid.\nLet Et = CH₂CH₃.\n`CH₃(a)-CH(b)(Et)-CH(c)(Et)-CH₂(d)-COOH`\nLet's analyze the methine protons, H(b) and H(c).\n*   **H(b) (on C4):** This proton is coupled to the `CH₃(a)` group (3 protons, gives a quartet), the `H(c)` proton (1 proton, gives a doublet), and the `CH₂` of its own ethyl group (2 protons, gives a triplet). Total neighbors = 3+1+2 = 6. The pattern is a **qdt** (which is the same as a **dtq**). **This is a match.**\n*   **H(c) (on C3):** This proton is coupled to the `H(b)` proton (1 proton, gives a doublet), the `CH₂(d)` group (2 protons, gives a triplet), and the `CH₂` of its own ethyl group (2 protons, gives a triplet). Total neighbors = 1+2+2 = 5. The pattern is a **dtt**. **This is also a match.**\n\n**Conclusion:** Structure B is the only one that has a proton environment corresponding to a `dtq` signal and another proton environment corresponding to a `dtt` signal.\n\nFinal check:\n*   Compound B is 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid.\n*   Its FTIR spectrum would show broad O-H and strong C=O absorptions, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n*   Its ¹H NMR spectrum would not show vinyl protons.\n*   Its ¹H NMR spectrum would contain a proton (H at C4) with a `dtq` splitting pattern.\n*   Its ¹H NMR spectrum would contain a proton (H at C3) with a `dtt` splitting pattern.\nAll pieces of experimental data point to this structure.\n\n<<<B>>>"
