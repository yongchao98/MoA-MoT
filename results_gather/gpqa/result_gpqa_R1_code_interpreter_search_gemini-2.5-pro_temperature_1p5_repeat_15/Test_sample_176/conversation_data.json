    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe primary objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to the luminosity of Star_2, which is `L_1 / L_2`.\n\n**2. Recall the Luminosity Formula**\nThe luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n`L = 4 * π * R^2 * σ * T^4`\nwhere:\n*   `R` is the star's radius.\n*   `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   `T` is the star's effective surface temperature.\n\n**3. Set up the Luminosity Ratio**\nWe can write the formula for each star and then divide them:\n`L_1 = 4 * π * R_1^2 * σ * T_1^4`\n`L_2 = 4 * π * R_2^2 * σ * T_2^4`\n\nThe ratio is:\n`L_1 / L_2 = (4 * π * R_1^2 * σ * T_1^4) / (4 * π * R_2^2 * σ * T_2^4)`\n\nThe constants `4`, `π`, and `σ` cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n`L_1 / L_2 = (R_1 / R_2)^2 * (T_1 / T_2)^4`\n\n**4. Use the Given Information about Radius**\nThe problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star_2 (`R_1 = 1.5 * R_2`). Therefore, the ratio `R_1 / R_2 = 1.5`.\nSubstituting this into our ratio equation:\n`L_1 / L_2 = (1.5)^2 * (T_1 / T_2)^4`\n`L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 * (T_1 / T_2)^4`\n\nNow, we need to determine the ratio of the temperatures (`T_1 / T_2`).\n\n**5. Relate Temperature to Observed Wavelength**\nThe temperature of a star is related to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation (`λ_max,emitted`) by Wien's Displacement Law:\n`λ_max,emitted = b / T`\nwhere `b` is Wien's displacement constant.\n\nHowever, astronomers observe the wavelength (`λ_max,observed`) after it has been affected by the Doppler effect due to the star's motion relative to the observer (radial velocity). The relationship is:\n`λ_max,observed = λ_max,emitted * (1 + v_r / c)`\nwhere `v_r` is the radial velocity and `c` is the speed of light. A positive `v_r` indicates the star is moving away (redshift).\n\n**6. Apply the Doppler Effect and Wien's Law to Both Stars**\nThe problem states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same for both stars: `λ_max,obs,1 = λ_max,obs,2`.\n\n*   **For Star_1:**\n    *   Radial velocity `v_r1 = 0 km/s`.\n    *   With no velocity, there is no Doppler shift.\n    *   `λ_max,obs,1 = λ_max,em,1 = b / T_1`\n\n*   **For Star_2:**\n    *   Radial velocity `v_r2 = 700 km/s`.\n    *   The light is redshifted.\n    *   `λ_max,obs,2 = λ_max,em,2 * (1 + v_r2 / c) = (b / T_2) * (1 + v_r2 / c)`\n\n**7. Solve for the Temperature Ratio**\nSince `λ_max,obs,1 = λ_max,obs,2`, we can set the two expressions equal:\n`b / T_1 = (b / T_2) * (1 + v_r2 / c)`\n\nCancel the constant `b` from both sides:\n`1 / T_1 = (1 / T_2) * (1 + v_r2 / c)`\n\nRearrange to find the temperature ratio `T_1 / T_2`:\n`T_2 / T_1 = 1 + v_r2 / c`\n`T_1 / T_2 = 1 / (1 + v_r2 / c)`\n\n**8. Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio**\nSubstitute the expression for the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n`L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 * (T_1 / T_2)^4`\n`L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 * (1 / (1 + v_r2 / c))^4`\n`L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 / (1 + v_r2 / c)^4`\n\nNow, we plug in the numerical values and compute the result.\n\n```python\n# Constants and given values\nc = 299792.458  # Speed of light in km/s\nv2 = 700.0       # Radial velocity of Star_2 in km/s\nradius_ratio = 1.5\n\n# Calculate the luminosity ratio L1/L2\n# Formula: L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\n# T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + v2/c)\n# L1/L2 = (radius_ratio**2) / (1 + v2/c)**4\n\nluminosity_ratio = (radius_ratio**2) / ((1 + v2 / c)**4)\n\nprint(luminosity_ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n2.229047391942475\n</execute_code>\nThe calculation shows that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.229. This matches option B. The information about the stars' masses is not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The user wants me to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to Star_2.\n\n**1. Identify the Relevant Physical Laws**\n\n*   **Luminosity of a black body:** The luminosity (L) of a star radiating as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: `L = 4 * π * R^2 * σ * T^4`, where R is the radius, T is the surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   **Peak Wavelength and Temperature:** The relationship between the peak emission wavelength (λ_emitted) and temperature (T) is given by Wien's Displacement Law: `λ_emitted = b / T`, where b is Wien's constant.\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength (λ_observed) of a moving source is shifted relative to the emitted wavelength (λ_emitted). For non-relativistic speeds, the formula is `λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r / c)`, where `v_r` is the radial velocity (positive for moving away) and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n**2. Formulate the Ratio of Luminosities**\n\nWe need to compute `L_1 / L_2`.\nUsing the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n`L_1 = 4 * π * R_1^2 * σ * T_1^4`\n`L_2 = 4 * π * R_2^2 * σ * T_2^4`\n\nThe ratio is:\n`L_1 / L_2 = (4 * π * R_1^2 * σ * T_1^4) / (4 * π * R_2^2 * σ * T_2^4)`\nThe constants `4πσ` cancel out, leaving:\n`L_1 / L_2 = (R_1 / R_2)^2 * (T_1 / T_2)^4`\n\n**3. Use the Given Information**\n\n*   **Radius Ratio:** The problem states `R_1 = 1.5 * R_2`, so `R_1 / R_2 = 1.5`.\n    Substituting this in, we get:\n    `L_1 / L_2 = (1.5)^2 * (T_1 / T_2)^4 = 2.25 * (T_1 / T_2)^4`\n    (Note: The information about the mass is extraneous and not needed for this calculation).\n\n*   **Wavelength and Velocity:** The problem states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same: `λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2`. We need to relate this to the temperatures `T_1` and `T_2`.\n\n**4. Find the Temperature Ratio (T_1 / T_2)**\n\n*   **For Star_1:**\n    *   Radial velocity `v_1 = 0`.\n    *   There is no Doppler shift, so `λ_obs,1 = λ_em,1`.\n    *   Using Wien's Law: `λ_obs,1 = b / T_1`.\n\n*   **For Star_2:**\n    *   Radial velocity `v_2 = 700 km/s`.\n    *   The observed wavelength is Doppler-shifted: `λ_obs,2 = λ_em,2 * (1 + v_2 / c)`.\n    *   Using Wien's Law: `λ_em,2 = b / T_2`.\n    *   Substituting this into the Doppler formula: `λ_obs,2 = (b / T_2) * (1 + v_2 / c)`.\n\n*   **Equating the Observed Wavelengths:**\n    Since `λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2`:\n    `b / T_1 = (b / T_2) * (1 + v_2 / c)`\n    Cancel `b` from both sides:\n    `1 / T_1 = (1 / T_2) * (1 + v_2 / c)`\n    Rearrange to find the temperature ratio `T_1 / T_2`:\n    `T_2 / T_1 = 1 + v_2 / c`\n    `T_1 / T_2 = 1 / (1 + v_2 / c)`\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio**\n\nNow substitute the expression for the temperature ratio back into our luminosity ratio equation:\n`L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 * (T_1 / T_2)^4`\n`L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 * (1 / (1 + v_2 / c))^4`\n`L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 / (1 + v_2 / c)^4`\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and compute the result.\n\n*   `v_2 = 700 km/s`\n*   `c ≈ 299792.458 km/s` (speed of light)\n*   `Radius Ratio Squared = 2.25`\n\n```python\n# Constants and given values\nv2 = 700.0  # km/s\nc = 299792.458  # km/s (speed of light)\nradius_ratio_squared = 2.25\n\n# Calculate the luminosity ratio\n# L1/L2 = 2.25 / (1 + v2/c)^4\nluminosity_ratio = radius_ratio_squared / ((1 + v2 / c)**4)\n\nprint(luminosity_ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n2.229047391942475\n</execute_code>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 2.229. Rounding this value to two decimal places gives 2.23.\n\nTherefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of ~2.23.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The calculation shows the luminosity ratio is approximately `2.2291`.\n\nLooking at the provided options:\nA) ~2.25\nB) ~2.23\nC) ~2.32\nD) ~2.35\n\nThe calculated value `2.2291` is closest to `2.23`.\n\nThe step-by-step reasoning is as follows:\n1.  The luminosity `L` is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: `L = 4πR²σT⁴`.\n2.  The ratio of luminosities is `L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴`.\n3.  Given `R₁ = 1.5 * R₂`, the radius term `(R₁/R₂)²` is `1.5² = 2.25`.\n4.  The observed peak wavelength `λ_obs` is related to the emitted wavelength `λ_em` by the Doppler effect: `λ_obs = λ_em * (1 + v/c)`.\n5.  The emitted wavelength is related to temperature by Wien's Law: `λ_em = b/T`.\n6.  For Star 1, `v₁=0`, so `λ_obs,₁ = λ_em,₁ = b/T₁`.\n7.  For Star 2, `v₂=700 km/s`, so `λ_obs,₂ = λ_em,₂ * (1 + v₂/c) = (b/T₂) * (1 + v₂/c)`.\n8.  The problem states `λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂`. Therefore, `b/T₁ = (b/T₂) * (1 + v₂/c)`.\n9.  This simplifies to the temperature ratio `T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)`.\n10. Substituting this back into the luminosity ratio gives: `L₁/L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v₂/c)⁴`.\n11. Plugging in the values `v₂ = 700 km/s` and `c ≈ 299792.458 km/s` yields the result `~2.2291`, which rounds to `2.23`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
