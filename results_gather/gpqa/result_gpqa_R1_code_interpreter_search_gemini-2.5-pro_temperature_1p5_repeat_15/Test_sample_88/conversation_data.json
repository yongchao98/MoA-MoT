    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C10H14Br2). Adamantane has a tricyclic cage structure.\n2.  **Reaction 1:** Heating with excess KOH at 240°C. This is a strong base under harsh conditions, suggesting elimination and/or rearrangement.\n3.  **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   IR spectrum: 1720 cm⁻¹. This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O), most likely a ketone.\n    *   ¹H NMR spectrum: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). The total integration is 14H, the same as the starting material.\n    *   Molecular Formula: The reaction replaces two bromine atoms with one oxygen atom to form a ketone, so the formula is C10H14O. Let's check the degrees of unsaturation (DoU): DoU = C + 1 - H/2 = 10 + 1 - 14/2 = 4. Adamantane's tricyclic system accounts for 3 DoU, and the ketone's C=O bond accounts for 1 DoU, summing to 4. This initially suggests a saturated tricyclic ketone.\n\n4.  **Critical Clue from Later Step:** The problem states that Product 2 (formed from Product 1) undergoes ozonolysis. Ozonolysis cleaves C=C double bonds. Since Product 2 is formed by a simple reduction of Product 1 (see Step 2), Product 1 must already contain a C=C double bond.\n5.  **Re-evaluation of Product 1:** Product 1 must be an unsaturated ketone (an enone). Its formula is C10H14O. DoU = 1 (C=O) + 1 (C=C) + 2 (rings) = 4. This is consistent with the formula, implying the structure is a bicyclic enone (not tricyclic like adamantane). The high IR frequency (1720 cm⁻¹) for the C=O group can be explained by ring strain, often seen in bicyclic ketones.\n6.  **Finding a Structure for Product 1:** We need a bicyclic C10H14O enone that matches the NMR data. The signal at 4.79 ppm (2H) is a key feature.\n    *   This chemical shift is typical for protons on an exocyclic double bond (C=CH₂), which are usually found around 4.6-4.8 ppm. The \"2H\" integration fits perfectly.\n    *   The simplified NMR spectrum (only 3 distinct signals) suggests a highly symmetrical molecule.\n    *   A structure that fits all these criteria is **3-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-7-one**.\n        *   **Formula:** C10H14O. (Correct)\n        *   **Functionality:** It has a ketone (C=O at position 7) and an alkene (exocyclic C=CH₂ at position 3). (Correct)\n        *   **Symmetry:** It possesses a plane of symmetry passing through the C=O group and the C=CH₂ group. This explains the simple NMR spectrum.\n        *   **NMR match:** The two protons of the C=CH₂ group would account for the signal at 4.79 ppm (2H). The remaining 12 protons on the bicyclic frame would account for the other signals.\n    *   Formation of this rearranged structure from 1,3-dibromoadamantane under forcing conditions is plausible, although it involves a complex fragmentation and recombination pathway.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n\n1.  **Reaction 2:** Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide (Al(O-iPr)₃).\n2.  **Reaction Type:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which selectively reduces ketones and aldehydes to alcohols. The C=C double bond is not affected.\n3.  **Product 2 Structure:** The ketone group (C=O) in Product 1 is reduced to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    *   Product 2 is **3-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-7-ol**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Reaction 3:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide (DMS).\n2.  **Reaction Type:** This is a reductive ozonolysis, which cleaves a C=C double bond and replaces it with two carbonyl groups.\n3.  **Transformation:** The exocyclic double bond (C=CH₂) of Product 2 is cleaved. The `C` of the ring becomes a ketone (C=O), and the `CH₂` group becomes formaldehyde (H₂C=O), which is typically washed away during workup.\n4.  **Product 3 Structure:** The original bicyclic framework remains, but the C=CH₂ at position 3 is converted to a C=O. The alcohol at position 7 is untouched.\n    *   Product 3 is **7-hydroxy-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of Product 3**\n\n1.  **Structure:** Product 3 is 7-hydroxy-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one. This molecule retains the plane of symmetry passing through the C3-ketone and the C7-alcohol.\n2.  **Most Deshielded Proton:** The question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding the exchangeable -OH proton). In this structure, the proton attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (H7 on C7) is the most deshielded due to the electronegativity of the oxygen atom. Its chemical shift would be in the range of 3.5-4.5 ppm. All other C-H protons are either alpha to a ketone (~2.5 ppm) or further away (<2.5 ppm).\n3.  **Coupling Pattern of H7:** To determine the splitting pattern (multiplicity) of H7, we need to count its neighboring protons.\n    *   H7 is on carbon C7. The adjacent carbons are C6 and C8.\n    *   Due to the molecule's plane of symmetry, the two protons on C6 are equivalent to the two protons on C8.\n    *   However, the two protons on C6 itself (H6-endo and H6-exo) are diastereotopic and thus not magnetically equivalent. They will have different coupling constants to H7. Let's call their coupling constants J_ax and J_eq.\n    *   By symmetry, H7 couples to two \"endo\" protons (H6-endo and H8-endo) with the same coupling constant, `J_endo`. This coupling will split the H7 signal into a **triplet**.\n    *   H7 also couples to two \"exo\" protons (H6-exo and H8-exo) with the same coupling constant, `J_exo`. This coupling will split each line of the first triplet into another **triplet**.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The resulting pattern for the H7 signal is a **triplet of triplets (tt)**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
