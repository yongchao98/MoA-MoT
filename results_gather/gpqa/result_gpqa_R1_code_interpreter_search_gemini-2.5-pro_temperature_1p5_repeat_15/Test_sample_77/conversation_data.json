    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical situation:** The problem describes a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$. We need to find the scalar potential `V` and vector potential $\\vec{A}$ at a field point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t`. A key element is that the fields observed at time `t` were generated by the charge at an earlier, \"retarded\" time, `tr`.\n\n2.  **Recall the concept of Retarded Potentials:** For time-varying charge and current distributions, the potentials at $(\\vec{r}, t)$ are not determined by the source configuration at time `t`, but at the retarded time $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$. This is because the information (the field) travels at the speed of light `c`. The general integral formulas for retarded potentials are:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\n3.  **Apply to a moving point charge:** For a single point charge `q` with trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$ and velocity $\\vec{v}(t) = d\\vec{s}/dt$, the charge and current densities are:\n    *   $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    *   $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\n4.  **Evaluate the integrals (Liénard-Wiechert Potentials):** Substituting these densities into the retarded potential integrals is a standard but non-trivial calculation in electrodynamics. The complication arises because the retarded time `tr` itself depends on the integration variable `r'`. The result of this integration gives the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n    Let's define the terms as given in the problem:\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: position of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$: velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$: the vector from the source's retarded position to the field point.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}|$: the distance from the source's retarded position to the field point.\n    *   The retarded time condition is $t_r = t - d/c$.\n\n    The evaluation of the integrals yields:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - (\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - (\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c}$\n\n5.  **Simplify and Compare with Options:** Let's manipulate these expressions to match the format of the given options. We can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\n    Now let's examine the options:\n    *   A) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$: Incorrect. These are non-retarded potentials.\n    *   B) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$: Incorrect.\n    *   C) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$: These expressions exactly match our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n    *   D) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$: Incorrect sign in the denominator. The minus sign is crucial and arises from the Doppler-like effect; the fields are compressed in the direction of motion, leading to a larger potential. A plus sign would imply the opposite.\n\n6.  **Verify the relationship between V and A:** As a sanity check, let's verify the relationship between our derived V and A.\n    $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - (\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c} = \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\vec{v} \\left( \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - (\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c} \\right)$\n    Since $\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 = 1/c^2$, we have:\n    $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$\n    Let's check if this holds for option C:\n    $\\vec{A} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    $V = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    $\\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi c \\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    Using $\\mu_0 = 1/(\\epsilon_0 c^2)$, we rewrite $\\vec{A}$:\n    $\\vec{A} = \\dfrac{(1/\\epsilon_o c^2) qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})} = \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi c \\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    The relationship holds.\n\nConclusion: The expressions in option C correctly represent the Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a moving point charge.\n\n<<<C>>>"
