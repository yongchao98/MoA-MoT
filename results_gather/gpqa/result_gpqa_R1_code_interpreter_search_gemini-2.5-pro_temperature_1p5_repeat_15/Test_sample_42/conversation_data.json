    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Identify the Principal Functional Group\n\nThe molecule contains several functional groups:\n*   Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n*   Carbaldehyde (-CHO)\n*   Cyano (-CN)\n*   Hydroxyl (-OH)\n*   Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2)\n*   Methoxy (-OCH3)\n\nAccording to IUPAC rules for nomenclature of organic compounds, the priority of these functional groups is as follows:\nCarboxylic acid > Carbaldehyde > Cyano > Hydroxyl > Amino.\nTherefore, the carboxylic acid is the principal functional group. This makes the parent molecule **benzoic acid**, and the carbon atom attached to the -COOH group is designated as C1.\n\n### 2. Determine the Structure from the Description\n\nWe will build the structure step-by-step based on the relative positions given.\n\n*   **Parent:** Benzoic acid. We place the -COOH group at the C1 position.\n\n*   **\"A carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another.\"**\n    *   This means these three groups are in a 1,3,5-relationship on the benzene ring.\n    *   With -COOH at C1, the carbaldehyde (-CHO, named \"formyl\" as a substituent) and the cyano (-CN) group must be at C3 and C5.\n\n*   **\"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group.\"**\n    *   The position para (opposite) to C1 is C4. So, the methoxy group (-OCH3) is at C4.\n\n*   **\"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\"**\n    *   The positions ortho (adjacent) to C1 are C2 and C6.\n    *   So, a hydroxyl group (-OH) and a dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2) are at C2 and C6. We still need to determine which is where.\n\n*   **\"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"**\n    *   The nitrile (cyano, -CN) is at either C3 or C5.\n    *   Let's assume the -CN group is at C5. The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6.\n    *   The description states the methoxy (-OCH3) and the alcohol (hydroxyl, -OH) are at these positions.\n    *   We already placed the -OCH3 group at C4. This fits the description.\n    *   Therefore, the hydroxyl group (-OH) must be at C6.\n    *   This means the remaining ortho position to the acid, C2, must be occupied by the dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2).\n    *   And the carbaldehyde (-CHO) group must be at C3.\n\nThis gives us a single, unambiguous structure:\n\n*   **C1:** -COOH\n*   **C2:** -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n*   **C3:** -CHO (formyl)\n*   **C4:** -OCH3 (methoxy)\n*   **C5:** -CN (cyano)\n*   **C6:** -OH (hydroxy)\n\n### 3. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules\n\nThe principal functional group (-COOH) is at C1. We must number the ring to give the lowest possible set of locants (numbers) to the other substituents.\n\nThere are two possible directions to number the ring from C1:\n\n*   **Path A (Clockwise):** C1 -> C2(-NMe2) -> C3(-CHO) -> C4(-OCH3) -> C5(-CN) -> C6(-OH).\n    *   The locants are: **2, 3, 4, 5, 6**.\n\n*   **Path B (Counter-clockwise):** Let's re-label our determined structure for counter-clockwise numbering starting from C1.\n    *   C1: -COOH\n    *   C2: -OH (hydroxy)\n    *   C3: -CN (cyano)\n    *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n    *   C5: -CHO (formyl)\n    *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n    *   The locants are: **2, 3, 4, 5, 6**.\n\nSince both numbering directions result in the identical set of locants (2,3,4,5,6), we must use the tie-breaker rule: we give the lower number to the substituent that comes first alphabetically.\n\n### 4. Alphabetize Substituents and Apply Tie-Breaker\n\nLet's list the substituents alphabetically:\n1.  **C**yano\n2.  **D**imethylamino\n3.  **F**ormyl\n4.  **H**ydroxy\n5.  **M**ethoxy\n\nNow we compare the locants for each substituent in our two paths. We look for the first point of difference.\n\n| Substituent (Alphabetical) | Path A Locant (Clockwise) | Path B Locant (Counter-clockwise) |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: |\n| **Cyano** | 5 | **3** |\n| Dimethylamino | 2 | 6 |\n| Formyl | 3 | 5 |\n| Hydroxy | 6 | 2 |\n| Methoxy | 4 | 4 |\n\nThe first substituent in alphabetical order is \"cyano\". Path A gives it locant 5, while Path B gives it locant 3. Since 3 is lower than 5, **Path B (counter-clockwise numbering) is the correct IUPAC numbering scheme.**\n\n### 5. Assemble the Final Name\n\nUsing the correct numbering from Path B:\n*   **Parent:** benzoic acid\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   3-cyano\n    *   6-(dimethylamino)\n    *   5-formyl\n    *   2-hydroxy\n    *   4-methoxy\n\nNow, we list the substituents in alphabetical order followed by the parent name:\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\nThis name corresponds exactly to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
