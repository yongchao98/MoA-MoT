    "This problem requires us to relate the temperatures of two stars based on the relative excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The key physical principle is the Boltzmann distribution, which is applicable here because the photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n### Reasoning and Derivation\n\n1.  **The Boltzmann Equation**: Under LTE, the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited energy state `i` (`N_i`) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state `j` (`N_j`) is given by the Boltzmann equation:\n\n    ```\n    N_i / N_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp[-(E_i - E_j) / (k * T)]\n    ```\n\n    where:\n    *   `g_i` and `g_j` are the statistical weights of the states.\n    *   `ΔE = E_i - E_j` is the energy difference between the states.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the temperature.\n\n2.  **Defining \"Excitation\"**: The problem states that \"iron atoms...are twice as excited in a specific energy level\" in star 1 compared to star 2. A natural measure of the excitation to a specific level `i` is the ratio of its population (`N_i`) to the population of the ground state (`N_ground`). Let's denote this excitation ratio as `X = N_i / N_ground`.\n\n3.  **Applying to the Two Stars**: We can write the excitation ratio for each star using the Boltzmann equation. Let `T_1` and `T_2` be the temperatures of star 1 and star 2, respectively. We are considering the same energy level transition in the same atomic species (iron), so the statistical weights (`g_i`, `g_ground`) and the energy difference `ΔE` are the same for both stars.\n\n    *   For star 1: `X_1 = (g_i / g_ground) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]`\n    *   For star 2: `X_2 = (g_i / g_ground) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]`\n\n4.  **Using the Given Information**: The problem states that `X_1 = 2 * X_2`. Substituting the expressions from step 3:\n\n    ```\n    (g_i / g_ground) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * (g_i / g_ground) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n    ```\n\n5.  **Simplifying the Equation**: The term with the statistical weights `(g_i / g_ground)` is a common factor on both sides and can be canceled out:\n\n    ```\n    exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n    ```\n\n6.  **Solving for the Temperatures**: To isolate the temperatures, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\n    ```\n    ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n    ```\n\n    Using the logarithm properties `ln(e^x) = x` and `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`:\n\n    ```\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n    ```\n\n7.  **Isolating ln(2)**: We rearrange the equation to match the format of the given options:\n\n    ```\n    ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)\n    ```\n\n8.  **Factoring and Finalizing**: We can factor out the `ΔE / k` term and combine the fractions involving temperature:\n\n    ```\n    (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n    (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n    ```\n\n9.  **Evaluating the Constant Factor**: The problem provides `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`. The Boltzmann constant is `k ≈ 1.380649 x 10^(-23) J/K`. Therefore, the ratio `ΔE / k` is:\n\n    ```\n    ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.380649 x 10^(-23) J/K) ≈ 1 K\n    ```\n    The problem is designed such that this pre-factor is essentially 1. Substituting this value into our equation:\n\n    ```\n    1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n    ```\n    This simplifies to:\n    ```\n    ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n    ```\n\nThis equation matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
