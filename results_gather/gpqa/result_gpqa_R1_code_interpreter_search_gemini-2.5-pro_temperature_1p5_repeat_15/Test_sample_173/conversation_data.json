    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and calculation process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Define Variables and Knowns\n\n*   Initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus: $E_0 = M c^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   The nucleus is at rest, so its initial momentum is $p_0 = 0$.\n*   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n*   One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's designate $m_1$ as the more massive fragment: $m_1 = 2m_2$.\n*   The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99 M$.\n*   $T_1$ is the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment ($m_1$).\n*   The goal is to find the difference between the correct relativistic value of $T_1$ and the value of $T_1$ calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.\n\n### 2. Calculate Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments\n\nFirst, we determine the rest-mass energies of the two fragments, $m_1 c^2$ and $m_2 c^2$.\nFrom the given information:\n$(m_1 + m_2)c^2 = 0.99 (M c^2)$\n$(m_1 + m_2)c^2 = 0.99 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 297 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nWe also know that $m_1 = 2m_2$, which implies $m_1 c^2 = 2(m_2 c^2)$.\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n1.  $m_1 c^2 + m_2 c^2 = 297 \\text{ GeV}$\n2.  $m_1 c^2 = 2(m_2 c^2)$\n\nSubstitute (2) into (1):\n$2(m_2 c^2) + m_2 c^2 = 297 \\text{ GeV}$\n$3(m_2 c^2) = 297 \\text{ GeV}$\n$m_2 c^2 = \\frac{297}{3} \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nNow, find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment:\n$m_1 c^2 = 2(m_2 c^2) = 2 \\times 99 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nSo, we have:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment ($m_1$): $m_1 c^2 = 198 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment ($m_2$): $m_2 c^2 = 99 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n### 3. Apply Conservation Laws\n\n**Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the fission must equal the total energy after. The difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy is converted into kinetic energy of the fragments. This is the Q-value of the reaction.\n\n$Q = \\text{Initial rest-mass energy} - \\text{Final rest-mass energy}$\n$Q = M c^2 - (m_1 c^2 + m_2 c^2)$\n$Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments:\n$Q = T_1 + T_2 = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the total final momentum must also be zero. The two fragments fly off in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude.\n$p_1 = p_2$ (where $p_1$ and $p_2$ are the magnitudes of the momenta).\n\n### 4. Calculate $T_1$ using Classical Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy $T$ and momentum $p$ are related by $T = \\frac{p^2}{2m}$.\nFrom momentum conservation, $p_1 = p_2$, so $p_1^2 = p_2^2$.\nTherefore, $2m_1 T_{1,cl} = 2m_2 T_{2,cl}$, which simplifies to:\n$m_1 T_{1,cl} = m_2 T_{2,cl}$\n\nUsing the mass ratio $m_1 = 2m_2$, we get:\n$2m_2 T_{1,cl} = m_2 T_{2,cl} \\implies 2T_{1,cl} = T_{2,cl}$\n\nFrom energy conservation, we know $T_{1,cl} + T_{2,cl} = Q = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\nSubstitute $T_{2,cl} = 2T_{1,cl}$ into the energy equation:\n$T_{1,cl} + 2T_{1,cl} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n$3T_{1,cl} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n$T_{1,cl} = 1 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nSo, the classical approximation for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is $T_{1, \\text{classical}} = 1 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n### 5. Calculate $T_1$ using Relativistic Formulas\n\nIn special relativity, the relationship between total energy ($E$), momentum ($p$), and rest mass ($m$) is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. The total energy is the sum of kinetic and rest-mass energy, $E = T + mc^2$.\nSubstituting this into the equation gives:\n$(T + mc^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$\n$T^2 + 2Tmc^2 + (mc^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$\n$(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2Tmc^2$\n\nFrom momentum conservation, $p_1 = p_2$, so $(p_1c)^2 = (p_2c)^2$.\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = T_2^2 + 2T_2(m_2c^2)$\n\nWe substitute the known values:\n*   $m_1c^2 = 198 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   $m_2c^2 = 99 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   $T_2 = Q - T_1 = 3 - T_1$\n\nThe equation becomes:\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1(198) = (3 - T_1)^2 + 2(3 - T_1)(99)$\n$T_1^2 + 396T_1 = (9 - 6T_1 + T_1^2) + (594 - 198T_1)$\n\nThe $T_1^2$ terms cancel out on both sides:\n$396T_1 = 9 - 6T_1 + 594 - 198T_1$\n$396T_1 = 603 - 204T_1$\n$396T_1 + 204T_1 = 603$\n$600T_1 = 603$\n$T_1 = \\frac{603}{600} \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nSo, the correct relativistic kinetic energy is $T_{1, \\text{relativistic}} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n### 6. Find the Difference\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical value, in MeV.\nDifference = $T_{1, \\text{relativistic}} - T_{1, \\text{classical}}$\nDifference = $1.005 \\text{ GeV} - 1 \\text{ GeV} = 0.005 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nTo convert this to MeV, we use the conversion factor 1 GeV = 1000 MeV.\nDifference = $0.005 \\times 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nThe difference between the two calculated values for $T_1$ is 5 MeV.\nLet's check the given options:\nA) 5 MeV.\nB) 20 MeV.\nC) 2 MeV.\nD) 10 MeV.\n\nThe calculated result matches option A.\n\n```python\n# All energy values are in GeV\n\n# Initial rest-mass energy\nE_initial = 300\n\n# Final sum of rest-mass energies is 99% of initial\nE_final_rest = 0.99 * E_initial\n\n# Q-value is the total kinetic energy released\nQ = E_initial - E_final_rest\n\n# Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (m2)\n# m1 + m2 = E_final_rest and m1 = 2*m2\n# 3*m2 = E_final_rest\nm2c2 = E_final_rest / 3\n\n# Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (m1)\nm1c2 = 2 * m2c2\n\n# Classical Calculation for T1 (kinetic energy of the more massive fragment)\n# From m1*T1 = m2*T2 and T1+T2 = Q, we derive T1 = Q / 3 for m1=2*m2\nT1_classical = Q / 3\n\n# Relativistic Calculation for T1\n# From (p1c)^2 = (p2c)^2, we have T1^2 + 2*T1*m1c2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2c2\n# Using T2 = Q - T1 and solving for T1 gives:\nT1_relativistic = (Q * (Q + 2*m2c2)) / (2 * E_initial)\n\n# Calculate the difference in GeV\ndifference_gev = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\n\n# Convert the difference to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV)\ndifference_mev = difference_gev * 1000\n\nprint(f\"{difference_mev}\")\n```\n>>>\n5.0\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1.  **Identify Given Information**\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus, $E_0 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$.\n    *   The initial nucleus is at rest, so its initial total energy is $E_{initial} = 300 \\text{ GeV}$ and its initial momentum is $p_{initial} = 0$.\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n    *   The more massive fragment, $m_1$, has a mass twice that of the other fragment, $m_2$. So, $m_1 = 2m_2$. This also means their rest-mass energies are related by $m_1c^2 = 2(m_2c^2)$.\n    *   The sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass: $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$. This implies the sum of their rest-mass energies is $(m_1+m_2)c^2 = 0.99(Mc^2)$.\n\n2.  **Calculate Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n    *   The sum of the rest-mass energies of the fragments is:\n        $(m_1 + m_2)c^2 = 0.99 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 297 \\text{ GeV}$.\n    *   We have a system of two linear equations:\n        1.  $m_1c^2 + m_2c^2 = 297 \\text{ GeV}$\n        2.  $m_1c^2 = 2(m_2c^2)$\n    *   Substitute equation (2) into (1):\n        $2(m_2c^2) + m_2c^2 = 297 \\text{ GeV}$\n        $3(m_2c^2) = 297 \\text{ GeV}$\n        $m_2c^2 = 99 \\text{ GeV}$\n    *   Now, find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment ($m_1$):\n        $m_1c^2 = 2 \\times 99 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n    *   By the principle of conservation of energy, the initial rest-mass energy is converted into the final rest-mass energy plus the kinetic energy of the fragments ($T_1 + T_2$).\n    *   The total kinetic energy released, known as the Q-value, is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies:\n        $Q = T_1 + T_2 = E_0 - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2) = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n4.  **Calculate $T_1$ using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n    *   The initial nucleus was at rest, so by the conservation of momentum, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of the momentum be $p$.\n        $p_1 = p_2 = p$.\n    *   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is given by $T = p^2 / (2m)$.\n    *   So, $p^2 = 2m_1T_{1,cl}$ and $p^2 = 2m_2T_{2,cl}$.\n    *   Therefore, $m_1T_{1,cl} = m_2T_{2,cl}$.\n    *   Since $m_1 = 2m_2$, we have $2m_2T_{1,cl} = m_2T_{2,cl}$, which simplifies to $T_{2,cl} = 2T_{1,cl}$.\n    *   Using the total kinetic energy, $T_{1,cl} + T_{2,cl} = Q = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n    *   Substitute $T_{2,cl}$: $T_{1,cl} + 2T_{1,cl} = 3 \\text{ GeV} \\implies 3T_{1,cl} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n    *   So, the classical kinetic energy is $T_{1,cl} = 1 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) Value of $T_1$**\n    *   In special relativity, the relationship between total energy ($E$), momentum ($p$), and rest-mass energy ($mc^2$) is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$.\n    *   This can be rewritten for momentum as $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2$.\n    *   Since $E = T + mc^2$, we have $(pc)^2 = (T+mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2T(mc^2)$.\n    *   From momentum conservation, $(p_1c)^2 = (p_2c)^2$.\n    *   Therefore, $T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = T_2^2 + 2T_2(m_2c^2)$.\n    *   We substitute the known values:\n        *   $m_1c^2 = 198 \\text{ GeV}$\n        *   $m_2c^2 = 99 \\text{ GeV}$\n        *   $T_2 = Q - T_1 = 3 - T_1$\n    *   The equation becomes:\n        $T_1^2 + 2T_1(198) = (3 - T_1)^2 + 2(3 - T_1)(99)$\n        $T_1^2 + 396T_1 = (9 - 6T_1 + T_1^2) + (594 - 198T_1)$\n    *   The $T_1^2$ terms cancel on both sides:\n        $396T_1 = 9 - 6T_1 + 594 - 198T_1$\n        $396T_1 = 603 - 204T_1$\n        $396T_1 + 204T_1 = 603$\n        $600T_1 = 603$\n        $T_1 = \\frac{603}{600} \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n    *   So, the correct relativistic kinetic energy is $T_{1,rel} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n6.  **Find the Difference**\n    *   The difference between the relativistic and classical values for $T_1$ is:\n        $\\Delta T_1 = T_{1,rel} - T_{1,cl} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV} - 1 \\text{ GeV} = 0.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n    *   The question asks for the answer in MeV. We convert GeV to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n        $\\Delta T_1 = 0.005 \\text{ GeV} \\times 1000 \\frac{\\text{MeV}}{\\text{GeV}} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n### Python Code for Verification\nThe following Python script automates the calculations described above.\n```python\n# All energy values are in GeV\n\n# Initial rest-mass energy of the parent nucleus\nE_initial = 300.0\n\n# The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass\nE_final_rest = 0.99 * E_initial\n\n# The total kinetic energy released (Q-value) is the mass defect\nQ = E_initial - E_final_rest\n\n# The final fragments have masses m1 and m2, with m1 = 2*m2.\n# Their rest energies are E_rest_1 and E_rest_2.\n# E_rest_1 + E_rest_2 = E_final_rest\n# E_rest_1 = 2 * E_rest_2\n# So, 3 * E_rest_2 = E_final_rest\nE_rest_2 = E_final_rest / 3.0\nE_rest_1 = 2.0 * E_rest_2\n\n# Classical (non-relativistic) calculation for T1 (kinetic energy of the more massive fragment)\n# Conservation of momentum p1 = p2 => sqrt(2*m1*T1) = sqrt(2*m2*T2) => m1*T1 = m2*T2\n# Since m1 = 2*m2, then 2*T1 = T2.\n# Also, T1 + T2 = Q.\n# Substituting T2: T1 + 2*T1 = Q => 3*T1 = Q\nT1_classical = Q / 3.0\n\n# Relativistic calculation for T1\n# Conservation of momentum (pc)^2_1 = (pc)^2_2\n# (pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(mc^2)\n# T1^2 + 2*T1*E_rest_1 = T2^2 + 2*T2*E_rest_2\n# Substitute T2 = Q - T1:\n# T1^2 + 2*T1*E_rest_1 = (Q-T1)^2 + 2*(Q-T1)*E_rest_2\n# T1^2 + 2*T1*E_rest_1 = Q^2 - 2*Q*T1 + T1^2 + 2*Q*E_rest_2 - 2*T1*E_rest_2\n# 2*T1*E_rest_1 = Q^2 - 2*Q*T1 + 2*Q*E_rest_2 - 2*T1*E_rest_2\n# T1 * (2*E_rest_1 + 2*Q + 2*E_rest_2) = Q^2 + 2*Q*E_rest_2\n# T1 * 2*(E_rest_1 + E_rest_2 + Q) = Q * (Q + 2*E_rest_2)\n# T1 * 2*(E_final_rest + Q) = Q * (Q + 2*E_rest_2)\n# T1 * 2*E_initial = Q * (Q + 2*E_rest_2)\nT1_relativistic = (Q * (Q + 2 * E_rest_2)) / (2 * E_initial)\n\n# Calculate the difference in GeV\ndifference_gev = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\n\n# Convert the difference to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV)\ndifference_mev = difference_gev * 1000\n\nprint(f\"{difference_mev}\")\n```\n>>>\n5.0\n\n<<<A>>>",
