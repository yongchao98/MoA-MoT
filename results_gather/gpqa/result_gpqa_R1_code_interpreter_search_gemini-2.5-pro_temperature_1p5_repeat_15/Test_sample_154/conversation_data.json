    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the uncertainty in the measurement of the observable $P_z$, denoted as $\\Delta P_z$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Uncertainty Principle Formula:** In quantum mechanics, the uncertainty (standard deviation) of an operator $A$ in a given state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is defined by the formula:\n    $\\Delta A = \\sqrt{\\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2}$\n    For this problem, the operator is $P_z$, so the formula is:\n    $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n\n3.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The matrix representation of the operator $P_z$ is:\n        $P_z = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   The state vector of the system is given by the column vector:\n        $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   The corresponding \"bra\" vector, which is the conjugate transpose of $|\\psi\\rangle$, is:\n        $\\langle\\psi| = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of $P_z$, $\\langle P_z \\rangle$:**\n    The expectation value is calculated as $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z | \\psi \\rangle$.\n    *   First, we apply the operator $P_z$ to the state vector $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n        $P_z |\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} (1)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (0)(-1/2) \\\\ (0)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (0)(-1/2) \\\\ (0)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (-1)(-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   Next, we take the inner product of $\\langle \\psi |$ with the resulting vector $P_z |\\psi\\rangle$:\n        $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | (P_z |\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n        $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left[ (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(1/2) \\right] = \\hbar \\left[ \\frac{1}{4} + 0 - \\frac{1}{4} \\right] = 0$\n    So, the expectation value of $P_z$ is 0.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of $P_z^2$, $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$:**\n    *   First, we need the matrix representation of the operator $P_z^2$. We find this by squaring the matrix for $P_z$:\n        $P_z^2 = \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & (-1)^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   Now, we calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z^2 | \\psi \\rangle$:\n        $P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   Next, we take the inner product with $\\langle \\psi |$:\n        $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | (P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n        $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left[ (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-1/2) \\right] = \\hbar^2 \\left[ \\frac{1}{4} + 0 + \\frac{1}{4} \\right] = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$:**\n    *   Now we substitute the values of $\\langle P_z \\rangle$ and $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$ into the uncertainty formula:\n        $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}}$\n        $\\Delta P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\nThe uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ is $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$. This corresponds to option A.\nTo verify this calculation, the following Python code can be executed.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Set hbar = 1 for simplicity in calculation, and add it back at the end.\nhbar = 1\n\n# Define the P_z operator matrix\nP_z = hbar * np.array([\n    [1, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, -1]\n])\n\n# Define the state vector psi\npsi = np.array([\n    [-0.5],\n    [1/np.sqrt(2)],\n    [-0.5]\n])\n\n# Calculate the expectation value of P_z\n# <P_z> = psi_dagger * P_z * psi\npsi_dagger = psi.conj().T\nexp_Pz = np.dot(psi_dagger, np.dot(P_z, psi)).item()\n\n# Calculate the P_z^2 operator matrix\nPz_squared = np.dot(P_z, P_z)\n\n# Calculate the expectation value of P_z^2\n# <P_z^2> = psi_dagger * P_z^2 * psi\nexp_Pz_squared = np.dot(psi_dagger, np.dot(Pz_squared, psi)).item()\n\n# Calculate the variance\nvariance_Pz = exp_Pz_squared - exp_Pz**2\n\n# Calculate the uncertainty (standard deviation)\nuncertainty_Pz = np.sqrt(variance_Pz)\n\n# The result is a multiple of hbar.
