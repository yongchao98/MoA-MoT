    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Principle of Conservation of Energy**\n\nIn a relativistic system with a potential energy U, the total energy $\\mathcal{E}$ which is conserved is the sum of the relativistic energy of the particle and its potential energy. The relativistic energy $E$ of a particle with rest mass $m$ and velocity $v$ is given by $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nThe total conserved energy is:\n$\\mathcal{E} = E + U(x) = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x)$\n\nFor a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is given by Hooke's law, $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, where $k$ is the spring constant and $x$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position.\n\nSo, the conserved quantity for our system is:\n$\\mathcal{E} = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}} + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n**2. Analyze the System at Two Key Points**\n\nWe can use the principle of energy conservation by equating the total energy at two specific points in the oscillation cycle.\n\n*   **Point 1: Maximum Displacement (Amplitude)**\n    At the point of maximum displacement, the particle is momentarily at rest.\n    *   Position: $x = A$\n    *   Velocity: $v = 0$\n    *   Lorentz factor: $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0/c)^2}} = 1$\n    *   The total energy at this point ($\\mathcal{E}_1$) is:\n        $\\mathcal{E}_1 = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n*   **Point 2: Equilibrium Position**\n    At the equilibrium position, the potential energy is zero, and the particle has its maximum speed.\n    *   Position: $x = 0$\n    *   Velocity: $v = v_{max}$\n    *   Lorentz factor: $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_{max}/c)^2}}$\n    *   The total energy at this point ($\\mathcal{E}_2$) is:\n        $\\mathcal{E}_2 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n\n**3. Equate the Energies and Solve for v_max**\n\nSince energy is conserved, $\\mathcal{E}_1 = \\mathcal{E}_2$:\n$mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n\nNow, we solve for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n$\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\nNext, we substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$ to find $v_{max}$:\n$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_{max}/c)^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\nTo isolate $v_{max}$, we first take the reciprocal of both sides:\n$\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\nSquare both sides:\n$1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\nRearrange the terms to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n$\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\nFinally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to get $v_{max}$:\n$v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n**4. Compare with the Given Options**\n\nThe derived expression is:\n$v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
