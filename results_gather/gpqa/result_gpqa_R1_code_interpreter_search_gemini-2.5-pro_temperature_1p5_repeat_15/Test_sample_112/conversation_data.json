    "*   **Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   A \"very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers (cm⁻¹)\" is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding. While alcohols also have O-H stretches, they are typically less broad unless the sample is very pure and concentrated, and the combination with other peaks points away from a simple alcohol.\n    *   A \"strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹\" is in the characteristic range for a carbonyl (C=O) group. Specifically, a C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid appears around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹. This further supports the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n    *   A \"strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹\" is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   The observation of \"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\" confirms the presence of an alkene (C=C). Vinyl hydrogens are the protons directly attached to the carbons of the double bond. This corroborates the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   A \"fragment peak at m/z = 45\" is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids. It corresponds to the loss of the carboxyl group as a cation, [COOH]⁺. The mass is calculated as: C (12) + O (16) + O (16) + H (1) = 45.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information:**\n    *   The combined evidence from FTIR (broad O-H, C=O) and Mass Spectrometry (m/z = 45) strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n    *   A carboxylic acid contains two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options B (C6H10O) and C (C6H12O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with two possibilities: A) C6H12O2 and D) C6H10O2.\n    *   The evidence from FTIR (C=C stretch) and 1H NMR (vinyl-hydrogens) confirms that the molecule contains a carbon-carbon double bond in addition to the carboxylic acid group.\n\n5.  **Use the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to Differentiate:**\n    *   The degree of unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)` for a formula CₓHᵧ (heteroatoms like oxygen don't change the calculation).\n    *   Our molecule has a carboxylic acid group, which contains one C=O double bond. This accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Our molecule also has an alkene group, which contains one C=C double bond. This accounts for a **second** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the correct molecular formula must have a total of **two** degrees of unsaturation.\n\n6.  **Calculate the DoU for the remaining options:**\n    *   **A) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1. This formula has only one degree of unsaturation. It would correspond to a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which does not have a C=C double bond. This contradicts the data.\n    *   **D) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. This formula has two degrees of unsaturation, which is consistent with having one C=O bond and one C=C bond. A possible structure would be a hexenoic acid.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The spectral data points to an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The formula C6H10O2 is the only option that contains two oxygen atoms (for the carboxylic acid) and has the correct degree of unsaturation (DoU=2) to account for both the carbonyl (C=O) and alkene (C=C) double bonds.\n\n<<<D>>>"
