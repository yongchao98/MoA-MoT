    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Core Concepts**\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the possible results of measuring a physical observable are the eigenvalues of the corresponding Hermitian operator. The probability of obtaining a specific eigenvalue is determined by the projection of the system's state vector onto the corresponding eigenvector.\n\nThe key formula for the probability `P(λ)` of measuring an eigenvalue `λ` for a system in a state `|ψ⟩` is:\n\n`P(λ) = |⟨v_λ|ψ⟩|² / (⟨ψ|ψ⟩ ⋅ ⟨v_λ|v_λ⟩)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `|ψ⟩` is the state vector of the system.\n*   `|v_λ⟩` is the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ`.\n*   `⟨v_λ|ψ⟩` is the inner product (or dot product in this matrix representation) of the eigenvector and the state vector.\n*   `⟨ψ|ψ⟩` and `⟨v_λ|v_λ⟩` are the squared norms of the state vector and the eigenvector, respectively. They are needed because the given vectors might not be normalized.\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information**\n\n*   The state vector of the system is `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]ᵀ`.\n*   The operator for the observable is `P`:\n    ```\n      [ 0, 1/√2, 0     ]\n    P = [ 1/√2, 0, 1/√2 ]\n      [ 0, 1/√2, 0     ]\n    ```\n*   We need to find the probability of the measurement yielding the value `0`. This means we are interested in the eigenvalue `λ = 0`.\n\n**3. Find the Eigenvalues of the Operator P**\n\nWe need to solve the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`, where `I` is the identity matrix.\n\n```\n      [ -λ,  1/√2,   0    ]\ndet   [ 1/√2,  -λ,  1/√2 ]  = 0\n      [ 0,   1/√2,  -λ    ]\n```\n\nExpanding the determinant:\n`(-λ) * [(-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2)] - (1/√2) * [(1/√2)(-λ) - (0)(1/√2)] + 0 = 0`\n`(-λ) * (λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2) * (-λ/√2) = 0`\n`-λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = 0`\n`-λ³ + λ = 0`\n`λ(1 - λ²) = 0`\n`λ(1 - λ)(1 + λ) = 0`\n\nThe eigenvalues are `λ₁ = 0`, `λ₂ = 1`, and `λ₃ = -1`. Since 0 is an eigenvalue, it is a possible outcome of the measurement.\n\n**4. Find the Eigenvector for λ = 0**\n\nNow we find the eigenvector `|v₀⟩` corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ = 0` by solving the equation `(P - 0*I)|v₀⟩ = 0`, which simplifies to `P|v₀⟩ = 0`. Let `|v₀⟩ = [x, y, z]ᵀ`.\n\n```\n[ 0, 1/√2, 0     ] [x]   [0]\n[ 1/√2, 0, 1/√2 ] [y] = [0]\n[ 0, 1/√2, 0     ] [z]   [0]\n```\nThis gives us a system of linear equations:\n1.  `(1/√2)y = 0`  => `y = 0`\n2.  `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0` => `x + z = 0` => `x = -z`\n\nSo, the eigenvector is of the form `[x, 0, -x]ᵀ`. We can choose the simplest non-zero vector by setting `x=1`, which gives us the unnormalized eigenvector `|v₀⟩ = [1, 0, -1]ᵀ`.\n\n**5. Calculate the Probability**\n\nNow we use the probability formula `P(0) = |⟨v₀|ψ⟩|² / (⟨ψ|ψ⟩ ⋅ ⟨v₀|v₀⟩)`.\n\n*   **Calculate the inner product `⟨v₀|ψ⟩`**:\n    `⟨v₀|` is the row vector `[1, 0, -1]`.\n    `|ψ⟩` is the column vector `[-1, 2, 1]ᵀ`.\n    `⟨v₀|ψ⟩ = (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) = -1 - 0 - 1 = -2`.\n\n*   **Calculate the squared magnitude `|⟨v₀|ψ⟩|²`**:\n    `|⟨v₀|ψ⟩|² = (-2)² = 4`.\n\n*   **Calculate the squared norm `⟨v₀|v₀⟩`**:\n    `⟨v₀|v₀⟩ = (1)(1) + (0)(0) + (-1)(-1) = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2`.\n\n*   **Calculate the squared norm `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`**:\n    `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)(-1) + (2)(2) + (1)(1) = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`.\n\n*   **Finally, calculate the probability `P(0)`**:\n    `P(0) = 4 / (6 * 2) = 4 / 12 = 1/3`.\n\nThe probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 is 1/3.\n\n<<<B>>>"
