    "Here is my thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z:**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. Let's determine its empirical and molecular formula.\n    *   Mass % of Hydrogen = 14.28% ≈ 1/7.\n    *   Mass % of Carbon = 100% - 14.28% = 85.72% ≈ 6/7.\n    *   Ratio of atoms C:H = (%C / M_C) : (%H / M_H) = (85.72 / 12) : (14.28 / 1) ≈ 7.14 : 14.28 ≈ 1 : 2.\n    *   The empirical formula of Z is CH2.\n    *   The general formula for a hydrocarbon with this empirical formula is (CH2)n, or CnH2n. This corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z does not react further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   We are also told that Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvents are cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   Both X and Y hydrogenate to a *single* substance Z. This implies that all components of mixtures X and Y must share the same carbon skeleton.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y and its formation:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them C and D.\n    *   Y is formed by heating mixture X with Platinum (Pt). This is a catalytic process, often associated with hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, or, as stated, disproportionation.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components (C and D) are either saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Substance Z is a constituent of mixture Y. Let's assume C is Z. So, C is a saturated cycloalkane.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y (C+D) gives only Z. This means hydrogenation of C gives Z (which is trivial, as C=Z and Z is saturated) and hydrogenation of D must also give Z.\n    *   Since D hydrogenates to Z (a cycloalkane), D must be an unsaturated or aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton as Z. Since D does not decolorize bromine water, it must be aromatic.\n    *   So, we have a pair: a saturated cycloalkane (C=Z) and an aromatic hydrocarbon (D) with the same carbon skeleton. The most common and simple example of such a pair is cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\n    *   Let's check if Z = C6H12 (cyclohexane) fits the data. Hydrogenation of benzene (C6H6) gives cyclohexane (C6H12). Cyclohexane is a widely used solvent. The mass percentage of H in C6H12 is (12*1.008) / (6*12.011 + 12*1.008) ≈ 14.37%, which is very close to 14.28% (the problem likely uses integer masses where 12/(6*12+12) = 12/84 = 1/7 ≈ 0.1428). This confirms Z is likely cyclohexane.\n    *   So, Mixture Y = {Cyclohexane (C6H12), Benzene (C6H6)}.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, so A and/or B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n    *   The reaction is: A + B --(Pt, heat)--> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6). This is a disproportionation, which in this context means a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component is reduced (gains H), and the other is oxidized (loses H).\n    *   Since A and B both hydrogenate to Z (cyclohexane), they must both be unsaturated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons.\n    *   The overall reaction for the components must be: C6Hx + C6Hy → C6H12 + C6H6.\n    *   By conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms must be the same on both sides.\n    *   Total H atoms = H(A) + H(B) = H(cyclohexane) + H(benzene) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   So we are looking for two unsaturated C6 cyclic molecules whose hydrogen counts (x and y) add up to 18.\n    *   Since A and B are unsaturated, x < 12 and y < 12.\n    *   A plausible combination is a C6H10 molecule (a cyclohexene) and a C6H8 molecule (a cyclohexadiene). 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Let A = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and B = Cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   The reaction would be: C6H10 + C6H8 → C6H12 + C6H6.\n    *   In this reaction, cyclohexene (A) is reduced to cyclohexane by gaining 2 hydrogen atoms. Cyclohexadiene (B) is oxidized to benzene by losing 2 hydrogen atoms. The hydrogen transfer is balanced.\n    *   The problem also states there are no *conjugated* multiple bonds in mixture X. Cyclohexa-1,3-diene is conjugated. Therefore, the C6H8 molecule must be the non-conjugated isomer, cyclohexa-1,4-diene. Cyclohexene is not conjugated.\n    *   This set of molecules fits all conditions of the problem.\n    *   Mixture X = {Cyclohexene (C6H10), Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8)}.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\". This means the sum of the number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component of the mixture.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in C6H10) + (H atoms in C6H8)\n    *   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
