    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the given reaction.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Reactant Name**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n*   **Core Structure:** `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` describes a cyclohexane ring fused with an oxirane (epoxide) ring. The bridgehead carbons are C1 and C6, and the oxygen is atom 7.\n*   **Substituents:** There are methyl groups on C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The absolute configuration at the four chiral centers (C1, C3, C4, C6) is given by the R/S descriptors.\n\n**2. Determine the 3D Structure of the Reactant**\n\nTo apply the reaction rules, we must first establish the relative and absolute stereochemistry of the reactant. We will use a planar representation with wedges (bonds coming out of the page) and dashes (bonds going into the page).\n\n*   Let's assume the epoxide ring oxygen is **up (beta, wedged)**.\n*   **At C1 (must be R):**\n    *   Bonds: C1-O (wedged), C1-Me, C1-C2, C1-C6.\n    *   Priorities (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog): O > C6 > C2 > Me.\n    *   For the configuration to be R, the lowest priority group (Me) must be pointing **down (alpha, dashed)**. (Viewing down the C1-Me bond, the sequence O→C6→C2 is clockwise).\n*   **At C6 (must be S):**\n    *   Bonds: C6-O (wedged), C6-H, C6-C1, C6-C5.\n    *   Priorities: O > C1 > C5 > H.\n    *   For the configuration to be S, the lowest priority group (H) must be pointing **down (alpha, dashed)**. (Viewing down the C6-H bond, the sequence O→C1→C5 is counter-clockwise).\n*   **At C3 (must be R) and C4 (must be R):**\n    *   We need to place the methyl groups at C3 and C4 to satisfy the R configuration for both. Let's place both methyl groups **up (beta, wedged)**.\n    *   **C3:** Bonds C3-Me (wedged), C3-H (dashed). Priorities: C4 > C2 > Me > H. The lowest priority group (H) is dashed. The sequence C4→C2→Me is clockwise. Thus, C3 is **R**. This is correct.\n    *   **C4:** Bonds C4-Me (wedged), C4-H (dashed). Priorities: C3 > C5 > Me > H. The lowest priority group (H) is dashed. The sequence C3→C5→Me is clockwise. Thus, C4 is **R**. This is correct.\n\n**Summary of Reactant Structure:**\n*   The epoxide oxygen is **up (wedged)**.\n*   The C1-Methyl group is **down (dashed)**.\n*   The C6-Hydrogen is **down (dashed)**.\n*   The C3-Methyl group is **up (wedged)**.\n*   The C4-Methyl group is **up (wedged)**.\n\n**3. Apply the Reaction Rules**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate) is a Gilman reagent, which is a source of the \"soft\" nucleophile Me⁻.\n*   **Rule 1: Regioselectivity.** The problem states that the alkyl group (methyl) attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide.\n    *   C1 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to O, Me, C2, C6).\n    *   C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to O, H, C1, C5).\n    *   C6 is significantly less sterically hindered than C1. Therefore, the nucleophilic attack will occur at **C6**.\n*   **Rule 2: Stereospecificity.** The attack proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked. This is a backside, S_N2-type attack.\n    *   The bond being broken is the C6-O bond, which is pointing **up (wedged)**.\n    *   The nucleophile (Me⁻) must attack from the opposite face, i.e., from **down (dashed)**.\n    *   The attack causes the stereocenter at C6 to invert. The existing C6-H bond, which was pointing down (dashed), will be pushed up and become **wedged**.\n\n**4. Determine the Structure of the Product**\n\n1.  A new C-C bond forms between the incoming methyl group and C6. This new methyl group will have a **dashed** orientation.\n2.  The original hydrogen on C6 is inverted to a **wedged** orientation.\n3.  The C6-O bond breaks. The oxygen atom remains attached to C1 and carries a negative charge.\n4.  Upon aqueous workup (which is implicit in these reactions), the negatively charged oxygen is protonated to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n5.  The stereochemistry at C1 is unaffected by the reaction. The C1-O bond was **wedged**, so the resulting C1-OH group will also be **wedged**.\n\n**Summary of Product Structure:**\n*   The parent is a cyclohexanol. The IUPAC numbering will start at the carbon bearing the -OH group (the original C1).\n*   **New C1 (original C1):** Has an -OH group **up (wedged)** and a -Me group **down (dashed)**.\n*   **New C2 (original C6):** Has a new -Me group **down (dashed)** and a hydrogen **up (wedged)**.\n*   **New C4 (original C4):** Has a -Me group **up (wedged)**.\n*   **New C5 (original C3):** Has a -Me group **up (wedged)**.\n\nThe product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options B and D.\n\n**5. Assign the IUPAC Name to the Product**\n\nWe need to determine the R/S configuration of the chiral centers in the product to distinguish between options A and C.\n\n*   **At C1:**\n    *   Priorities: OH(1) > C2(2) > C6(3) > Me(4).\n    *   The lowest priority group (Me) is dashed (away). The sequence from 1 to 3 (OH→C2→C6) is **clockwise**.\n    *   Therefore, C1 is **R**.\n*   **At C2 (original C6):**\n    *   Priorities: C1(1) > C3(2) > Me(3) > H(4).\n    *   The lowest priority group (H) is wedged (forward). We determine the direction and then reverse it.\n    *   The sequence from 1 to 3 (C1→C3→Me) is **clockwise**.\n    *   Reversing the result gives **counter-clockwise**.\n    *   Therefore, C2 is **S**.\n*   **At C4 (original C4):**\n    *   Priorities: C5(1) > C3(2) > Me(3) > H(4).\n    *   The lowest priority group (H) is dashed (away). The sequence from 1 to 3 (C5→C3→Me) is **clockwise**.\n    *   Therefore, C4 is **R**.\n*   **At C5 (original C3):**\n    *   Priorities: C4(1) > C6(2) > Me(3) > H(4).\n    *   The lowest priority group (H) is dashed (away). The sequence from 1 to 3 (C4→C6→Me) is **clockwise**.\n    *   Therefore, C5 is **R**.\n\nThe full IUPAC name of the product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
