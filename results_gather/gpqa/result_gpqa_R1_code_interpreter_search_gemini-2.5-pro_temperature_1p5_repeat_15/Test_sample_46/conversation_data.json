    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for calculating the DoU is:\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n    DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) plus one additional double bond (e.g., C=O), which accounts for the fifth degree.\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n\n*   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong intensity bands in this region (3300-3500 cm-1) is characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH2)**. A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one band, and a tertiary amine has no N-H bonds to stretch.\n*   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl region. The frequency is typical for an **ester** (usually 1715-1735 cm-1). It is too high for a typical amide (which would be ~1650-1690 cm-1).\n\n**3. 1H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents 3 protons, suggesting a methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (t):** It's a triplet, which means its neighboring carbon has 2 protons (n+1=3, so n=2). This points to a -CH2-CH3 fragment.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents 2 protons, suggesting a methylene (-CH2-) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (q):** It's a quartet, which means its neighboring carbon has 3 protons (n+1=4, so n=3). This confirms the -CH2-CH3 fragment.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very downfield shift for a CH2 group. It indicates that the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom, as in an ester: -O-CH2-CH3.\n*   Combining the signals at 1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm confirms the presence of an **ethoxy group attached to a carbonyl carbon (an ethyl ester, -COOCH2CH3)**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents 2 protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (bs):** A broad singlet is typical for exchangeable protons like those in an -OH or -NH group. Given the IR data indicating a primary amine, this signal corresponds to the **-NH2** protons. The broadness is due to quadupole relaxation and/or chemical exchange.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0-8.0 ppm):** These signals are in the aromatic region of the spectrum.\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** There are 4 protons on the benzene ring.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d + d):** The presence of two doublets is the classic pattern for a **para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. The two substituents on the ring are different, causing the chemically non-equivalent aromatic protons to split each other. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt), while the upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is ortho to the electron-donating amine group (-NH2).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, the unknown compound contains:\n*   A primary amine group (-NH2)\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3)\n*   A para-disubstituted benzene ring\n\nThese fragments can only be assembled in one way: the amine and the ethyl ester groups are attached to a benzene ring in a para (1,4) arrangement. This structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the given options:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all data perfectly.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. It has a secondary amide (not a primary amine) and an ether (not an ester). The IR and NMR would be significantly different.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. It is an amide (wrong C=O frequency) and is meta-substituted (would give a more complex aromatic NMR pattern).\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. This is an isomer, but the alkyl chain is attached to the carbonyl carbon (-OCOCH2CH3). The NMR for the CH2 group would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n\nTherefore, the only structure that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
