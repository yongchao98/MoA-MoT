    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the factor by which the ratio of the population of two energy levels of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms changes. We need to compare the star's state without spots to its state with spots. Let this factor be `F`.\nLet `R_unspotted = (N2/N1)_unspotted` be the ratio when the star has no spots.\nLet `R_spotted = (N2/N1)_spotted` be the ratio when the star has spots.\nThe goal is to calculate the factor `F = R_unspotted / R_spotted`.\n\n**2. Identify the Relevant Physics**\nThe problem states that the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). Under this assumption, the ratio of the number of atoms `N_i` in two different energy levels `i` and `j` is governed by the Boltzmann equation:\n\n`N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T))`\n\nWhere:\n*   `N_j`, `N_i` are the number of atoms in energy level `j` and `i`.\n*   `g_j`, `g_i` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels.\n*   `E_j`, `E_i` are the energies of the levels, and `ΔE = E_j - E_i`.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   `T` is the local temperature in Kelvin.\n\nLet's apply this to our two levels, 1 and 2:\n`R(T) = N2 / N1 = (g2 / g1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n\n**3. Define the States and Temperatures**\n*   **Unspotted Star:** The star's surface is uniform. The problem states its effective temperature is `T_unspotted = 6000 K`. This is the temperature we use for the Boltzmann equation in this state.\n    `R_unspotted = (g2 / g1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_unspotted))`\n\n*   **Spotted Star:** When spots cover 40% of the surface, the *overall effective temperature* drops to `T_spotted = 5500 K`. In spectroscopy, the properties of spectral lines, which depend on these population ratios, are often analyzed using this effective temperature as the characteristic temperature of the light-emitting region. Therefore, it is appropriate to use this temperature to calculate the representative population ratio for the spotted star.\n    `R_spotted = (g2 / g1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spotted))`\n\n**4. Calculate the Factor**\nNow we can compute the factor `F`:\n\n`F = R_unspotted / R_spotted`\n`F = [ (g2 / g1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_unspotted)) ] / [ (g2 / g1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spotted)) ]`\n\nThe term `(g2 / g1)` cancels out:\n`F = exp(-ΔE / (k * T_unspotted)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spotted))`\n\nUsing the property of exponents `exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b)`:\n`F = exp( (-ΔE / (k * T_unspotted)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_spotted)) )`\n`F = exp( (ΔE / k) * (1 / T_spotted - 1 / T_unspotted) )`\n\n**5. Calculate the Energy Term (ΔE/k)**\nThe energy difference `ΔE` is related to the wavelength `λ` of the transition between the two levels by the formula `ΔE = h * c / λ`.\nWe can substitute this into our factor equation:\n`F = exp( (h * c / (λ * k)) * (1 / T_spotted - 1 / T_unspotted) )`\n\nWe are given:\n*   `λ = 1448 Å = 1448 * 10^-10` m\n*   `T_unspotted = 6000 K`\n*   `T_spotted = 5500 K`\n\nAnd we use the physical constants:\n*   `h` (Planck's constant) `≈ 6.626 * 10^-34 J·s`\n*   `c` (speed of light) `≈ 3.0 * 10^8 m/s`\n*   `k` (Boltzmann constant) `≈ 1.381 * 10^-23 J/K`\n\nLet's compute the value of the exponent using a Python script for accuracy.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Physical Constants\nh = 6.62607015e-34  # J·s (Planck's constant)\nc = 299792458      # m/s (speed of light)\nk = 1.380649e-23   # J/K (Boltzmann constant)\n\n# Given parameters\nlambda_A = 1448.0   # Angstrom\nlambda_m = lambda_A * 1e-10  # meters\n\nT_unspotted = 6000.0  # K\nT_spotted = 5500.0    # K\n\n# Calculate the exponent for the factor equation\n# exponent = (h * c / (lambda_m * k)) * (1/T_spotted - 1/T_unspotted)\nterm1 = (h * c) / (lambda_m * k)\nterm2 = (1 / T_spotted) - (1 / T_unspotted)\nexponent = term1 * term2\n\n# Calculate the final factor\nfactor = np.exp(exponent)\n\nprint(f\"{factor=}\")\n```\n[execution results]\nfactor=4.506509939527581\n[end of execution results]\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 4.51. This value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The user's question has already been answered. The provided thinking process and the code execution led to the final answer.\n\n**Recap of the reasoning:**\n\n1.  The problem asks for the factor by which the ratio of the populations of two energy levels of neutral Titanium (Ti) changes when a star goes from having spots to no spots. This factor `F` is `R_unspotted / R_spotted`.\n2.  The population ratio `R = N2/N1` is governed by the Boltzmann equation, since the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE): `R(T) = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE / (k*T))`.\n3.  The factor `F` can be expressed as:\n    `F = R(T_unspotted) / R(T_spotted)`\n    `F = exp( (ΔE/k) * (1/T_spotted - 1/T_unspotted) )`\n4.  The energy difference `ΔE` is related to the transition wavelength `λ` by `ΔE = hc/λ`. Substituting this into the equation for the factor gives:\n    `F = exp( (hc/(λk)) * (1/T_spotted - 1/T_unspotted) )`\n5.  The problem provides all the necessary values:\n    *   `T_unspotted = 6000 K`\n    *   `T_spotted = 5500 K`\n    *   `λ = 1448 Å = 1448 * 10^-10 m`\n6.  The Python code was used to accurately calculate the numerical value of this expression using the given values and standard physical constants (`h`, `c`, `k`).\n7.  The execution of the code yielded a result of `factor ≈ 4.51`.\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
