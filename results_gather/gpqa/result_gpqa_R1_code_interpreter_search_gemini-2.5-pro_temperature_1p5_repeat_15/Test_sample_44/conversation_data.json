    "*   **1. Understand the System:**\n    *   The system consists of four identical spin-1/2 particles.\n    *   Spin-1/2 particles are fermions.\n    *   Identical fermions are indistinguishable and must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n    *   The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n\n*   **2. Single-Particle Energy Levels:**\n    *   The energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well are given by the formula:\n        $E_n = n^2 * (\\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2})$\n    *   The problem defines the base energy unit as $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\n    *   Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as $E_n = n^2 E$, where n is a positive integer (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n\n*   **3. Apply the Pauli Exclusion Principle:**\n    *   The Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state.\n    *   For a particle in this well, a state is defined by its energy level (quantum number *n*) and its spin projection (spin up or spin down).\n    *   This means each energy level *E_n* can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n*   **4. Calculate the Ground State Energy:**\n    *   The ground state is the state with the lowest possible total energy. To achieve this, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up.\n    *   **Level n=1 (Energy E₁ = 1²E = 1E):** We can place two particles here (one spin up, one spin down). Their combined energy is 2 * E₁ = 2E.\n    *   **Level n=2 (Energy E₂ = 2²E = 4E):** We have two more particles to place. We put them in the next available level, n=2. Their combined energy is 2 * E₂ = 2 * 4E = 8E.\n    *   **Total Ground State Energy:** The sum of the energies of all four particles.\n        *   E_ground = (2 particles * E₁) + (2 particles * E₂) = 2E + 8E = **10E**.\n\n*   **5. Calculate the First Excited State Energy:**\n    *   The first excited state is the configuration with the next lowest total energy after the ground state. This is achieved by the smallest possible energy excitation from the ground state.\n    *   The lowest energy excitation involves moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (n=3).\n    *   The new configuration is:\n        *   **Level n=1:** 2 particles. Energy = 2 * E₁ = 2E.\n        *   **Level n=2:** 1 particle. Energy = 1 * E₂ = 4E.\n        *   **Level n=3:** 1 particle. Energy = 1 * E₃ = 1 * 3²E = 9E.\n    *   **Total First Excited State Energy:**\n        *   E_1st_excited = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**.\n\n*   **6. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy:**\n    *   The second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy after the first excited state. We must consider all possible excitations from the ground state and find the second smallest energy increase.\n    *   Let's analyze the possibilities for creating an excited state from the ground state (2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2):\n        *   **Possibility A:** Excite one particle from n=2 to n=3. Energy = 15E (This is the first excited state).\n        *   **Possibility B:** Excite one particle from n=1 to n=3. The configuration becomes: 1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3.\n            *   Total Energy = (1 * E₁) + (2 * E₂) + (1 * E₃) = (1 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n        *   **Possibility C:** Excite two particles from n=2 to n=3. The configuration becomes: 2 particles in n=1, 0 particles in n=2, 2 particles in n=3.\n            *   Total Energy = (2 * E₁) + (2 * E₃) = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n        *   **Possibility D:** Excite one particle from n=2 to n=4. The configuration becomes: 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=4.\n            *   Total Energy = (2 * E₁) + (1 * E₂) + (1 * E₄) = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n    *   Comparing the energies of these excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E,...), the lowest is 15E (first excited state) and the next lowest is 18E.\n    *   **Total Second Excited State Energy:** E_2nd_excited = **18E**.\n\n*   **7. Conclusion:**\n    *   Ground State Energy = **10E**\n    *   First Excited State Energy = **15E**\n    *   Second Excited State Energy = **18E**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
