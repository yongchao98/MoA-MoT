    "This problem requires a multi-step calculation involving buffer solutions and sequential acid dissociation equilibria.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species and their initial amounts.**\n    *   The solution contains potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4●2H2O) in a volume of 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.200 L).\n    *   KH2PO4 is a salt that dissociates completely in water to provide K⁺ and H₂PO₄⁻ ions. H₂PO₄⁻ is the dihydrogen phosphate ion, which acts as a weak acid.\n    *   Na2HPO4●2H2O is a hydrated salt that dissociates completely in water to provide 2 Na⁺ ions and HPO₄²⁻ ions (the water molecules become part of the solvent). HPO₄²⁻ is the hydrogen phosphate ion, which is the conjugate base of H₂PO₄⁻.\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the acid and its conjugate base.**\n    *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol.\n    *   Initial concentration of H₂PO₄⁻ = Moles of KH₂PO₄ / Volume in L.\n        [H₂PO₄⁻] = (1.00 / 136.09) mol / 0.200 L.\n    *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol.\n    *   Initial concentration of HPO₄²⁻ = Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O / Volume in L.\n        [HPO₄²⁻] = (1.00 / 177.99) mol / 0.200 L.\n\n3.  **Recognize the buffer system and determine the solution's acidity ([H⁺]).**\n    *   The solution contains a weak acid (H₂PO₄⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻). This forms a buffer solution.\n    *   The relevant equilibrium for this buffer is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄):\n        H₂PO₄⁻(aq) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + HPO₄²⁻(aq)\n    *   The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka₂ = 6.2 x 10⁻⁸.\n    *   We can use the equilibrium expression for Ka₂ to find the hydrogen ion concentration, [H⁺]:\n        Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    *   Rearranging to solve for [H⁺]:\n        [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    *   Since the dissociation and association of the buffer components are minimal, we can approximate the equilibrium concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ with their initial concentrations.\n\n4.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) concentration.**\n    *   The orthophosphate ion, PO₄³⁻, is formed from the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion, HPO₄²⁻:\n        HPO₄²⁻(aq) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + PO₄³⁻(aq)\n    *   The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka₃ = 1.8 x 10⁻¹².\n    *   The equilibrium expression is:\n        Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   We can rearrange this equation to solve for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, [PO₄³⁻]:\n        [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    *   Here, [H⁺] is the value determined by the buffer equilibrium (Step 3), and [HPO₄²⁻] is the concentration of the hydrogen phosphate ion, which we can approximate as its initial concentration because the amount that dissociates further is negligible (due to the very small Ka₃ value).\n\n5.  **Combine the steps and compute the final value.**\n    *   We can substitute the expression for [H⁺] from Step 3 into the equation for [PO₄³⁻] from Step 4. However, it's computationally clearer to calculate [H⁺] first and then use it to find [PO₄³⁻].\n    *   Let's execute the calculations using a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\n# Constants and given values\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # g\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume_L = 0.200  # L\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate initial concentrations of the buffer components\nmoles_H2PO4_minus = mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4\nconc_H2PO4_minus = moles_H2PO4_minus / volume_L\n\nmoles_HPO4_2minus = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\nconc_HPO4_2minus = moles_HPO4_2minus / volume_L\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] from the buffer equilibrium (Ka2)\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\nconc_H_plus = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4_minus / conc_HPO4_2minus)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-] from the Ka3 equilibrium\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\nconc_PO4_3minus = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4_2minus / conc_H_plus)\n\n# Print the final result in scientific notation\nprint(f\"{conc_PO4_3minus:.2e}\")\n```\n<execute_code>\n6.24e-07\n</execute_code>\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) is 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical System**\n\n*   The solution contains two salts: potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH₂PO₄) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O).\n*   When dissolved in water, these salts dissociate completely:\n    *   KH₂PO₄(s) → K⁺(aq) + H₂PO₄⁻(aq)\n    *   Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O(s) → 2Na⁺(aq) + HPO₄²⁻(aq) + 2H₂O(l)\n*   The key species are the dihydrogen phosphate ion (H₂PO₄⁻) and the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻). These form a conjugate acid-base pair.\n\n**2. Identify the Relevant Equilibria**\n\nPhosphoric acid (H₃PO₄) is a triprotic acid with three dissociation steps:\n1.  H₃PO₄ ⇌ H⁺ + H₂PO₄⁻ (Ka₁)\n2.  **H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻ (Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸)**\n3.  **HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻ (Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹²)**\n\n*   The mixture of H₂PO₄⁻ (a weak acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (its conjugate base) creates a buffer solution. The pH (and thus the [H⁺]) of this solution is primarily determined by the second equilibrium (Ka₂).\n*   The ion we want to find, the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻), is produced in the third equilibrium (Ka₃). Its concentration will depend on the concentration of HPO₄²⁻ and the [H⁺] established by the buffer.\n\n**3. Calculate the Initial Molar Concentrations**\n\nFirst, we need to find the initial concentrations of the buffer components, H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻.\n\n*   **Moles of KH₂PO₄ (source of H₂PO₄⁻):**\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol\n\n*   **Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O (source of HPO₄²⁻):**\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol\n\n*   **Volume of the solution:**\n    *   Volume = 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L\n\n*   **Concentrations:**\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = (1.00 / 136.09) mol / 0.200 L\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = (1.00 / 177.99) mol / 0.200 L\n\n**4. Calculate the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]**\n\nWe use the equilibrium expression for Ka₂ to find [H⁺].\n\n*   Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n*   Rearranging for [H⁺]: [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n\nWe can use the initial concentrations calculated in Step 3 as a very good approximation for the equilibrium concentrations.\n\n**5. Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion [PO₄³⁻] Concentration**\n\nNow we use the equilibrium expression for Ka₃.\n\n*   Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n*   Rearranging for [PO₄³⁻]: [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n\nWe will use the [H⁺] value calculated in Step 4 and the initial concentration of [HPO₄²⁻].\n\n**6. Numerical Calculation**\n\nLet's use a Python script to perform these calculations accurately.\n\n```python\n# Given constants and values\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # g\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99  # g/mol\nvolume_L = 0.200  # L\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the initial concentrations of the buffer components\nmoles_H2PO4_minus = mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4\nconc_H2PO4_minus = moles_H2PO4_minus / volume_L\n\nmoles_HPO4_2minus = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\nconc_HPO4_2minus = moles_HPO4_2minus / volume_L\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] from the buffer equilibrium (Ka2)\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\nconc_H_plus = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4_minus / conc_HPO4_2minus)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-] from the Ka3 equilibrium\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\nconc_PO4_3minus = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4_2minus / conc_H_plus)\n\n# Print the final result in scientific notation to compare with the options\nprint(f\"{conc_PO4_3minus:.2e}\")\n\n```\n<execute_code>\n6.24e-07\n</execute_code>\nThe calculation shows that the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, [PO₄³⁻], is 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nComparing this result to the provided options:\nA) 5.48x10⁻⁷ M\nB) 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\nC) 3.97x10⁻⁷ M\nD) 2.81x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
