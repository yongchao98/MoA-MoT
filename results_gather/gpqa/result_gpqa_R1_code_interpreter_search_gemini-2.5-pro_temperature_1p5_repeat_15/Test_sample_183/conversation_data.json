    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's first establish the structure and substitution pattern based on IUPAC nomenclature rules. The substituent priority for numbering is: -OCH2CH3 (ethoxy) > -C(CH3)3 (tert-butyl). Thus, the correct IUPAC name is **1-ethoxy-2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThe substitution pattern is as follows:\n*   Ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1\n*   tert-Butyl group (-tBu) at C2\n*   Nitro group (-NO2) at C3\n\nThis means all three substituents are on adjacent carbons. Let's analyze their relative positions:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are **meta** to each other.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents\n\nUnderstanding the directing effects in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS) is crucial for planning the synthesis:\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy):** Strongly activating, ortho, para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-Butyl):** Weakly activating, ortho, para-director. It is very bulky and sterically hinders the ortho positions.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nThe meta relationship between the activating -OEt group and the deactivating -NO2 group is a key feature. This substitution pattern is difficult to achieve directly because activating groups (like -OEt) direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions, not the meta position. This suggests a more complex strategy is required, possibly involving a protecting/blocking group or a group that changes its directing effect during the synthesis.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences\n\nLet's analyze each option methodically.\n\n**Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...**\n1.  **i) HNO3/H2SO4:** Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n2.  **ii) Fe/HCl:** Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n3.  **iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction fails. The amino group (-NH2) is a strong Lewis base that reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), forming a complex that deactivates the ring towards electrophilic substitution.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option C is incorrect.**\n\n**Let's analyze the options starting with the introduction of the tert-butyl group.**\n\n**Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ...**\n1.  **i) t-BuCl/AlCl3:** Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene.\n2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The -tBu group is an o,p-director, but due to its bulkiness, the major product is the para isomer, **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene**. The ortho isomer is the minor product. A \"high-yield\" synthesis would avoid relying on a minor product.\n3.  **iii) SO3/H2SO4:** Sulfonation of 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene. The -tBu group (o,p-director) and the -NO2 group (m-director) both direct the incoming -SO3H group to the position ortho to -tBu and meta to -NO2. This gives **2-tert-butyl-5-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n4.  **iv) NaNO2/HCl:** Diazotization. This reagent is used to convert a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) into a diazonium salt (-N2+). There is no amine group present in the molecule at this stage.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option B is chemically incorrect.**\n\n**Option D: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\nThis option outlines a logical, multi-step synthesis. Let's trace it.\n1.  **i) t-BuCl/AlCl3:** Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** tert-Butylbenzene → **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene** (major product).\n3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** Reduction of the nitro group → **4-tert-butylaniline**.\n4.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of 4-tert-butylaniline. In strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a **meta-director**. The -tBu group is an o,p-director. The -NH3+ (at C1) directs to C3/C5. The -tBu (at C4) directs to C3/C5. The directing effects are cooperative, leading to a high yield of **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**.\n5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** Diazotization of the amine → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenediazonium salt**.\n6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** Williamson ether synthesis → **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThis sequence is a classic, high-yield pathway. However, the final product is **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, which is an isomer of the target molecule. The remaining steps, viii) `SO3/H2SO4` and ix) `dilute H2SO4`, would sulfonate and then desulfonate the ring, ultimately having no net effect and being superfluous. Given the significant flaws in other options, it is highly probable that there is an error in the name of the target molecule in the question, and this well-designed synthesis is the intended answer.\n\n**Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\nThis sequence uses a blocking group strategy.\n1.  **i) t-BuCl/AlCl3:** Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n2.  **ii) SO3/H2SO4:** Sulfonation. The bulky -tBu group directs the sulfonation to the para position → **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n3.  **iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration. -tBu (o,p) and -SO3H (m) both direct the nitro group to the position ortho to -tBu → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n4.  **iv) Fe/HCl:** Reduction of the nitro group → **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** Diazotization → **4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniobenzenesulfonate**.\n\nAt this point, we have substituents at positions 1(-SO3-), 2(N2+), and 4(-tBu). To reach the target, we need a 1,2,3 pattern and different groups. The remaining steps are: vi) `HNO3/H2SO4`, vii) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`, viii) `dilute H2SO4`, ix) `NaOH/EtBr`. Step (vi) `HNO3/H2SO4` is particularly out of place after diazotization and before the diazonium group has been replaced. If we were to replace the N2+ with OH (step vii) and then remove the SO3H group (step viii), we would form **3-tert-butylphenol**. Nitrating this phenol does not yield the required 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol precursor. Therefore, this pathway fails to produce the desired product.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\n*   **Option C** fails because Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline is not feasible.\n*   **Option B** fails because it calls for diazotization without an amine present.\n*   **Option A** involves a plausible blocking group strategy initially, but the subsequent steps are incorrectly ordered or do not lead to the desired regiochemistry.\n*   **Option D** outlines a chemically sound, high-yield synthesis for an isomer of the target molecule (1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene). The core sequence (i-vii) is textbook organic synthesis.\n\nGiven that options A, B, and C have clear chemical flaws, Option D represents the most viable and logical sequence of reactions, strongly suggesting the question intended a different isomer as the target. Therefore, it is the best possible answer among the choices.\n\n<<<D>>>"
