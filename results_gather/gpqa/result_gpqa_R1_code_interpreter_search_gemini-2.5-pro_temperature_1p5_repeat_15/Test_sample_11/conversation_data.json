    "*   **1. Principle of Conservation**\n    This problem involves a particle decay, which is governed by the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n    The decay is: `Pi(+) -> mu(+) + nu`\n    The Pi(+) meson is initially at rest.\n\n*   **2. Conservation of Momentum**\n    *   Initial momentum of the system (the stationary Pi(+) meson) is zero.\n    *   According to the conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero.\n    *   The final state has two particles, the muon (mu+) and the neutrino (nu). For their total momentum to be zero, they must travel in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n    *   Let `p` be the magnitude of the momentum of both the muon and the neutrino.\n        *   `p_mu = p`\n        *   `p_nu = p`\n\n*   **3. Conservation of Energy**\n    *   The total initial energy is the rest mass energy of the stationary Pi(+) meson.\n        *   `E_initial = m_pi * c^2`\n    *   The total final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n        *   `E_final = E_mu + E_nu`\n    *   The total energy of a particle is given by the relativistic formula: `E = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2)`.\n    *   Therefore:\n        *   `E_mu = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2)`\n        *   For the neutrino, we assume its rest mass is zero (`m_nu = 0`). So, its energy is `E_nu = sqrt((p*c)^2 + 0) = p*c`.\n    *   Applying the conservation of energy:\n        *   `m_pi * c^2 = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2) + p*c`\n\n*   **4. Solving for Momentum and Energy**\n    We need to solve the energy conservation equation for `p*c`.\n    1.  Rearrange the equation: `m_pi * c^2 - p*c = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2)`\n    2.  Square both sides: `(m_pi * c^2 - p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n    3.  Expand the left side: `(m_pi * c^2)^2 - 2 * (m_pi * c^2) * (p*c) + (p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n    4.  The `(p*c)^2` terms on both sides cancel out: `(m_pi * c^2)^2 - 2 * (m_pi * c^2) * (p*c) = (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n    5.  Solve for `p*c`: `p*c = [(m_pi * c^2)^2 - (m_mu * c^2)^2] / [2 * m_pi * c^2]`\n\n*   **5. Calculation**\n    Now, let's plug in the given values:\n    *   `m_pi * c^2 = 139.6 MeV`\n    *   `m_mu * c^2 = 105.7 MeV`\n\n    We can use a short Python script to perform the calculation accurately.\n\n```python\n# Given rest mass energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7\n\n# Calculate p*c using the derived formula\npc = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# The kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_nu) is equal to its total energy, pc\nKE_nu = pc\n\n# The total energy released in the decay is Q = m_pi*c^2 - m_mu*c^2\n# This energy is shared as kinetic energy between the products.\n# Q = KE_mu + KE_nu\n# So, KE_mu = Q - KE_nu = (m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2) - KE_nu\nKE_mu = (m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2) - KE_nu\n\nprint(f\"Kinetic Energy of Muon (KE_mu): {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Kinetic Energy of Neutrino (KE_nu): {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\nKinetic Energy of Muon (KE_mu): 4.12 MeV\nKinetic Energy of Neutrino (KE_nu): 29.78 MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon (mu+) and 29.8 MeV (rounding 29.78) for the neutrino (nu).\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nB) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nC) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nD) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The user wants to find the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay of a stationary pion.\n\n1.  **Identify the process:** The decay is `Pi(+) -> mu(+) + nu`. The initial particle `Pi(+)` is at rest.\n2.  **Conservation Laws:** This problem is governed by the conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n3.  **Given Values:**\n    *   Rest mass of `Pi(+)` (`m_pi`): `m_pi * c^2 = 139.6 MeV`\n    *   Rest mass of `mu(+)` (`m_mu`): `m_mu * c^2 = 105.7 MeV`\n    *   The neutrino (`nu`) is assumed to be massless, so its rest mass `m_nu * c^2 = 0 MeV`.\n\n4.  **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   Initial momentum `p_initial = 0` since the pion is at rest.\n    *   Final momentum `p_final = p_mu + p_nu`.\n    *   By conservation, `p_initial = p_final`, so `0 = p_mu + p_nu`.\n    *   This implies that the muon (`mu+`) and the neutrino (`nu`) must move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let this magnitude be `p`.\n        *   `|p_mu| = |p_nu| = p`\n\n5.  **Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   Initial energy `E_initial` is the rest energy of the pion: `E_initial = m_pi * c^2`.\n    *   Final energy `E_final` is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino: `E_final = E_mu + E_nu`.\n    *   The total energy of a particle is given by `E = sqrt((pc)^2 + (m*c^2)^2)`.\n    *   So, `E_mu = sqrt((pc)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2)`\n    *   And `E_nu = sqrt((pc)^2 + (m_nu * c^2)^2) = sqrt((pc)^2 + 0) = pc`.\n    *   By conservation, `E_initial = E_final`:\n        *   `m_pi * c^2 = sqrt((pc)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2) + pc`\n\n6.  **Solve for `pc` (momentum-energy term):**\n    *   Rearrange the equation: `m_pi * c^2 - pc = sqrt((pc)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2)`\n    *   Square both sides: `(m_pi * c^2 - pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n    *   Expand the left side: `(m_pi * c^2)^2 - 2 * (m_pi * c^2) * pc + (pc)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n    *   Cancel the `(pc)^2` term: `(m_pi * c^2)^2 - 2 * (m_pi * c^2) * pc = (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n    *   Isolate `pc`: `pc = [(m_pi * c^2)^2 - (m_mu * c^2)^2] / [2 * m_pi * c^2]`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Kinetic Energies:**\n    *   **Neutrino's Kinetic Energy (`KE_nu`):** Since the neutrino is massless, its total energy is its kinetic energy. `KE_nu = E_nu = pc`. We can calculate this using the formula derived above.\n    *   **Muon's Kinetic Energy (`KE_mu`):** The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest energy: `KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu * c^2`. We also know from energy conservation that the total energy released (Q-value) is converted into the kinetic energy of the products: `Q = KE_mu + KE_nu`. The Q-value is the difference in rest mass energies: `Q = m_pi * c^2 - m_mu * c^2`.\n        *   Therefore, `KE_mu = (m_pi * c^2 - m_mu * c^2) - KE_nu`.\n\n8.  **Numerical Calculation:** The Python code has already performed this calculation.\n    *   `m_pi_c2 = 139.6` MeV\n    *   `m_mu_c2 = 105.7` MeV\n    *   From the code output:\n        *   `pc` (which is `KE_nu`) = 29.78 MeV â‰ˆ 29.8 MeV\n        *   `KE_mu` = 4.12 MeV\n\n9.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated values are:\n    *   `KE_mu` = 4.12 MeV\n    *   `KE_nu` = 29.8 MeV\n\n    This matches option B.\n\nFinal check of the calculation in the code:\n`pc = (139.6**2 - 105.7**2) / (2 * 139.6)`\n`pc = (19488.16 - 11172.49) / 279.2`\n`pc = 8315.67 / 279.2`\n`pc = 29.7839...`  So `KE_nu = 29.8 MeV`.\n\n`KE_mu = (139.6 - 105.7) - 29.78`\n`KE_mu = 33.9 - 29.78`\n`KE_mu = 4.12` MeV.\nThe calculations are correct.\n\nFinal answer corresponds to the calculated values. Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Principle of Conservation:** The decay of the pion `Pi(+)` into a muon `mu(+)` and a neutrino `nu` must obey the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. The decay is represented as:\n    `Pi(+) -> mu(+) + nu`\n\n2.  **Initial State:** The problem states that the pion `Pi(+)` is stationary. This means its initial momentum is zero, and its initial energy is its rest mass energy.\n    *   Initial Momentum (`p_initial`): 0\n    *   Initial Energy (`E_initial`): `m_pi * c^2 = 139.6 MeV`\n\n3.  **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial momentum is zero, the total final momentum of the products (muon and neutrino) must also be zero. For this to happen, the muon and neutrino must travel in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let this magnitude of momentum be `p`.\n    *   `p_mu = p`\n    *   `p_nu = p`\n\n4.  **Conservation of Energy:** The total initial energy must equal the total final energy. The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n    *   `E_initial = E_final`\n    *   `m_pi * c^2 = E_mu + E_nu`\n\n5.  **Relativistic Energy:** The total energy `E` of a particle is given by the relativistic formula: `E = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2)`, where `p` is momentum, `m` is rest mass, and `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   For the muon (`mu+`): `E_mu = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2)`\n    *   For the neutrino (`nu`), we assume its rest mass is zero (`m_nu = 0`). Therefore, its energy is: `E_nu = sqrt((p*c)^2 + 0) = p*c`.\n\n6.  **Solving for Momentum and Energy:** Now substitute the energy expressions back into the energy conservation equation:\n    *   `m_pi * c^2 = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2) + p*c`\n\n    We need to solve this equation for `p*c`, which represents the energy of the neutrino.\n    *   Rearrange the equation: `m_pi * c^2 - p*c = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2)`\n    *   Square both sides: `(m_pi * c^2 - p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n    *   Expand the left side: `(m_pi * c^2)^2 - 2 * (m_pi * c^2) * (p*c) + (p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n    *   The `(p*c)^2` terms on both sides cancel out: `(m_pi * c^2)^2 - 2 * (m_pi * c^2) * (p*c) = (m_mu * c^2)^2`\n    *   Solve for `p*c`: `p*c = [(m_pi * c^2)^2 - (m_mu * c^2)^2] / [2 * m_pi * c^2]`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Kinetic Energies (KE):**\n    *   **KE of Neutrino:** Since the neutrino is massless, its total energy is purely kinetic.\n        `KE_nu = E_nu = p*c`\n        `KE_nu = [(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2] / [2 * 139.6]`\n        `KE_nu = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / 279.2`\n        `KE_nu = 8315.67 / 279.2 = 29.78 MeV`\n        Rounding to one decimal place gives **29.8 MeV**.\n\n    *   **KE of Muon:** The total energy released in the decay (Q-value) is shared as kinetic energy between the products.\n        `Q = KE_mu + KE_nu`\n        The Q-value is the initial rest energy minus the final rest energies:\n        `Q = (m_pi * c^2) - (m_mu * c^2 + m_nu * c^2) = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV`\n        Now find the muon's kinetic energy:\n        `KE_mu = Q - KE_nu`\n        `KE_mu = 33.9 - 29.78 = 4.12 MeV`\n        So, `KE_mu` is **4.12 MeV**.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The kinetic energies of the product particles are 4.12 MeV for the muon (`mu+`) and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino (`nu`). This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
