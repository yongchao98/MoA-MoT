    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the Functional Groups from the 1H NMR Data.**\n    *   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** A singlet integrating to 3 protons around 2.1 ppm is highly characteristic of the protons of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl, specifically an acetate group (CH₃-C(=O)-O-). All four possible options are acetates, so this fits.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (1H, d) and 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** These signals are in the vinylic region (4.5-7.5 ppm), indicating two protons on a carbon-carbon double bond (-CH=CH-). The integration (1H each) confirms this.\n    *   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** A doublet integrating to 3 protons suggests a methyl group (CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (-CH-).\n\n*   **Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Compare with Options.**\n    *   We have an acetate group (CH₃COO-), a double bond with two protons (-CH=CH-), and a methyl group attached to the double bond (CH₃-CH=).\n    *   Putting these together gives the structure of propenyl acetate: CH₃-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   Let's check the options.\n        *   **Propenyl acetate (A and D):** This structure fits the fragments we identified.\n        *   **Butenyl acetate (B and C):** Let's assume the most likely isomer, but-2-enyl acetate: CH₃-CH=CH-CH₂-O-C(=O)-CH₃. This structure contains a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to the oxygen. A signal for this group (typically a doublet around 4.5 ppm) is absent from the provided data. Therefore, we can eliminate the butenyl acetate options (B and C).\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans).**\n    *   The choice is now between Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. The key to differentiating between them is the coupling constant (J-value) between the two vinylic protons.\n    *   The data provides a signal at **7.0 ppm** which is a doublet with **J = 16.0 Hz**. This J-value represents the coupling between the two protons on the double bond.\n    *   **Rule of thumb for vinylic coupling constants:**\n        *   **³J_trans (protons are trans to each other):** Typically large, in the range of 12-18 Hz.\n        *   **³J_cis (protons are cis to each other):** Typically smaller, in the range of 6-12 Hz.\n    *   The observed coupling constant of **16.0 Hz** falls squarely in the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n*   **Step 4: Final Conclusion.**\n    *   The structure is propenyl acetate.\n    *   The J-value of 16.0 Hz indicates a trans double bond.\n    *   Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\nLet's briefly confirm the splitting patterns for Trans-propenyl acetate:\n*   `CH₃(c)-CH(b)=CH(a)-O-C(=O)-CH₃(d)`\n*   **H(a) at ~7.0 ppm:** Coupled to H(b), appears as a doublet (d). The J value is 16.0 Hz. This matches.\n*   **H(b) at ~5.5 ppm:** Coupled to H(a) (makes it a doublet) and the three H(c) protons (makes it a quartet). The overall pattern is a doublet of quartets (dq). This matches.\n*   **H(c) at ~1.6 ppm:** Coupled to H(b), appears as a doublet (d). This matches.\n*   **H(d) at ~2.1 ppm:** No adjacent protons, appears as a singlet (s). This matches.\nAll data points are consistent with Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<D>>>"
