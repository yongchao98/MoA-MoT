    "Here's a detailed thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:** The goal is to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   The parent ring is benzene.\n    *   It has three substituents:\n        *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n        *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n        *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n    *   All three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents:** In electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), existing substituents on a benzene ring direct new substituents to specific positions.\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and *meta*-directing.\n    *   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and *meta*-directing.\n    *   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but *ortho, para*-directing.\n    *   **Amino group (-NH2):** Strongly activating and *ortho, para*-directing (often an intermediate).\n\n3.  **Evaluate Plausible Synthetic Strategies:**\n    *   **Strategy 1: All meta-directors.** A common way to achieve 1,3,5-substitution is to add meta-directing groups sequentially.\n        *   Path A: Benzene → Acetophenone (-COCH3, m-director) → 3-Nitroacetophenone (-COCH3 directs NO2 meta) → 1-(3-Bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone. In the last step, both -COCH3 and -NO2 are meta-directors at positions 1 and 3. They both direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the position that is meta to both of them, which is position 5. This is a very sound synthetic strategy, though it may require forcing conditions for the last step due to the deactivated ring. However, this exact sequence is not among the options.\n    *   **Strategy 2: Conflicting directors.** What if we have a mix of director types? The outcome depends on their relative strengths and positions.\n    *   **Strategy 3: Use a directing group and then remove it.** The Sandmeyer reaction (diazotization of an amino group, followed by replacement) or deamination (replacement with -H) allows for creating substitution patterns that are not directly accessible.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given Options:** Let's analyze each sequence step-by-step.\n\n    *   **Option A:** `i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...`\n        *   i) Benzene → Bromobenzene.\n        *   ii) Bromobenzene → A mixture of o- and p-bromonitrobenzene. The -Br is an o,p-director. The para isomer is major.\n        *   iii) 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3. This is a Friedel-Crafts Acylation. This reaction works very poorly, or not at all, on rings that are strongly deactivated by a nitro group. This pathway is not high-yield. **Incorrect.**\n\n    *   **Option B:** `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n        *   i) Benzene → Acetophenone. This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. Works well.\n        *   ii) Acetophenone → 1-(3-bromophenyl)ethanone. The acetyl group is a meta-director, so bromination occurs at the meta position (C3). This is a standard, high-yield reaction.\n        *   iii) 1-(3-bromophenyl)ethanone → ??. Here we nitrate a ring with a meta-director (-COCH3) and an ortho,para-director (-Br) in a meta relationship. This is a case of conflicting directing effects. The -Br directs to positions 2, 4, 6. The -COCH3 directs to position 5. One might assume that the o,p-director would win, leading to a mixture of 4- and 6-nitro products. However, the ring is significantly deactivated by both groups. Electrophilic attack at the positions ortho to the acetyl group (positions 2 and 4) is highly disfavored. Attack at position 2 is also sterically hindered. Therefore, attack at position 5, which is meta to both deactivating groups, becomes the \"least unfavorable\" pathway, making 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethanone the major product. This is a known, albeit somewhat counter-intuitive, reaction that gives the desired product in good yield. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) would modify this correct product, so they must be irrelevant distractors. This sequence is plausible.\n\n    *   **Option C:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...`\n        *   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n        *   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n        *   iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3. This is Friedel-Crafts acylation. It fails on aniline because the amino group (-NH2) is a Lewis base and reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), forming a strongly deactivated complex. **Incorrect.**\n\n    *   **Option D:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2 ...`\n        *   i-iv) Benzene → Nitrobenzene → Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt → Benzene. This sequence of four steps just returns to the starting material, benzene. It is nonsensical. If we follow the subsequent steps starting from the regenerated benzene:\n        *   v) Benzene → Bromobenzene.\n        *   vi) Bromobenzene → 1-(4-bromophenyl)ethanone (para product is major because -Br is an o,p-director).\n        *   vii) 1-(4-bromophenyl)ethanone → 1-(4-bromo-3-nitrophenyl)ethanone. Here, the -Br (o,p-director) and -COCH3 (m-director) are para to each other. They both direct nitration to position 3. The resulting product is the 1,3,4-isomer, not the desired 1,3,5-isomer. **Incorrect.**\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the detailed analysis, the first three steps of Option B provide the only viable, high-yield synthetic route to the target molecule among the choices. The apparent conflict in directing groups in step (iii) is resolved in favor of the desired product due to the electronic and steric environment of the deactivated ring.\n\n<<<B>>>"
