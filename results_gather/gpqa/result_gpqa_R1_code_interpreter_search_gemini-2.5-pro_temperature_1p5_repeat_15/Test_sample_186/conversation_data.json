    "To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the listed stars are bright enough to be detected by the ESPRESSO spectrograph on a single 8m VLT telescope with a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 in a 1-hour exposure.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the limiting apparent magnitude for ESPRESSO\n\nThe first step is to find the faintest apparent V magnitude (m_V) a star can have and still meet the detection criteria (S/N ≥ 10 in 1 hour). We can use the ESPRESSO Exposure Time Calculator (ETC) for this. Based on typical ETC results for an instrument like ESPRESSO on an 8.2m telescope, for a 1-hour (3600s) exposure, an S/N of 10 is achieved for a star with an apparent V magnitude of approximately **m_V ≈ 16.5**.\n\nThis means any star with an apparent V magnitude (m_V) less than or equal to 16.5 will be detectable. Stars with m_V > 16.5 will not be detectable under the specified conditions.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the apparent V magnitude (m_V) for each star\n\nNow, we need to find the m_V for each listed star. A star is detectable if m_V ≤ 16.5.\n\n**a) Canopus:**\nCanopus is one of the brightest stars in the night sky. Its apparent V magnitude is approximately **m_V = -0.74**.\nSince -0.74 ≤ 16.5, **Canopus is detectable.**\n\n**b) Polaris:**\nPolaris, the North Star, is also a bright star. Its apparent V magnitude is approximately **m_V = +1.98**.\nSince 1.98 ≤ 16.5, **Polaris is detectable.**\n*(Note: Polaris is at a declination of +89 degrees, making it unobservable from Paranal Observatory in Chile, which is at a latitude of -24.6 degrees. However, the question asks if it would be detectable, which is a question of brightness, not observability. Assuming the question is about the star's intrinsic properties and instrument capability, we proceed.)*\n\n**For stars (c) through (f), we must first calculate their apparent magnitude (m_V) from their absolute magnitude (M_V) and distance (d).**\nThe relationship is given by the distance modulus formula:\nm_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5\nWhere M_V = 15 and d is given in parsecs (pc).\n\n**c) Star at 10 pc:**\nm_V = 15 + 5 * log10(10) - 5\nm_V = 15 + 5 * 1 - 5\nm_V = 15\nSince 15 ≤ 16.5, this **star is detectable.**\n\n**d) Star at 200 pc:**\nm_V = 15 + 5 * log10(200) - 5\nm_V = 15 + 5 * (2.301) - 5\nm_V = 15 + 11.505 - 5\nm_V = 21.505\nSince 21.505 > 16.5, this **star is NOT detectable.**\n\n**e) Star at 5 pc:**\nm_V = 15 + 5 * log10(5) - 5\nm_V = 15 + 5 * (0.699) - 5\nm_V = 15 + 3.495 - 5\nm_V = 13.495\nSince 13.495 ≤ 16.5, this **star is detectable.**\n\n**f) Star at 50 pc:**\nm_V = 15 + 5 * log10(50) - 5\nm_V = 15 + 5 * (1.699) - 5\nm_V = 15 + 8.495 - 5\nm_V = 18.495\nSince 18.495 > 16.5, this **star is NOT detectable.**\n\n### Step 3: Count the number of detectable stars\n\nLet's summarize our findings:\n*   a) Canopus (m_V = -0.74): **Detectable**\n*   b) Polaris (m_V = 1.98): **Detectable**\n*   c) Star at 10 pc (m_V = 15.0): **Detectable**\n*   d) Star at 200 pc (m_V = 21.5): Not Detectable\n*   e) Star at 5 pc (m_V = 13.5): **Detectable**\n*   f) Star at 50 pc (m_V = 18.5): Not Detectable\n\nThe detectable stars are (a), (b), (c), and (e). This gives a total of 4 detectable stars.\n\n<<<C>>>"
