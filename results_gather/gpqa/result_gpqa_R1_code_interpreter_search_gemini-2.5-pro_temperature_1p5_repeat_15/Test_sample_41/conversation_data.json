    "An elegant problem-solving strategy involves breaking down a problem into smaller, manageable parts. Here, we'll first determine the relationship between the orbital distances of the planets using the provided temperature data. Then, with these distances, we'll apply Kepler's Third Law to find the ratio of their orbital periods.\n\n**Step 1: Relating Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet orbiting a star is given by the formula:\n\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n*   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (the orbital distance for a circular orbit).\n*   $A$ is the planet's bond albedo.\n\nFor any two planets orbiting the same star, the terms $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constant. The problem states that the albedo ($A$) is the same for all three planets. Therefore, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between two planets (say, Planet i and Planet j) simplifies to:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,i}}{T_{eq,j}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_i} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_j} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}} = \\left( \\frac{a_j}{a_i} \\right)^{1/2}$\n\nThis can be rearranged to find the ratio of their orbital distances:\n\n$\\frac{a_j}{a_i} = \\left( \\frac{T_{eq,i}}{T_{eq,j}} \\right)^2$\n\n**Step 2: Calculating the Ratios of Orbital Distances**\n\nUsing the formula from Step 1 and the given temperature ratios:\n\n*   Ratio for Planet 1 and Planet 2:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left( \\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} \\right)^2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96$\n\n*   Ratio for Planet 2 and Planet 3:\n    $\\frac{a_3}{a_2} = \\left( \\frac{T_{eq,2}}{T_{eq,3}} \\right)^2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29$\n\nTo find the ratio of the orbital distance of Planet 3 to Planet 1 ($a_3/a_1$), we multiply the two ratios we just found:\n\n$\\frac{a_3}{a_1} = \\frac{a_3}{a_2} \\times \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = 5.29 \\times 1.96 = 10.3684$\n\n**Step 3: Applying Kepler's Third Law**\n\nKepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of the orbital period ($P$) of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis ($a$) of its orbit, provided the planets orbit the same central star.\n\n$P^2 \\propto a^3$\n\nFor two planets (i and j) orbiting the same star:\n\n$\\left( \\frac{P_j}{P_i} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{a_j}{a_i} \\right)^3$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides gives:\n\n$\\frac{P_j}{P_i} = \\left( \\frac{a_j}{a_i} \\right)^{3/2}$\n\n**Step 4: Calculating the Final Period Ratio**\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the orbital period of Planet 3 to that of Planet 1 ($P_3/P_1$). Using the formula from Step 3 and the result from Step 2:\n\n$\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{a_3}{a_1} \\right)^{3/2} = (10.3684)^{3/2}$\n\nThis calculation can be performed precisely with a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given ratios of equilibrium temperatures\nT1_div_T2 = 1.4\nT2_div_T3 = 2.3\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes a2/a1\na2_div_a1 = T1_div_T2**2\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes a3/a2\na3_div_a2 = T2_div_T3**2\n\n# Calculate the overall ratio of semi-major axes a3/a1\na3_div_a1 = a3_div_a2 * a2_div_a1\n\n# Apply Kepler's Third Law to find the ratio of orbital periods P3/P1\n# (P3/P1)^2 = (a3/a1)^3  =>  P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2)\nP3_div_P1 = a3_div_a1**(3/2)\n\nprint(f\"{P3_div_P1:.1f}\")\n```\n>>>\n33.4\n\nThe result shows that the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of approximately 33.4. The information about the planet masses and the TTV discovery method is extraneous and not needed for this calculation, as the mass of the planets is considered negligible compared to the star's mass in the standard application of Kepler's Third Law.\n\n<<<D>>>",
