    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Products and Reactions**\n\n*   **Reaction 1 Product:** (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered ring lactone (a delta-lactone) with a single chiral center at position 4, which has an (R) configuration.\n*   **Reaction 2 Product:** (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is the enantiomer of the first product, with an (S) configuration at the chiral center.\n*   **Lactone Formation:** Lactones are formed by the intramolecular esterification of a hydroxy acid. To form a six-membered ring lactone, the precursor must be a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid (or a derivative like a 5-hydroxy ester).\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\nAll options provided are stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". Let's determine the structure from this name.\n*   The parent chain is a pentanoic acid derivative with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at one end.\n*   At the other end (position 5), there is an \"isobutoxy-oxo\" group, which describes an isobutyl ester group: -C(=O)O-iBu.\n*   There is an ethyl group at position 3.\n*   The structure is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid).\n\nLet's draw the structure:\nHOOC(1) - CH₂(2) - CH(Et)(3) - CH₂(4) - C(=O)O-iBu(5)\n\nThis molecule has a single chiral center at carbon 3, which is specified as either (R) or (S) in the options.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reagents and Reaction Pathways**\n\nThis problem hinges on the chemoselectivity of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃.\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This reagent is a moderately strong reducing agent. It readily reduces esters, aldehydes, and ketones. It reduces carboxylic acids much more slowly. Therefore, in a molecule containing both an ester and a carboxylic acid, LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the **ester group**.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent is highly selective for reducing **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols, and it typically does not reduce esters under the same conditions.\n\nNow, let's trace the two reaction pathways.\n\n**Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ → (R)-lactone**\n\n1.  **Starting Material (A):** (R/S)-HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu\n2.  **Reduction:** LiBH₄ selectively reduces the ester group (-COOiBu) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    (R/S)-HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu  + LiBH₄  →  (R/S)-HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n    The intermediate is (R/S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n3.  **Lactonization:** The H⁺ workup protonates the intermediates and catalyzes the intramolecular esterification. The hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid group at C1 to form a six-membered ring.\n4.  **Stereochemistry:** The reactions (reduction and cyclization) do not occur at the chiral center (C3 of the starting material, which becomes C4 of the lactone). Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained.\n5.  **Conclusion:** To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n    So, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Reaction 2: B + BH₃ → (S)-lactone**\n\n1.  **Starting Material (B):** (R/S)-HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu\n2.  **Reduction:** BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    (R/S)-HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu  + BH₃  →  (R/S)-HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu\n    The intermediate is isobutyl (R/S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n3.  **Lactonization:** The H⁺ workup catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, eliminating isobutanol (iBuOH) to form the six-membered lactone.\n4.  **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the chiral center is not involved in the reaction, so its configuration is retained.\n5.  **Conclusion:** To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n    So, **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**4. Final Answer Selection**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A must be the (R) enantiomer.\n*   Starting material B must be the (S) enantiomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\nA = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nB = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n<<<A>>>"
