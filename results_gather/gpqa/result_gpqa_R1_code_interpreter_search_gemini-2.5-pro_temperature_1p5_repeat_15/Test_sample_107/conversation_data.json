    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical Quantities:**\n    *   **Paramagnetic coupling term `⟨H⟩`**: This refers to the energy shift of an atomic energy level due to an external magnetic field, also known as the Zeeman effect. The energy shift for the linear Zeeman effect is given by the formula:\n        `⟨H⟩ = m * μ_B * B`\n        where:\n        *   `m` is the orbital magnetic quantum number. The problem states it has a \"small value\", so we can assume a low integer like `m=1` for a representative calculation.\n        *   `μ_B` is the Bohr magneton, a fundamental physical constant.\n        *   `B` is the magnitude of the external magnetic field.\n\n    *   **Transition energy `ΔE`**: This is the energy difference between two atomic levels, which corresponds to the emission or absorption of a photon. The energy of the photon is related to its wavelength `λ` by the formula:\n        `ΔE = h * c / λ`\n        where:\n        *   `h` is Planck's constant.\n        *   `c` is the speed of light.\n        *   `λ` is the wavelength of the photon.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Transition Energy (`ΔE`)**:\n    *   The given wavelength is `λ = 0.4861 μm = 0.4861 × 10⁻⁶ m`.\n    *   We use the known values for Planck's constant (`h ≈ 6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s`) and the speed of light (`c ≈ 3 × 10⁸ m/s`).\n    *   `ΔE = (6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s × 3 × 10⁸ m/s) / (0.4861 × 10⁻⁶ m)`\n    *   `ΔE ≈ 4.089 × 10⁻¹⁹ J`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy (`⟨H⟩`)**:\n    *   The problem states `B = 1 T` and `m` is small. We'll use `m = 1`.\n    *   The value of the Bohr magneton is `μ_B ≈ 9.274 × 10⁻²⁴ J/T`.\n    *   `⟨H⟩ = 1 × (9.274 × 10⁻²⁴ J/T) × 1 T`\n    *   `⟨H⟩ = 9.274 × 10⁻²⁴ J`\n\n4.  **Compare the Orders of Magnitude**:\n    *   `ΔE ≈ 4.089 × 10⁻¹⁹ J`\n    *   `⟨H⟩ ≈ 9.274 × 10⁻²⁴ J`\n\n    Let's find the ratio `ΔE / ⟨H⟩`:\n    *   Ratio = `(4.089 × 10⁻¹⁹ J) / (9.274 × 10⁻²⁴ J) ≈ 4.4 × 10⁴`\n\n    This means `ΔE` is approximately 44,000 times larger than `⟨H⟩`.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**:\n    The paramagnetic coupling term `⟨H⟩` is significantly smaller than the transition energy `ΔE`. This relationship is expressed as `⟨H⟩ ≪ ΔE`.\n\nTo verify these calculations, we can use a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport scipy.constants as const\n\n# --- Constants ---\n# Wavelength in meters\nlambda_m = 0.4861e-6\n# Magnetic field in Tesla\nB = 1.0\n# A small integer value for the magnetic quantum number\nm = 1\n\n# --- Calculations ---\n# Transition energy in Joules\ndelta_E = (const.h * const.c) / lambda_m\n\n# Paramagnetic coupling energy in Joules\n# const.physical_constants['Bohr magneton'][0] gives μ_B in J/T\nH_para = m * const.physical_constants['Bohr magneton'][0] * B\n\n# --- Output the results ---\nprint(f\"Transition energy ΔE = {delta_E:.4e} J\")\nprint(f\"Paramagnetic coupling term <H> = {H_para:.4e} J\")\nprint(f\"The ratio ΔE / <H> is approximately {delta_E / H_para:.2e}\")\nprint(f\"The results show that <H> is much smaller than ΔE.\")\n```\n\n**Final Answer Derivation from the reasoning:**\n\nOur calculation shows that `ΔE` is on the order of `10⁻¹⁹ J` while `⟨H⟩` is on the order of `10⁻²⁴ J`. Since the exponent for `⟨H⟩` (-24) is much smaller (more negative) than the exponent for `ΔE` (-19), it is clear that `⟨H⟩` is many orders of magnitude smaller than `ΔE`. Therefore, the correct relationship is `⟨H⟩ ≪ ΔE`.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\nIn LaTeX format:\n\nThe transition energy is given by:\n$$ \\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ \\Delta E = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J}\\cdot\\text{s})(3.00 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s})}{0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}} \\approx 4.09 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J} $$\n\nThe paramagnetic coupling energy (Zeeman splitting) is given by:\n$$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = m \\mu_B B $$\nFor `m=1` and `B=1T`:\n$$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = (1)(9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J/T})(1 \\text{ T}) = 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J} $$\n\nComparing the two energy values:\n$$ \\frac{\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}}{4.09 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5} $$\nThis ratio is very small, which means:\n$$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll\\Delta E $$\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem requires us to compare the magnitude of two energy values: the paramagnetic coupling energy `⟨H⟩` in a given magnetic field, and the energy `ΔE` of a photon from a specific atomic transition.\n\n**1. Calculate the Transition Energy (`ΔE`)**\n\nThe energy of a photon is related to its wavelength (`λ`) by the formula:\n$$ \\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} $$\nwhere:\n-   `h` is Planck's constant ($6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J}\\cdot\\text{s}$)\n-   `c` is the speed of light ($3.00 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$)\n-   `λ` is the wavelength, given as $0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ \\Delta E = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J}\\cdot\\text{s})(3.00 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s})}{0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}} $$\n$$ \\Delta E \\approx 4.09 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J} $$\nThe Python code output confirms this value precisely as `4.0865e-19 J`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy (`⟨H⟩`)**\n\nThe energy shift due to the paramagnetic coupling (the linear Zeeman effect) is given by:\n$$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = m \\mu_B B $$\nwhere:\n-   `m` is the orbital magnetic quantum number. The problem states it has a \"small value,\" so we can use `m=1` as a representative case.\n-   `μ_B` is the Bohr magneton, a fundamental physical constant ($9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J/T}$).\n-   `B` is the magnetic field strength, given as $1 \\text{ T}$.\n\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = (1)(9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J/T})(1 \\text{ T}) $$\n$$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J} $$\nThe Python code output confirms this value precisely as `9.2740e-24 J`.\n\n**3. Compare the Magnitudes**\n\nNow we compare the two energy values:\n-   `ΔE ≈ 4.09 × 10⁻¹⁹ J`\n-   `⟨H⟩ ≈ 9.27 × 10⁻²⁴ J`\n\nThe exponent of `⟨H⟩` (-24) is much smaller (more negative) than the exponent of `ΔE` (-19). This indicates that the paramagnetic coupling energy is significantly smaller than the transition energy.\n\nTo make the comparison more concrete, we can calculate the ratio, as was done in the Python script:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta E}{\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle} = \\frac{4.0865 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}}{9.2740 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}} \\approx 4.41 \\times 10^4 = 44,100 $$\nThis means the transition energy `ΔE` is more than 44,000 times larger than the paramagnetic coupling energy `⟨H⟩`.\n\nTherefore, the relationship between the two quantities is:\n$$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll\\Delta E $$\n\n<<<A>>>"
