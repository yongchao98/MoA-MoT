    "An N-sided polygon where N approaches infinity and all apothems are of the same length 'a' becomes a circle of radius 'a'. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nThe diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern. The angular positions of the dark fringes (minima) in this pattern are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J_1(x).\n\nThe condition for the m-th minimum is given by:\n`sin(θ_m) = z_m * λ / (2 * π * a)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `θ_m` is the angular position of the m-th minimum.\n*   `λ` is the wavelength of the light.\n*   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   `z_m` is the m-th zero of the Bessel function J_1(x).\n\nThe problem states that the angles are small, so we can use the approximation `sin(θ) ≈ tan(θ) ≈ θ`.\nThus, the angular position of the m-th minimum is:\n`θ_m = z_m * λ / (2 * π * a)`\n\nTo find the angular positions of the first two minima, we need the first two zeros of J_1(x):\n*   First zero, `z_1 ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second zero, `z_2 ≈ 7.0156`\n\nNow, we can calculate the angular positions:\n*   For the first minimum (`m=1`):\n    `θ_1 = z_1 * λ / (2 * π * a) = 3.8317 * λ / (2 * π * a) ≈ 0.610 * λ / a`\n\n*   For the second minimum (`m=2`):\n    `θ_2 = z_2 * λ / (2 * π * a) = 7.0156 * λ / (2 * π * a) ≈ 1.117 * λ / a`\n\nThe question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ_2 - θ_1`.\n\n`Δθ = θ_2 - θ_1 = (1.117 * λ / a) - (0.610 * λ / a)`\n`Δθ = (1.117 - 0.610) * λ / a`\n`Δθ = 0.507 * λ / a`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.506 λ / a\nB) 0.610 λ / a\nC) 1.220 λ / a\nD) 0.500 λ / a\n\nThe calculated value `0.507 λ / a` is closest to option A. The small difference is likely due to the precision of the constants used.\n\n<<<A>>>"
