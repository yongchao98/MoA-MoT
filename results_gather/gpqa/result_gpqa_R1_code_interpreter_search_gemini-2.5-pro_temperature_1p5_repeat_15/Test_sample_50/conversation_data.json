    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System:**\n    We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is held at a constant potential of zero (V=0). The presence of the charge `q` will induce a distribution of charges on the surface of the sphere to maintain the V=0 condition on its surface. We need to find the total potential energy of this system.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:**\n    This problem can be simplified using the method of images. The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere, created by the induced charges on its surface, can be exactly replicated by a single fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` placed *inside* the sphere. The potential on the surface of the sphere due to the external charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must be zero.\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge and its Position:**\n    Let the center of the sphere be the origin. The charge `q` is at `x=d`. The image charge `q'` is placed at a position `b` from the center along the line connecting the center and `q`. Through calculations that enforce the V=0 condition on the sphere's surface, the parameters of the image charge are found to be:\n    *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   Image charge position: `b = R^2 / d`\n\n    The image charge is located inside the sphere (since d > R, then b < R) and has the opposite sign to the real charge `q`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:**\n    The potential energy of the system is the work done by an external force to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. The external force required is equal and opposite to the electrostatic force exerted on `q` by the grounded sphere. By the method of images, this electrostatic force is the same as the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\n    Let's calculate this work by integrating the force:\n    *   The potential energy `U` is given by the integral of the external force `F_ext` from infinity to `d`. `U = ∫[∞, d] F_ext dx`.\n    *   The external force is opposite to the electrostatic force between `q` and the sphere: `F_ext = -F_elec`.\n    *   The electrostatic force on charge `q` when it is at a variable distance `x` from the center is the force from its corresponding image charge `q'(x)` at position `b(x)`.\n        *   `q'(x) = -qR/x`\n        *   `b(x) = R^2/x`\n        *   Distance between `q` and `q'` is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n    *   The force is `F_elec(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))^2`.\n        `F_elec(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`.\n        This is an attractive force (negative sign).\n    *   The external force is `F_ext(x) = -F_elec(x) = k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`.\n    *   Now, we integrate to find the potential energy `U`:\n        `U = ∫[∞, d] F_ext(x) dx = ∫[∞, d] [k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n    *   To solve the integral, we use the substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, which gives `du = 2x dx`.\n        `U = k * q^2 * R * ∫[∞, d^2-R^2] (1/u^2) * (du/2)`\n        `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * ∫ u^-2 du`\n        `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [-u^-1]_∞^(d^2-R^2)`\n        `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [-1/u]_∞^(d^2-R^2)`\n        `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [ -1/(d^2 - R^2) - (-1/∞) ]`\n        `U = (k * q^2 * R / 2) * [ -1/(d^2 - R^2) ]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Alternative (Shortcut) Method:**\n    The interaction energy of the system can also be found using the formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` created by the induced charges (or, equivalently, by the image charge).\n    *   `V_induced` at distance `d` is the potential from `q'` at distance `b`:\n        `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n        `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n        `V_induced = -k * qR / d / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n        `V_induced = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    *   Now, calculate the energy:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced = (1/2) * q * [ -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    Both methods yield the same result. The net potential energy of the system is `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. This matches option A. The negative sign indicates that the force between the charge and the grounded sphere is attractive, and the system is in a bound state with lower energy than when the charge is at infinity.\n\n<<<A>>>"
