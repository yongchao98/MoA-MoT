    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the given information about the compound:**\n    *   **Structure:** It is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we have a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two substituents.\n    *   **Molecular Formula Hint:** It contains 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contribute the remaining 2 carbons (8 - 6 = 2).\n    *   **FTIR Data:**\n        *   A peak for a carbonyl group (C=O) is present.\n        *   A peak for an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X) is present. This means a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n2.  **Propose a plausible structure:**\n    *   We have a benzene ring with two substituents.\n    *   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X). This substituent has 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group.\n    *   A functional group that fits this description perfectly is the acetyl group (-COCH₃). It has 2 carbons and a carbonyl group.\n    *   Therefore, the compound is a haloacetophenone (X-C₆H₄-COCH₃). This structure has 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 8 carbon atoms, a carbonyl group, an aromatic-halogen bond, and is di-substituted.\n\n3.  **Determine the substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para):**\n    *   The 1H NMR spectrum provides clues about the relative positions of the substituents. Let's analyze the aromatic region of the given options.\n    *   A para (1,4) substituted benzene ring with two different groups typically shows a symmetrical pattern in the aromatic region: two distinct signals, each appearing as a doublet, and each integrating to 2 protons. This is due to the plane of symmetry through the C1-C4 axis.\n    *   Ortho (1,2) and meta (1,3) substitutions usually result in more complex splitting patterns with four distinct signals (or overlapping multiplets) for the four aromatic protons.\n\n4.  **Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for the proposed structure (4-haloacetophenone):**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (C₆H₄):** Assuming para-substitution (which gives the simplest and most recognizable pattern), we expect two doublets in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). Each doublet would correspond to 2 protons. The protons adjacent (ortho) to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group (-COCH₃) would be more deshielded and appear at a higher chemical shift (further downfield) than the protons adjacent to the halogen. So, we'd expect something like: **~7.8 ppm (2H, d)** and **~7.6 ppm (2H, d)**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-COCH₃):** The three protons of the methyl group are attached to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, this signal will be a **singlet (s)**. Its chemical shift is typically in the range of 2.1-2.6 ppm. The integration will be for **3 hydrogens (3H)**. So we'd expect: **~2.3 ppm (3H, s)**.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the given options against the prediction:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde (-CHO), not a methyl ketone (-COCH₃). This contradicts our most likely structure.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum lacks any signals in the typical aromatic proton region (6.5-8.5 ppm). This cannot be the correct spectrum for an aromatic compound.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **Aromatic Region:** 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). This perfectly matches the expected pattern for a para-substituted benzene ring.\n        *   **Aliphatic Region:** 2.3 (3H, s). This perfectly matches the expected signal for an acetyl methyl group.\n        *   This option is an excellent match for the predicted spectrum of 4-haloacetophenone.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum shows only one proton in the aromatic region (6.9 ppm, 1H), which is inconsistent with a di-substituted benzene ring (which should have 4 aromatic protons).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compound is a 4-haloacetophenone. Its 1H NMR spectrum consists of two doublets in the aromatic region for the four ring protons and a singlet in the aliphatic region for the three methyl protons. Option C is the only one that matches this description.\n\n<<<C>>>"
