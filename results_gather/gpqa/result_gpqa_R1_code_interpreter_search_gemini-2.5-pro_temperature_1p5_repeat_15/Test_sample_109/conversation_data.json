    "`ESPRESSO` is located at the Paranal Observatory in Chile, which is in the Southern Hemisphere. It can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude brighter than 17.\n`HIRES` is located at the Keck Observatory in Hawaii, USA, which is in the Northern Hemisphere. It can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude brighter than 16.\n\nFor a star to be observable by **both** spectrographs, it must satisfy two conditions:\n1.  **Visibility from both hemispheres:** Since the observatories are in different hemispheres, the star must be located at a declination (DEC) that is visible from both. Stars with very high positive or very high negative declinations are typically only visible from one hemisphere. Keck is at a latitude of approximately +20°, and Paranal is at approximately -24°. Stars with declinations between these latitudes are generally visible from both locations.\n2.  **Apparent Magnitude Limit:** The star's apparent V magnitude must be brighter than the stricter of the two limits. HIRES has the stricter limit (`V < 16`). Therefore, the star must have an apparent V magnitude `V < 16`.\n\nLet's analyze each star:\n\n*   **Star 1:**\n    *   DEC = -75°. This is a very southern declination, making it practically invisible from the Northern Hemisphere (Keck).\n    *   It fails the visibility condition.\n\n*   **Star 2:**\n    *   DEC = +55°. This is a very northern declination, making it practically invisible from the Southern Hemisphere (Paranal).\n    *   It fails the visibility condition.\n\n*   **Star 3:**\n    *   DEC = +48°. This is a northern declination, but still potentially visible (at low elevation) from Paranal. We will proceed to check the magnitude.\n    *   The apparent V magnitude is given as 15.5 mag, with a color excess E(B-V) = 0.6 mag. This means the observed apparent magnitude is already corrected for interstellar extinction. The apparent V magnitude is `V = 15.5`.\n    *   Is `V < 16`? Yes, `15.5 < 16`.\n    *   Is it visible from both? A star with DEC = +48° is visible from Keck (Latitude ~+20°). From Paranal (Latitude ~-24°), it would be very low on the northern horizon, but since the problem asks to disregard pointing limits, we consider it observable.\n    *   **Star 3 can be observed by both.**\n\n*   **Star 4:**\n    *   DEC = -48°. This is a southern declination, visible from Paranal. It would be very low on the southern horizon for Keck, but again, disregarding pointing limits, we consider it observable.\n    *   The absolute V magnitude (Mv) is 15.5 mag, the distance is 10 pc, and E(B-V) = 0.4 mag. We need to calculate the apparent V magnitude (V).\n    *   First, we calculate the absorption in the V band (Av): Av = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag.\n    *   The relationship between apparent magnitude (V), absolute magnitude (Mv), distance (d), and absorption (Av) is: `V = Mv - 5 + 5 * log10(d) + Av`.\n    *   V = 15.5 - 5 + 5 * log10(10) + 1.24\n    *   V = 15.5 - 5 + 5 * 1 + 1.24\n    *   V = 16.74 mag.\n    *   Is `V < 16`? No, `16.74` is not less than 16.\n    *   It fails the magnitude condition for HIRES.\n\n*   **Star 5:**\n    *   DEC = +60°. This is a very northern declination, making it practically invisible from the Southern Hemisphere (Paranal).\n    *   It fails the visibility condition.\n\nBased on this analysis, only Star 3 can be detected by both observatories. However, since the provided options are pairs of stars, let's re-evaluate the visibility constraint. The problem states to \"disregard the pointing limits of the telescopes\". This is an unusual instruction, as it could be interpreted to mean that if a star is ever above the horizon, it is observable.\n\nLet's assume this loose interpretation and focus purely on the magnitude constraints first, as they are definitive.\n- Star 1: `V = 15.5` -> Observable by both based on magnitude.\n- Star 2: `V = 16.5` -> NOT observable by HIRES (`16.5` is not `< 16`).\n- Star 3: `V = 15.5` -> Observable by both based on magnitude.\n- Star 4: `V = 16.74` -> NOT observable by HIRES (`16.74` is not `< 16`).\n- Star 5: `V = 16.5` -> NOT observable by HIRES (`16.5` is not `< 16`).\n\nThis strict analysis shows that only Star 1 and Star 3 have apparent magnitudes bright enough for both instruments. No option matches `{Star1, Star3}`. This suggests there may be a misunderstanding of the problem's parameters.\n\nLet's re-read Star 3's information carefully: \"apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag\". This phrasing is slightly ambiguous. It could mean the *observed* apparent magnitude is 15.5 (as assumed above), or it could mean the apparent magnitude *before* extinction is 15.5. In standard astronomical convention, \"apparent magnitude\" refers to the magnitude we observe, which already includes the effects of extinction. Let's stick with this standard interpretation.\n\nLet's re-examine Star 5.\n- Absolute Magnitude (Mv) = 16.5, distance (d) = 5 pc.\n- Apparent Magnitude (V) = Mv - 5 + 5 * log10(d) = 16.5 - 5 + 5 * log10(5)\n- V = 11.5 + 5 * (0.69897) = 11.5 + 3.49 = 14.99 mag.\n- Is `V < 16`? Yes, `14.99 < 16`. Star 5 is observable by both based on magnitude.\n- The declination is +60°, which makes it not visible from Paranal.\n\nIf we strictly apply the magnitude and standard visibility rules (i.e., stars must be in a declination range visible to both hemispheres), only Star 3 works. This would make the question unsolvable with the given options.\n\nLet's reconsider the visibility constraint: \"disregard the pointing limits\". Perhaps this is a hint to ignore declination entirely and focus only on the magnitude calculation. If we ignore visibility:\n- **Star 1:** V = 15.5 (< 16). OK.\n- **Star 2:** V = 16.5 (> 16). NO.\n- **Star 3:** V = 15.5 (< 16). OK.\n- **Star 4:** V = 16.74 (> 16). NO.\n- **Star 5:** V = 14.99 (< 16). OK.\n\nUnder the \"ignore visibility\" interpretation, Stars 1, 3, and 5 are candidates. No option combines any two of these. This implies there must be another interpretation.\n\nLet's re-read Star 3 again. \"apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag\". What if the *extinction has not yet been applied*? This would be non-standard phrasing, but let's test it.\n- Unreddened apparent magnitude = 15.5 mag.\n- Absorption Av = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag.\n- Observed apparent magnitude V = 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36 mag.\n- `17.36` is not `< 16`. Under this interpretation, Star 3 is NOT observable.\n\nIf Star 3 is not observable, then our candidates (ignoring visibility) are Star 1 and Star 5. This pair is not an option.\n\nThere seems to be an error in the problem statement or the options. However, let's revisit our calculations and interpretations one last time, selecting the most likely astronomical meaning for each term.\n1.  **Visibility:** The declination of a star is a fundamental property, not a \"pointing limit\". A pointing limit refers to how close to the horizon a telescope can point. Ignoring it means we can observe a star as long as it is mathematically above the horizon. Under this, Star 2 (DEC=+55) and Star 5 (DEC=+60) are definitely not visible from Paranal (Lat=-24). Star 1 (DEC=-75) is not visible from Keck (Lat=+20). This leaves Star 3 (DEC=+48) and Star 4 (DEC=-48) as the only two stars that could *potentially* be seen from both hemispheres, even if at very low altitudes.\n2.  **Magnitude:** \"Apparent magnitude\" is the observed magnitude.\n\nLet's proceed with the two plausible candidates from a visibility standpoint: Star 3 and Star 4.\n- **Star 3:** Apparent V = 15.5 mag. This is < 16. So Star 3 is observable.\n- **Star 4:** Apparent V = 16.74 mag. This is > 16. So Star 4 is NOT observable.\n\nThis again leads to only Star 3 being the single correct answer, which contradicts the format of the options. There must be an error in the problem's premises. Let's re-calculate Star 5.\n- V = 14.99 mag. This star is bright enough. Its declination is +60°.\n\nGiven the options, the question writer may have made an error and intended for both Star 3 and Star 5 to be the answer.\n- Star 3: V = 15.5 (< 16)\n- Star 5: V = 14.99 (< 16)\nBoth satisfy the magnitude constraint. Option C pairs them. This requires completely ignoring the visibility constraints, which is a plausible (though strange) interpretation of \"disregard the pointing limits\". Let's assume this is the intended logic.\n\n*   Star 1: V = 15.5 (< 16) -> OK\n*   Star 2: V = 16.5 (> 16) -> Fail\n*   Star 3: V = 15.5 (< 16) -> OK\n*   Star 4: V = 16.74 (> 16) -> Fail\n*   Star 5: V = 14.99 (< 16) -> OK\n\nThe stars that satisfy the brightness criterion `V < 16` are Star 1, Star 3, and Star 5. Since no option for {1,3}, {1,5}, or {1,3,5} exists, but {3,5} does, this is the most likely intended answer, despite the physical impossibility of observing these two stars with this specific pair of telescopes.\n\nFinal check:\n- **Star 3:** `V = 15.5`. `15.5 < 17` (ESPRESSO) and `15.5 < 16` (HIRES). Magnitude is fine.\n- **Star 5:** `V = 14.99`. `14.99 < 17` (ESPRESSO) and `14.99 < 16` (HIRES). Magnitude is fine.\n\nBoth stars meet the magnitude requirements for both instruments. The question's instruction to disregard pointing limits is best interpreted as \"ignore declination and hemisphere visibility\".\n\n<<<C>>>"
