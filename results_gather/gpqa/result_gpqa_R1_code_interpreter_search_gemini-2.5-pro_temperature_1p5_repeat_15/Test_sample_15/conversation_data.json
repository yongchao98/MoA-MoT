    "A compound is optically active if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of one or more chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral. If a molecule has more than one chiral center, it can be achiral if it possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion; such a compound is called a meso compound. We will analyze each compound to determine if it is chiral.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers (an sp3 carbon with four different substituents). There are no chiral centers in this molecule. C3 is bonded to two identical hydrogen atoms, and C4 is bonded to three identical hydrogen atoms.\n    *   The molecule has a double bond, but the atoms around the double bond are largely in a plane. The molecule as a whole can adopt a conformation that has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **achiral** and not optically active.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   The name itself specifies the absolute configuration at multiple stereocenters (3aR, 7aS) and the geometry of a double bond (E).\n    *   The specification of a single set of stereochemical descriptors (R, S, E) defines a single, specific stereoisomer.\n    *   A single stereoisomer is, by definition, optically active unless it happens to be a meso compound.\n    *   Given the complexity and lack of symmetry in the name and implied structure, it is extremely unlikely to be meso. The presence of defined chiral centers designated as R and S confirms its chirality.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters, at C2 and C3.\n    *   Let's consider the arrangement of groups. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that can pass through the C2-C3 bond in an eclipsed conformation. The top half (`HOOC-CH(CH3)-`) is the mirror image of the bottom half.\n    *   The (2R,3S) isomer is a **meso compound**. Meso compounds have chiral centers but are achiral overall due to internal symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **achiral** and not optically active.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the compound above. The (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   This molecule lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is non-superimposable on its mirror image, (2S,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   The question specifies a single enantiomer, (2R,3R).\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group on C1.\n    *   Let's examine C1. It is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  -OH (hydroxyl group)\n        2.  -H (hydrogen atom)\n        3.  The ring path towards the double bond: -C2H2-C3H=\n        4.  The ring path away from the double bond: -C6H2-C5H2-\n    *   Since the paths around the ring are different, C1 is a chiral center. The molecule has one chiral center, so it must be chiral.\n    *   The name specifies the (R) enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   The notation (1s,3s,5s), while not standard IUPAC, in a symmetrical case like this typically denotes the highly symmetric all-cis isomer (all OH groups on the same side of the ring).\n    *   This all-cis isomer possesses a high degree of symmetry. It has a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry. Each plane of symmetry passes through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group.\n    *   Due to the presence of planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral. The carbons C1, C3, and C5 are not true chiral centers because the two paths around the ring from each of these carbons are identical.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **achiral** and not optically active.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   The IUPAC name corresponds to the structure `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers. The only potential candidate is C3 of the butane chain.\n    *   C3 is bonded to a hydrogen atom, the `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group, and two methyl (-CH3) groups.\n    *   Since C3 is bonded to two identical methyl groups, it is not a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has no other stereogenic elements (like axial or planar chirality).\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **achiral** and not optically active.\n\n**Summary:**\n1.  (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Achiral\n2.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Chiral**\n3.  (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Achiral (meso)\n4.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Chiral**\n5.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Chiral**\n6.  (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Achiral\n7.  1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Achiral\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>"
