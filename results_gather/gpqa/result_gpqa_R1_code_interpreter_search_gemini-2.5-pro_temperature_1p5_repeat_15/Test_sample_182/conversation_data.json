    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Reactant's Name:**\n    The reactant is \"2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\". Let's break this down to draw the structure and find its molecular formula.\n    *   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This is the base structure. It's a six-membered carbon ring with one double bond between carbon-3 and carbon-4.\n    *   **-carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group is the principal functional group, so it's at position 1.\n    *   **2-formyl**: An aldehyde group (-CHO) is attached to carbon-2.\n    *   **5-vinyl**: A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is attached to carbon-5.\n\n2.  **Determine the Molecular Formula of the Reactant:**\n    Let's count the atoms in the structure:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in -CH=CH2 = 10 carbons.\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):**\n        *   On the ring: C1(1H), C2(1H), C3(1H), C4(1H), C5(1H), C6(2H) = 7 H.\n        *   On the functional groups: COOH(1H), CHO(1H), -CH=CH2(3H) = 5 H.\n        *   Total H = 7 + 5 = 12 hydrogens.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = 3 oxygens.\n    The molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Reactant:**\n    The IHD (or degree of unsaturation) tells us the number of rings and/or pi (π) bonds in a molecule. The formula is:\n    IHD = C - (H/2) + (N/2) + 1\n    For our reactant C10H12O3 (N=0):\n    IHD = 10 - (12/2) + 0 + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5.\n\n    We can also find this by inspecting the structure:\n    *   1 ring = 1 IHD\n    *   1 C=C bond in the ring = 1 IHD\n    *   1 C=C bond in the vinyl group = 1 IHD\n    *   1 C=O bond in the carboxylic acid = 1 IHD\n    *   1 C=O bond in the aldehyde = 1 IHD\n    *   Total IHD = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5. This confirms the calculation.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    The reactant is treated with **red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P + HI)**. This is a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its job is to:\n    *   Reduce aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to their corresponding alkane parts (-CH3).\n    *   Reduce (saturate) carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   The carbon skeleton, including the ring, remains intact.\n\n5.  **Determine the Product's Structure and Formula:**\n    All the sites of unsaturation (except the ring itself) and the oxygen-containing groups will be reduced.\n    *   The `cyclohexene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring.\n    *   The `-COOH` group at C1 becomes a methyl group `-CH3`.\n    *   The `-CHO` group at C2 becomes a methyl group `-CH3`.\n    *   The vinyl group `-CH=CH2` at C5 becomes an ethyl group `-CH2-CH3`.\n\n    The product is a substituted cyclohexane. The number of carbon atoms does not change, so it's still C10. Since it's now a fully saturated cycloalkane (all C-C single bonds, no C=C bonds), its general formula must be **CnH2n**.\n    Therefore, the product's molecular formula is **C10H20**.\n\n6.  **Calculate the IHD of the Product:**\n    Using the IHD formula for the product, C10H20:\n    IHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = **1**.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The IHD of the final product is 1. This single degree of unsaturation is due to the presence of the cyclohexane ring. The reduction process eliminated the 4 degrees of unsaturation that came from the four π bonds in the reactant (two C=C and two C=O).\n    IHD_product = IHD_reactant - 4 = 5 - 4 = 1.\n\nThe calculated IHD is 1, which corresponds to option B.\n```python\n# Python code to verify the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) calculations.\n\n# IHD Formula: IHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\n\n# Reactant: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\n# Molecular Formula: C10H12O3\nC_reactant = 10\nH_reactant = 12\nN_reactant = 0\nihd_reactant = C_reactant - (H_reactant / 2) + (N_reactant / 2) + 1\nprint(f\"IHD of reactant (C10H12O3): {int(ihd_reactant)}\")\n\n# Product after reaction with Red P + HI\n# All double bonds and oxygenated groups are reduced. The product is a substituted cyclohexane.\n# Molecular Formula: C10H20\nC_product = 10\nH_product = 20\nN_product = 0\nihd_product = C_product - (H_product / 2) + (N_product / 2) + 1\nprint(f\"IHD of product (C10H20): {int(ihd_product)}\")\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "*   **Step 1: Determine the structure and molecular formula of the reactant.**\n    The reactant is \"2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\".\n    *   The base structure is `cyclohex-3-ene`, a six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbon-3 and carbon-4.\n    *   The primary functional group is `carboxylic acid` (-COOH), which is placed at position C1.\n    *   At position C2, there is a `formyl` group (-CHO).\n    *   At position C5, there is a `vinyl` group (-CH=CH2).\n\n    Now, let's determine its molecular formula (CxHyOz) by counting the atoms:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in the -COOH group + 1 in the -CHO group + 2 in the vinyl group = **10 carbons (C10)**.\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** We count the hydrogens on each carbon and in the functional groups. The structure is C10H12O3.\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 in the -COOH group + 1 in the -CHO group = **3 oxygens (O3)**.\n    So, the molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Understand the reaction.**\n    The reactant is treated with red phosphorus and an excess of hydroiodic acid (Red P + excess HI). This is a very powerful reducing agent used in organic chemistry. It performs the following reductions:\n    *   It completely reduces aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) to their corresponding alkane groups (in this case, methyl groups, -CH3).\n    *   It reduces (saturates) carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   The carbon skeleton, including the ring, remains intact.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the structure and molecular formula of the product.**\n    The reduction process transforms the reactant as follows:\n    *   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring (the double bond is saturated).\n    *   The `carboxylic acid` group at C1 is reduced to a `methyl` group (-CH3).\n    *   The `formyl` group at C2 is reduced to a `methyl` group (-CH3).\n    *   The `vinyl` group (-CH=CH2) at C5 is reduced to an `ethyl` group (-CH2-CH3).\n\n    The resulting product is 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane. The number of carbon atoms remains the same (C10). Since the product is now a fully saturated cycloalkane (containing only single bonds within a single ring), its general formula is CnH2n.\n    Therefore, the molecular formula of the product is **C10H20**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.**\n    The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (also known as the degree of unsaturation) for a molecule with the formula CxHyOz is calculated as:\n    IHD = C - (H/2) + 1\n\n    For our product with the formula C10H20:\n    IHD = 10 - (20 / 2) + 1\n    IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n    IHD = 1\n\n    The IHD of 1 is due to the presence of the single ring structure (the cyclohexane ring). All the pi bonds (from C=C and C=O) have been eliminated by the reduction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
