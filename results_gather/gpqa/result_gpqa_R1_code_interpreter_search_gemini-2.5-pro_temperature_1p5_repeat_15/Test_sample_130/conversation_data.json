    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction:**\n    *   The first reactant is a dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene, which upon dehydration forms an anhydride. The NMR data for this anhydride is given:\n        *   ¹H NMR: A single peak at 7 ppm. The value of 7 ppm is in the aromatic/alkene region. A single peak implies all protons are chemically equivalent.\n        *   ¹³C NMR: Two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene region) and 165 ppm (carbonyl region). Two peaks imply there are only two types of carbon atoms in the molecule.\n    *   This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. Maleic acid (cis-butenedioic acid) is a cis-dicarboxylic acid. Its dehydration product, maleic anhydride, has a plane of symmetry, making the two alkene protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent. This gives one ¹H signal and two ¹³C signals, consistent with the provided data.\n    *   The second reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is the diene for the Diels-Alder reaction.\n    *   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition** between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n\n2.  **Determine the Products and their Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction between a cyclic diene and a dienophile can produce two diastereomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   According to the Alder endo rule, the *endo* adduct is the kinetically favored product and is typically the **major product**. The *exo* adduct is the thermodynamically more stable product and is typically the **minor product**.\n    *   The problem states that a major and a minor product are formed. We can confidently assign the major product as the *endo* isomer and the minor product as the *exo* isomer.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structure of the Products:**\n    *   Let's analyze the structure of the resulting bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system.\n        *   The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. The diene system involves carbons C1, C2, C3, and C4. The reaction happens between C1 and C4 of the diene and the two carbons of the maleic anhydride double bond.\n        *   In the product, the original C1 and C4 of the diene become the bridgehead carbons, each bearing a methyl group (**bridgehead methyls**).\n        *   The original C2 and C3 of the diene form the new double bond in the bicyclic system, each bearing a methyl group (**vinyl methyls**).\n        *   The original C5 of the diene (a CH2 group) becomes the one-carbon bridge (the **methylene bridge**, C7). This bridge has two diastereotopic protons: **H_syn** (pointing towards the double bond) and **H_anti** (pointing away).\n        *   The carbons from the maleic anhydride form the two-carbon bridge, which includes the anhydride functionality. The two protons on this bridge (**H_b**) are equivalent due to a plane of symmetry in the molecule.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Spatial Relationships (NOE):**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close in space (< 5 Å). We need to find an NOE interaction that is present in the major (*endo*) product but absent in the minor (*exo*) product.\n    *   **In the *endo* adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride part of the molecule is tucked \"under\" the main six-membered ring, on the same side as the methylene (C7) bridge.\n        *   This geometry places the anhydride protons (**H_b**) very close to the **H_syn** proton on the methylene bridge. A strong NOE cross-peak is expected between H_b and H_syn.\n        *   The H_b protons are far from the H_anti proton.\n        *   The bridgehead methyl groups point generally \"up and away\" from the center of the bicyclic cage, making them distant from the endo H_b protons.\n    *   **In the *exo* adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride part is oriented \"up\", away from the methylene bridge.\n        *   This geometry places the anhydride protons (**H_b**) far from the **H_syn** proton. The NOE cross-peak between H_b and H_syn will be absent or very weak.\n        *   The H_b protons are now close to the H_anti proton.\n        *   The H_b protons are also now on the same side as the bridgehead methyl groups, so an NOE may be observed between them.\n\n5.  **Identify the Differentiating Cross-Peak and Match with Options:**\n    *   The NOE interaction that is strong in the major (*endo*) product and absent/weak in the minor (*exo*) product is the one between the anhydride protons (**H_b**) and the **H_syn** proton of the methylene bridge.\n    *   Now, let's assign the NMR signals given in the options to these protons:\n        *   **H_b**: These two equivalent protons are on carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups. They will be deshielded. The `2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm` is the correct assignment for H_b.\n        *   **H_syn / H_anti**: These are the two protons on the C7 bridge. They are diastereotopic and couple to each other (geminal coupling), so they should appear as a pair of doublets. H_syn is shielded by the anisotropy of the nearby C=C bond, so it will appear at a higher field (lower ppm) than H_anti. The `1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm` is a reasonable assignment for one of these protons, most likely H_syn.\n        *   **Methyl groups**: There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the two bridgehead methyls and the two vinyl methyls. These will appear as two `6H singlets`, for example at `~1.0 ppm` and `~1.7 ppm`.\n    *   The diagnostic cross-peak for the major product is between **H_b** and **H_syn**.\n    *   This corresponds to an interaction between the `2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm` and the `1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm`.\n    *   This matches the description in Option D.\n\nLet's evaluate the other options:\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm: NOE between the two different methyl groups. This is not the primary peak that distinguishes endo from exo.\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: NOE between a set of methyl groups and H_b. As argued above, this interaction is expected to be strong in the *minor (exo)* product (between H_b and bridgehead methyls), not the major (endo) product.\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm: NOE between a methyl group and a bridge proton. This is possible, but the NOE between H_b and H_syn is the classic and most conclusive evidence for the endo geometry.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak present in the major product and absent in the minor product connects the resonances of H_b and H_syn.\n\n<<<D>>>"
