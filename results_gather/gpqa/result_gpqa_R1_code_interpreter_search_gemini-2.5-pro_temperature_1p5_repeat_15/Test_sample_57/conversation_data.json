    "The user wants me to identify which of the given theories does not require regularization at high energies.\n\n1.  **Analysis of the Options:**\n    *   **A) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** QCD is a quantum field theory (QFT) describing the strong force. Like most QFTs, its perturbative calculations involve loop diagrams that lead to divergent integrals at high energies (ultraviolet divergences). To handle these infinities and extract meaningful physical predictions, a process of regularization (to make the integrals temporarily finite) and renormalization (to absorb the infinities into the definition of physical parameters) is necessary. Therefore, QCD requires regularization.\n    *   **B) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** QED is the quantum field theory of electromagnetism. It was the first successful QFT and the model for others like QCD. It also suffers from ultraviolet divergences in loop calculations (e.g., calculating the electron's self-energy or the Lamb shift). The development of regularization and renormalization techniques was a key triumph of QED. Therefore, QED requires regularization.\n    *   **C) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory, governed by Maxwell's equations, is not a quantum theory. However, it has its own problem with infinities at high energies or, equivalently, short distances. The most famous example is the self-energy of a point charge. If an electron is treated as a mathematical point, the energy stored in its own electric field is infinite. To get a finite result, one must introduce a \"cutoff,\" such as assuming the electron has a small but finite radius. This procedure is a form of regularization. Thus, even classical electrodynamics encounters divergences that require some form of regularization to resolve.\n    *   **D) Superstring Theory:** Superstring theory is a candidate for a theory of everything, including quantum gravity. One of its key features and primary motivations is that it is believed to be free from ultraviolet (high-energy) divergences. In this theory, fundamental entities are not point particles but one-dimensional strings. Interactions, which are the source of divergences in QFT, are not point-like events but rather smooth processes of strings splitting and joining. This \"smearing out\" of interactions over a region of the order of the string length naturally removes the short-distance singularities that plague QFTs. Consequently, scattering amplitudes in superstring theory are expected to be finite, and the theory does not require an ad-hoc regularization procedure.\n\n2.  **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the analysis, Quantum Chromodynamics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and even Classical Electrodynamics all encounter infinities at high energies/short distances that necessitate some form of regularization. Superstring Theory, by its fundamental nature where particles are extended strings rather than points, is constructed to avoid these divergences altogether.\n\n<<<D>>>"
