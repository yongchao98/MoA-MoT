Let's analyze the effect of each mutation by translating the DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence, reading it in codons (groups of three nucleotides) starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n**Intact Gene Sequence and Protein:**\n*   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...-3’\n*   **Protein:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr - Ser - Val - Asp...\n\nThis is the functional protein that produces the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n---\n\n**Analysis of Mutants:**\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...-3’\n    *   **Changes:** `TTT` -> `TTC` (Phe -> Phe, a silent mutation) and `CTC` -> `TAC` (Leu -> Tyr, a missense mutation).\n    *   **Protein:** Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly - Thr - Ser - Val - Asp...\n    *   **Effect:** This is a missense mutation, which changes one amino acid (Leucine to Tyrosine). This might alter the protein's function, but it could also have little to no effect. It is not a guaranteed way to eliminate the protein's activity.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...-3’\n    *   **Changes:** `TTT` -> `TTC` (Phe -> Phe, a silent mutation) and `CTC` -> `TAA`.\n    *   **Protein:** Met - Phe - **STOP**\n    *   **Effect:** The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. It causes translation to terminate prematurely, creating a tiny, non-functional protein fragment only two amino acids long. This is highly likely to completely eliminate the gene's function.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG...-3’\n    *   **Changes:** This sequence has multiple changes compared to the intact gene, resulting in several amino acid substitutions (missense mutations).\n    *   **Protein:** Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly - **Val** - **Thr** - **Ser**...\n    *   **Effect:** Multiple missense mutations change several amino acids. While this is more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it does not guarantee a complete loss of function. The protein is still produced at full length.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...-3’\n    *   **Changes:** Comparing to the intact gene (`...GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted.\n    *   **Protein:** Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Thr - Ser - Val - Asp...\n    *   **Effect:** This is an in-frame deletion. It removes one amino acid (Glycine) from the protein and also contains a missense mutation (`CTC` -> `TAC`). Like a missense mutation, deleting a single amino acid might disrupt the protein, but it is not guaranteed to completely inactivate it.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe most effective way to eliminate the function of a gene is to prevent the synthesis of a full-length, functional protein. **Mutant 2** introduces a premature stop codon very early in the sequence. This will result in a severely truncated and non-functional protein, thus most probably eliminating the production of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to analyze the effect of each mutation on the protein's synthesis. The goal is to find the mutation that most probably results in a non-functional protein. This is typically achieved by a \"knockout\" mutation that stops the protein from being made correctly.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the intact gene's initial sequence to understand its translation into amino acids. The genetic code is read in triplets called codons. The sequence begins with `ATG`, which is the standard start codon that codes for the amino acid Methionine and signals the beginning of protein translation.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’\n    *   **Amino Acids:** Methionine - Phenylalanine - Leucine - Alanine - Glycine...\n\nNow, let's examine each mutant:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’\n    *   **Change:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, where one amino acid is substituted for another. While this could potentially alter the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’\n    *   **Change:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is one of the three **stop codons** (along with TGA and TAG). This type of mutation is called a **nonsense mutation**. It signals the machinery of the cell to stop protein synthesis prematurely. This results in a severely truncated and almost certainly non-functional protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’\n    *   **Change:** This mutant has two changes compared to the intact gene. The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine), and the sixth codon `ACT` (Threonine) becomes `GTC` (Valine). These are two separate **missense mutations**. Similar to Mutant 1, this might affect protein function, but it is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...-3’\n    *   **Change:** This mutant also has two **missense mutations**. The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine), and the fifth codon `GGT` (Glycine) becomes `ACT` (Threonine). Again, this is less likely to completely eliminate the protein's function compared to a nonsense mutation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon very early in the gene sequence. This nonsense mutation will halt protein synthesis, leading to a very short and non-functional protein product. This is the most direct and probable way to eliminate the function of the protein responsible for the anti-nutritional compound. The other mutants only cause amino acid substitutions (missense mutations), which may or may not inactivate the protein. Therefore, Mutant 2 is the most desirable outcome for the stated goal.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo determine which mutation will most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to find the mutation that causes the most severe disruption to the gene's protein product. A non-functional protein cannot synthesize the compound.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Intact Gene:** First, we'll establish the baseline by translating the beginning of the original gene sequence into its amino acid sequence. The gene starts with `ATG` (the start codon) and ends with `TGA` (a stop codon).\n2.  **Analyze Each Mutant:** We will examine each mutant sequence to identify the type of mutation and its effect on the resulting protein.\n    *   A **missense mutation** changes one amino acid, which might or might not disable the protein.\n    *   An **in-frame deletion/insertion** removes or adds an entire amino acid, which also might or might not disable the protein.\n    *   A **frameshift mutation** (caused by an insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three) changes the reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n    *   A **nonsense mutation** changes an amino acid codon into a STOP codon, which terminates protein synthesis prematurely, resulting in a truncated and almost certainly non-functional protein.\n3.  **Compare the Effects:** The most severe disruptions are frameshift and nonsense mutations, as they are most likely to result in a completely non-functional protein. We will identify which mutant has the most disruptive mutation.\n\nLet's execute the analysis with Python.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_mutations():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes gene mutations to determine which is most likely to result in a non-functional protein.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the DNA codon table for translation ('*' = STOP codon)\n    codon_table = {\n        'ATA':'I', 'ATC':'I', 'ATT':'I', 'ATG':'M', 'ACA':'T', 'ACC':'T', 'ACG':'T', 'ACT':'T',\n        'AAC':'N', 'AAT':'N', 'AAA':'K', 'AAG':'K', 'AGC':'S', 'AGT':'S', 'AGA':'R', 'AGG':'R',\n        'CTA':'L', 'CTC':'L', 'CTG':'L', 'CTT':'L', 'CCA':'P', 'CCC':'P', 'CCG':'P', 'CCT':'P',\n        'CAC':'H', 'CAT':'H', 'CAA':'Q', 'CAG':'Q', 'CGA':'R', 'CGC':'R', 'CGG':'R', 'CGT':'R',\n        'GTA':'V', 'GTC':'V', 'GTG':'V', 'GTT':'V', 'GCA':'A', 'GCC':'A', 'GCG':'A', 'GCT':'A',\n        'GAC':'D', 'GAT':'D', 'GAA':'E', 'GAG':'E', 'GGA':'G', 'GGC':'G', 'GGG':'G', 'GGT':'G',\n        'TCA':'S', 'TCC':'S', 'TCG':'S', 'TCT':'S', 'TTC':'F', 'TTT':'F', 'TTA':'L', 'TTG':'L',\n        'TAC':'Y', 'TAT':'Y', 'TAA':'*', 'TAG':'*', 'TGC':'C', 'TGT':'C', 'TGA':'*', 'TGG':'W',\n    }\n\n    def translate(seq):\n        protein = \"\"\n        for i in range(0, len(seq) - (len(seq) % 3), 3):\n            codon = seq[i:i+3]\n            amino_acid = codon_table.get(codon, 'X') # 'X' for unknown\n            if amino_acid == '*':\n                protein += '*'\n                break\n            protein += amino_acid\n        return protein\n\n    # Gene sequences\n    intact_gene = \"ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\n    mutant_1 = \"ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\"\n    mutant_2 = \"ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\"\n    mutant_3 = \"ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\n    mutant_4 = \"ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\n\n    print(\"Analysis of Gene Mutations:\\n\")\n\n    # Intact Gene\n    print(f\"Intact Gene:        ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...\")\n    print(f\"Translated Protein: {translate(intact_gene)}\")\n    print(\"Analysis: This is the original, functional protein.\\n\")\n\n    # Mutant 1\n    print(f\"Mutant 1:           ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT...\")\n    print(f\"Translated Protein: {translate(mutant_1)}\")\n    print(\"Analysis: This is a missense mutation (Leucine -> Tyrosine).

This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the target gene. To eliminate the compound, we need to disrupt the function of this protein, ideally by creating a \"knockout\" mutation that results in a non-functional or absent protein.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Intact Gene Sequence**\nThe provided sequence is the beginning of the coding region (first exon) of the gene.\nIntact gene: `5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`\n\nLet's break this sequence into codons (groups of three nucleotides) to determine the original amino acid sequence. The reading frame starts with `ATG`, which is the start codon.\n*   `ATG` - Methionine (Met) - Start codon\n*   `TTT` - Phenylalanine (Phe)\n*   `CTC` - Leucine (Leu)\n*   `GCT` - Alanine (Ala)\n*   `GGT` - Glycine (Gly)\n*   `ACT` - Threonine (Thr)\n*   ...and so on.\n\nThe goal is to find a mutation that causes the most significant disruption to the protein that will be translated from this sequence.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Each Mutant Individually**\n\n**Careful Point:** The most effective mutations for knocking out gene function are typically **nonsense mutations** (which create a premature stop codon) or **frameshift mutations** (insertions or deletions of nucleotides not in a multiple of three). These are generally more disruptive than **missense mutations** (which change one amino acid to another) or **silent mutations** (which don't change the amino acid at all).\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`\n    *   Let's compare it to the intact gene, codon by codon:\n        *   Intact: `ATG TTT CTC ...` (Met-Phe-Leu...)\n        *   Mutant 1: `ATG TTC TAC ...` (Met-Phe-Tyr...)\n    *   Analysis: The codon `TTT` has changed to `TTC`. Both `TTT` and `TTC` code for Phenylalanine (Phe), so this is a silent mutation. The codon `CTC` (Leucine) has changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It changes one amino acid. While this *could* affect protein function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`\n    *   Let's compare it to the intact gene, codon by codon:\n        *   Intact: `ATG TTT CTC ...` (Met-Phe-Leu...)\n        *   Mutant 2: `ATG TTC TAA ...`\n    *   Analysis: The codon `TTT` has changed to `TTC` (a silent mutation, as in Mutant 1). The codon `CTC` (Leucine) has changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **STOP codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   **Impact:** This mutation will cause the ribosome to stop translation after the second amino acid (Phenylalanine). The resulting protein will be only two amino acids long (Met-Phe). A protein this severely truncated is almost certain to be non-functional. This is a very strong candidate for eliminating the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`\n    *   Let's compare it to the intact gene, codon by codon:\n        *   Intact: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ...` (Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly-Thr...)\n        *   Mutant 3: `ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ...` (Met-Phe-Tyr-Ala-Gly-Val...)\n    *   Analysis: The codon `CTC` (Leucine) has changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and the codon `ACT` (Threonine) has changed to `GTC` (Valine). These are two separate **missense mutations**. Like Mutant 1, this changes the amino acid sequence, but it doesn't guarantee a complete loss of function.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`\n    *   Let's compare it to the intact gene:\n        *   Intact: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT ...`\n        *   Mutant 4: `ATG TTT TAC GCT --- ACT TCT ...`\n    *   Analysis: There are two changes here. First, the codon `CTC` (Leucine) has changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), which is a **missense mutation**. Second, the codon `GGT` (Glycine) has been deleted entirely. Since a full codon (3 nucleotides) was deleted, this is an **in-frame deletion**. The reading frame for the rest of the gene is preserved, but the final protein will be missing one amino acid (Glycine) and have another one changed (Leu to Tyr). While this is a significant change, it is less likely to cause a complete knockout than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Mutations and Conclude**\n*   Mutant 1: One amino acid change. (Less likely to be a knockout)\n*   **Mutant 2: Introduces a premature STOP codon. Protein synthesis stops almost immediately. (Most likely to be a knockout)**\n*   Mutant 3: Two amino acid changes. (Less likely to be a knockout)\n*   Mutant 4: One amino acid change and one amino acid deletion. (Significant, but less certain to be a knockout than a premature stop codon).\n\nThe nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most drastic change, leading to a severely truncated and almost certainly non-functional protein. Therefore, this mutation is the most probable one to eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nTo determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to find the mutation that is most likely to create a non-functional protein. This is typically achieved by a mutation that causes a major disruption in the protein's structure, such as a frameshift or a premature stop codon.\n\nLet's analyze the effect of each mutation by translating the DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence. The genetic code is read in triplets called codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n**1. Intact Gene:**\n*   Sequence: 5’-**ATG TTT CTC GCT**...-3’\n*   Translation:\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Start)\n    *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine\n    *   `CTC` -> Leucine\n    *   `GCT` -> Alanine\n*   Protein Start: Met-Phe-Leu-Ala...\n\n**2. Mutant 1:**\n*   Sequence: 5’-**ATG TTC TAC GCT**...-3’\n*   Changes from intact gene: `TTT` -> `TTC` and `CTC` -> `TAC`.\n*   Translation:\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine\n    *   `TTC` -> Phenylalanine (Note: `TTT` and `TTC` both code for Phenylalanine, so this is a silent mutation).\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Note: `CTC` for Leucine is changed to `TAC` for Tyrosine. This is a missense mutation).\n    *   `GCT` -> Alanine\n*   Protein Start: Met-Phe-**Tyr**-Ala...\n*   Effect: This is a missense mutation, which changes one amino acid. The resulting protein is altered, but it may or may not be functional. It is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than other types of mutations.\n\n**3. Mutant 2:**\n*   Sequence: 5’-**ATG TTC TAA GCT**...-3’\n*   Changes from intact gene: `TTT` -> `TTC` and `CTC` -> `TAA`.\n*   Translation:\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine\n    *   `TTC` -> Phenylalanine\n    *   `TAA` -> **STOP**\n*   Protein Start: Met-Phe-STOP\n*   Effect: This is a **nonsense mutation**. The `TAA` codon is a stop codon, which signals the ribosome to terminate translation. This will result in a very short, truncated protein containing only two amino acids. This protein will almost certainly be non-functional.\n\n**4. Mutant 3:**\n*   Sequence: 5’-**ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT**...-3’\n*   Changes from intact gene: `CTC` -> `TAC` (missense mutation, Leu -> Tyr) and an insertion of `GTC` after `GGT`.\n*   Effect: This mutation causes one amino acid change and an insertion of a single amino acid (Valine, from `GTC`). Because a full codon (3 bases) was inserted, the reading frame is not shifted. This is an in-frame insertion. The protein is altered but may still be functional.\n\n**5. Mutant 4:**\n*   Sequence: 5’-**ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT**...-3’\n*   Changes from intact gene: `CTC` -> `TAC` (missense mutation, Leu -> Tyr) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon.\n*   Effect: This mutation causes one amino acid change and the deletion of one amino acid (Glycine, from `GGT`). Because a full codon was deleted, this is an in-frame deletion. The protein is altered but may still be functional.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon very early in the gene. This leads to the production of a severely truncated and non-functional protein. This is the most effective way among the given options to \"knock out\" the gene's function and thus eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine which mutation will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to analyze the effect of each mutation on the gene's protein product. The goal is to find the mutation most likely to result in a non-functional protein.\n\nThe intact gene sequence begins with `5’-ATG TTT CTC...`, where `ATG` is the start codon. The protein synthesis starts here.\n\nLet's analyze each mutant:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC...`\n    *   Compared to the intact gene (`ATG TTT CTC`), the second codon `TTT` has changed to `TTC`. Both `TTT` and `TTC` code for the amino acid Phenylalanine, making this a **silent mutation** with no effect on the protein sequence.\n    *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, which substitutes one amino acid for another. A missense mutation might alter or even eliminate protein function, but it is not guaranteed. The effect depends on the importance of that specific amino acid to the protein's structure and function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA...`\n    *   The second codon change (`TTT` to `TTC`) is a silent mutation, as in Mutant 1.\n    *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This type of change is called a **nonsense mutation**. It causes protein synthesis to terminate prematurely, resulting in a very short, truncated protein (in this case, only two amino acids long). A truncated protein is almost always non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...`\n    *   This sequence appears to have multiple single-base changes compared to the intact gene. However, a closer look at the sequence `ATGTTT**T**ACG...` reveals an insertion of a single nucleotide (`T`) after the second codon.\n    *   An insertion of a number of bases not divisible by three causes a **frameshift mutation**. This alters the three-base-pair reading frame for all subsequent codons, leading to a completely different and usually non-functional amino acid sequence, which often ends in a premature stop codon. Like a nonsense mutation, a frameshift mutation is very likely to eliminate protein function.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...`\n    *   This sequence is difficult to interpret as a single, simple mutational event like those typically caused by EMS. It appears to involve multiple substitutions or a combination of a substitution and a deletion. For instance, if we assume the `GGT` codon was deleted and the `CTC` codon was changed to `TAC`, this would be a complex mutation. An in-frame deletion (of 3 bases) would remove an amino acid, which may or may not eliminate function, while a missense mutation has an uncertain effect. Due to its complexity and ambiguity, it is a less likely candidate.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBoth a nonsense mutation (Mutant 2) and a frameshift mutation (Mutant 3) are highly likely to result in a complete loss of protein function. However, the problem states that the mutants were generated using EMS. EMS is a chemical mutagen that primarily causes point mutations (substitutions), particularly G:C to A:T transitions, and is less likely to cause insertions or deletions.\n\n*   The change in **Mutant 2** (`CTC` to `TAA`) is a point mutation (a substitution).\n*   The change in **Mutant 3** is an insertion.\n\nGiven that EMS was used, a point mutation is a more probable event than an insertion. The nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is a point mutation that is virtually guaranteed to eliminate the protein's function by creating a severely truncated product. Therefore, it is the most probable mutation to achieve the desired outcome.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nTo identify the mutation most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to find the one that would most severely disrupt the function of the gene responsible for its synthesis. This is typically achieved by a mutation that leads to a non-functional or truncated protein.\n\n### Analysis of the Mutations\n\nFirst, let's establish the reading frame from the intact gene sequence. The sequence begins with `ATG`, the start codon, so the codons are read in groups of three from the beginning.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT`…-3’\n    *   This translates to: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n\nNow, let's analyze each mutant:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT`…-3’\n    *   Compared to the intact gene, the `TTT` codon is now `TTC`, and `CTC` is now `TAC`.\n    *   `TTT` to `TTC` both code for Phenylalanine (a silent mutation).\n    *   `CTC` (Leucine) changes to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, which substitutes one amino acid for another. While this could potentially affect the protein's function, it might also have little to no effect, especially if the amino acids have similar properties or are not in a critical region of the protein. The protein is still produced at full length.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT`…-3’\n    *   Here, the `CTC` codon for Leucine has been changed to `TAA`.\n    *   `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This type of change is called a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   This mutation causes translation to stop prematurely, resulting in a severely shortened protein (only two amino acids long in this case). A truncated protein of this nature is almost certain to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT`…-3’\n    *   Comparing the codons to the intact gene:\n        *   `CTC` (Leucine) changes to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n        *   `ACT` (Threonine) changes to `GTC` (Valine).\n    *   This mutant contains at least two **missense mutations**. Similar to Mutant 1, this changes amino acids but still produces a full-length protein. The functional impact is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT`…-3’\n    *   Comparing the codons to the intact gene:\n        *   `CTC` (Leucine) changes to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n        *   `GGT` (Glycine) changes to `GCT` (Alanine).\n    *   This mutant also contains two **missense mutations**. Like mutants 1 and 3, it produces a full-length protein with a few amino acid changes, making the loss of function less certain than a nonsense mutation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAmong the given options, a nonsense mutation is the most likely to cause a complete loss of function. Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the protein-coding sequence. This will halt protein synthesis and produce a tiny, non-functional peptide, thereby eliminating the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound. While frameshift mutations are also highly effective at knocking out genes, Mutant 2 clearly and unambiguously represents a nonsense mutation, the most severe type among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, the most effective strategy is to \"knock out\" the gene responsible for its synthesis. This means introducing a mutation that renders the protein produced by the gene non-functional. Let's analyze the effects of each mutation.\n\nThe intact gene's initial codons are:\n`5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT...-3’`\nThis translates to the amino acid sequence:\nMet - Phe - Leu - Ala...\n\nNow let's examine the mutants:\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n    *   The codons are `ATG` (Met), `TTC` (Phe), and `TAC` (Tyr).\n    *   This is a **missense mutation**, where one amino acid (Leucine) is replaced by another (Tyrosine). While this might alter the protein's function, it doesn't guarantee it will be completely non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    *   The codons are `ATG` (Met), `TTC` (Phe), and `TAA`.\n    *   `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This type of mutation is called a **nonsense mutation**. It causes translation to halt prematurely, resulting in a very short, truncated protein (only two amino acids long). A nonsense mutation that occurs so early in the gene sequence is highly likely to produce a non-functional protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’`\n    *   This sequence contains multiple amino acid changes compared to the original.\n    *   This represents multiple **missense mutations**. Like Mutant 1, it results in a full-length protein with some altered amino acids. This might affect function, but it is less certain to eliminate it entirely compared to a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   Comparing this to the intact gene, a missense mutation has occurred (`CTC` to `TAC`), and the `GGT` codon has been deleted.\n    *   Since a full codon (three bases) was removed, the reading frame is not shifted. This is an **in-frame deletion**. The resulting protein will be missing one amino acid (Glycine) and have another substituted (Leucine to Tyrosine). This is less likely to completely abolish protein function than a premature stop codon.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe most effective mutation for eliminating the function of a protein is the one that prevents a full-length, functional version from being made. The nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a stop signal at the very beginning of the protein-coding sequence. This is the most probable option to successfully eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nTo solve this problem, we need to analyze the genetic mutations in each mutant line and determine which one is most likely to result in a non-functional protein, thereby eliminating the production of the anti-nutritional compound. A non-functional protein is most reliably produced by a mutation that severely disrupts the gene's reading frame or introduces a premature stop codon.\n\nLet's break down the DNA sequence into codons (three-base units) and translate them into amino acids for the intact gene and each mutant. The standard genetic code will be used for translation. The gene starts with the `ATG` start codon.\n\n**Intact Gene Sequence:**\n`5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA-3’`\n*   **Translation:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr - Ser - Val - Asp - Glu - His - Ile - Tyr - Cys - Arg...\n\nNow, let's analyze each mutant:\n\n**Mutant 1:**\n*   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC…TGA-3’`\n*   Comparison with Intact:\n    *   Codon 2: `TTT` -> `TTC`. Both codons code for Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a **silent mutation**.\n    *   Codon 3: `CTC` -> `TAC`. `CTC` codes for Leucine (Leu), while `TAC` codes for Tyrosine (Tyr). This is a **missense mutation**, which changes one amino acid.\n*   **Effect:** A single amino acid change might or might not inactivate the protein. Its function could be reduced, altered, or unaffected. It is not the most certain way to eliminate function.\n\n**Mutant 2:**\n*   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC…TGA-3’`\n*   Comparison with Intact:\n    *   Codon 2: `TTT` -> `TTC`. This is a silent mutation (Phe).\n    *   Codon 3: `CTC` -> `TAA`. `CTC` codes for Leucine (Leu), while `TAA` is a **stop codon**.\n*   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. It introduces a premature stop codon very early in the sequence. The translation will terminate after the second amino acid, producing a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe). This truncated protein will be non-functional. This is the most likely mutation to completely eliminate the synthesis of the target compound.\n\n**Mutant 3:**\n*   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA-3’`\n*   Comparison with Intact:\n    *   Codon 3: `CTC` -> `TAC`. Missense mutation (Leu -> Tyr).\n    *   Codon 6: `ACT` -> `GTC`. `ACT` codes for Threonine (Thr), while `GTC` codes for Valine (Val). This is another **missense mutation**.\n*   **Effect:** This mutant has two amino acid changes. While this increases the chance of disrupting the protein's function compared to a single missense mutation, it is still not as definitive as a premature stop codon. The protein is still fully translated.\n\n**Mutant 4:**\n*   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA-3’`\n*   Comparison with Intact: The mutant sequence is shorter.\n    *   Intact: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...` (Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly-Thr...)\n    *   Mutant: `ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...` (Met-Phe-Tyr-Ala-Thr...)\n    *   The sequence `CTC GCT GGT` (coding for Leu-Ala-Gly) in the intact gene has been effectively changed to `TAC GCT` (coding for Tyr-Ala), and the reading frame continues from there. This represents a combination of a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`) and a deletion of one codon (`GGT`).\n*   **Effect:** This is an **in-frame deletion** (deletion of 3 bases) combined with a missense mutation. The protein will be missing one amino acid (Glycine) and have another changed (Leu to Tyr), but the rest of the protein will be translated correctly. This might inactivate the protein, but like missense mutations, the outcome is not as certain as a nonsense mutation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe most effective mutation for eliminating a protein's function is the one that causes the most severe disruption. A nonsense mutation (Mutant 2) introduces a premature stop codon, leading to a severely truncated and guaranteed non-functional protein. The other mutations (missense and in-frame deletion) result in a full-length or near-full-length protein with one or two amino acid changes, which may or may not be sufficient to eliminate its function. Therefore, Mutant 2 is the most probable candidate to achieve the desired outcome.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the most effective mutation:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein, which is encoded by a specific gene. To stop the compound's synthesis, we need to disrupt the gene so that it no longer produces a functional protein.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Gene:** The intact gene sequence begins with `5’-ATG...`, which is the universal start codon (Methionine). It ends with `...TGA-3’`, which is one of the three stop codons. The protein synthesis starts at `ATG` and continues until a stop codon is reached.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Types of Mutations:**\n    *   **Silent Mutation:** A change in the DNA sequence that does not change the amino acid sequence. This has no effect on the protein.\n    *   **Missense Mutation:** A change in the DNA that results in a different amino acid being incorporated into the protein. This *might* disrupt protein function, especially if the change occurs in a critical region, but it could also have little to no effect.\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** A change in the DNA that results in a premature stop codon. This truncates the protein, and if it occurs early in the sequence, it almost always results in a non-functional protein.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation (Insertion/Deletion):** The insertion or deletion of nucleotides (not in a multiple of three). This shifts the reading frame, changing every subsequent amino acid. This typically leads to a completely different and non-functional protein, often encountering a premature stop codon in the new frame.\n\n4.  **Analyze Each Mutant Sequence:** We will break down each DNA sequence into three-letter codons and translate them into amino acids to see the effect of the mutation. The genetic code will be used for translation (`_` represents a stop codon).\n\n    *   **Intact Gene:**\n        *   DNA: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ...`\n        *   Protein: `Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr ...`\n        *   This is our baseline for a functional protein.\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:**\n        *   DNA: `ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT ...`\n        *   Protein: `Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Gly - Thr ...`\n        *   **Analysis:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It changes a single amino acid. This might not be enough to completely inactivate the protein.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:**\n        *   DNA: `ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT ...`\n        *   Protein: `Met - Phe - STOP`\n        *   **Analysis:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAA` (a stop codon). This is a **nonsense mutation**. Translation will stop after the second amino acid, producing a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide. This peptide will almost certainly be non-functional.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:**\n        *   DNA: `ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT ...`\n        *   Protein: `Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Gly - Val - Thr ...`\n        *   **Analysis:** This sequence contains two changes compared to the intact gene: `CTC` (Leu) -> `TAC` (Tyr) and `ACT` (Thr) -> `GTC` (Val). These are two **missense mutations**. While two changes are more disruptive than one, it is still not guaranteed to eliminate function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:**\n        *   DNA: `ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT ...`\n        *   Protein: `Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Thr - Ser ...`\n        *   **Analysis:** This sequence also contains two changes: `CTC` (Leu) -> `TAC` (Tyr) and `GGT` (Gly) -> `ACT` (Thr). These are two **missense mutations**. Again, this is not as certain to eliminate function as a premature stop codon.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The most effective way to ensure a gene is knocked out is to prevent the synthesis of a full-length protein. Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the protein-coding sequence. This is the most drastic and definitive change among the options, making it the most probable mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nTo determine which mutation will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to identify the mutation that is most likely to create a non-functional protein. A non-functional protein is most reliably produced by a mutation that causes a major disruption, such as a premature stop to protein synthesis.\n\nLet's analyze the effect of each mutation by translating the DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence. The genetic code is read in three-base-pair units called codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n**Intact Gene (Control)**\n*   **DNA Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’\n*   **Codons:** `ATG` (Methionine/Start), `TTT` (Phenylalanine), `CTC` (Leucine), `GCT` (Alanine), `GGT` (Glycine)\n*   **Protein Sequence:** Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly...\nThis is the functional protein that produces the unwanted compound.\n\n**Analysis of Mutants**\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   **DNA Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’\n    *   **Changes:** The second codon `TTT` becomes `TTC`, and the third codon `CTC` becomes `TAC`.\n    *   **Effect:**\n        *   `TTT` -> `TTC`: Both codons code for Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a **silent mutation** with no effect on the protein.\n        *   `CTC` (Leucine) -> `TAC` (Tyrosine): This is a **missense mutation**, which substitutes one amino acid for another. This might alter the protein's function, but it is not guaranteed to inactivate it.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   **DNA Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’\n    *   **Changes:** The second codon `TTT` becomes `TTC`, and the third codon `CTC` becomes `TAA`.\n    *   **Effect:**\n        *   `TTT` -> `TTC`: This is a silent mutation (Phe -> Phe).\n        *   `CTC` (Leucine) -> `TAA` (**STOP**): This is a **nonsense mutation**. The `TAA` codon is a stop codon, which signals the ribosome to terminate protein synthesis.\n    *   **Result:** Protein synthesis will stop after only two amino acids have been joined. The resulting product will be a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe), which will be completely non-functional. This mutation will almost certainly eliminate the protein's activity.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   **DNA Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’\n    *   **Changes:** This sequence contains two **missense mutations**: `CTC` (Leu) -> `TAC` (Tyr) and `ACT` (Thr) -> `GTC` (Val).

This is an **in-frame deletion** because a full codon (3 bases) is removed, which deletes an amino acid without shifting the reading frame. The resulting protein will be missing one amino acid and have another changed. This is a significant alteration but does not guarantee complete loss of function.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most severe because it introduces a premature stop codon very early in the gene. This will halt protein synthesis, resulting in a severely truncated and non-functional protein. This is the most reliable way to \"knock out\" the gene's function among the choices provided.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which mutation is most likely to result in a non-functional protein, thereby eliminating the production of the anti-nutritional compound. A non-functional protein is most reliably created by a mutation that causes a major disruption to the protein's structure, such as stopping its synthesis prematurely.\n\nLet's analyze the effect of each mutation by translating the DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence.

This is the functional protein.\n\n**2. Mutant 1 Analysis**\n*   **Sequence:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT`... -3’\n*   **Change:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). Note that the second codon `TTT` is changed to `TTC`, but both code for Phenylalanine, so this is a silent mutation.\n*   **Protein:** Met-Phe-Tyr-Ala-Gly...\n*   **Effect:** This is a **missense mutation**. It substitutes one amino acid for another. While this might affect the protein's function, it does not guarantee it will be non-functional. The protein is still produced at its full length.\n\n**3.

When the ribosome encounters this codon, it terminates translation. This results in a severely truncated protein containing only two amino acids. Such a short peptide is almost certain to be non-functional.\n\n**4. Mutant 3 Analysis**\n*   **Sequence:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT`... -3’\n*   **Change:** Two changes are present.

Mutant 4 Analysis**\n*   **Sequence:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT`... -3’\n*   **Change:** Comparing to the intact gene (`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), we see that the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`.\n*   **Protein:** Met-Phe-Tyr-Ala-Thr...\n*   **Effect:** This is a combination of a **missense mutation** (Leu -> Tyr) and an **in-frame deletion** (the Glycine codon `GGT` is removed). Because three bases (one full codon) were removed, the reading frame is not shifted. The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another amino acid changed. This alters the protein, but like a missense mutation, it doesn't guarantee a complete loss of function.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe most drastic and reliable way to eliminate a protein's function among the given options is to introduce a premature stop codon, as seen in Mutant 2.

This is the most probable mutation to completely eliminate the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’\n    *   **Change:** This sequence shows multiple single-base substitutions compared to the original, resulting in several amino acid changes (e.g., Leucine to Tyrosine, Threonine to Valine). These are multiple **missense mutations**. Similar to Mutant 1, this will alter the protein, but complete loss of function is less certain than with a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’\n    *   **Change:** This sequence also contains multiple **missense mutations** (e.g., Leucine to Tyrosine, Glycine to Threonine). Like the other missense mutations, the effect is not as predictably severe as a nonsense mutation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nMutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon very early in the protein-coding sequence. This nonsense mutation will lead to a severely truncated and non-functional protein, making it the most likely candidate to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nTo determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to find the mutation that will most probably result in a non-functional protein. This is typically achieved through a nonsense mutation (creating a premature stop codon) or a frameshift mutation (insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three). These mutations lead to a truncated or completely scrambled protein, which is almost always non-functional.\n\nLet's analyze the effect of each mutation by translating the DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence. The genetic code is read in triplets called codons, starting from the start codon ATG.\n\n**Intact Gene:**\n*   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT ... -3’\n*   **mRNA:** 5’-AUG UUU CUC GCU GGU ACU UCU ... -3’\n*   **Amino Acids:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr - Ser ...\n\nThis is the functional protein that produces the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nNow let's analyze each mutant:\n\n**Mutant 1:**\n*   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT ... -3’ (parsed from `ATGTTCTACGCT...`)\n*   **mRNA:** 5’-AUG UUC UAC GCU ... -3’\n*   **Amino Acids:** Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala ...\n*   **Effect:** The third codon, CTC (Leucine), has been changed to TAC (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, which substitutes one amino acid for another. While this *could* potentially inactivate the protein if the amino acid is in a critical location, it often results in a protein that is still functional. It is less likely to cause a complete knockout compared to other types of mutations.\n\n**Mutant 2:**\n*   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT ... -3’ (parsed from `ATGTTCTAAGCT...`)\n*   **mRNA:** 5’-AUG UUC UAA GCU ... -3’\n*   **Amino Acids:** Met - Phe - **STOP**\n*   **Effect:** The third codon, CTC (Leucine), has been changed to TAA, which is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. The synthesis of the protein will terminate prematurely after only two amino acids. The resulting polypeptide will be extremely short and certainly non-functional. This is a very effective way to knock out a gene's function.\n\n**Mutant 3:**\n*   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT **GTC** ACT TCT ... -3’ (parsed from `ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCT...`)\n*   **Effect:** Comparing this to the intact sequence (`...GCT GGT ACT...`), a new codon, GTC, has been inserted between GGT and ACT. This is an **in-frame insertion** of one codon (GTC codes for Valine). The resulting protein will have one extra amino acid but the rest of the reading frame is intact. This may or may not inactivate the protein, but it's less disruptive than a premature stop codon.\n\n**Mutant 4:**\n*   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT ... -3’ (parsed from `ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCT...`)\n*   **Effect:** Comparing this to the intact sequence (`...GCT GGT ACT...`), the codon GGT has been removed. This is an **in-frame deletion** of one codon. The resulting protein will be missing one amino acid (Glycine), but the rest of the reading frame will be correct. Similar to Mutant 3, this might not completely inactivate the protein.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe mutation in **Mutant 2** introduces a premature stop codon very early in the gene (the third codon). This will lead to the production of a severely truncated and non-functional protein. Therefore, this mutation is the most probable one to successfully eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nTo eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, the function of the gene responsible for its synthesis must be inactivated. This is often referred to as a \"gene knockout\". Analyzing the different types of mutations introduced in the mutant lines helps determine which is most likely to result in a non-functional protein.\n\n### Analysis of the Mutations:\n\nFirst, let's establish the reading frame of the intact gene. The sequence begins with `ATG`, which is the universal start codon for protein synthesis. The genetic code is read in triplets, or codons, from this point.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   **Codons & Amino Acids:**\n        *   `ATG` - Methionine (Start)\n        *   `TTT` - Phenylalanine\n        *   `CTC` - Leucine\n        *   `GCT` - Alanine\n\nNow let's examine the mutations:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n    *   The second codon `TTT` is changed to `TTC`. Both `TTT` and `TTC` code for Phenylalanine, so this is a silent mutation.\n    *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, which changes a single amino acid. A missense mutation might alter or reduce the protein's function, but it does not guarantee complete inactivation.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon** (also known as a nonsense codon).\n    *   This type of change is called a **nonsense mutation**. It causes translation to terminate prematurely, resulting in a severely truncated and almost certainly non-functional protein. Introducing a premature stop codon is a common and effective strategy for creating a gene knockout.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n    *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   The sixth codon `ACT` (Threonine) is changed to `GTC` (Valine).\n    *   This mutant has two **missense mutations**. While multiple amino acid changes increase the likelihood of disrupting protein function compared to a single change, it is still less certain to cause complete inactivation than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   This is a single **missense mutation**, similar to Mutant 1. It may or may not eliminate the protein's function.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe most effective mutation for eliminating the function of a gene is a nonsense mutation that introduces a premature stop codon early in the coding sequence. This leads to a truncated protein that is highly unlikely to be functional. Mutant 2 is the only one with a nonsense mutation (`TAA`) at the very beginning of the gene (the third codon). The other mutants only have missense mutations, which substitute one amino acid for another and may not completely abolish the protein's activity. Therefore, Mutant 2 is the most probable candidate to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nMy plan is to analyze each mutation to determine its effect on the protein produced by the gene. The goal is to find the mutation that is most likely to completely inactivate the protein, thus eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n1.  **Establish a baseline:** I will first translate the sequence of the intact gene to understand the original amino acid sequence.\n2.  **Define a translation tool:** I will create a standard genetic code dictionary (DNA codon to amino acid) and a function to perform the translation.\n3.  **Analyze each mutant:** I will translate each of the four mutant sequences.\n4.  **Compare the effects:**\n    *   A **missense mutation** changes one amino acid. This might alter or reduce the protein's function, but it may not eliminate it.\n    *   A **nonsense mutation** introduces a premature stop codon. This truncates the protein, and if it happens early in the sequence, it almost certainly results in a non-functional protein.\n    *   A **frameshift mutation** (caused by an insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three) changes the reading frame. This alters all subsequent amino acids and often leads to a premature stop codon, resulting in a non-functional protein.\n5.  **Conclusion:** I will identify the mutation that causes the most severe disruption. A nonsense or frameshift mutation early in the gene is the most likely candidate to achieve the desired outcome. I will then select the corresponding option.\n\n```python\ndef solve_mutation_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes gene mutations to find the one most likely to\n    inactivate the resulting protein.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the genetic code and the DNA sequences.\n    genetic_code = {\n        'ATA':'I', 'ATC':'I', 'ATT':'I', 'ATG':'M',\n        'ACA':'T', 'ACC':'T', 'ACG':'T', 'ACT':'T',\n        'AAC':'N', 'AAT':'N', 'AAA':'K', 'AAG':'K',\n        'AGC':'S', 'AGT':'S', 'TCA':'S', 'TCC':'S', 'TCG':'S', 'TCT':'S',\n        'AGA':'R', 'AGG':'R', 'CGA':'R', 'CGC':'R', 'CGG':'R', 'CGT':'R',\n        'CTA':'L', 'CTC':'L', 'CTG':'L', 'CTT':'L', 'TTA':'L', 'TTG':'L',\n        'CCA':'P', 'CCC':'P', 'CCG':'P', 'CCT':'P',\n        'CAC':'H', 'CAT':'H', 'CAA':'Q', 'CAG':'Q',\n        'GTA':'V', 'GTC':'V', 'GTG':'V', 'GTT':'V',\n        'GCA':'A', 'GCC':'A', 'GCG':'A', 'GCT':'A',\n        'GAC':'D', 'GAT':'D', 'GAA':'E', 'GAG':'E',\n        'GGA':'G', 'GGC':'G', 'GGG':'G', 'GGT':'G',\n        'TTC':'F', 'TTT':'F', 'TAC':'Y', 'TAT':'Y',\n        'TGC':'C', 'TGT':'C', 'TGG':'W',\n        'TAA':'_STOP_', 'TAG':'_STOP_', 'TGA':'_STOP_'\n    }\n\n    sequences = {\n        \"Intact gene\": \"ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\",\n        \"Mutant 1\": \"ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\",\n        \"Mutant 2\": \"ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\",\n        \"Mutant 3\": \"ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\",\n        \"Mutant 4\": \"ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Define a translation function.\n    def translate(dna_seq):\n        protein = []\n        for i in range(0, len(dna_seq) - (len(dna_seq) % 3), 3):\n            codon = dna_seq[i:i+3]\n            amino_acid = genetic_code.get(codon, 'X') # 'X' for unknown\n            protein.append(amino_acid)\n            if amino_acid == '_STOP_':\n                break\n        return \"-\".join(protein)\n\n    # Step 3: Analyze each sequence and print the results.\n    print(\"Analysis of Gene Sequences:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Translate and analyze the intact gene\n    intact_protein = translate(sequences[\"Intact gene\"])\n    print(f\"Intact gene protein (start): {intact_protein}\")\n    print(\"This is the reference for a functional protein.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    \n    # Translate and analyze Mutant 1\n    # Intact: ATG TTT CTC...

To do this, we need to inactivate the protein that this gene encodes. The most effective way to inactivate a protein is to prevent its correct and full-length synthesis. We need to find the mutation that is *most likely* to cause a complete loss of function of the protein.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Intact Gene Sequence**\nThe intact gene sequence begins with `5’-ATG...`. In molecular biology, `ATG` is the standard start codon, which signals the beginning of protein translation and codes for the amino acid Methionine. The protein is built by reading the DNA sequence in groups of three nucleotides, called codons.\nThe initial reading frame is:\n`ATG` (Methionine - START)\n`TTT` (Phenylalanine)\n`CTC` (Leucine)\n`GCT` (Alanine)\n`GGT` (Glycine)\n...and so on.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Each Mutant for its Effect on the Protein**\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   Intact: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT...`\n    *   Mutant: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...`\n    *   **Change:** The codon `TTT` is changed to `TTC`, and `CTC` is changed to `TAC`.\n    *   **Effect:**\n        *   `TTT` (Phenylalanine) -> `TTC` (Phenylalanine): This is a **silent mutation**; the amino acid does not change.\n        *   `CTC` (Leucine) -> `TAC` (Tyrosine): This is a **missense mutation**; it substitutes one amino acid for another.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This mutation results in a full-length protein with only one amino acid changed. While this *could* potentially affect the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to inactivate it. Many single amino acid changes have little to no effect.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   Intact: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT...`\n    *   Mutant: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...`\n    *   **Change:** The codon `CTC` is changed to `TAA`.\n    *   **Effect:** `TAA` is one of the three **stop codons** (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). This type of mutation is called a **nonsense mutation**. It signals the ribosome to stop translation prematurely.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The protein synthesis will stop after the second amino acid. This will produce a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Methionine-Phenylalanine) instead of the full-length functional protein. This is almost certain to completely eliminate the protein's function.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   Intact: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...`\n    *   Mutant: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT...` (Note: a `T` is inserted between `TTT` and `C` from `CTC`)\n    *   **Change:** A single nucleotide (`T`) has been inserted.\n    *   **Effect:** This is a **frameshift mutation**. The insertion shifts the three-letter reading frame for all subsequent codons. The new amino acid sequence will be completely different from the original from that point onwards.\n    *   **Conclusion:** A frameshift mutation early in a gene is extremely likely to produce a non-functional protein. The altered sequence often creates a premature stop codon by chance a short distance downstream. This is also a very effective way to knock out a gene.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   Intact: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...`\n    *   Mutant: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...`\n    *   **Change:** A comparison shows that `CTC` has changed to `TAC` (a missense mutation, as in Mutant 1) and the `GGT` codon has been deleted entirely.\n    *   **Effect:** This is an **in-frame deletion** (a deletion of 3 nucleotides, which removes one amino acid without shifting the reading frame) combined with a missense mutation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** A nearly full-length protein is produced that is simply missing one amino acid (Glycine) and has another changed (Leucine to Tyrosine). Like the missense mutation, this may or may not inactivate the protein. It is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Mutations and Select the Best Candidate**\nWe are looking for the mutation *most likely* to eliminate the compound.\n*   **Low Probability:** Mutant 1 (missense) and Mutant 4 (in-frame deletion) produce a protein that is still mostly intact. Their ability to knock out function is uncertain.\n*   **High Probability:** Mutant 2 (nonsense) and Mutant 3 (frameshift) are both highly effective at creating non-functional proteins.\n*   **Final Choice:** The nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** introduces a definitive \"STOP\" signal for protein synthesis right at the beginning of the gene. This guarantees the production of a severely truncated and non-functional peptide. This is arguably the most direct and certain method of gene inactivation among the given choices.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nAn effective way to eliminate a gene's function is to introduce a mutation that results in a non-functional or truncated protein. The most severe mutations are typically frameshift mutations (insertions or deletions not divisible by three) or nonsense mutations (which introduce a premature stop codon).\n\nLet's analyze each mutation by comparing it to the intact gene and translating the resulting sequence. The genetic code is read in triplets called codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n**Intact Gene:**\n*   **Sequence:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT ... TGA-3’`\n*   **Codons:** ATG (Met), TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser)\n*   **Protein:** Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly-Thr-Ser...\n*   This sequence produces the full-length, functional protein responsible for the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n**Mutant 1:**\n*   **Sequence:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT ... TGA-3’`\n*   **Comparison:** The original `TTT CTC` is changed to `TTC TAC`.\n    *   `TTT` -> `TTC`: Both codons code for Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a **silent mutation**.\n    *   `CTC` -> `TAC`: `CTC` codes for Leucine (Leu), while `TAC` codes for Tyrosine (Tyr). This is a **missense mutation**, changing one amino acid in the protein.\n*   **Protein:** Met-Phe-**Tyr**-Ala-Gly-Thr-Ser...\n*   **Effect:** A single amino acid change might alter the protein's function, but it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely.\n\n**Mutant 2:**\n*   **Sequence:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT ... TGA-3’`\n*   **Comparison:** The original `TTT CTC` is changed to `TTC TAA`.\n    *   `TTT` -> `TTC`: Silent mutation (Phe -> Phe).\n    *   `CTC` -> `TAA`: `CTC` codes for Leucine (Leu), while `TAA` is a **stop codon**.\n*   **Protein:** Met-Phe-**STOP**.\n*   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. It introduces a premature stop codon at the third position. The cell will only produce a tiny, two-amino-acid-long peptide (Met-Phe). This resulting peptide will be completely non-functional, thus eliminating the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n**Mutant 3:**\n*   **Sequence:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT ... TGA-3’`\n*   **Comparison:** The original `CTC` and `ACT` are changed to `TAC` and `GTC`.\n    *   `CTC` (Leu) -> `TAC` (Tyr): A missense mutation.\n    *   `ACT` (Thr) -> `GTC` (Val): Another missense mutation.\n*   **Protein:** Met-Phe-**Tyr**-Ala-Gly-**Val**-Ser...\n*   **Effect:** Two amino acids are changed. This is more likely to disrupt function than a single missense mutation, but it is still less severe than a premature stop codon. The full-length protein is still produced, and it might retain some function.\n\n**Mutant 4:**\n*   **Sequence:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT ... TGA-3’`\n*   **Comparison:** A comparison of the strings shows that `GGT` (the 5th codon) has been deleted, and `CTC` has been changed to `TAC`.\n    *   `CTC` (Leu) -> `TAC` (Tyr): A missense mutation.\n    *   Deletion of `GGT`: This is a deletion of three nucleotides.\n*   **Protein:** Met-Phe-**Tyr**-Ala-Thr-Ser...\n*   **Effect:** This is an in-frame deletion (a deletion of a full codon) combined with a missense mutation. The protein will be missing one amino acid (Glycine) and have another one changed (Leu -> Tyr). The reading frame for the rest of the gene is preserved. While this will alter the protein, it is not guaranteed to completely inactivate it.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe mutation in **Mutant 2** introduces a premature stop codon, which will terminate protein synthesis very early. This is the most reliable way among the given options to produce a non-functional protein and therefore eliminate the unwanted compound.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nTo eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, the goal is to create a non-functional protein. This is most reliably achieved by a mutation that causes a complete loss of function. Let's analyze the effect of each mutation on the protein's synthesis and structure.\n\nThe intact gene begins `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT...`, which translates to the amino acid sequence: Met-Phe-Leu-Ala... The sequence `ATG` is the start codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...`\n    *   This sequence contains two changes compared to the intact gene:\n        1.  `TTT` -> `TTC`: Both codons code for Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a *silent mutation* and has no effect on the amino acid sequence.\n        2.  `CTC` -> `TAC`: This changes the codon for Leucine (Leu) to Tyrosine (Tyr). This is a *missense mutation*.\n    *   A missense mutation changes a single amino acid. While this might alter or reduce the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely. The protein might still be produced and retain some or all of its activity.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...`\n    *   This sequence has a change from `CTC` to `TAA`.\n    *   The codon `TAA` is a stop codon (also known as a nonsense codon).\n    *   This type of mutation is called a *nonsense mutation*. It introduces a premature stop signal, causing protein synthesis to halt.\n    *   The result is a severely truncated protein (in this case, only two amino acids long: Met-Phe). A protein this short is almost certain to be non-functional. This is a highly effective way to knock out gene function.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...`\n    *   A comparison of the intact sequence (`ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT...`) with Mutant 3 (`ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTT...`) reveals an insertion of a nucleotide (`T`) after the first two codons.\n    *   Intact codons: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...`\n    *   Mutant 3 codons: `ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...`\n    *   Wait, the provided sequence strings show a different mutation. Let's re-examine the full strings:\n        *   Intact:  `5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`\n        *   Mutant 3: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`\n        *   The change is an insertion of a 'T' at position 6. This shifts the reading frame for all subsequent codons.\n    *   This is a *frameshift mutation*. The insertion of a single nucleotide alters the grouping of bases into codons, changing every amino acid downstream of the mutation. This almost always leads to a premature stop codon and a non-functional protein. Like a nonsense mutation, a frameshift is highly likely to eliminate the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT ACG CTA CTT CTG...`\n    *   Comparing the intact sequence (`...GCT GGT ACT...`) with Mutant 4 (`...GCT ACT...`) shows a deletion of the three nucleotides `GGT`.\n    *   The `GGT` codon codes for the amino acid Glycine. Since three nucleotides (a full codon) are removed, the reading frame is not shifted.\n    *   This is an *in-frame deletion*. The resulting protein will be missing one amino acid (Glycine) but will otherwise have a normal sequence. The loss of a single amino acid may or may not eliminate the protein's function, making this outcome less certain than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth the nonsense mutation (Mutant 2) and the frameshift mutation (Mutant 3) are highly likely to produce a non-functional protein and thus eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. However, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a stop codon (`TAA`) at the third position, guaranteeing the production of a tiny, non-functional dipeptide. This is the most direct and certain method among the choices to completely halt the synthesis of the target protein.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nTo determine which mutation will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to analyze how each change in the DNA sequence affects the resulting protein. The goal is to find the mutation that is most likely to create a non-functional protein.\n\n### Analysis of the Gene and Mutations:\n\nThe intact gene sequence begins with `5’-ATG TTT CTC...-3’`. Translation starts at the `ATG` codon. Let's analyze the effect of each mutation:\n\n*   **Intact Gene Translation:**\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Met)\n    *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (Phe)\n    *   `CTC` -> Leucine (Leu)\n    *   The protein starts with Met-Phe-Leu...\n\n*   **Mutant 1: `5’-ATGTTCTACGCT...-3’`**\n    *   This sequence has two changes compared to the intact gene: `TTT` becomes `TTC`, and `CTC` becomes `TAC`.\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Met)\n    *   `TTC` -> Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a *silent mutation* because both `TTT` and `TTC` code for the same amino acid.\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Tyr). This is a *missense mutation* because it changes the amino acid from Leucine to Tyrosine. A missense mutation alters the protein but may or may not eliminate its function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2: `5’-ATGTTCTAAGCT...-3’`**\n    *   This sequence also has changes: `TTT` becomes `TTC`, and `CTC` becomes `TAA`.\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Met)\n    *   `TTC` -> Phenylalanine (Phe). (Silent mutation)\n    *   `TAA` -> **STOP**. This is a *nonsense mutation* because it introduces a premature stop codon. This type of mutation leads to the production of a shortened, incomplete, and likely non-functional protein. Terminating the protein after only two amino acids makes it almost certain that the enzyme will lose its function.\n\n*   **Mutant 3: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTT...-3’`**\n    *   This sequence has multiple changes: `CTC` becomes `TAC`, and `ACT` becomes `GTC`, among others.\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Met)\n    *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (Phe)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Tyr) (Missense mutation: Leu -> Tyr)\n    *   `GCT` -> Alanine (Ala)\n    *   `GGT` -> Glycine (Gly)\n    *   `GTC` -> Valine (Val) (Missense mutation: Thr -> Val)\n    *   This mutant has multiple missense mutations, which change several amino acids. While this could alter or reduce the protein's function, it is less certain to eliminate it completely compared to a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCT...-3’`**\n    *   This sequence has a missense mutation (`CTC` -> `TAC`) and a deletion of the three bases `GGT`.\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Met)\n    *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (Phe)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Tyr) (Missense mutation: Leu -> Tyr)\n    *   The `GGT` codon, which codes for Glycine, is deleted.\n    *   Because exactly three nucleotides are removed, the reading frame is preserved. This is called an *in-frame deletion*. The resulting protein will be missing one amino acid (Glycine) and have one substitution (Leu -> Tyr). While this can affect protein function, it is not as severe as a frameshift or nonsense mutation.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nComparing the four mutants, Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the protein-coding sequence. Nonsense mutations are one of the most effective ways to cause a complete loss of protein function, as they result in a severely truncated protein. The other mutations result in amino acid substitutions or a small in-frame deletion, which are less likely to completely abolish the protein's activity. Therefore, Mutant 2 is the most probable to eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nTo eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, the goal is to inactivate the gene responsible for its synthesis. This is most effectively achieved by a mutation that results in a non-functional or severely truncated protein. Let's analyze the effect of each mutation on the protein sequence, keeping in mind that protein synthesis starts at the `ATG` codon and terminates at a stop codon.\n\n*   **Intact gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...TGA-3’`\n    *   This sequence translates to: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...TGA-3’`\n    *   The mutation changes the third codon from `CTC` to `TAC`.\n    *   `CTC` codes for the amino acid Leucine.\n    *   `TAC` codes for the amino acid Tyrosine.\n    *   This is a **missense mutation**: it changes one amino acid for another. This might or might not inactivate the protein, depending on the importance of this specific amino acid to the protein's structure and function. It is not a guaranteed method of elimination.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTT TAA GCT GGT...TGA-3’`\n    *   The mutation changes the third codon from `CTC` to `TAA`.\n    *   `TAA` is one of the three standard stop codons (along with `TGA` and `TAG`).\n    *   This is a **nonsense mutation**: it introduces a premature stop codon. The translation of the protein will halt at this point, resulting in a very short, truncated protein containing only two amino acids (Met-Phe). This truncated protein is almost certain to be non-functional, thus eliminating the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...TGA-3’`\n    *   This mutant sequence contains multiple changes compared to the intact gene.\n    *   The third codon changes from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   The sixth codon changes from `ACT` (Threonine) to `GTC` (Valine).\n    *   The seventh codon changes from `TCT` (Serine) to `ACT` (Threonine).\n    *   These are all **missense mutations**, changing three different amino acids in the protein chain. While multiple changes increase the likelihood of disrupting protein function compared to a single missense mutation, it is still not as definitive as a premature stop codon. The full-length protein will be produced, and it might retain some or all of its function.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...TGA-3’`\n    *   Comparing this to the intact sequence reveals two changes: the third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and the fifth codon, `GGT` (Glycine), has been deleted entirely.\n    *   This results in a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion** (a deletion of a full three-nucleotide codon). The reading frame for the rest of the gene is preserved. The final protein will have one amino acid changed and be one amino acid shorter. This could disrupt the protein's function, but like missense mutations, it is not a guaranteed loss of function.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe most reliable way to eliminate the function of the gene is to introduce a premature stop codon, which is what occurs in Mutant 2. This nonsense mutation will cause protein synthesis to terminate almost immediately, ensuring the production of the anti-nutritional compound is stopped.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\n*   **Goal:** To eliminate an anti-nutritional compound by mutating the gene responsible for its synthesis. This means we are looking for the mutation most likely to cause a complete loss of function of the resulting protein. This is often called a \"knockout\" or \"null\" mutation.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Intact Gene:**\n    *   The gene sequence begins with `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT...-3’`.\n    *   `ATG` is the start codon, coding for Methionine (Met).\n    *   The ribosome reads the sequence in groups of three called codons.\n    *   Intact codons and their corresponding amino acids:\n        *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Met)\n        *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (Phe)\n        *   `CTC` -> Leucine (Leu)\n        *   `GCT` -> Alanine (Ala)\n    *   So, the normal, functional protein starts with the amino acid sequence: Met-Phe-Leu-Ala...\n\n*   **Analysis of the Mutants:** We need to determine the effect of each mutation on the final protein.\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:**\n        *   The sequence shows a change from `...CTC...` (Leucine) to `...TAC...` (Tyrosine).\n        *   Original protein: Met-Phe-**Leu**-Ala...\n        *   Mutant 1 protein: Met-Phe-**Tyr**-Ala...\n        *   This is a **missense mutation**: one amino acid is swapped for another. This might disrupt the protein's function, or it might have little to no effect. It is not a guaranteed way to eliminate the protein's activity.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:**\n        *   The sequence shows a change from `...CTC...` (Leucine) to `...TAA...`.\n        *   `TAA` is a **STOP codon**.\n        *   When the ribosome reads `TAA`, it terminates translation.\n        *   Original protein: Met-Phe-Leu-Ala...\n        *   Mutant 2 protein: Met-Phe-STOP. The resulting product is just a tiny two-amino-acid peptide (a dipeptide).\n        *   This is a **nonsense mutation**. Because it occurs so early in the gene (at the third codon), the resulting protein is severely truncated and is virtually certain to be non-functional.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:**\n        *   Comparing the intact and mutant strings reveals a probable **frameshift mutation**. An extra nucleotide has been inserted, which shifts the \"reading frame\" of the codons.\n        *   Original frame: `ATG | TTT | CTC | GCT | ...`\n        *   Mutant frame (example of an insertion): `ATG | TTT | T`**C**`TC | GCT | ...` becomes `ATG | TTT | TCT | CGC | ...`\n        *   This changes every single amino acid from the point of the mutation onwards. A frameshift almost always leads to a completely non-functional protein, and often introduces a premature stop codon downstream. This is also a very effective way to knock out a gene.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:**\n        *   This mutation appears to be a deletion of three nucleotides (`GGT`).\n        *   Since three nucleotides make up one codon, this is an **in-frame deletion**.\n        *   The result is a protein that is simply missing one amino acid. Like a missense mutation, this might or might not disable the protein. It is less likely to cause a complete loss of function compared to a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   We are looking for the mutation that will **most probably** eliminate the compound. Both a frameshift (Mutant 3) and a nonsense mutation (Mutant 2) are highly likely to create a non-functional protein.\n    *   However, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a STOP codon at the very beginning of the protein sequence (the 3rd codon). This immediately terminates translation, producing a useless dipeptide. This is the most direct and certain way among the choices to guarantee a complete loss of function. Therefore, it is the most probable to achieve the desired outcome.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nTo determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to find the mutation that is most likely to result in a completely non-functional protein. This type of mutation is often called a \"knockout\" or \"null\" mutation. Let's analyze the effect of each mutation on the protein sequence by translating the DNA codons.\n\nThe beginning of the intact gene's coding sequence is:\n**5’- ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ... -3’**\n\nTranslated into amino acids, this becomes:\n*   `ATG` -> Methionine (Start)\n*   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine\n*   `CTC` -> Leucine\n*   `GCT` -> Alanine\n*   `GGT` -> Glycine\n**Protein sequence:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - ...\n\nNow let's analyze each mutant:\n\n**Mutant 1:**\n*   DNA: `5’- ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ... -3’`\n*   Change: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, where one amino acid is replaced by another.\n*   Effect: The protein will have a single amino acid change near the beginning. While this might alter the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to completely inactivate it. The protein could still be partially or fully functional.\n\n**Mutant 2:**\n*   DNA: `5’- ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ... -3’`\n*   Change: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n*   Effect: When the ribosome translates the mRNA, it will encounter the stop codon `TAA` and terminate protein synthesis. The resulting product will be a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Methionine-Phenylalanine). This severely truncated protein will be completely non-functional. This is the most reliable way to eliminate the gene's function.\n\n**Mutant 3:**\n*   DNA: `5’- ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ... -3’`\n*   Change: This sequence contains two changes compared to the intact gene: `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and further down, `ACT` (Threonine) is changed to `GTC` (Valine). These are two separate **missense mutations**.\n*   Effect: The resulting protein has two amino acid substitutions. While more disruptive than a single substitution, it's still not as certain to cause a complete loss of function as a premature stop codon.\n\n**Mutant 4:**\n*   DNA: `5’- ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT ... -3’`\n*   Change: Comparing this to the intact sequence (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), we see `CTC` has changed to `TAC` (a missense mutation) and the codon `GGT` has been deleted entirely.\n*   Effect: This is a missense mutation combined with an **in-frame deletion** (a deletion of exactly 3 nucleotides). Removing an entire amino acid from the protein chain is highly likely to be detrimental to its function. However, a premature stop codon, as seen in Mutant 2, is generally considered a more surefire method for creating a non-functional protein because it halts synthesis entirely.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMutant 2 introduces a nonsense mutation (a premature stop codon) very early in the coding sequence. This will result in a severely truncated, non-functional protein. This is the most definitive way among the choices to knock out the gene's function and therefore eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nTo determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to find the mutation that has the highest probability of creating a non-functional protein. A non-functional protein cannot catalyze the synthesis of the compound. Let's analyze the impact of each mutation by translating the start of the gene sequence into its corresponding amino acid sequence.\n\nWe will read the DNA sequence in groups of three letters (codons), starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n**1. Intact Gene Sequence Analysis**\n*   **Sequence:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n*   **Translation:**\n    *   `ATG` codes for Methionine (M)\n    *   `TTT` codes for Phenylalanine (F)\n    *   `CTC` codes for Leucine (L)\n*   The normal, functional protein begins with the amino acid sequence: **M-F-L...**\n\n**2. Analysis of Mutant Sequences**\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n    *   **Translation:** `ATG` (M) - `TTC` (F) - `TAC` (Y - Tyrosine).\n    *   **Effect:** This is a **missense mutation**. The third amino acid is changed from Leucine to Tyrosine. The protein will still be produced at full length, but with one amino acid changed. This might or might not inactivate the protein. It is not the most certain outcome.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    *   **Translation:** `ATG` (M) - `TTC` (F) - `TAA` (**STOP**).\n    *   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The `TAA` codon is a stop signal that terminates protein synthesis. The resulting \"protein\" will be a tiny, two-amino-acid fragment (M-F). A severely truncated protein like this is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   **Translation:** `ATG` (M) - `TTT` (F) - `TAC` (Y - Tyrosine).\n    *   **Effect:** This is another **missense mutation**, similar to Mutant 1. The third amino acid is changed from Leucine to Tyrosine. Again, this results in a full-length protein with a substitution, which is not guaranteed to inactivate it.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   **Alignment:**\n        *   Intact: `...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`\n        *   Mutant 4: `...TAC GCT --- ACT...`\n    *   **Effect:** This involves a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`) and an **in-frame deletion** (the codon `GGT` is missing). An in-frame deletion removes an entire amino acid but does not shift the reading frame for the rest of the protein. The resulting protein is slightly shorter and has one amino acid substituted. While this is disruptive, it is less certain to cause complete inactivation than a premature stop codon.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe mutation in **Mutant 2** introduces a premature stop codon very early in the coding sequence. This will cause protein synthesis to halt, producing a severely truncated and non-functional protein. This is the most reliable method among the choices to inactivate the gene and thus eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nTo solve this problem, we must determine which mutation is most likely to result in a non-functional protein, thereby eliminating the production of the anti-nutritional compound. A non-functional protein is most reliably created by a mutation that causes the premature termination of its synthesis.\n\nLet's analyze the genetic code. Protein synthesis, or translation, starts at the `ATG` codon (which codes for Methionine) and reads the sequence in triplets called codons. Let's examine the original gene and each mutant by breaking them into codons and determining the resulting amino acid sequence.\n\n**1. Intact Gene Sequence:**\n*   **DNA:** 5’- ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ... -3’\n*   **Amino Acids:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr ...\n    *   This sequence produces the full, functional protein responsible for the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n**2.

It changes one amino acid in the protein chain. While this might alter the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it. The protein could still be functional.\n\n**3. Mutant 2 Sequence:**\n*   **DNA:** 5’- ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT ... -3’\n*   **Comparison:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAA`.\n*   **Amino Acids:** Met - Phe - **STOP**\n*   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**, which signals the end of translation. This mutation will cause protein synthesis to stop prematurely, producing a tiny, non-functional protein fragment only two amino acids long. This is the most effective way to eliminate the protein's function.\n\n**4. Mutant 3 Sequence:**\n*   **DNA:** 5’- ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT ... -3’\n*   **Comparison:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and the sixth codon `ACT` (Threonine) is changed to `GTC` (Valine).\n*   **Amino Acids:** Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly - **Val** ...\n*   **Effect:** These are two **missense mutations**.

This usually involves a \"loss-of-function\" mutation that prevents the formation of a complete, functional protein.\n\n### Analysis of the Gene and Mutations:\n\nFirst, let's analyze the sequence of the intact gene by breaking it into codons (groups of three DNA bases). The gene starts with `ATG`, which is the start codon for protein synthesis.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...TGA-3’`\n    *   Amino Acids: `Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr...Stop`\n\nNow, let's examine each mutant to see how the change affects the resulting amino acid sequence.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...`\n    *   Changes: The codon `CTC` (coding for Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (coding for Tyrosine).\n    *   Type of Mutation: This is a **missense mutation**, where one amino acid is substituted for another. While this could potentially alter the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...`\n    *   Changes: The codon `CTC` (coding for Leucine) is changed to `TAA`.\n    *   Type of Mutation: `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**, which signals for protein synthesis to stop prematurely. This mutation occurs very early in the gene (at the third codon). The resulting protein would be extremely short (only two amino acids long) and almost certainly non-functional. This type of mutation is a highly effective way to \"knock out\" or inactivate a gene.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...`\n    *   Changes: The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and further downstream, another change occurs.\n    *   Type of Mutation: This involves multiple **missense mutations**. Like Mutant 1, this changes amino acids but doesn't guarantee a complete loss of function.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...`\n    *   Changes: The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `GGT` (Glycine) is changed to `ACT` (Threonine).\n    *   Type of Mutation: This also contains multiple **missense mutations**. Again, this alters the protein, but complete inactivation is less certain than with a nonsense mutation.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nA nonsense mutation that introduces a premature stop codon early in the coding sequence is the most reliable way to produce a truncated and non-functional protein, thereby eliminating its activity. Mutant 2 is the only one with this type of mutation.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nTo determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we must identify the mutation that has the highest probability of creating a non-functional protein. This involves analyzing how each mutation alters the gene's protein-coding sequence.\n\n### Analysis of Mutations\n\nFirst, let's establish the amino acid sequence of the intact gene by breaking its DNA sequence into three-letter codons, starting with the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT…-3’`\n*   **Amino Acid Sequence:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr...\n\nNow, let's analyze the effect of each mutation:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** The sequence `5’-ATGTTCTACGCT…-3’` translates to the codons `ATG TTC TAC GCT…`. This changes the original `TTT` codon to `TTC` and the `CTC` codon to `TAC`.\n    *   `TTT` to `TTC` both code for the amino acid Phenylalanine (Phe), making this a silent mutation.\n    *   `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine) is a **missense mutation**, which substitutes one amino acid for another. While this could potentially affect the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** The sequence `5’-ATGTTCTAAGCT…-3’` translates to the codons `ATG TTC TAA GCT…`.\n    *   Similar to Mutant 1, `TTT` changes to `TTC` (a silent mutation).\n    *   Crucially, the third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is mutated to `TAA`. The `TAA` codon is a **nonsense or stop codon**. This signals the cell's machinery to stop protein synthesis prematurely. The resulting protein would be truncated to only two amino acids, making it almost certainly non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** The sequence `5’-ATGTTTTACGCT…-3’` translates to `ATG TTT TAC GCT…`.\n    *   This changes the third codon from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, similar to the one in Mutant 1. The impact on protein function is uncertain and less likely to be as severe as a nonsense mutation.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** The sequence `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACT...-3’` translates to `ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...`.\n    *   This sequence contains two changes compared to the intact gene: `CTC` becomes `TAC` (Leucine to Tyrosine) and `GGT` becomes `ACT` (Glycine to Threonine). These are two separate **missense mutations**. While multiple amino acid changes increase the chance of disrupting protein function compared to a single missense mutation, it is still less definitive than a premature stop codon.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nA nonsense mutation that introduces a premature stop codon is one of the most severe types of mutations, as it leads to a shortened, incomplete protein that is typically non-functional. Missense mutations only change a single amino acid, which may or may not disrupt the protein's function. A silent mutation, by definition, does not change the amino acid sequence, though recent research shows it can still have subtle effects.\n\nAmong the choices, Mutant 2 is the only one that introduces a premature stop codon. This happens very early in the gene sequence (at the third codon), ensuring the resulting protein will be severely truncated and non-functional. This makes it the most probable mutation to successfully eliminate the unwanted compound.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nTo eliminate an anti-nutritional compound synthesized by a specific gene, the most effective strategy is to introduce a mutation that completely destroys the function of the protein encoded by that gene. This is known as a \"knock-out\" mutation. Let's analyze the provided mutations to determine which is most likely to achieve this.\n\nThe original gene sequence begins: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`. This translates to the amino acid sequence: `Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly...`\n\nNow, let's examine each mutant:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** The sequence is `5’-ATG TTC TAC...-3’`.\n    *   This translates to `Met-Phe-Tyr...`\n    *   Compared to the original (`Met-Phe-Leu...`), a single amino acid has been changed from Leucine (Leu) to Tyrosine (Tyr). This is a **missense mutation**. While a missense mutation *can* sometimes inactivate a protein, it often results in a protein that is still functional, especially if the changed amino acid is not in a critical part of the protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** The sequence is `5’-ATG TTC TAA...-3’`.\n    *   This translates to `Met-Phe-STOP`.\n    *   The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This type of mutation, which introduces a premature stop signal, is called a **nonsense mutation**. The synthesis of the protein will halt at this point, resulting in a severely shortened, truncated protein that is almost certainly non-functional. Introducing a premature stop codon is a very effective way to cause a loss of function.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** The sequence appears to have multiple changes or a frameshift. If we assume it is a **frameshift mutation** (caused by an insertion or deletion of nucleotides not in a multiple of three), it would alter the entire downstream amino acid sequence. This is also very likely to result in a non-functional protein. However, the most unambiguous and definitively disruptive mutation presented in the options is the nonsense mutation.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** The sequence `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’` translates to `Met-Phe-Tyr-Ala-Thr...`\n    *   This represents at least two **missense mutations** (Leu to Tyr and Gly to Thr). Similar to Mutant 1, this changes amino acids but does not guarantee a complete loss of function.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the options, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most probable one to completely eliminate the protein's function and, therefore, the anti-nutritional compound. It results in a protein that is truncated after only two amino acids, which cannot perform the complex function of synthesizing a compound. The missense mutations in the other mutants are far less certain to have such a drastic effect.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nTo solve this problem, we need to analyze how each mutation affects the gene's product, the protein. The goal is to find the mutation that is most likely to result in a non-functional protein, thus eliminating the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nA functional protein is synthesized by transcribing the DNA sequence into messenger RNA (mRNA) and then translating the mRNA into a chain of amino acids. This process starts at the start codon (ATG) and ends at a stop codon (in this case, TGA at the end of the gene).\n\nLet's break down the intact gene sequence and each mutant sequence into codons (groups of three nucleotides) and see what amino acids they code for.\n\n**Intact Gene:**\n*   Sequence: 5’-**ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT**...TGA-3’\n*   Amino Acids: **Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly**...\n\nNow let's analyze each mutant:\n\n**Mutant 1:**\n*   Sequence: 5’-**ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT**...TGA-3’\n*   Change: Compared to the intact gene (ATG TTT CTC GCT), the codons TTT and CTC have changed to TTC and TAC.\n    *   TTT -> TTC: Both TTT and TTC code for Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a *silent mutation*.\n    *   CTC -> TAC: CTC codes for Leucine (Leu), while TAC codes for Tyrosine (Tyr). This is a *missense mutation*.\n*   Effect: The third amino acid is changed from Leucine to Tyrosine. This might alter the protein's function, but it could also have little or no effect. It is not guaranteed to inactivate the protein.\n\n**Mutant 2:**\n*   Sequence: 5’-**ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT**...TGA-3’\n*   Change: Compared to the intact gene (ATG TTT CTC GCT), the codons TTT and CTC have changed to TTC and TAA.\n    *   TTT -> TTC: This is a silent mutation (Phe -> Phe).\n    *   CTC -> TAA: CTC codes for Leucine (Leu), but **TAA is a STOP codon**. This is a *nonsense mutation*.\n*   Effect: The introduction of a premature stop codon at the third position will cause translation to terminate. The resulting \"protein\" will be only two amino acids long (Met-Phe). A protein this truncated is almost certain to be completely non-functional. This is the most likely mutation to eliminate the synthesis of the compound.\n\n**Mutant 3:**\n*   Sequence: 5’-**ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT**...TGA-3’\n*   Change: Compared to the intact gene (ATG TTT CTC GCT), the codon CTC has changed to TAC.\n    *   CTC -> TAC: CTC codes for Leucine (Leu), while TAC codes for Tyrosine (Tyr). This is a *missense mutation*.\n*   Effect: This mutation causes the same amino acid change as in Mutant 1. The effect is uncertain and not as definitive as a stop codon.\n\n**Mutant 4:**\n*   Sequence: 5’-**ATG TTT ACG CTA CTT CTG**...TGA-3’ (Assuming a deletion of the C at position 7)\n*   Change: This mutation is best interpreted as a deletion of a single nucleotide (the C at position 7 of CTC). This deletion causes a *frameshift*. The reading frame for all subsequent codons is altered.\n    *   Original: ATG TTT **C**TC GCT GGT ACT... (Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr...)\n    *   Mutant: ATG TTT TCG CTG GTA CT... (Met - Phe - Ser - Leu - Val - Leu...)\n*   Effect: A frameshift mutation changes every amino acid downstream from the mutation, usually resulting in a completely different and non-functional protein. It often leads to a premature stop codon as well. While very effective at inactivating a gene, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is even more direct and certain in its effect by immediately halting protein production. Given the options, the nonsense mutation is the most \"probable\" to achieve the desired outcome.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe mutation in **Mutant 2** introduces a premature stop codon early in the gene sequence. This is the most effective and reliable way among the given choices to ensure a non-functional, truncated protein is produced, thereby eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nTo eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, the gene responsible for its synthesis must be rendered non-functional. This is most effectively achieved by a mutation that results in a truncated and non-functional protein. Let's analyze the impact of each mutation on the protein sequence, using the standard genetic code to translate the DNA codons.\n\nThe beginning of the intact gene's coding sequence and its corresponding amino acid sequence is:\n*   **Intact gene:** 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’\n*   **Protein:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n\nNow let's examine each mutant:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’\n    *   The `TTT` codon changed to `TTC`. Both code for Phenylalanine (Phe), so this is a silent mutation.\n    *   The `CTC` codon (Leucine) changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, which changes a single amino acid. While this might affect the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely. The protein might still be partially active.\n    *   **Resulting Protein:** Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly...\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’\n    *   The `TTT` codon changed to `TTC` (silent mutation).\n    *   The `CTC` codon (Leucine) changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**.\n    *   This type of change is called a **nonsense mutation**. It introduces a premature stop signal, causing protein synthesis to halt. The result is a severely shortened, incomplete protein that is almost certain to be non-functional, especially when it occurs so early in the gene.\n    *   **Resulting Protein:** Met - Phe - **STOP**\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’\n    *   This mutant has multiple changes compared to the intact gene.\n    *   `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   `ACT` (Threonine) is changed to `GTC` (Valine).\n    *   `TCT` (Serine) is changed to `ACT` (Threonine).\n    *   These are all **missense mutations**, resulting in several amino acid substitutions. While multiple changes make it more likely that the protein's function is disrupted compared to a single change, it doesn't guarantee a complete loss of function.\n    *   **Resulting Protein:** Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly - **Val** - **Thr**...\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’\n    *   This mutant also contains multiple **missense mutations**.\n    *   `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   `GGT` (Glycine) is changed to `ACT` (Threonine).\n    *   Similar to Mutant 3, this will alter the protein sequence but may not completely inactivate it.\n    *   **Resulting Protein:** Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - **Thr**...\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe goal is to eliminate the compound, which is best achieved by completely knocking out the function of the protein that synthesizes it. A nonsense mutation (Mutant 2) introduces a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated and nonfunctional protein. This is the most definitive way to eliminate the protein's activity among the given options. The missense mutations in the other mutants only substitute amino acids, which may or may not render the protein non-functional.\n\nTherefore, Mutant 2 is the most probable choice to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nTo determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to understand how each mutation affects the protein produced by the gene. The most effective way to eliminate a protein's function is to introduce a change that either drastically alters its structure or, more definitively, prevents its complete synthesis. This is often achieved by a \"nonsense\" mutation, which introduces a premature stop codon, or a \"frameshift\" mutation, which scrambles the entire downstream amino acid sequence.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Define the Genetic Code**: We'll use a standard codon table to translate the DNA sequences into amino acid sequences.\n2.  **Translate Each Sequence**: We will translate the DNA sequence of the intact gene and each of the four mutants into their corresponding amino acid sequences. We will focus on the beginning of the gene where the mutations occurred.\n3.  **Analyze the Protein Changes**:\n    *   A **silent mutation** changes the DNA but not the amino acid, having no effect.\n    *   A **missense mutation** changes one amino acid for another. This might affect the protein's function, but it may not eliminate it.\n    *   A **nonsense mutation** changes an amino acid codon into a STOP codon. This terminates protein synthesis prematurely, creating a truncated and almost certainly non-functional protein. This is a very strong candidate for eliminating the compound.\n    *   A **frameshift mutation** (caused by an insertion or deletion of bases not in a multiple of three) alters the reading frame, changing all subsequent amino acids and often leading to a premature stop codon.\n4.  **Identify the Most Disruptive Mutation**: We will compare the effects of each mutation. The one causing a premature stop codon is the most likely to achieve the desired outcome.\n\nLet's execute this plan with code.\n\n```python\ndef translate_dna(dna_sequence):\n    \"\"\"Translates a DNA sequence into a protein sequence.\"\"\"\n    genetic_code = {\n        'TTT': 'F', 'TTC': 'F', 'TTA': 'L', 'TTG': 'L',\n        'CTT': 'L', 'CTC': 'L', 'CTA': 'L', 'CTG': 'L',\n        'ATT': 'I', 'ATC': 'I', 'ATA': 'I', 'ATG': 'M',\n        'GTT': 'V', 'GTC': 'V', 'GTA': 'V', 'GTG': 'V',\n        'TCT': 'S', 'TCC': 'S', 'TCA': 'S', 'TCG': 'S',\n        'CCT': 'P', 'CCC': 'P', 'CCA': 'P', 'CCG': 'P',\n        'ACT': 'T', 'ACC': 'T', 'ACA': 'T', 'ACG': 'T',\n        'GCT': 'A', 'GCC': 'A', 'GCA': 'A', 'GCG': 'A',\n        'TAT': 'Y', 'TAC': 'Y', 'TAA': '*', 'TAG': '*',\n        'CAT': 'H', 'CAC': 'H', 'CAA': 'Q', 'CAG': 'Q',\n        'AAT': 'N', 'AAC': 'N', 'AAA': 'K', 'AAG': 'K',\n        'GAT': 'D', 'GAC': 'D', 'GAA': 'E', 'GAG': 'E',\n        'TGT': 'C', 'TGC': 'C', 'TGA': '*', 'TGG': 'W',\n        'CGT': 'R', 'CGC': 'R', 'CGA': 'R', 'CGG': 'R',\n        'AGT': 'S', 'AGC': 'S', 'AGA': 'R', 'AGG': 'R',\n        'GGT': 'G', 'GGC': 'G', 'GGA': 'G', 'GGG': 'G',\n    }\n    protein = []\n    # Process the sequence in codons (3 bases at a time)\n    for i in range(0, len(dna_sequence) - 2, 3):\n        codon = dna_sequence[i:i+3]\n        amino_acid = genetic_code.get(codon, 'X') # 'X' for unknown codon\n        if amino_acid == '*': # Stop codon\n            protein.append('STOP')\n            break\n        protein.append(amino_acid)\n    return \"-\".join(protein)\n\n# DNA sequences\nintact_gene = \"ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\nmutant_1 = \"ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\"\nmutant_2 = \"ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\"\nmutant_3 = \"ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\nmutant_4 = \"ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\n\n# Translate and print the results for the first few amino acids\nprint(\"Analysis of Gene Mutations:\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(f\"Intact Gene Protein: {translate_dna(intact_gene)}\")\nprint(f\"Mutant 1 Protein:    {translate_dna(mutant_1)}\")\nprint(f\"Mutant 2 Protein:    {translate_dna(mutant_2)}\")\nprint(f\"Mutant 3 Protein:    {translate_dna(mutant_3)}\")\nprint(f\"Mutant 4 Protein:    {translate_dna(mutant_4)}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(\"\\nExplanation:\")\nprint(\"Mutant 1 results in a missense mutation (L -> Y), which changes one amino acid.

This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by a specific gene. To stop the synthesis of the compound, we need to inactivate this gene so it no longer produces a functional protein. The most effective way to achieve this is by introducing a mutation that leads to a non-functional or severely truncated protein.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Intact Gene Sequence**\nThe provided sequence is the start of the coding strand of the gene's first exon.\nIntact gene: `5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`\n*   `ATG` is the start codon, which codes for the amino acid Methionine (Met). This confirms we are at the beginning of the protein-coding sequence.\n*   The sequence is read in groups of three bases, called codons.\n*   Let's determine the initial amino acid sequence of the functional protein by reading the codons:\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Met)\n    *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (Phe)\n    *   `CTC` -> Leucine (Leu)\n    *   `GCT` -> Alanine (Ala)\n    *   `GGT` -> Glycine (Gly)\n    *   ... and so on.\nThe initial part of the healthy protein is: **Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly...**\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Each Mutant and its Consequences**\nWe will now analyze each mutant sequence to see how the mutation affects the resulting protein. The most severe mutations are typically nonsense mutations (creating a premature stop codon) and frameshift mutations (inserting or deleting bases in a number not divisible by three).\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`\n    *   Comparison: The `TTTCTC` from the intact gene is changed to `TTCTAC`.\n    *   Codon changes:\n        *   Intact: `ATG` `TTT` `CTC`\n        *   Mutant 1: `ATG` `TTC` `TAC`\n    *   Protein translation:\n        *   `ATG` -> Met\n        *   `TTC` -> Phe (`TTT` also codes for Phe, so this part is a silent mutation).\n        *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Tyr). The original codon `CTC` coded for Leucine.\n    *   **Effect:** This is a **missense mutation**. It changes one amino acid in the protein chain (Leucine to Tyrosine). This might or might not inactivate the protein. It is less likely to completely eliminate function compared to more severe mutations.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`\n    *   Comparison: The `TTTCTC` from the intact gene is changed to `TTCTAA`.\n    *   Codon changes:\n        *   Intact: `ATG` `TTT` `CTC`\n        *   Mutant 2: `ATG` `TTC` `TAA`\n    *   Protein translation:\n        *   `ATG` -> Met\n        *   `TTC` -> Phe (silent mutation)\n        *   `TAA` -> **STOP**. The codon `TAA` is one of the three stop codons in the genetic code.\n    *   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. It introduces a premature stop codon. Protein synthesis will halt after the second amino acid (Phenylalanine). The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe), which is virtually certain to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`\n    *   Comparison: The original sequence `...TTTCTCG...` has been changed to `...TTTTACG...`. A single 'T' has been inserted after the `TTT` codon.\n        *   Intact: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...`\n        *   Mutant 3: `ATG TTT T ACG CTG GTG...` (The reading frame is shifted from this point on).\n    *   **Effect:** This is a **frameshift mutation**. The insertion of a single nucleotide shifts the reading frame for all subsequent codons. The entire amino acid sequence after the second amino acid (Phe) will be different from the original, creating a \"garbage\" protein. Frameshift mutations often also create a premature stop codon by chance downstream. This type of mutation is highly likely to result in a non-functional protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`\n    *   Comparison: Analysis shows that the codon `GGT` (coding for Glycine) has been deleted, and the codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n        *   Intact: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...` -> Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly-Thr...\n        *   Mutant 4: `ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...` -> Met-Phe-Tyr-Ala-Thr...\n    *   **Effect:** This is an **in-frame deletion** of one amino acid (Glycine) and a **missense mutation** (Leucine to Tyrosine). Because a full codon (3 bases) was deleted, the reading frame is maintained for the rest of the gene. While removing/changing amino acids can disrupt function, it is less severe than a frameshift or nonsense mutation.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude Which Mutation is Most Likely to Succeed**\n*   Mutants 1 (missense) and 4 (in-frame deletion/missense) alter the protein but do not guarantee a complete loss of function.\n*   Mutants 2 (nonsense) and 3 (frameshift) are both severe mutations that are highly likely to create a non-functional protein (a \"null allele\").\n*   However, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most direct and definitive. It causes protein synthesis to stop almost immediately, producing a mere two-amino-acid fragment. There is no ambiguity; the functional protein will not be made. This is the most certain way to eliminate the compound.\n\nTherefore, Mutant 2 offers the highest probability of success.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand how mutations affect gene function. The goal is to find the mutation that is most likely to produce a non-functional protein, thereby eliminating the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound. This is typically achieved by a mutation that severely disrupts the protein's structure, such as a frameshift or a nonsense mutation.\n\nLet's analyze the sequences by breaking them into three-letter codons and comparing them to the intact gene. The translation process starts at the `ATG` (start codon).\n\n**Intact gene:**\n5’-**ATG-TTT-CTC**-GCT-GGT-ACT-TCT-GTG-GAT-GAA-CAT-ATT-TAT-TGT-CGT…TGA-3’\n*   Translation: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr - Ser - Val...\nThis sequence produces the full, functional protein responsible for the unwanted compound.\n\n**Mutant 1:**\n5’-**ATG-TTC-TAC**-GCT-GGT-ACT-TCT-GTG-GAT-GAA-CAT-ATT-TAT-TGT-CGC…TGA-3’\n*   Comparison: The second codon `TTT` is now `TTC` (both code for Phe, a silent mutation), and the third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is now `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n*   Mutation type: This is a **missense mutation**. It changes one amino acid (Leucine to Tyrosine). While this might alter the protein's function, it often does not completely eliminate it. The full-length protein is still produced.\n\n**Mutant 2:**\n5’-**ATG-TTC-TAA**-GCT-GGT-ACT-TCT-GTG-GAT-GAA-CAT-ATT-TAT-TGT-CGC…TGA-3’\n*   Comparison: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAA`.\n*   Mutation type: `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. It causes protein synthesis to stop prematurely after only two amino acids (Met-Phe) have been joined. The resulting peptide will be extremely short and completely non-functional. This is the most effective way to \"knock out\" the gene's function.\n\n**Mutant 3:**\n5’-**ATG-TTT-TAC-GCT-GGT-GTC-ACT**-TCT-GTG-GAT-GAA-CAT-ATT-TAT-TGT-CGT…TGA-3’\n*   Comparison: There are multiple changes. `CTC` (Leu) -> `TAC` (Tyr), `ACT` (Thr) -> `GTC` (Val), `TCT` (Ser) -> `ACT` (Thr).\n*   Mutation type: These are multiple **missense mutations**. A full-length protein with several incorrect amino acids will be produced. It might be non-functional, but this is less certain than the definite truncation caused by a stop codon.\n\n**Mutant 4:**\n5’-**ATG-TTT-TAC-GCT-ACT**-TCT-GTG-GAT-GAA-CAT-ATT-TAT-TGT-CGT…TGA-3’\n*   Comparison: Comparing to the intact gene, the codon `GGT` has been deleted, and the codon `CTC` has been changed to `TAC`.\n*   Mutation type: This is an **in-frame deletion** (a deletion of 3 bases) combined with a **missense mutation**. The reading frame is not shifted, but one amino acid (Glycine) is missing, and another is changed (Leucine to Tyrosine). A nearly full-length protein is produced and may retain some function.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMutant 2 is the most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound because the nonsense mutation introduces a premature stop codon. This leads to the production of a severely truncated and non-functional protein, effectively disabling the gene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nTo eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, the goal is to inactivate the gene responsible for its synthesis. This is most effectively achieved by a \"loss-of-function\" mutation that prevents the production of a functional protein. Let's analyze the effect of each mutation on the gene's protein-coding sequence.\n\nThe intact gene sequence begins `5’-ATG TTT CTC...`, which codes for the amino acid sequence Methionine-Phenylalanine-Leucine.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** The sequence `5’-ATG TTC TAC...` contains a change in the third codon from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, where one amino acid is substituted for another. While this could potentially disrupt protein function, it is not guaranteed. Many missense mutations have little to no effect, or only partially reduce function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** The sequence `5’-ATG TTC TAA...` contains a change in the third codon from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAA`. On the corresponding mRNA, this would be UAA. UAA is a **stop codon**, which signals the end of protein synthesis. This type of change is called a **nonsense mutation**. A nonsense mutation results in a prematurely shortened, truncated protein that is typically non-functional, especially when it occurs so early in the gene. This is a classic example of a loss-of-function mutation.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** The sequence `5’-ATG TTT TAC...` has a change in the third codon from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, similar to Mutant 1. It results in a single amino acid substitution, which may or may not eliminate the protein's function.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** The sequence `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...` results from a deletion of the `GGT` codon compared to the original `...GCT GGT ACT...`. This is an **in-frame deletion**, which removes a single amino acid (Glycine) but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. The resulting protein will be missing one amino acid, which could harm its function but is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than a premature stop codon.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nA nonsense mutation (Mutant 2) is the most probable type of mutation to completely disrupt protein function and, therefore, eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. It stops protein production near the very beginning, ensuring the resulting polypeptide is too short to perform its intended role.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nTo identify the mutation most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to determine which change would most probably result in a non-functional protein. Let's analyze the effect of each mutation on the gene's protein-coding sequence.\n\nThe beginning of the intact gene is:\n`5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\nThis translates to the amino acid sequence: Methionine (Start) - Phenylalanine - Leucine - Alanine - Glycine...\n\nHere is an analysis of each mutant:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** The sequence `ATGTTTCTCGCT...` changes to `ATGTTCTACGCT...`. This corresponds to a change in the second codon from TTT to TTC and the third codon from CTC to TAC.\n    *   TTT and TTC both code for Phenylalanine, so the first change is a silent mutation.\n    *   CTC codes for Leucine, while TAC codes for Tyrosine. This is a **missense mutation**, which substitutes one amino acid for another. This might alter the protein's function, but there is no guarantee it will completely eliminate it.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** The sequence `ATGTTTCTCGCT...` changes to `ATGTTCTAAGCT...`. This corresponds to a change in the third codon from CTC to TAA.\n    *   TAA is a **stop codon** (also known as a nonsense codon).\n    *   This type of mutation is called a **nonsense mutation**. It signals the cell to stop protein synthesis prematurely. The resulting protein would be extremely short (only two amino acids long) and almost certainly non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** Comparing the intact sequence to `ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTT...` reveals a frameshift mutation. A `T` has been inserted after the second codon.\n    *   Intact frame: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...`\n    *   Mutant frame: `ATG TTT T ACG CTG GTG...`\n    *   This **frameshift mutation** alters the reading frame of the gene. All codons downstream of the insertion will be different, leading to a completely altered amino acid sequence and likely a premature stop codon, resulting in a non-functional protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** Comparing the intact sequence `...GCT GGT ACT...` to the mutant `...GCT ACT TCT...` shows that the codon GGT appears to have been deleted. This is an in-frame deletion of a single amino acid (Glycine). While this could impact protein function, it is generally less severe than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth the nonsense mutation (Mutant 2) and the frameshift mutation (Mutant 3) are highly likely to produce a non-functional protein. However, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a stop codon at the very beginning of the protein (the third amino acid position). This is the most direct and certain method among the choices to ensure the production of a severely truncated and non-functional protein, thereby eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nTo identify which mutation will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to determine which change to the gene sequence would most severely impact the function of the protein it codes for. The most effective mutations for knocking out protein function are those that cause a major disruption, such as a frameshift or a premature stop to protein synthesis.\n\nLet's analyze the impact of each mutation by translating the initial part of its DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence. The genetic code is read in triplets of nucleotides called codons, starting with the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene Sequence Analysis:**\n    `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT...`\n    This translates to the amino acid sequence: Methionine - Phenylalanine - Leucine - Alanine...\n\n*   **Mutant 1 Analysis:**\n    `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...`\n    This translates to: Methionine - Phenylalanine - Tyrosine - Alanine...\n    This is a **missense mutation**, where one amino acid (Leucine) is replaced by another (Tyrosine). This might alter or reduce the protein's function, but it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely.\n\n*   **Mutant 2 Analysis:**\n    `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...`\n    This translates to: Methionine - Phenylalanine - **Stop**\n    This is a **nonsense mutation**. The codon `TAA` is one of the three stop codons (along with TGA and TAG) that signals the ribosome to terminate protein synthesis. This mutation causes the creation of a severely shortened protein, containing only two amino acids. A protein this truncated is almost certain to be non-functional, thus eliminating the production of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3 Analysis:**\n    `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT...`\n    This translates to: Methionine - Phenylalanine - Tyrosine - Alanine...\n    Similar to Mutant 1, this is a **missense mutation** (Leucine is replaced by Tyrosine). It is not the most likely to completely eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 4 Analysis:**\n    `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...`\n    This translates to: Methionine - Phenylalanine - Tyrosine - Alanine - Threonine...\n    This sequence contains multiple **missense mutations** (Leucine to Tyrosine and Glycine to Threonine). While multiple changes increase the likelihood of disrupting function compared to a single missense mutation, it is still less certain than a premature stop codon.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon very early in the sequence. This is the most destructive type of mutation among the choices, as it prevents the full protein from ever being made. Therefore, it is the most likely to successfully eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Goal:** The objective is to find a mutation that eliminates an anti-nutritional compound. This is best achieved by completely knocking out the function of the gene responsible for its synthesis. The most effective way to do this is to create a non-functional or severely truncated protein.\n\n2.  **Understand the Intact Gene:**\n    *   The sequence starts with `5’-ATG...`, which is the universal start codon (codes for Methionine). This is where protein synthesis begins.\n    *   The sequence ends with `...TGA-3’`, which is a stop codon. This is where protein synthesis terminates.\n    *   The mutations are in the first exon, near the beginning of the gene. A mutation early in the sequence has a higher probability of disrupting the entire protein structure and function.\n\n3.  **Analyze Each Mutant's Genetic Change:** We need to compare each mutant sequence to the intact gene, break them down into codons (groups of three DNA bases), and determine the effect on the resulting amino acid sequence.\n\n    *   **Intact Gene Sequence:** `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ...`\n    *   **Amino Acids:** `Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr ...`\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:**\n        *   Sequence: `ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT ...`\n        *   Comparison: The second codon `TTT` changes to `TTC`, and the third codon `CTC` changes to `TAC`.\n        *   Effect: `TTT` -> `TTC` codes for the same amino acid, Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a *silent mutation*. `CTC` (Leucine) -> `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a *missense mutation*.\n        *   Conclusion: The protein has one amino acid swapped for another. This might alter or reduce the protein's function, but it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:**\n        *   Sequence: `ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT ...`\n        *   Comparison: The second codon `TTT` changes to `TTC` (silent mutation, as above). The third codon `CTC` changes to `TAA`.\n        *   Effect: `TAA` is a **STOP codon**. In mRNA, this would be `UAA`.\n        *   Conclusion: This is a **nonsense mutation**. Protein synthesis will halt prematurely after the second amino acid. The resulting product would be a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (`Met-Phe`). A protein this truncated is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional. This is a very strong candidate for eliminating the compound.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:**\n        *   Sequence: `ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT ...`\n        *   Comparison: Let's align the mutant to the intact sequence. It appears there is an insertion of a single nucleotide 'T' after the second codon (`TTT`).\n            *   Intact: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ...`\n            *   Mutant: `ATG TTT T ACG CTG GTG TCA ...`\n        *   Effect: This single base insertion causes a **frameshift mutation**. The three-letter reading frame for codons is shifted. All codons downstream of the insertion are read incorrectly, leading to a completely scrambled sequence of amino acids from that point forward. A frameshift almost always results in a non-functional protein and frequently creates a premature stop codon by chance.\n        *   Conclusion: Like the nonsense mutation, a frameshift is a catastrophic event for the protein and is very likely to eliminate its function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:**\n        *   Sequence: `ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT ...`\n        *   Comparison: `CTC` changes to `TAC` (a missense mutation, Leu -> Tyr). The codon `GGT` (Glycine) has been deleted.\n        *   Effect: This is a combination of a missense mutation and an **in-frame deletion** (a deletion of exactly three bases). Because three bases were deleted, the reading frame is preserved for the rest of the gene.\n        *   Conclusion: The final protein will be missing one amino acid and have another one swapped. While this will alter the protein, it's less likely to cause a complete loss of function compared to a nonsense or frameshift mutation that affects the entire downstream sequence.\n\n4.  **Compare the Strongest Candidates:**\n    *   Both **Mutant 2 (Nonsense)** and **Mutant 3 (Frameshift)** will almost certainly result in a non-functional protein.\n    *   Mutant 2 creates a stop codon at the 3rd position, leading to a 2-amino acid product.\n    *   Mutant 3 scrambles the entire amino acid sequence after the 2nd position.\n    *   Both outcomes effectively eliminate the synthesis of the functional, full-length protein. Therefore, both mutations are highly probable to achieve the desired outcome of eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nGiven the choices, both D (Mutant 2) and A (Mutant 3) are excellent answers. However, a nonsense mutation leading to a stop codon is the most direct and unambiguous way to terminate protein synthesis and guarantee a non-functional product.\n\nFinal evaluation leads us to Mutant 2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nThe goal is to find the mutation that will most likely lead to a non-functional protein, thus eliminating the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound. Let's analyze the effect of each mutation by translating the DNA sequence into its corresponding amino acid sequence. A complete knockout of the gene's function is the desired outcome.\n\n**1. Understand the Genetic Code and Mutations**\n\n*   **Reading Frame:** The genetic code is read in three-base \"words\" called codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** A change in the DNA sequence that results in a different amino acid being incorporated into the protein. The effect can range from negligible to a complete loss of function.\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** A change in the DNA sequence that results in a premature stop codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This halts translation, producing a shortened, usually non-functional, protein. This is the most reliable way to \"knock out\" a gene.\n*   **Deletion/Insertion:** Adding or removing one or more bases. If the number of bases is not a multiple of three, it causes a \"frameshift\" mutation, scrambling all subsequent codons, almost always resulting in a non-functional protein. If it's a multiple of three, it results in an \"in-frame\" deletion/insertion, which is less disruptive but can still affect function.\n\n**2. Analyze the Provided Sequences and the Code Output**\n\nLet's break down the effect of each mutation based on the provided code output, which translated the DNA sequences into amino acid sequences ('_' represents a stop codon):\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...`\n    *   **Translation:** `M F L A G T...` (Methionine-Phenylalanine-Leucine-Alanine-Glycine-Threonine...)\n    *   **Result:** A full-length, functional protein that produces the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...`\n    *   **Code Output:** `MFYAGTSVDEHIYCR`\n    *   **Analysis:** The original sequence `CTC` (Leucine) was changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. The protein is still full-length but has one amino acid substituted. This *might* disrupt its function, but it's not guaranteed.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...`\n    *   **Code Output:** `MF`\n    *   **Analysis:** The original sequence `CTC` (Leucine) was changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**. Translation stops after the second amino acid (Phenylalanine). This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   **Result:** The produced \"protein\" is only a dipeptide (`Met-Phe`). This severely truncated product will be completely non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...`\n    *   **Code Output:** `MFYAGVTSVDEHIYCR`\n    *   **Analysis:** The original `CTC` (Leucine) changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `ACT` (Threonine) changed to `GTC` (Valine). These are two **missense mutations**. The protein is full-length but with two altered amino acids. Like Mutant 1, the effect is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...`\n    *   **Code Output:** `MFYATSVDEHIYCR`\n    *   **Analysis:** The sequence shows a change (`CTC` to `TAC`) and the loss of the `GGT` codon. This is a **missense mutation combined with an in-frame deletion**. The protein is slightly shorter and has one amino acid change. Again, the effect on function is uncertain.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nMutant 2 is the only one that introduces a premature stop codon early in the gene. This leads to the production of a very short, non-functional protein fragment. This is the most definitive way to eliminate the protein's function among the given options. Therefore, Mutant 2 will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the cultivar.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nTo determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to find the mutation that is most likely to result in a completely non-functional protein. This is typically achieved by a mutation that drastically alters the protein's amino acid sequence or causes its production to stop prematurely.\n\nLet's analyze the effect of each mutation by translating the DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence. The genetic code is read in three-base units called codons, starting with `ATG`.\n\n**Intact Gene:**\n*   **Sequence:** 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT`...-3’\n*   **Amino Acids:** Methionine - Phenylalanine - Leucine - Alanine - Glycine...\n*   This is the blueprint for the functional protein that produces the unwanted compound.\n\n**Mutant 1:**\n*   **Sequence:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT`...-3’\n*   **Amino Acids:** Methionine - Phenylalanine - Tyrosine - Alanine - Glycine...\n*   **Analysis:** This mutation changes the third amino acid from Leucine (`CTC`) to Tyrosine (`TAC`). This is a **missense mutation**. While changing one amino acid *could* inactivate the protein, it could also have little or no effect. It is not the most reliable way to disable the gene.\n\n**Mutant 2:**\n*   **Sequence:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT`...-3’\n*   **Amino Acids:** Methionine - Phenylalanine - **STOP**\n*   **Analysis:** This mutation changes the third codon from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAA`, which is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. It causes protein synthesis to terminate after only two amino acids. The resulting peptide is extremely short and guaranteed to be non-functional. This is a very effective way to eliminate the target compound.\n\n**Mutant 3:**\n*   **Sequence:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC`...-3’\n*   **Amino Acids:** Methionine - Phenylalanine - Tyrosine - Alanine - Glycine - Valine...\n*   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact gene, there has been a complex change or a frameshift mutation that alters the reading frame. A frameshift mutation changes every amino acid downstream from the mutation site and is very likely to create a non-functional protein.\n\n**Mutant 4:**\n*   **Sequence:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT`...-3’\n*   **Analysis:** This mutation results in the deletion of the `GGT` codon found in the intact gene. This is an **in-frame deletion**, which removes a single amino acid (Glycine) but leaves the rest of the protein sequence intact. Similar to a missense mutation, this is less likely to completely destroy protein function than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth a nonsense mutation (Mutant 2) and a frameshift mutation (implied in Mutant 3) are very effective at inactivating a gene. However, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a stop codon very early in the sequence. This is the most direct and unambiguous signal to halt protein production, ensuring a non-functional product. Therefore, it is the most probable method among the choices to eliminate the compound.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nTo solve this problem, we must determine which mutation is most likely to result in a non-functional protein, thereby eliminating the anti-nutritional compound. We will analyze the effect of each mutation on the gene's protein-coding sequence. The fundamental principle is that mutations causing a premature stop codon (nonsense mutations) or altering the entire subsequent amino acid sequence (frameshift mutations) are the most destructive to protein function.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Intact Gene:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ...`\n    *   Translation begins at the start codon `ATG` (Methionine).\n    *   The codons translate to: `ATG` (Met) - `TTT` (Phe) - `CTC` (Leu) - `GCT` (Ala) - `GGT` (Gly) - `ACT` (Thr) ...\n    *   This sequence produces the functional protein.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mutant 1:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT ...`\n    *   Comparison: The `CTC` codon (Leu) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyr).\n    *   Mutation type: This is a **missense mutation**, which changes a single amino acid. While this *can* disrupt protein function, it often results in a protein that is still partially or fully functional. It is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mutant 2:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT ...`\n    *   Comparison: The `CTC` codon (Leu) has been changed to `TAA`.\n    *   Mutation type: This is a **nonsense mutation**. `TAA` is one of the three stop codons. The ribosome will terminate translation at this point. The resulting \"protein\" will be only two amino acids long (`Met-Phe`). A severely truncated protein like this is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n4.  **Analyze Mutant 3:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT ...`\n    *   Comparison: This mutation changes `CTC` to `TAC` (a missense mutation like in Mutant 1) and also inserts a `GTC` codon (Val) after the `GGT` codon.\n    *   Mutation type: This is a combination of a missense mutation and an **in-frame insertion** (an insertion of a number of bases that is a multiple of three). This adds an amino acid to the protein chain but does not alter the reading frame for the rest of the gene. Like a simple missense mutation, it is not guaranteed to inactivate the protein.\n\n5.  **Analyze Mutant 4:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...`\n    *   Comparison: A `GGT` codon appears to have been deleted. This is a deletion of three nucleotides.\n    *   Mutation type: Let's re-examine the string alignment, as the changes are complex.\n        `Intact:   ...GTTTCTCGCTGGTACT...`\n        `Mutant 4: ...GTTTTACGCTACTTCT...`\n        This involves multiple substitutions and a deletion, resulting in a **frameshift mutation**. The reading frame is altered from this point onwards. All subsequent amino acids will be incorrect, and a random stop codon is likely to be encountered soon. This is also a very effective way to inactivate a protein.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth Mutant 2 (nonsense) and Mutant 4 (frameshift) are excellent candidates for completely inactivating the gene. However, the mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a stop codon at the very beginning of the protein (the 3rd codon). This is an unambiguous and definitive way to terminate protein synthesis, resulting in a tiny, non-functional peptide. Therefore, it is the most probable mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nTo eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the barley cultivar, the most effective mutation would be one that completely inactivates the gene responsible for its synthesis. This is best achieved by a mutation that results in a non-functional or severely shortened protein. Let's analyze the effects of the mutations in the given mutants.\n\nThe genetic code is read in triplets of nucleotides called codons, where each codon specifies a particular amino acid or a stop signal. The process begins at a \"start\" codon (`ATG`) and ends at a \"stop\" codon (`TGA`, `TAA`, or `TAG`).\n\n*   **Intact Gene Analysis**: The initial sequence is `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT...`.\n    *   `ATG` is the start codon for Methionine.\n    *   `TTT` codes for Phenylalanine.\n    *   `CTC` codes for Leucine.\n\n*   **Mutant 1 Analysis**: The sequence is `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...`.\n    *   This represents a change from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This type of mutation, which results in a different amino acid, is called a **missense mutation**. While a missense mutation can sometimes render a protein non-functional, it might also only slightly alter it or have no effect at all, making it less reliable for completely eliminating the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 2 Analysis**: The sequence is `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...`.\n    *   Here, the codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is one of the three **stop codons**.\n    *   This type of mutation is called a **nonsense mutation**. It causes protein synthesis to terminate prematurely. The resulting protein would be only two amino acids long (Methionine-Phenylalanine), which would be completely non-functional. This is a very effective way to \"knock out\" a gene's function.\n\n*   **Mutant 3 Analysis**: The sequence `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTT...` compared to the intact `5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTT...` suggests a significant change. A plausible interpretation is a single nucleotide insertion, which would cause a **frameshift mutation**. A frameshift alters the three-letter codon reading frame, changing all subsequent amino acids and often leading to a premature stop codon. Like a nonsense mutation, a frameshift is highly likely to produce a non-functional protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 4 Analysis**: Comparing `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGT...` with the intact gene suggests the deletion of the `GGT` codon. This is an **in-frame deletion**, meaning one amino acid (Glycine) is removed without altering the reading frame. This is less likely to be as detrimental as a nonsense or frameshift mutation and may only partially affect the protein's function.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth nonsense (Mutant 2) and frameshift (Mutant 3) mutations are very likely to eliminate the protein's function. However, the mutation in Mutant 2 is definitively a nonsense mutation that introduces a stop codon at the third position. This guarantees the production of a severely truncated, non-functional protein. Therefore, it is the most certain and direct way to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound among the choices provided.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nTo eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the barley cultivar, a loss-of-function mutation is required in the gene responsible for its synthesis. This type of mutation results in a complete or partial loss of the gene's function. Analyzing the different types of mutations found in the mutants reveals which is most likely to achieve this outcome.\n\nThe types of mutations that most reliably cause a loss of function are nonsense and frameshift mutations. A nonsense mutation changes a codon for an amino acid into a premature stop codon, which halts protein synthesis and typically results in a shortened, non-functional protein. A frameshift mutation, caused by an insertion or deletion of nucleotides not in a multiple of three, alters the reading frame of the gene. This changes all subsequent amino acids and almost always results in a non-functional protein. Missense mutations, which substitute one amino acid for another, may or may not eliminate the protein's function and are therefore less reliable for this purpose.\n\nLet's examine the specific mutants:\n*   **Intact gene codons:** 5’-ATG (Met) TTT (Phe) CTC (Leu) ... -3’\n*   **Mutant 1:** The sequence shows a change from CTC to TAC in the third codon. This is a **missense mutation**, changing the amino acid from Leucine to Tyrosine. The protein is still produced and might be functional.\n*   **Mutant 2:** The sequence shows a change from CTC to TAA in the third codon. TAA is a **stop codon**. This nonsense mutation would cause protein synthesis to terminate after only two amino acids. The resulting truncated protein would be non-functional, leading to a loss of function.\n*   **Mutant 3:** The sequence in this mutant is longer than the intact gene, indicating an insertion. This causes a **frameshift mutation**, which would alter the entire amino acid sequence from that point forward, leading to a loss of function. However, the problem states the mutations were induced by EMS, a chemical mutagen that primarily causes point mutations (single base substitutions), specifically G:C to A:T transitions. While EMS can in rare cases cause deletions or insertions, it is not the typical mechanism.\n*   **Mutant 4:** This mutant contains multiple changes, all of which are **missense mutations** that substitute one amino acid for another. While several amino acid changes increase the likelihood of disrupting function compared to a single change, it is not as certain as a premature stop codon.\n\nConsidering the types of mutations and their effects, both Mutant 2 and Mutant 3 would very likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. However, the question asks which is the *most probable* mutation to achieve this. Given that EMS was the mutagen used, a point mutation is the expected event. Mutant 2 contains a point mutation that results in a nonsense codon. This is a very common and effective way to create a knockout or null allele. Mutant 3's frameshift via insertion is not a characteristic EMS mutation. Therefore, Mutant 2 represents the most probable and effective mutation to eliminate the target compound under the specified experimental conditions.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nTo identify which mutation will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we must determine which change in the DNA sequence is most likely to result in a non-functional protein. Let's analyze the effect of each mutation on the gene's protein product.\n\nThe intact gene sequence begins: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’\nTranslating this from the start codon (ATG), the first few amino acids are:\n*   **ATG**: Methionine (Start)\n*   **TTT**: Phenylalanine\n*   **CTC**: Leucine\n*   **GCT**: Alanine\n\nNow, let's examine the mutants:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’\n    *   **ATG**: Methionine\n    *   **TTC**: Phenylalanine (same as TTT, a silent mutation)\n    *   **TAC**: Tyrosine\n    This is a **missense mutation**, which changes a single amino acid (Leucine to Tyrosine). While this could potentially affect protein function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’\n    *   **ATG**: Methionine\n    *   **TTC**: Phenylalanine\n    *   **TAA**: **Stop codon**\n    This mutation is a **nonsense mutation**. It introduces a premature stop codon very early in the sequence. This will cause protein synthesis to terminate, resulting in a drastically shortened and almost certainly non-functional protein, consisting of only two amino acids.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT...-3’\n    *   **ATG**: Methionine\n    *   **TTT**: Phenylalanine\n    *   **TAC**: Tyrosine\n    Similar to Mutant 1, this is a **missense mutation**, changing the amino acid Leucine to Tyrosine. It is less likely to cause a complete loss of function compared to a nonsense mutation.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** The sequence provided for Mutant 4 (`5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCT...-3'`) compared to the intact gene (`5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT...-3'`) shows multiple complex changes. However, if we interpret it as having a `CTC` to `TAC` change, it would also be a missense mutation like Mutants 1 and 3. In any case, it does not introduce a stop codon.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAmong the given options, a nonsense mutation is the most likely to completely abolish the function of the protein. Mutant 2 is the only one that introduces a premature stop codon, which will lead to a severely truncated and non-functional protein. This makes it the most probable candidate for eliminating the targeted anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "To determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to identify the mutation that has the highest probability of creating a non-functional protein. A non-functional protein cannot catalyze the synthesis of the compound. This is best achieved by a mutation that severely disrupts the protein's structure, such as introducing a premature stop codon or causing a frameshift.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Intact Gene\nFirst, we establish the original amino acid sequence by translating the intact gene's DNA sequence. Protein synthesis begins at the start codon `ATG`. The sequence is read in groups of three nucleotides, called codons.\n*   **Intact Gene DNA:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n*   **Codons:** `ATG` | `TTT` | `CTC` | `GCT` | `GGT`\n*   **Amino Acid Sequence:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\nThis sequence produces the functional protein responsible for the unwanted compound.\n\n### 2. Analyze Each Mutant\n\n*   **Mutant 1: `...ATG TTC TAC...`**\n    *   The change from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine) is a **missense mutation**. This means one amino acid in the protein chain is substituted for another. While this *could* disrupt the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely. The full-length protein is still produced.\n\n*   **Mutant 2: `...ATG TTC TAA...`**\n    *   The change from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAA` is a **nonsense mutation**. The `TAA` codon is a **stop codon**.\n    *   This mutation signals the cellular machinery to terminate protein synthesis prematurely. Since the stop codon appears at the very beginning of the gene (the third codon), the resulting product will be a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe).\n    *   A severely truncated protein like this is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional. This is the most effective way to \"knock out\" a gene's function.\n\n*   **Mutant 3: `...ATG TTT TAC...` (plus other changes)**\n    *   This mutant contains one or more **missense mutations** (e.g., Leucine to Tyrosine) and may also have insertions or deletions. The provided sequences show at least two amino acid substitutions. Like Mutant 1, this results in a full-length protein with altered amino acids, which is less certain to cause a complete loss of function compared to a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4: `...ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...`**\n    *   A comparison with the intact gene shows that the `GGT` codon is deleted, and the `CTC` codon is changed to `TAC`. This is an **in-frame deletion** (a deletion of 3 bases) combined with a **missense mutation**.\n    *   The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another amino acid changed, but the reading frame for the rest of the gene is preserved. This is a significant change, but it's less likely to cause a complete loss of function than a premature stop codon.\n\n### 3. Conclusion\nThe mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most severe. By introducing a premature stop codon very early in the gene sequence, it ensures that a functional protein is not produced. The resulting truncated product will be completely inactive, thus eliminating the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound. This is the most reliable and probable way to achieve the desired outcome among the given choices.\n\n<<<D>>>"

Let's analyze the effect of each mutation by translating the DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence, reading it in codons (groups of three nucleotides) starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n**Intact Gene Sequence and Protein:**\n*   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...-3’\n*   **Protein:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr - Ser - Val - Asp...\n\nThis is the functional protein that produces the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n---\n\n**Analysis of Mutants:**\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...-3’\n    *   **Changes:** `TTT` -> `TTC` (Phe -> Phe, a silent mutation) and `CTC` -> `TAC` (Leu -> Tyr, a missense mutation).\n    *   **Protein:** Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly - Thr - Ser - Val - Asp...\n    *   **Effect:** This is a missense mutation, which changes one amino acid (Leucine to Tyrosine). This might alter the protein's function, but it could also have little to no effect. It is not a guaranteed way to eliminate the protein's activity.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...-3’\n    *   **Changes:** `TTT` -> `TTC` (Phe -> Phe, a silent mutation) and `CTC` -> `TAA`.\n    *   **Protein:** Met - Phe - **STOP**\n    *   **Effect:** The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. It causes translation to terminate prematurely, creating a tiny, non-functional protein fragment only two amino acids long. This is highly likely to completely eliminate the gene's function.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG...-3’\n    *   **Changes:** This sequence has multiple changes compared to the intact gene, resulting in several amino acid substitutions (missense mutations).\n    *   **Protein:** Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly - **Val** - **Thr** - **Ser**...\n    *   **Effect:** Multiple missense mutations change several amino acids. While this is more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it does not guarantee a complete loss of function. The protein is still produced at full length.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...-3’\n    *   **Changes:** Comparing to the intact gene (`...GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted.\n    *   **Protein:** Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Thr - Ser - Val - Asp...\n    *   **Effect:** This is an in-frame deletion. It removes one amino acid (Glycine) from the protein and also contains a missense mutation (`CTC` -> `TAC`). Like a missense mutation, deleting a single amino acid might disrupt the protein, but it is not guaranteed to completely inactivate it.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe most effective way to eliminate the function of a gene is to prevent the synthesis of a full-length, functional protein. **Mutant 2** introduces a premature stop codon very early in the sequence. This will result in a severely truncated and non-functional protein, thus most probably eliminating the production of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to analyze the effect of each mutation on the protein's synthesis. The goal is to find the mutation that most probably results in a non-functional protein. This is typically achieved by a \"knockout\" mutation that stops the protein from being made correctly.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the intact gene's initial sequence to understand its translation into amino acids. The genetic code is read in triplets called codons. The sequence begins with `ATG`, which is the standard start codon that codes for the amino acid Methionine and signals the beginning of protein translation.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’\n    *   **Amino Acids:** Methionine - Phenylalanine - Leucine - Alanine - Glycine...\n\nNow, let's examine each mutant:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’\n    *   **Change:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, where one amino acid is substituted for another. While this could potentially alter the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’\n    *   **Change:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is one of the three **stop codons** (along with TGA and TAG). This type of mutation is called a **nonsense mutation**. It signals the machinery of the cell to stop protein synthesis prematurely. This results in a severely truncated and almost certainly non-functional protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’\n    *   **Change:** This mutant has two changes compared to the intact gene. The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine), and the sixth codon `ACT` (Threonine) becomes `GTC` (Valine). These are two separate **missense mutations**. Similar to Mutant 1, this might affect protein function, but it is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...-3’\n    *   **Change:** This mutant also has two **missense mutations**. The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine), and the fifth codon `GGT` (Glycine) becomes `ACT` (Threonine). Again, this is less likely to completely eliminate the protein's function compared to a nonsense mutation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon very early in the gene sequence. This nonsense mutation will halt protein synthesis, leading to a very short and non-functional protein product. This is the most direct and probable way to eliminate the function of the protein responsible for the anti-nutritional compound. The other mutants only cause amino acid substitutions (missense mutations), which may or may not inactivate the protein. Therefore, Mutant 2 is the most desirable outcome for the stated goal.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo determine which mutation will most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to find the mutation that causes the most severe disruption to the gene's protein product. A non-functional protein cannot synthesize the compound.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Intact Gene:** First, we'll establish the baseline by translating the beginning of the original gene sequence into its amino acid sequence. The gene starts with `ATG` (the start codon) and ends with `TGA` (a stop codon).\n2.  **Analyze Each Mutant:** We will examine each mutant sequence to identify the type of mutation and its effect on the resulting protein.\n    *   A **missense mutation** changes one amino acid, which might or might not disable the protein.\n    *   An **in-frame deletion/insertion** removes or adds an entire amino acid, which also might or might not disable the protein.\n    *   A **frameshift mutation** (caused by an insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three) changes the reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n    *   A **nonsense mutation** changes an amino acid codon into a STOP codon, which terminates protein synthesis prematurely, resulting in a truncated and almost certainly non-functional protein.\n3.  **Compare the Effects:** The most severe disruptions are frameshift and nonsense mutations, as they are most likely to result in a completely non-functional protein. We will identify which mutant has the most disruptive mutation.\n\nLet's execute the analysis with Python.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_mutations():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes gene mutations to determine which is most likely to result in a non-functional protein.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the DNA codon table for translation ('*' = STOP codon)\n    codon_table = {\n        'ATA':'I', 'ATC':'I', 'ATT':'I', 'ATG':'M', 'ACA':'T', 'ACC':'T', 'ACG':'T', 'ACT':'T',\n        'AAC':'N', 'AAT':'N', 'AAA':'K', 'AAG':'K', 'AGC':'S', 'AGT':'S', 'AGA':'R', 'AGG':'R',\n        'CTA':'L', 'CTC':'L', 'CTG':'L', 'CTT':'L', 'CCA':'P', 'CCC':'P', 'CCG':'P', 'CCT':'P',\n        'CAC':'H', 'CAT':'H', 'CAA':'Q', 'CAG':'Q', 'CGA':'R', 'CGC':'R', 'CGG':'R', 'CGT':'R',\n        'GTA':'V', 'GTC':'V', 'GTG':'V', 'GTT':'V', 'GCA':'A', 'GCC':'A', 'GCG':'A', 'GCT':'A',\n        'GAC':'D', 'GAT':'D', 'GAA':'E', 'GAG':'E', 'GGA':'G', 'GGC':'G', 'GGG':'G', 'GGT':'G',\n        'TCA':'S', 'TCC':'S', 'TCG':'S', 'TCT':'S', 'TTC':'F', 'TTT':'F', 'TTA':'L', 'TTG':'L',\n        'TAC':'Y', 'TAT':'Y', 'TAA':'*', 'TAG':'*', 'TGC':'C', 'TGT':'C', 'TGA':'*', 'TGG':'W',\n    }\n\n    def translate(seq):\n        protein = \"\"\n        for i in range(0, len(seq) - (len(seq) % 3), 3):\n            codon = seq[i:i+3]\n            amino_acid = codon_table.get(codon, 'X') # 'X' for unknown\n            if amino_acid == '*':\n                protein += '*'\n                break\n            protein += amino_acid\n        return protein\n\n    # Gene sequences\n    intact_gene = \"ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\n    mutant_1 = \"ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\"\n    mutant_2 = \"ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\"\n    mutant_3 = \"ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\n    mutant_4 = \"ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\n\n    print(\"Analysis of Gene Mutations:\\n\")\n\n    # Intact Gene\n    print(f\"Intact Gene:        ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...\")\n    print(f\"Translated Protein: {translate(intact_gene)}\")\n    print(\"Analysis: This is the original, functional protein.\\n\")\n\n    # Mutant 1\n    print(f\"Mutant 1:           ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT...\")\n    print(f\"Translated Protein: {translate(mutant_1)}\")\n    print(\"Analysis: This is a missense mutation (Leucine -> Tyrosine).

This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the target gene. To eliminate the compound, we need to disrupt the function of this protein, ideally by creating a \"knockout\" mutation that results in a non-functional or absent protein.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Intact Gene Sequence**\nThe provided sequence is the beginning of the coding region (first exon) of the gene.\nIntact gene: `5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`\n\nLet's break this sequence into codons (groups of three nucleotides) to determine the original amino acid sequence. The reading frame starts with `ATG`, which is the start codon.\n*   `ATG` - Methionine (Met) - Start codon\n*   `TTT` - Phenylalanine (Phe)\n*   `CTC` - Leucine (Leu)\n*   `GCT` - Alanine (Ala)\n*   `GGT` - Glycine (Gly)\n*   `ACT` - Threonine (Thr)\n*   ...and so on.\n\nThe goal is to find a mutation that causes the most significant disruption to the protein that will be translated from this sequence.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Each Mutant Individually**\n\n**Careful Point:** The most effective mutations for knocking out gene function are typically **nonsense mutations** (which create a premature stop codon) or **frameshift mutations** (insertions or deletions of nucleotides not in a multiple of three). These are generally more disruptive than **missense mutations** (which change one amino acid to another) or **silent mutations** (which don't change the amino acid at all).\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`\n    *   Let's compare it to the intact gene, codon by codon:\n        *   Intact: `ATG TTT CTC ...` (Met-Phe-Leu...)\n        *   Mutant 1: `ATG TTC TAC ...` (Met-Phe-Tyr...)\n    *   Analysis: The codon `TTT` has changed to `TTC`. Both `TTT` and `TTC` code for Phenylalanine (Phe), so this is a silent mutation. The codon `CTC` (Leucine) has changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It changes one amino acid. While this *could* affect protein function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`\n    *   Let's compare it to the intact gene, codon by codon:\n        *   Intact: `ATG TTT CTC ...` (Met-Phe-Leu...)\n        *   Mutant 2: `ATG TTC TAA ...`\n    *   Analysis: The codon `TTT` has changed to `TTC` (a silent mutation, as in Mutant 1). The codon `CTC` (Leucine) has changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **STOP codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   **Impact:** This mutation will cause the ribosome to stop translation after the second amino acid (Phenylalanine). The resulting protein will be only two amino acids long (Met-Phe). A protein this severely truncated is almost certain to be non-functional. This is a very strong candidate for eliminating the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`\n    *   Let's compare it to the intact gene, codon by codon:\n        *   Intact: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ...` (Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly-Thr...)\n        *   Mutant 3: `ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ...` (Met-Phe-Tyr-Ala-Gly-Val...)\n    *   Analysis: The codon `CTC` (Leucine) has changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and the codon `ACT` (Threonine) has changed to `GTC` (Valine). These are two separate **missense mutations**. Like Mutant 1, this changes the amino acid sequence, but it doesn't guarantee a complete loss of function.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`\n    *   Let's compare it to the intact gene:\n        *   Intact: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT ...`\n        *   Mutant 4: `ATG TTT TAC GCT --- ACT TCT ...`\n    *   Analysis: There are two changes here. First, the codon `CTC` (Leucine) has changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), which is a **missense mutation**. Second, the codon `GGT` (Glycine) has been deleted entirely. Since a full codon (3 nucleotides) was deleted, this is an **in-frame deletion**. The reading frame for the rest of the gene is preserved, but the final protein will be missing one amino acid (Glycine) and have another one changed (Leu to Tyr). While this is a significant change, it is less likely to cause a complete knockout than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Mutations and Conclude**\n*   Mutant 1: One amino acid change. (Less likely to be a knockout)\n*   **Mutant 2: Introduces a premature STOP codon. Protein synthesis stops almost immediately. (Most likely to be a knockout)**\n*   Mutant 3: Two amino acid changes. (Less likely to be a knockout)\n*   Mutant 4: One amino acid change and one amino acid deletion. (Significant, but less certain to be a knockout than a premature stop codon).\n\nThe nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most drastic change, leading to a severely truncated and almost certainly non-functional protein. Therefore, this mutation is the most probable one to eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nTo determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to find the mutation that is most likely to create a non-functional protein. This is typically achieved by a mutation that causes a major disruption in the protein's structure, such as a frameshift or a premature stop codon.\n\nLet's analyze the effect of each mutation by translating the DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence. The genetic code is read in triplets called codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n**1. Intact Gene:**\n*   Sequence: 5’-**ATG TTT CTC GCT**...-3’\n*   Translation:\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Start)\n    *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine\n    *   `CTC` -> Leucine\n    *   `GCT` -> Alanine\n*   Protein Start: Met-Phe-Leu-Ala...\n\n**2. Mutant 1:**\n*   Sequence: 5’-**ATG TTC TAC GCT**...-3’\n*   Changes from intact gene: `TTT` -> `TTC` and `CTC` -> `TAC`.\n*   Translation:\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine\n    *   `TTC` -> Phenylalanine (Note: `TTT` and `TTC` both code for Phenylalanine, so this is a silent mutation).\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Note: `CTC` for Leucine is changed to `TAC` for Tyrosine. This is a missense mutation).\n    *   `GCT` -> Alanine\n*   Protein Start: Met-Phe-**Tyr**-Ala...\n*   Effect: This is a missense mutation, which changes one amino acid. The resulting protein is altered, but it may or may not be functional. It is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than other types of mutations.\n\n**3. Mutant 2:**\n*   Sequence: 5’-**ATG TTC TAA GCT**...-3’\n*   Changes from intact gene: `TTT` -> `TTC` and `CTC` -> `TAA`.\n*   Translation:\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine\n    *   `TTC` -> Phenylalanine\n    *   `TAA` -> **STOP**\n*   Protein Start: Met-Phe-STOP\n*   Effect: This is a **nonsense mutation**. The `TAA` codon is a stop codon, which signals the ribosome to terminate translation. This will result in a very short, truncated protein containing only two amino acids. This protein will almost certainly be non-functional.\n\n**4. Mutant 3:**\n*   Sequence: 5’-**ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT**...-3’\n*   Changes from intact gene: `CTC` -> `TAC` (missense mutation, Leu -> Tyr) and an insertion of `GTC` after `GGT`.\n*   Effect: This mutation causes one amino acid change and an insertion of a single amino acid (Valine, from `GTC`). Because a full codon (3 bases) was inserted, the reading frame is not shifted. This is an in-frame insertion. The protein is altered but may still be functional.\n\n**5. Mutant 4:**\n*   Sequence: 5’-**ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT**...-3’\n*   Changes from intact gene: `CTC` -> `TAC` (missense mutation, Leu -> Tyr) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon.\n*   Effect: This mutation causes one amino acid change and the deletion of one amino acid (Glycine, from `GGT`). Because a full codon was deleted, this is an in-frame deletion. The protein is altered but may still be functional.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon very early in the gene. This leads to the production of a severely truncated and non-functional protein. This is the most effective way among the given options to \"knock out\" the gene's function and thus eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine which mutation will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to analyze the effect of each mutation on the gene's protein product. The goal is to find the mutation most likely to result in a non-functional protein.\n\nThe intact gene sequence begins with `5’-ATG TTT CTC...`, where `ATG` is the start codon. The protein synthesis starts here.\n\nLet's analyze each mutant:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC...`\n    *   Compared to the intact gene (`ATG TTT CTC`), the second codon `TTT` has changed to `TTC`. Both `TTT` and `TTC` code for the amino acid Phenylalanine, making this a **silent mutation** with no effect on the protein sequence.\n    *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, which substitutes one amino acid for another. A missense mutation might alter or even eliminate protein function, but it is not guaranteed. The effect depends on the importance of that specific amino acid to the protein's structure and function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA...`\n    *   The second codon change (`TTT` to `TTC`) is a silent mutation, as in Mutant 1.\n    *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This type of change is called a **nonsense mutation**. It causes protein synthesis to terminate prematurely, resulting in a very short, truncated protein (in this case, only two amino acids long). A truncated protein is almost always non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...`\n    *   This sequence appears to have multiple single-base changes compared to the intact gene. However, a closer look at the sequence `ATGTTT**T**ACG...` reveals an insertion of a single nucleotide (`T`) after the second codon.\n    *   An insertion of a number of bases not divisible by three causes a **frameshift mutation**. This alters the three-base-pair reading frame for all subsequent codons, leading to a completely different and usually non-functional amino acid sequence, which often ends in a premature stop codon. Like a nonsense mutation, a frameshift mutation is very likely to eliminate protein function.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...`\n    *   This sequence is difficult to interpret as a single, simple mutational event like those typically caused by EMS. It appears to involve multiple substitutions or a combination of a substitution and a deletion. For instance, if we assume the `GGT` codon was deleted and the `CTC` codon was changed to `TAC`, this would be a complex mutation. An in-frame deletion (of 3 bases) would remove an amino acid, which may or may not eliminate function, while a missense mutation has an uncertain effect. Due to its complexity and ambiguity, it is a less likely candidate.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBoth a nonsense mutation (Mutant 2) and a frameshift mutation (Mutant 3) are highly likely to result in a complete loss of protein function. However, the problem states that the mutants were generated using EMS. EMS is a chemical mutagen that primarily causes point mutations (substitutions), particularly G:C to A:T transitions, and is less likely to cause insertions or deletions.\n\n*   The change in **Mutant 2** (`CTC` to `TAA`) is a point mutation (a substitution).\n*   The change in **Mutant 3** is an insertion.\n\nGiven that EMS was used, a point mutation is a more probable event than an insertion. The nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is a point mutation that is virtually guaranteed to eliminate the protein's function by creating a severely truncated product. Therefore, it is the most probable mutation to achieve the desired outcome.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nTo identify the mutation most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to find the one that would most severely disrupt the function of the gene responsible for its synthesis. This is typically achieved by a mutation that leads to a non-functional or truncated protein.\n\n### Analysis of the Mutations\n\nFirst, let's establish the reading frame from the intact gene sequence. The sequence begins with `ATG`, the start codon, so the codons are read in groups of three from the beginning.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT`…-3’\n    *   This translates to: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n\nNow, let's analyze each mutant:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT`…-3’\n    *   Compared to the intact gene, the `TTT` codon is now `TTC`, and `CTC` is now `TAC`.\n    *   `TTT` to `TTC` both code for Phenylalanine (a silent mutation).\n    *   `CTC` (Leucine) changes to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, which substitutes one amino acid for another. While this could potentially affect the protein's function, it might also have little to no effect, especially if the amino acids have similar properties or are not in a critical region of the protein. The protein is still produced at full length.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT`…-3’\n    *   Here, the `CTC` codon for Leucine has been changed to `TAA`.\n    *   `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This type of change is called a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   This mutation causes translation to stop prematurely, resulting in a severely shortened protein (only two amino acids long in this case). A truncated protein of this nature is almost certain to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT`…-3’\n    *   Comparing the codons to the intact gene:\n        *   `CTC` (Leucine) changes to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n        *   `ACT` (Threonine) changes to `GTC` (Valine).\n    *   This mutant contains at least two **missense mutations**. Similar to Mutant 1, this changes amino acids but still produces a full-length protein. The functional impact is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT`…-3’\n    *   Comparing the codons to the intact gene:\n        *   `CTC` (Leucine) changes to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n        *   `GGT` (Glycine) changes to `GCT` (Alanine).\n    *   This mutant also contains two **missense mutations**. Like mutants 1 and 3, it produces a full-length protein with a few amino acid changes, making the loss of function less certain than a nonsense mutation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAmong the given options, a nonsense mutation is the most likely to cause a complete loss of function. Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the protein-coding sequence. This will halt protein synthesis and produce a tiny, non-functional peptide, thereby eliminating the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound. While frameshift mutations are also highly effective at knocking out genes, Mutant 2 clearly and unambiguously represents a nonsense mutation, the most severe type among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, the most effective strategy is to \"knock out\" the gene responsible for its synthesis. This means introducing a mutation that renders the protein produced by the gene non-functional. Let's analyze the effects of each mutation.\n\nThe intact gene's initial codons are:\n`5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT...-3’`\nThis translates to the amino acid sequence:\nMet - Phe - Leu - Ala...\n\nNow let's examine the mutants:\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n    *   The codons are `ATG` (Met), `TTC` (Phe), and `TAC` (Tyr).\n    *   This is a **missense mutation**, where one amino acid (Leucine) is replaced by another (Tyrosine). While this might alter the protein's function, it doesn't guarantee it will be completely non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    *   The codons are `ATG` (Met), `TTC` (Phe), and `TAA`.\n    *   `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This type of mutation is called a **nonsense mutation**. It causes translation to halt prematurely, resulting in a very short, truncated protein (only two amino acids long). A nonsense mutation that occurs so early in the gene sequence is highly likely to produce a non-functional protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’`\n    *   This sequence contains multiple amino acid changes compared to the original.\n    *   This represents multiple **missense mutations**. Like Mutant 1, it results in a full-length protein with some altered amino acids. This might affect function, but it is less certain to eliminate it entirely compared to a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   Comparing this to the intact gene, a missense mutation has occurred (`CTC` to `TAC`), and the `GGT` codon has been deleted.\n    *   Since a full codon (three bases) was removed, the reading frame is not shifted. This is an **in-frame deletion**. The resulting protein will be missing one amino acid (Glycine) and have another substituted (Leucine to Tyrosine). This is less likely to completely abolish protein function than a premature stop codon.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe most effective mutation for eliminating the function of a protein is the one that prevents a full-length, functional version from being made. The nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a stop signal at the very beginning of the protein-coding sequence. This is the most probable option to successfully eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nTo solve this problem, we need to analyze the genetic mutations in each mutant line and determine which one is most likely to result in a non-functional protein, thereby eliminating the production of the anti-nutritional compound. A non-functional protein is most reliably produced by a mutation that severely disrupts the gene's reading frame or introduces a premature stop codon.\n\nLet's break down the DNA sequence into codons (three-base units) and translate them into amino acids for the intact gene and each mutant. The standard genetic code will be used for translation. The gene starts with the `ATG` start codon.\n\n**Intact Gene Sequence:**\n`5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA-3’`\n*   **Translation:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr - Ser - Val - Asp - Glu - His - Ile - Tyr - Cys - Arg...\n\nNow, let's analyze each mutant:\n\n**Mutant 1:**\n*   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC…TGA-3’`\n*   Comparison with Intact:\n    *   Codon 2: `TTT` -> `TTC`. Both codons code for Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a **silent mutation**.\n    *   Codon 3: `CTC` -> `TAC`. `CTC` codes for Leucine (Leu), while `TAC` codes for Tyrosine (Tyr). This is a **missense mutation**, which changes one amino acid.\n*   **Effect:** A single amino acid change might or might not inactivate the protein. Its function could be reduced, altered, or unaffected. It is not the most certain way to eliminate function.\n\n**Mutant 2:**\n*   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC…TGA-3’`\n*   Comparison with Intact:\n    *   Codon 2: `TTT` -> `TTC`. This is a silent mutation (Phe).\n    *   Codon 3: `CTC` -> `TAA`. `CTC` codes for Leucine (Leu), while `TAA` is a **stop codon**.\n*   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. It introduces a premature stop codon very early in the sequence. The translation will terminate after the second amino acid, producing a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe). This truncated protein will be non-functional. This is the most likely mutation to completely eliminate the synthesis of the target compound.\n\n**Mutant 3:**\n*   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA-3’`\n*   Comparison with Intact:\n    *   Codon 3: `CTC` -> `TAC`. Missense mutation (Leu -> Tyr).\n    *   Codon 6: `ACT` -> `GTC`. `ACT` codes for Threonine (Thr), while `GTC` codes for Valine (Val). This is another **missense mutation**.\n*   **Effect:** This mutant has two amino acid changes. While this increases the chance of disrupting the protein's function compared to a single missense mutation, it is still not as definitive as a premature stop codon. The protein is still fully translated.\n\n**Mutant 4:**\n*   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA-3’`\n*   Comparison with Intact: The mutant sequence is shorter.\n    *   Intact: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...` (Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly-Thr...)\n    *   Mutant: `ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...` (Met-Phe-Tyr-Ala-Thr...)\n    *   The sequence `CTC GCT GGT` (coding for Leu-Ala-Gly) in the intact gene has been effectively changed to `TAC GCT` (coding for Tyr-Ala), and the reading frame continues from there. This represents a combination of a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`) and a deletion of one codon (`GGT`).\n*   **Effect:** This is an **in-frame deletion** (deletion of 3 bases) combined with a missense mutation. The protein will be missing one amino acid (Glycine) and have another changed (Leu to Tyr), but the rest of the protein will be translated correctly. This might inactivate the protein, but like missense mutations, the outcome is not as certain as a nonsense mutation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe most effective mutation for eliminating a protein's function is the one that causes the most severe disruption. A nonsense mutation (Mutant 2) introduces a premature stop codon, leading to a severely truncated and guaranteed non-functional protein. The other mutations (missense and in-frame deletion) result in a full-length or near-full-length protein with one or two amino acid changes, which may or may not be sufficient to eliminate its function. Therefore, Mutant 2 is the most probable candidate to achieve the desired outcome.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the most effective mutation:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein, which is encoded by a specific gene. To stop the compound's synthesis, we need to disrupt the gene so that it no longer produces a functional protein.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Gene:** The intact gene sequence begins with `5’-ATG...`, which is the universal start codon (Methionine). It ends with `...TGA-3’`, which is one of the three stop codons. The protein synthesis starts at `ATG` and continues until a stop codon is reached.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Types of Mutations:**\n    *   **Silent Mutation:** A change in the DNA sequence that does not change the amino acid sequence. This has no effect on the protein.\n    *   **Missense Mutation:** A change in the DNA that results in a different amino acid being incorporated into the protein. This *might* disrupt protein function, especially if the change occurs in a critical region, but it could also have little to no effect.\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** A change in the DNA that results in a premature stop codon. This truncates the protein, and if it occurs early in the sequence, it almost always results in a non-functional protein.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation (Insertion/Deletion):** The insertion or deletion of nucleotides (not in a multiple of three). This shifts the reading frame, changing every subsequent amino acid. This typically leads to a completely different and non-functional protein, often encountering a premature stop codon in the new frame.\n\n4.  **Analyze Each Mutant Sequence:** We will break down each DNA sequence into three-letter codons and translate them into amino acids to see the effect of the mutation. The genetic code will be used for translation (`_` represents a stop codon).\n\n    *   **Intact Gene:**\n        *   DNA: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ...`\n        *   Protein: `Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr ...`\n        *   This is our baseline for a functional protein.\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:**\n        *   DNA: `ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT ...`\n        *   Protein: `Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Gly - Thr ...`\n        *   **Analysis:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It changes a single amino acid. This might not be enough to completely inactivate the protein.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:**\n        *   DNA: `ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT ...`\n        *   Protein: `Met - Phe - STOP`\n        *   **Analysis:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAA` (a stop codon). This is a **nonsense mutation**. Translation will stop after the second amino acid, producing a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide. This peptide will almost certainly be non-functional.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:**\n        *   DNA: `ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT ...`\n        *   Protein: `Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Gly - Val - Thr ...`\n        *   **Analysis:** This sequence contains two changes compared to the intact gene: `CTC` (Leu) -> `TAC` (Tyr) and `ACT` (Thr) -> `GTC` (Val). These are two **missense mutations**. While two changes are more disruptive than one, it is still not guaranteed to eliminate function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:**\n        *   DNA: `ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT ...`\n        *   Protein: `Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala - Thr - Ser ...`\n        *   **Analysis:** This sequence also contains two changes: `CTC` (Leu) -> `TAC` (Tyr) and `GGT` (Gly) -> `ACT` (Thr). These are two **missense mutations**. Again, this is not as certain to eliminate function as a premature stop codon.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The most effective way to ensure a gene is knocked out is to prevent the synthesis of a full-length protein. Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the protein-coding sequence. This is the most drastic and definitive change among the options, making it the most probable mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nTo determine which mutation will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to identify the mutation that is most likely to create a non-functional protein. A non-functional protein is most reliably produced by a mutation that causes a major disruption, such as a premature stop to protein synthesis.\n\nLet's analyze the effect of each mutation by translating the DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence. The genetic code is read in three-base-pair units called codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n**Intact Gene (Control)**\n*   **DNA Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’\n*   **Codons:** `ATG` (Methionine/Start), `TTT` (Phenylalanine), `CTC` (Leucine), `GCT` (Alanine), `GGT` (Glycine)\n*   **Protein Sequence:** Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly...\nThis is the functional protein that produces the unwanted compound.\n\n**Analysis of Mutants**\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   **DNA Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’\n    *   **Changes:** The second codon `TTT` becomes `TTC`, and the third codon `CTC` becomes `TAC`.\n    *   **Effect:**\n        *   `TTT` -> `TTC`: Both codons code for Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a **silent mutation** with no effect on the protein.\n        *   `CTC` (Leucine) -> `TAC` (Tyrosine): This is a **missense mutation**, which substitutes one amino acid for another. This might alter the protein's function, but it is not guaranteed to inactivate it.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   **DNA Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’\n    *   **Changes:** The second codon `TTT` becomes `TTC`, and the third codon `CTC` becomes `TAA`.\n    *   **Effect:**\n        *   `TTT` -> `TTC`: This is a silent mutation (Phe -> Phe).\n        *   `CTC` (Leucine) -> `TAA` (**STOP**): This is a **nonsense mutation**. The `TAA` codon is a stop codon, which signals the ribosome to terminate protein synthesis.\n    *   **Result:** Protein synthesis will stop after only two amino acids have been joined. The resulting product will be a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe), which will be completely non-functional. This mutation will almost certainly eliminate the protein's activity.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   **DNA Sequence:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’\n    *   **Changes:** This sequence contains two **missense mutations**: `CTC` (Leu) -> `TAC` (Tyr) and `ACT` (Thr) -> `GTC` (Val).

This is an **in-frame deletion** because a full codon (3 bases) is removed, which deletes an amino acid without shifting the reading frame. The resulting protein will be missing one amino acid and have another changed. This is a significant alteration but does not guarantee complete loss of function.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most severe because it introduces a premature stop codon very early in the gene. This will halt protein synthesis, resulting in a severely truncated and non-functional protein. This is the most reliable way to \"knock out\" the gene's function among the choices provided.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which mutation is most likely to result in a non-functional protein, thereby eliminating the production of the anti-nutritional compound. A non-functional protein is most reliably created by a mutation that causes a major disruption to the protein's structure, such as stopping its synthesis prematurely.\n\nLet's analyze the effect of each mutation by translating the DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence.

When the ribosome encounters this codon, it terminates translation. This results in a severely truncated protein containing only two amino acids. Such a short peptide is almost certain to be non-functional.\n\n**4. Mutant 3 Analysis**\n*   **Sequence:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT`... -3’\n*   **Change:** Two changes are present.

Mutant 4 Analysis**\n*   **Sequence:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT`... -3’\n*   **Change:** Comparing to the intact gene (`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), we see that the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`.\n*   **Protein:** Met-Phe-Tyr-Ala-Thr...\n*   **Effect:** This is a combination of a **missense mutation** (Leu -> Tyr) and an **in-frame deletion** (the Glycine codon `GGT` is removed). Because three bases (one full codon) were removed, the reading frame is not shifted. The resulting protein is one amino acid shorter and has another amino acid changed. This alters the protein, but like a missense mutation, it doesn't guarantee a complete loss of function.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe most drastic and reliable way to eliminate a protein's function among the given options is to introduce a premature stop codon, as seen in Mutant 2.

Translation starts at the `ATG` codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene Sequence and Protein:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...-3’\n    *   **Amino Acids:** Methionine - Phenylalanine - Leucine - Alanine - Glycine - Threonine...\n\nNow, let's examine the effect of each mutation:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’\n    *   **Change:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, which substitutes one amino acid for another. While this could alter the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’\n    *   **Change:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This type of change is called a **nonsense mutation**. It signals the machinery to stop protein synthesis prematurely. The resulting protein will be extremely short (only two amino acids long) and almost certainly non-functional. This is the most probable mutation to completely eliminate the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’\n    *   **Change:** This sequence shows multiple single-base substitutions compared to the original, resulting in several amino acid changes (e.g., Leucine to Tyrosine, Threonine to Valine). These are multiple **missense mutations**. Similar to Mutant 1, this will alter the protein, but complete loss of function is less certain than with a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’\n    *   **Change:** This sequence also contains multiple **missense mutations** (e.g., Leucine to Tyrosine, Glycine to Threonine). Like the other missense mutations, the effect is not as predictably severe as a nonsense mutation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nMutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon very early in the protein-coding sequence. This nonsense mutation will lead to a severely truncated and non-functional protein, making it the most likely candidate to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nTo determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to find the mutation that will most probably result in a non-functional protein. This is typically achieved through a nonsense mutation (creating a premature stop codon) or a frameshift mutation (insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three). These mutations lead to a truncated or completely scrambled protein, which is almost always non-functional.\n\nLet's analyze the effect of each mutation by translating the DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence. The genetic code is read in triplets called codons, starting from the start codon ATG.\n\n**Intact Gene:**\n*   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT ... -3’\n*   **mRNA:** 5’-AUG UUU CUC GCU GGU ACU UCU ... -3’\n*   **Amino Acids:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr - Ser ...\n\nThis is the functional protein that produces the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nNow let's analyze each mutant:\n\n**Mutant 1:**\n*   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT ... -3’ (parsed from `ATGTTCTACGCT...`)\n*   **mRNA:** 5’-AUG UUC UAC GCU ... -3’\n*   **Amino Acids:** Met - Phe - Tyr - Ala ...\n*   **Effect:** The third codon, CTC (Leucine), has been changed to TAC (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, which substitutes one amino acid for another. While this *could* potentially inactivate the protein if the amino acid is in a critical location, it often results in a protein that is still functional. It is less likely to cause a complete knockout compared to other types of mutations.\n\n**Mutant 2:**\n*   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT ... -3’ (parsed from `ATGTTCTAAGCT...`)\n*   **mRNA:** 5’-AUG UUC UAA GCU ... -3’\n*   **Amino Acids:** Met - Phe - **STOP**\n*   **Effect:** The third codon, CTC (Leucine), has been changed to TAA, which is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. The synthesis of the protein will terminate prematurely after only two amino acids. The resulting polypeptide will be extremely short and certainly non-functional. This is a very effective way to knock out a gene's function.\n\n**Mutant 3:**\n*   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT **GTC** ACT TCT ... -3’ (parsed from `ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCT...`)\n*   **Effect:** Comparing this to the intact sequence (`...GCT GGT ACT...`), a new codon, GTC, has been inserted between GGT and ACT. This is an **in-frame insertion** of one codon (GTC codes for Valine). The resulting protein will have one extra amino acid but the rest of the reading frame is intact. This may or may not inactivate the protein, but it's less disruptive than a premature stop codon.\n\n**Mutant 4:**\n*   **DNA:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT ... -3’ (parsed from `ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCT...`)\n*   **Effect:** Comparing this to the intact sequence (`...GCT GGT ACT...`), the codon GGT has been removed. This is an **in-frame deletion** of one codon. The resulting protein will be missing one amino acid (Glycine), but the rest of the reading frame will be correct. Similar to Mutant 3, this might not completely inactivate the protein.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe mutation in **Mutant 2** introduces a premature stop codon very early in the gene (the third codon). This will lead to the production of a severely truncated and non-functional protein. Therefore, this mutation is the most probable one to successfully eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nTo eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, the function of the gene responsible for its synthesis must be inactivated. This is often referred to as a \"gene knockout\". Analyzing the different types of mutations introduced in the mutant lines helps determine which is most likely to result in a non-functional protein.\n\n### Analysis of the Mutations:\n\nFirst, let's establish the reading frame of the intact gene. The sequence begins with `ATG`, which is the universal start codon for protein synthesis. The genetic code is read in triplets, or codons, from this point.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   **Codons & Amino Acids:**\n        *   `ATG` - Methionine (Start)\n        *   `TTT` - Phenylalanine\n        *   `CTC` - Leucine\n        *   `GCT` - Alanine\n\nNow let's examine the mutations:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n    *   The second codon `TTT` is changed to `TTC`. Both `TTT` and `TTC` code for Phenylalanine, so this is a silent mutation.\n    *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, which changes a single amino acid. A missense mutation might alter or reduce the protein's function, but it does not guarantee complete inactivation.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon** (also known as a nonsense codon).\n    *   This type of change is called a **nonsense mutation**. It causes translation to terminate prematurely, resulting in a severely truncated and almost certainly non-functional protein. Introducing a premature stop codon is a common and effective strategy for creating a gene knockout.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n    *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   The sixth codon `ACT` (Threonine) is changed to `GTC` (Valine).\n    *   This mutant has two **missense mutations**. While multiple amino acid changes increase the likelihood of disrupting protein function compared to a single change, it is still less certain to cause complete inactivation than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   This is a single **missense mutation**, similar to Mutant 1. It may or may not eliminate the protein's function.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe most effective mutation for eliminating the function of a gene is a nonsense mutation that introduces a premature stop codon early in the coding sequence. This leads to a truncated protein that is highly unlikely to be functional. Mutant 2 is the only one with a nonsense mutation (`TAA`) at the very beginning of the gene (the third codon). The other mutants only have missense mutations, which substitute one amino acid for another and may not completely abolish the protein's activity. Therefore, Mutant 2 is the most probable candidate to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nMy plan is to analyze each mutation to determine its effect on the protein produced by the gene. The goal is to find the mutation that is most likely to completely inactivate the protein, thus eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n1.  **Establish a baseline:** I will first translate the sequence of the intact gene to understand the original amino acid sequence.\n2.  **Define a translation tool:** I will create a standard genetic code dictionary (DNA codon to amino acid) and a function to perform the translation.\n3.  **Analyze each mutant:** I will translate each of the four mutant sequences.\n4.  **Compare the effects:**\n    *   A **missense mutation** changes one amino acid. This might alter or reduce the protein's function, but it may not eliminate it.\n    *   A **nonsense mutation** introduces a premature stop codon. This truncates the protein, and if it happens early in the sequence, it almost certainly results in a non-functional protein.\n    *   A **frameshift mutation** (caused by an insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three) changes the reading frame. This alters all subsequent amino acids and often leads to a premature stop codon, resulting in a non-functional protein.\n5.  **Conclusion:** I will identify the mutation that causes the most severe disruption. A nonsense or frameshift mutation early in the gene is the most likely candidate to achieve the desired outcome. I will then select the corresponding option.\n\n```python\ndef solve_mutation_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes gene mutations to find the one most likely to\n    inactivate the resulting protein.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the genetic code and the DNA sequences.\n    genetic_code = {\n        'ATA':'I', 'ATC':'I', 'ATT':'I', 'ATG':'M',\n        'ACA':'T', 'ACC':'T', 'ACG':'T', 'ACT':'T',\n        'AAC':'N', 'AAT':'N', 'AAA':'K', 'AAG':'K',\n        'AGC':'S', 'AGT':'S', 'TCA':'S', 'TCC':'S', 'TCG':'S', 'TCT':'S',\n        'AGA':'R', 'AGG':'R', 'CGA':'R', 'CGC':'R', 'CGG':'R', 'CGT':'R',\n        'CTA':'L', 'CTC':'L', 'CTG':'L', 'CTT':'L', 'TTA':'L', 'TTG':'L',\n        'CCA':'P', 'CCC':'P', 'CCG':'P', 'CCT':'P',\n        'CAC':'H', 'CAT':'H', 'CAA':'Q', 'CAG':'Q',\n        'GTA':'V', 'GTC':'V', 'GTG':'V', 'GTT':'V',\n        'GCA':'A', 'GCC':'A', 'GCG':'A', 'GCT':'A',\n        'GAC':'D', 'GAT':'D', 'GAA':'E', 'GAG':'E',\n        'GGA':'G', 'GGC':'G', 'GGG':'G', 'GGT':'G',\n        'TTC':'F', 'TTT':'F', 'TAC':'Y', 'TAT':'Y',\n        'TGC':'C', 'TGT':'C', 'TGG':'W',\n        'TAA':'_STOP_', 'TAG':'_STOP_', 'TGA':'_STOP_'\n    }\n\n    sequences = {\n        \"Intact gene\": \"ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\",\n        \"Mutant 1\": \"ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\",\n        \"Mutant 2\": \"ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\",\n        \"Mutant 3\": \"ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\",\n        \"Mutant 4\": \"ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Define a translation function.\n    def translate(dna_seq):\n        protein = []\n        for i in range(0, len(dna_seq) - (len(dna_seq) % 3), 3):\n            codon = dna_seq[i:i+3]\n            amino_acid = genetic_code.get(codon, 'X') # 'X' for unknown\n            protein.append(amino_acid)\n            if amino_acid == '_STOP_':\n                break\n        return \"-\".join(protein)\n\n    # Step 3: Analyze each sequence and print the results.\n    print(\"Analysis of Gene Sequences:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Translate and analyze the intact gene\n    intact_protein = translate(sequences[\"Intact gene\"])\n    print(f\"Intact gene protein (start): {intact_protein}\")\n    print(\"This is the reference for a functional protein.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    \n    # Translate and analyze Mutant 1\n    # Intact: ATG TTT CTC...

To do this, we need to inactivate the protein that this gene encodes. The most effective way to inactivate a protein is to prevent its correct and full-length synthesis. We need to find the mutation that is *most likely* to cause a complete loss of function of the protein.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Intact Gene Sequence**\nThe intact gene sequence begins with `5’-ATG...`. In molecular biology, `ATG` is the standard start codon, which signals the beginning of protein translation and codes for the amino acid Methionine. The protein is built by reading the DNA sequence in groups of three nucleotides, called codons.\nThe initial reading frame is:\n`ATG` (Methionine - START)\n`TTT` (Phenylalanine)\n`CTC` (Leucine)\n`GCT` (Alanine)\n`GGT` (Glycine)\n...and so on.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Each Mutant for its Effect on the Protein**\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   Intact: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT...`\n    *   Mutant: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...`\n    *   **Change:** The codon `TTT` is changed to `TTC`, and `CTC` is changed to `TAC`.\n    *   **Effect:**\n        *   `TTT` (Phenylalanine) -> `TTC` (Phenylalanine): This is a **silent mutation**; the amino acid does not change.\n        *   `CTC` (Leucine) -> `TAC` (Tyrosine): This is a **missense mutation**; it substitutes one amino acid for another.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This mutation results in a full-length protein with only one amino acid changed. While this *could* potentially affect the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to inactivate it. Many single amino acid changes have little to no effect.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   Intact: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT...`\n    *   Mutant: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...`\n    *   **Change:** The codon `CTC` is changed to `TAA`.\n    *   **Effect:** `TAA` is one of the three **stop codons** (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). This type of mutation is called a **nonsense mutation**. It signals the ribosome to stop translation prematurely.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The protein synthesis will stop after the second amino acid. This will produce a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Methionine-Phenylalanine) instead of the full-length functional protein. This is almost certain to completely eliminate the protein's function.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   Intact: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...`\n    *   Mutant: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT...` (Note: a `T` is inserted between `TTT` and `C` from `CTC`)\n    *   **Change:** A single nucleotide (`T`) has been inserted.\n    *   **Effect:** This is a **frameshift mutation**. The insertion shifts the three-letter reading frame for all subsequent codons. The new amino acid sequence will be completely different from the original from that point onwards.\n    *   **Conclusion:** A frameshift mutation early in a gene is extremely likely to produce a non-functional protein. The altered sequence often creates a premature stop codon by chance a short distance downstream. This is also a very effective way to knock out a gene.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   Intact: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...`\n    *   Mutant: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...`\n    *   **Change:** A comparison shows that `CTC` has changed to `TAC` (a missense mutation, as in Mutant 1) and the `GGT` codon has been deleted entirely.\n    *   **Effect:** This is an **in-frame deletion** (a deletion of 3 nucleotides, which removes one amino acid without shifting the reading frame) combined with a missense mutation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** A nearly full-length protein is produced that is simply missing one amino acid (Glycine) and has another changed (Leucine to Tyrosine). Like the missense mutation, this may or may not inactivate the protein. It is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Mutations and Select the Best Candidate**\nWe are looking for the mutation *most likely* to eliminate the compound.\n*   **Low Probability:** Mutant 1 (missense) and Mutant 4 (in-frame deletion) produce a protein that is still mostly intact. Their ability to knock out function is uncertain.\n*   **High Probability:** Mutant 2 (nonsense) and Mutant 3 (frameshift) are both highly effective at creating non-functional proteins.\n*   **Final Choice:** The nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** introduces a definitive \"STOP\" signal for protein synthesis right at the beginning of the gene. This guarantees the production of a severely truncated and non-functional peptide. This is arguably the most direct and certain method of gene inactivation among the given choices.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nAn effective way to eliminate a gene's function is to introduce a mutation that results in a non-functional or truncated protein. The most severe mutations are typically frameshift mutations (insertions or deletions not divisible by three) or nonsense mutations (which introduce a premature stop codon).\n\nLet's analyze each mutation by comparing it to the intact gene and translating the resulting sequence. The genetic code is read in triplets called codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n**Intact Gene:**\n*   **Sequence:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT ... TGA-3’`\n*   **Codons:** ATG (Met), TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser)\n*   **Protein:** Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly-Thr-Ser...\n*   This sequence produces the full-length, functional protein responsible for the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n**Mutant 1:**\n*   **Sequence:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT ... TGA-3’`\n*   **Comparison:** The original `TTT CTC` is changed to `TTC TAC`.\n    *   `TTT` -> `TTC`: Both codons code for Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a **silent mutation**.\n    *   `CTC` -> `TAC`: `CTC` codes for Leucine (Leu), while `TAC` codes for Tyrosine (Tyr). This is a **missense mutation**, changing one amino acid in the protein.\n*   **Protein:** Met-Phe-**Tyr**-Ala-Gly-Thr-Ser...\n*   **Effect:** A single amino acid change might alter the protein's function, but it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely.\n\n**Mutant 2:**\n*   **Sequence:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT ... TGA-3’`\n*   **Comparison:** The original `TTT CTC` is changed to `TTC TAA`.\n    *   `TTT` -> `TTC`: Silent mutation (Phe -> Phe).\n    *   `CTC` -> `TAA`: `CTC` codes for Leucine (Leu), while `TAA` is a **stop codon**.\n*   **Protein:** Met-Phe-**STOP**.\n*   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. It introduces a premature stop codon at the third position. The cell will only produce a tiny, two-amino-acid-long peptide (Met-Phe). This resulting peptide will be completely non-functional, thus eliminating the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n**Mutant 3:**\n*   **Sequence:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT ... TGA-3’`\n*   **Comparison:** The original `CTC` and `ACT` are changed to `TAC` and `GTC`.\n    *   `CTC` (Leu) -> `TAC` (Tyr): A missense mutation.\n    *   `ACT` (Thr) -> `GTC` (Val): Another missense mutation.\n*   **Protein:** Met-Phe-**Tyr**-Ala-Gly-**Val**-Ser...\n*   **Effect:** Two amino acids are changed. This is more likely to disrupt function than a single missense mutation, but it is still less severe than a premature stop codon. The full-length protein is still produced, and it might retain some function.\n\n**Mutant 4:**\n*   **Sequence:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT ... TGA-3’`\n*   **Comparison:** A comparison of the strings shows that `GGT` (the 5th codon) has been deleted, and `CTC` has been changed to `TAC`.\n    *   `CTC` (Leu) -> `TAC` (Tyr): A missense mutation.\n    *   Deletion of `GGT`: This is a deletion of three nucleotides.\n*   **Protein:** Met-Phe-**Tyr**-Ala-Thr-Ser...\n*   **Effect:** This is an in-frame deletion (a deletion of a full codon) combined with a missense mutation. The protein will be missing one amino acid (Glycine) and have another one changed (Leu -> Tyr). The reading frame for the rest of the gene is preserved. While this will alter the protein, it is not guaranteed to completely inactivate it.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe mutation in **Mutant 2** introduces a premature stop codon, which will terminate protein synthesis very early. This is the most reliable way among the given options to produce a non-functional protein and therefore eliminate the unwanted compound.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nTo eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, the goal is to create a non-functional protein. This is most reliably achieved by a mutation that causes a complete loss of function. Let's analyze the effect of each mutation on the protein's synthesis and structure.\n\nThe intact gene begins `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT...`, which translates to the amino acid sequence: Met-Phe-Leu-Ala... The sequence `ATG` is the start codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...`\n    *   This sequence contains two changes compared to the intact gene:\n        1.  `TTT` -> `TTC`: Both codons code for Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a *silent mutation* and has no effect on the amino acid sequence.\n        2.  `CTC` -> `TAC`: This changes the codon for Leucine (Leu) to Tyrosine (Tyr). This is a *missense mutation*.\n    *   A missense mutation changes a single amino acid. While this might alter or reduce the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely. The protein might still be produced and retain some or all of its activity.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...`\n    *   This sequence has a change from `CTC` to `TAA`.\n    *   The codon `TAA` is a stop codon (also known as a nonsense codon).\n    *   This type of mutation is called a *nonsense mutation*. It introduces a premature stop signal, causing protein synthesis to halt.\n    *   The result is a severely truncated protein (in this case, only two amino acids long: Met-Phe). A protein this short is almost certain to be non-functional. This is a highly effective way to knock out gene function.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...`\n    *   A comparison of the intact sequence (`ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT...`) with Mutant 3 (`ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTT...`) reveals an insertion of a nucleotide (`T`) after the first two codons.\n    *   Intact codons: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...`\n    *   Mutant 3 codons: `ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...`\n    *   Wait, the provided sequence strings show a different mutation. Let's re-examine the full strings:\n        *   Intact:  `5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`\n        *   Mutant 3: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`\n        *   The change is an insertion of a 'T' at position 6. This shifts the reading frame for all subsequent codons.\n    *   This is a *frameshift mutation*. The insertion of a single nucleotide alters the grouping of bases into codons, changing every amino acid downstream of the mutation. This almost always leads to a premature stop codon and a non-functional protein. Like a nonsense mutation, a frameshift is highly likely to eliminate the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT ACG CTA CTT CTG...`\n    *   Comparing the intact sequence (`...GCT GGT ACT...`) with Mutant 4 (`...GCT ACT...`) shows a deletion of the three nucleotides `GGT`.\n    *   The `GGT` codon codes for the amino acid Glycine. Since three nucleotides (a full codon) are removed, the reading frame is not shifted.\n    *   This is an *in-frame deletion*. The resulting protein will be missing one amino acid (Glycine) but will otherwise have a normal sequence. The loss of a single amino acid may or may not eliminate the protein's function, making this outcome less certain than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth the nonsense mutation (Mutant 2) and the frameshift mutation (Mutant 3) are highly likely to produce a non-functional protein and thus eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. However, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a stop codon (`TAA`) at the third position, guaranteeing the production of a tiny, non-functional dipeptide. This is the most direct and certain method among the choices to completely halt the synthesis of the target protein.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nTo determine which mutation will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to analyze how each change in the DNA sequence affects the resulting protein. The goal is to find the mutation that is most likely to create a non-functional protein.\n\n### Analysis of the Gene and Mutations:\n\nThe intact gene sequence begins with `5’-ATG TTT CTC...-3’`. Translation starts at the `ATG` codon. Let's analyze the effect of each mutation:\n\n*   **Intact Gene Translation:**\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Met)\n    *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (Phe)\n    *   `CTC` -> Leucine (Leu)\n    *   The protein starts with Met-Phe-Leu...\n\n*   **Mutant 1: `5’-ATGTTCTACGCT...-3’`**\n    *   This sequence has two changes compared to the intact gene: `TTT` becomes `TTC`, and `CTC` becomes `TAC`.\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Met)\n    *   `TTC` -> Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a *silent mutation* because both `TTT` and `TTC` code for the same amino acid.\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Tyr). This is a *missense mutation* because it changes the amino acid from Leucine to Tyrosine. A missense mutation alters the protein but may or may not eliminate its function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2: `5’-ATGTTCTAAGCT...-3’`**\n    *   This sequence also has changes: `TTT` becomes `TTC`, and `CTC` becomes `TAA`.\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Met)\n    *   `TTC` -> Phenylalanine (Phe). (Silent mutation)\n    *   `TAA` -> **STOP**. This is a *nonsense mutation* because it introduces a premature stop codon. This type of mutation leads to the production of a shortened, incomplete, and likely non-functional protein. Terminating the protein after only two amino acids makes it almost certain that the enzyme will lose its function.\n\n*   **Mutant 3: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTT...-3’`**\n    *   This sequence has multiple changes: `CTC` becomes `TAC`, and `ACT` becomes `GTC`, among others.\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Met)\n    *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (Phe)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Tyr) (Missense mutation: Leu -> Tyr)\n    *   `GCT` -> Alanine (Ala)\n    *   `GGT` -> Glycine (Gly)\n    *   `GTC` -> Valine (Val) (Missense mutation: Thr -> Val)\n    *   This mutant has multiple missense mutations, which change several amino acids. While this could alter or reduce the protein's function, it is less certain to eliminate it completely compared to a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCT...-3’`**\n    *   This sequence has a missense mutation (`CTC` -> `TAC`) and a deletion of the three bases `GGT`.\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Met)\n    *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (Phe)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Tyr) (Missense mutation: Leu -> Tyr)\n    *   The `GGT` codon, which codes for Glycine, is deleted.\n    *   Because exactly three nucleotides are removed, the reading frame is preserved. This is called an *in-frame deletion*. The resulting protein will be missing one amino acid (Glycine) and have one substitution (Leu -> Tyr). While this can affect protein function, it is not as severe as a frameshift or nonsense mutation.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nComparing the four mutants, Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the protein-coding sequence. Nonsense mutations are one of the most effective ways to cause a complete loss of protein function, as they result in a severely truncated protein. The other mutations result in amino acid substitutions or a small in-frame deletion, which are less likely to completely abolish the protein's activity. Therefore, Mutant 2 is the most probable to eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nTo eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, the goal is to inactivate the gene responsible for its synthesis. This is most effectively achieved by a mutation that results in a non-functional or severely truncated protein. Let's analyze the effect of each mutation on the protein sequence, keeping in mind that protein synthesis starts at the `ATG` codon and terminates at a stop codon.\n\n*   **Intact gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...TGA-3’`\n    *   This sequence translates to: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...TGA-3’`\n    *   The mutation changes the third codon from `CTC` to `TAC`.\n    *   `CTC` codes for the amino acid Leucine.\n    *   `TAC` codes for the amino acid Tyrosine.\n    *   This is a **missense mutation**: it changes one amino acid for another. This might or might not inactivate the protein, depending on the importance of this specific amino acid to the protein's structure and function. It is not a guaranteed method of elimination.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTT TAA GCT GGT...TGA-3’`\n    *   The mutation changes the third codon from `CTC` to `TAA`.\n    *   `TAA` is one of the three standard stop codons (along with `TGA` and `TAG`).\n    *   This is a **nonsense mutation**: it introduces a premature stop codon. The translation of the protein will halt at this point, resulting in a very short, truncated protein containing only two amino acids (Met-Phe). This truncated protein is almost certain to be non-functional, thus eliminating the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...TGA-3’`\n    *   This mutant sequence contains multiple changes compared to the intact gene.\n    *   The third codon changes from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   The sixth codon changes from `ACT` (Threonine) to `GTC` (Valine).\n    *   The seventh codon changes from `TCT` (Serine) to `ACT` (Threonine).\n    *   These are all **missense mutations**, changing three different amino acids in the protein chain. While multiple changes increase the likelihood of disrupting protein function compared to a single missense mutation, it is still not as definitive as a premature stop codon. The full-length protein will be produced, and it might retain some or all of its function.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...TGA-3’`\n    *   Comparing this to the intact sequence reveals two changes: the third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and the fifth codon, `GGT` (Glycine), has been deleted entirely.\n    *   This results in a **missense mutation** and an **in-frame deletion** (a deletion of a full three-nucleotide codon). The reading frame for the rest of the gene is preserved. The final protein will have one amino acid changed and be one amino acid shorter. This could disrupt the protein's function, but like missense mutations, it is not a guaranteed loss of function.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe most reliable way to eliminate the function of the gene is to introduce a premature stop codon, which is what occurs in Mutant 2. This nonsense mutation will cause protein synthesis to terminate almost immediately, ensuring the production of the anti-nutritional compound is stopped.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\n*   **Goal:** To eliminate an anti-nutritional compound by mutating the gene responsible for its synthesis.

This might disrupt the protein's function, or it might have little to no effect. It is not a guaranteed way to eliminate the protein's activity.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:**\n        *   The sequence shows a change from `...CTC...` (Leucine) to `...TAA...`.\n        *   `TAA` is a **STOP codon**.\n        *   When the ribosome reads `TAA`, it terminates translation.\n        *   Original protein: Met-Phe-Leu-Ala...\n        *   Mutant 2 protein: Met-Phe-STOP. The resulting product is just a tiny two-amino-acid peptide (a dipeptide).\n        *   This is a **nonsense mutation**. Because it occurs so early in the gene (at the third codon), the resulting protein is severely truncated and is virtually certain to be non-functional.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:**\n        *   Comparing the intact and mutant strings reveals a probable **frameshift mutation**. An extra nucleotide has been inserted, which shifts the \"reading frame\" of the codons.\n        *   Original frame: `ATG | TTT | CTC | GCT | ...`\n        *   Mutant frame (example of an insertion): `ATG | TTT | T`**C**`TC | GCT | ...` becomes `ATG | TTT | TCT | CGC | ...`\n        *   This changes every single amino acid from the point of the mutation onwards. A frameshift almost always leads to a completely non-functional protein, and often introduces a premature stop codon downstream. This is also a very effective way to knock out a gene.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:**\n        *   This mutation appears to be a deletion of three nucleotides (`GGT`).\n        *   Since three nucleotides make up one codon, this is an **in-frame deletion**.\n        *   The result is a protein that is simply missing one amino acid. Like a missense mutation, this might or might not disable the protein. It is less likely to cause a complete loss of function compared to a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   We are looking for the mutation that will **most probably** eliminate the compound. Both a frameshift (Mutant 3) and a nonsense mutation (Mutant 2) are highly likely to create a non-functional protein.\n    *   However, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a STOP codon at the very beginning of the protein sequence (the 3rd codon).

This type of mutation is often called a \"knockout\" or \"null\" mutation. Let's analyze the effect of each mutation on the protein sequence by translating the DNA codons.\n\nThe beginning of the intact gene's coding sequence is:\n**5’- ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ... -3’**\n\nTranslated into amino acids, this becomes:\n*   `ATG` -> Methionine (Start)\n*   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine\n*   `CTC` -> Leucine\n*   `GCT` -> Alanine\n*   `GGT` -> Glycine\n**Protein sequence:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - ...\n\nNow let's analyze each mutant:\n\n**Mutant 1:**\n*   DNA: `5’- ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ... -3’`\n*   Change: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, where one amino acid is replaced by another.\n*   Effect: The protein will have a single amino acid change near the beginning. While this might alter the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to completely inactivate it. The protein could still be partially or fully functional.\n\n**Mutant 2:**\n*   DNA: `5’- ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ... -3’`\n*   Change: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n*   Effect: When the ribosome translates the mRNA, it will encounter the stop codon `TAA` and terminate protein synthesis. The resulting product will be a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Methionine-Phenylalanine). This severely truncated protein will be completely non-functional. This is the most reliable way to eliminate the gene's function.\n\n**Mutant 3:**\n*   DNA: `5’- ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ... -3’`\n*   Change: This sequence contains two changes compared to the intact gene: `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and further down, `ACT` (Threonine) is changed to `GTC` (Valine). These are two separate **missense mutations**.\n*   Effect: The resulting protein has two amino acid substitutions. While more disruptive than a single substitution, it's still not as certain to cause a complete loss of function as a premature stop codon.\n\n**Mutant 4:**\n*   DNA: `5’- ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT ... -3’`\n*   Change: Comparing this to the intact sequence (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), we see `CTC` has changed to `TAC` (a missense mutation) and the codon `GGT` has been deleted entirely.\n*   Effect: This is a missense mutation combined with an **in-frame deletion** (a deletion of exactly 3 nucleotides). Removing an entire amino acid from the protein chain is highly likely to be detrimental to its function. However, a premature stop codon, as seen in Mutant 2, is generally considered a more surefire method for creating a non-functional protein because it halts synthesis entirely.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMutant 2 introduces a nonsense mutation (a premature stop codon) very early in the coding sequence.

The third amino acid is changed from Leucine to Tyrosine. The protein will still be produced at full length, but with one amino acid changed. This might or might not inactivate the protein. It is not the most certain outcome.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    *   **Translation:** `ATG` (M) - `TTC` (F) - `TAA` (**STOP**).\n    *   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The `TAA` codon is a stop signal that terminates protein synthesis. The resulting \"protein\" will be a tiny, two-amino-acid fragment (M-F). A severely truncated protein like this is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   **Translation:** `ATG` (M) - `TTT` (F) - `TAC` (Y - Tyrosine).\n    *   **Effect:** This is another **missense mutation**, similar to Mutant 1.

An in-frame deletion removes an entire amino acid but does not shift the reading frame for the rest of the protein. The resulting protein is slightly shorter and has one amino acid substituted. While this is disruptive, it is less certain to cause complete inactivation than a premature stop codon.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe mutation in **Mutant 2** introduces a premature stop codon very early in the coding sequence.

A non-functional protein is most reliably created by a mutation that causes the premature termination of its synthesis.\n\nLet's analyze the genetic code.

Mutant 2 Sequence:**\n*   **DNA:** 5’- ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT ... -3’\n*   **Comparison:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAA`.\n*   **Amino Acids:** Met - Phe - **STOP**\n*   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**, which signals the end of translation. This mutation will cause protein synthesis to stop prematurely, producing a tiny, non-functional protein fragment only two amino acids long. This is the most effective way to eliminate the protein's function.\n\n**4.

This is a **nonsense mutation**, which signals for protein synthesis to stop prematurely. This mutation occurs very early in the gene (at the third codon). The resulting protein would be extremely short (only two amino acids long) and almost certainly non-functional. This type of mutation is a highly effective way to \"knock out\" or inactivate a gene.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...`\n    *   Changes: The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and further downstream, another change occurs.\n    *   Type of Mutation: This involves multiple **missense mutations**. Like Mutant 1, this changes amino acids but doesn't guarantee a complete loss of function.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...`\n    *   Changes: The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `GGT` (Glycine) is changed to `ACT` (Threonine).\n    *   Type of Mutation: This also contains multiple **missense mutations**. Again, this alters the protein, but complete inactivation is less certain than with a nonsense mutation.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nA nonsense mutation that introduces a premature stop codon early in the coding sequence is the most reliable way to produce a truncated and non-functional protein, thereby eliminating its activity. Mutant 2 is the only one with this type of mutation.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nTo determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we must identify the mutation that has the highest probability of creating a non-functional protein. This involves analyzing how each mutation alters the gene's protein-coding sequence.\n\n### Analysis of Mutations\n\nFirst, let's establish the amino acid sequence of the intact gene by breaking its DNA sequence into three-letter codons, starting with the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT…-3’`\n*   **Amino Acid Sequence:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr...\n\nNow, let's analyze the effect of each mutation:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** The sequence `5’-ATGTTCTACGCT…-3’` translates to the codons `ATG TTC TAC GCT…`. This changes the original `TTT` codon to `TTC` and the `CTC` codon to `TAC`.\n    *   `TTT` to `TTC` both code for the amino acid Phenylalanine (Phe), making this a silent mutation.\n    *   `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine) is a **missense mutation**, which substitutes one amino acid for another. While this could potentially affect the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** The sequence `5’-ATGTTCTAAGCT…-3’` translates to the codons `ATG TTC TAA GCT…`.\n    *   Similar to Mutant 1, `TTT` changes to `TTC` (a silent mutation).\n    *   Crucially, the third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is mutated to `TAA`. The `TAA` codon is a **nonsense or stop codon**. This signals the cell's machinery to stop protein synthesis prematurely. The resulting protein would be truncated to only two amino acids, making it almost certainly non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** The sequence `5’-ATGTTTTACGCT…-3’` translates to `ATG TTT TAC GCT…`.\n    *   This changes the third codon from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, similar to the one in Mutant 1. The impact on protein function is uncertain and less likely to be as severe as a nonsense mutation.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** The sequence `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACT...-3’` translates to `ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...`.\n    *   This sequence contains two changes compared to the intact gene: `CTC` becomes `TAC` (Leucine to Tyrosine) and `GGT` becomes `ACT` (Glycine to Threonine). These are two separate **missense mutations**. While multiple amino acid changes increase the chance of disrupting protein function compared to a single missense mutation, it is still less definitive than a premature stop codon.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nA nonsense mutation that introduces a premature stop codon is one of the most severe types of mutations, as it leads to a shortened, incomplete protein that is typically non-functional. Missense mutations only change a single amino acid, which may or may not disrupt the protein's function. A silent mutation, by definition, does not change the amino acid sequence, though recent research shows it can still have subtle effects.\n\nAmong the choices, Mutant 2 is the only one that introduces a premature stop codon. This happens very early in the gene sequence (at the third codon), ensuring the resulting protein will be severely truncated and non-functional. This makes it the most probable mutation to successfully eliminate the unwanted compound.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nTo eliminate an anti-nutritional compound synthesized by a specific gene, the most effective strategy is to introduce a mutation that completely destroys the function of the protein encoded by that gene.

This translates to the amino acid sequence: `Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly...`\n\nNow, let's examine each mutant:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** The sequence is `5’-ATG TTC TAC...-3’`.\n    *   This translates to `Met-Phe-Tyr...`\n    *   Compared to the original (`Met-Phe-Leu...`), a single amino acid has been changed from Leucine (Leu) to Tyrosine (Tyr). This is a **missense mutation**. While a missense mutation *can* sometimes inactivate a protein, it often results in a protein that is still functional, especially if the changed amino acid is not in a critical part of the protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** The sequence is `5’-ATG TTC TAA...-3’`.\n    *   This translates to `Met-Phe-STOP`.\n    *   The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This type of mutation, which introduces a premature stop signal, is called a **nonsense mutation**. The synthesis of the protein will halt at this point, resulting in a severely shortened, truncated protein that is almost certainly non-functional. Introducing a premature stop codon is a very effective way to cause a loss of function.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** The sequence appears to have multiple changes or a frameshift. If we assume it is a **frameshift mutation** (caused by an insertion or deletion of nucleotides not in a multiple of three), it would alter the entire downstream amino acid sequence. This is also very likely to result in a non-functional protein. However, the most unambiguous and definitively disruptive mutation presented in the options is the nonsense mutation.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** The sequence `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’` translates to `Met-Phe-Tyr-Ala-Thr...`\n    *   This represents at least two **missense mutations** (Leu to Tyr and Gly to Thr). Similar to Mutant 1, this changes amino acids but does not guarantee a complete loss of function.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the options, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most probable one to completely eliminate the protein's function and, therefore, the anti-nutritional compound. It results in a protein that is truncated after only two amino acids, which cannot perform the complex function of synthesizing a compound. The missense mutations in the other mutants are far less certain to have such a drastic effect.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nTo solve this problem, we need to analyze how each mutation affects the gene's product, the protein. The goal is to find the mutation that is most likely to result in a non-functional protein, thus eliminating the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nA functional protein is synthesized by transcribing the DNA sequence into messenger RNA (mRNA) and then translating the mRNA into a chain of amino acids. This process starts at the start codon (ATG) and ends at a stop codon (in this case, TGA at the end of the gene).\n\nLet's break down the intact gene sequence and each mutant sequence into codons (groups of three nucleotides) and see what amino acids they code for.\n\n**Intact Gene:**\n*   Sequence: 5’-**ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT**...TGA-3’\n*   Amino Acids: **Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly**...\n\nNow let's analyze each mutant:\n\n**Mutant 1:**\n*   Sequence: 5’-**ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT**...TGA-3’\n*   Change: Compared to the intact gene (ATG TTT CTC GCT), the codons TTT and CTC have changed to TTC and TAC.\n    *   TTT -> TTC: Both TTT and TTC code for Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a *silent mutation*.\n    *   CTC -> TAC: CTC codes for Leucine (Leu), while TAC codes for Tyrosine (Tyr). This is a *missense mutation*.\n*   Effect: The third amino acid is changed from Leucine to Tyrosine. This might alter the protein's function, but it could also have little or no effect. It is not guaranteed to inactivate the protein.\n\n**Mutant 2:**\n*   Sequence: 5’-**ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT**...TGA-3’\n*   Change: Compared to the intact gene (ATG TTT CTC GCT), the codons TTT and CTC have changed to TTC and TAA.\n    *   TTT -> TTC: This is a silent mutation (Phe -> Phe).\n    *   CTC -> TAA: CTC codes for Leucine (Leu), but **TAA is a STOP codon**. This is a *nonsense mutation*.\n*   Effect: The introduction of a premature stop codon at the third position will cause translation to terminate. The resulting \"protein\" will be only two amino acids long (Met-Phe). A protein this truncated is almost certain to be completely non-functional. This is the most likely mutation to eliminate the synthesis of the compound.\n\n**Mutant 3:**\n*   Sequence: 5’-**ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT**...TGA-3’\n*   Change: Compared to the intact gene (ATG TTT CTC GCT), the codon CTC has changed to TAC.\n    *   CTC -> TAC: CTC codes for Leucine (Leu), while TAC codes for Tyrosine (Tyr). This is a *missense mutation*.\n*   Effect: This mutation causes the same amino acid change as in Mutant 1. The effect is uncertain and not as definitive as a stop codon.\n\n**Mutant 4:**\n*   Sequence: 5’-**ATG TTT ACG CTA CTT CTG**...TGA-3’ (Assuming a deletion of the C at position 7)\n*   Change: This mutation is best interpreted as a deletion of a single nucleotide (the C at position 7 of CTC). This deletion causes a *frameshift*. The reading frame for all subsequent codons is altered.\n    *   Original: ATG TTT **C**TC GCT GGT ACT... (Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr...)\n    *   Mutant: ATG TTT TCG CTG GTA CT... (Met - Phe - Ser - Leu - Val - Leu...)\n*   Effect: A frameshift mutation changes every amino acid downstream from the mutation, usually resulting in a completely different and non-functional protein. It often leads to a premature stop codon as well. While very effective at inactivating a gene, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is even more direct and certain in its effect by immediately halting protein production. Given the options, the nonsense mutation is the most \"probable\" to achieve the desired outcome.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe mutation in **Mutant 2** introduces a premature stop codon early in the gene sequence. This is the most effective and reliable way among the given choices to ensure a non-functional, truncated protein is produced, thereby eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nTo eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, the gene responsible for its synthesis must be rendered non-functional. This is most effectively achieved by a mutation that results in a truncated and non-functional protein. Let's analyze the impact of each mutation on the protein sequence, using the standard genetic code to translate the DNA codons.\n\nThe beginning of the intact gene's coding sequence and its corresponding amino acid sequence is:\n*   **Intact gene:** 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’\n*   **Protein:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n\nNow let's examine each mutant:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’\n    *   The `TTT` codon changed to `TTC`. Both code for Phenylalanine (Phe), so this is a silent mutation.\n    *   The `CTC` codon (Leucine) changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, which changes a single amino acid.

It introduces a premature stop signal, causing protein synthesis to halt. The result is a severely shortened, incomplete protein that is almost certain to be non-functional, especially when it occurs so early in the gene.\n    *   **Resulting Protein:** Met - Phe - **STOP**\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’\n    *   This mutant has multiple changes compared to the intact gene.\n    *   `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   `ACT` (Threonine) is changed to `GTC` (Valine).\n    *   `TCT` (Serine) is changed to `ACT` (Threonine).\n    *   These are all **missense mutations**, resulting in several amino acid substitutions. While multiple changes make it more likely that the protein's function is disrupted compared to a single change, it doesn't guarantee a complete loss of function.\n    *   **Resulting Protein:** Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly - **Val** - **Thr**...\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’\n    *   This mutant also contains multiple **missense mutations**.\n    *   `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   `GGT` (Glycine) is changed to `ACT` (Threonine).\n    *   Similar to Mutant 3, this will alter the protein sequence but may not completely inactivate it.\n    *   **Resulting Protein:** Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - **Thr**...\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe goal is to eliminate the compound, which is best achieved by completely knocking out the function of the protein that synthesizes it. A nonsense mutation (Mutant 2) introduces a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated and nonfunctional protein. This is the most definitive way to eliminate the protein's activity among the given options. The missense mutations in the other mutants only substitute amino acids, which may or may not render the protein non-functional.\n\nTherefore, Mutant 2 is the most probable choice to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nTo determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to understand how each mutation affects the protein produced by the gene. The most effective way to eliminate a protein's function is to introduce a change that either drastically alters its structure or, more definitively, prevents its complete synthesis. This is often achieved by a \"nonsense\" mutation, which introduces a premature stop codon, or a \"frameshift\" mutation, which scrambles the entire downstream amino acid sequence.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Define the Genetic Code**: We'll use a standard codon table to translate the DNA sequences into amino acid sequences.\n2.  **Translate Each Sequence**: We will translate the DNA sequence of the intact gene and each of the four mutants into their corresponding amino acid sequences. We will focus on the beginning of the gene where the mutations occurred.\n3.  **Analyze the Protein Changes**:\n    *   A **silent mutation** changes the DNA but not the amino acid, having no effect.\n    *   A **missense mutation** changes one amino acid for another. This might affect the protein's function, but it may not eliminate it.\n    *   A **nonsense mutation** changes an amino acid codon into a STOP codon. This terminates protein synthesis prematurely, creating a truncated and almost certainly non-functional protein. This is a very strong candidate for eliminating the compound.\n    *   A **frameshift mutation** (caused by an insertion or deletion of bases not in a multiple of three) alters the reading frame, changing all subsequent amino acids and often leading to a premature stop codon.\n4.  **Identify the Most Disruptive Mutation**: We will compare the effects of each mutation. The one causing a premature stop codon is the most likely to achieve the desired outcome.\n\nLet's execute this plan with code.\n\n```python\ndef translate_dna(dna_sequence):\n    \"\"\"Translates a DNA sequence into a protein sequence.\"\"\"\n    genetic_code = {\n        'TTT': 'F', 'TTC': 'F', 'TTA': 'L', 'TTG': 'L',\n        'CTT': 'L', 'CTC': 'L', 'CTA': 'L', 'CTG': 'L',\n        'ATT': 'I', 'ATC': 'I', 'ATA': 'I', 'ATG': 'M',\n        'GTT': 'V', 'GTC': 'V', 'GTA': 'V', 'GTG': 'V',\n        'TCT': 'S', 'TCC': 'S', 'TCA': 'S', 'TCG': 'S',\n        'CCT': 'P', 'CCC': 'P', 'CCA': 'P', 'CCG': 'P',\n        'ACT': 'T', 'ACC': 'T', 'ACA': 'T', 'ACG': 'T',\n        'GCT': 'A', 'GCC': 'A', 'GCA': 'A', 'GCG': 'A',\n        'TAT': 'Y', 'TAC': 'Y', 'TAA': '*', 'TAG': '*',\n        'CAT': 'H', 'CAC': 'H', 'CAA': 'Q', 'CAG': 'Q',\n        'AAT': 'N', 'AAC': 'N', 'AAA': 'K', 'AAG': 'K',\n        'GAT': 'D', 'GAC': 'D', 'GAA': 'E', 'GAG': 'E',\n        'TGT': 'C', 'TGC': 'C', 'TGA': '*', 'TGG': 'W',\n        'CGT': 'R', 'CGC': 'R', 'CGA': 'R', 'CGG': 'R',\n        'AGT': 'S', 'AGC': 'S', 'AGA': 'R', 'AGG': 'R',\n        'GGT': 'G', 'GGC': 'G', 'GGA': 'G', 'GGG': 'G',\n    }\n    protein = []\n    # Process the sequence in codons (3 bases at a time)\n    for i in range(0, len(dna_sequence) - 2, 3):\n        codon = dna_sequence[i:i+3]\n        amino_acid = genetic_code.get(codon, 'X') # 'X' for unknown codon\n        if amino_acid == '*': # Stop codon\n            protein.append('STOP')\n            break\n        protein.append(amino_acid)\n    return \"-\".join(protein)\n\n# DNA sequences\nintact_gene = \"ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\nmutant_1 = \"ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\"\nmutant_2 = \"ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\"\nmutant_3 = \"ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\nmutant_4 = \"ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\n\n# Translate and print the results for the first few amino acids\nprint(\"Analysis of Gene Mutations:\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(f\"Intact Gene Protein: {translate_dna(intact_gene)}\")\nprint(f\"Mutant 1 Protein:    {translate_dna(mutant_1)}\")\nprint(f\"Mutant 2 Protein:    {translate_dna(mutant_2)}\")\nprint(f\"Mutant 3 Protein:    {translate_dna(mutant_3)}\")\nprint(f\"Mutant 4 Protein:    {translate_dna(mutant_4)}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(\"\\nExplanation:\")\nprint(\"Mutant 1 results in a missense mutation (L -> Y), which changes one amino acid.

This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by a specific gene. To stop the synthesis of the compound, we need to inactivate this gene so it no longer produces a functional protein. The most effective way to achieve this is by introducing a mutation that leads to a non-functional or severely truncated protein.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Intact Gene Sequence**\nThe provided sequence is the start of the coding strand of the gene's first exon.\nIntact gene: `5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`\n*   `ATG` is the start codon, which codes for the amino acid Methionine (Met). This confirms we are at the beginning of the protein-coding sequence.\n*   The sequence is read in groups of three bases, called codons.\n*   Let's determine the initial amino acid sequence of the functional protein by reading the codons:\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Met)\n    *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (Phe)\n    *   `CTC` -> Leucine (Leu)\n    *   `GCT` -> Alanine (Ala)\n    *   `GGT` -> Glycine (Gly)\n    *   ... and so on.\nThe initial part of the healthy protein is: **Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly...**\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Each Mutant and its Consequences**\nWe will now analyze each mutant sequence to see how the mutation affects the resulting protein. The most severe mutations are typically nonsense mutations (creating a premature stop codon) and frameshift mutations (inserting or deleting bases in a number not divisible by three).\n\n*   **Mutant 1:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`\n    *   Comparison: The `TTTCTC` from the intact gene is changed to `TTCTAC`.\n    *   Codon changes:\n        *   Intact: `ATG` `TTT` `CTC`\n        *   Mutant 1: `ATG` `TTC` `TAC`\n    *   Protein translation:\n        *   `ATG` -> Met\n        *   `TTC` -> Phe (`TTT` also codes for Phe, so this part is a silent mutation).\n        *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Tyr). The original codon `CTC` coded for Leucine.\n    *   **Effect:** This is a **missense mutation**. It changes one amino acid in the protein chain (Leucine to Tyrosine). This might or might not inactivate the protein. It is less likely to completely eliminate function compared to more severe mutations.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`\n    *   Comparison: The `TTTCTC` from the intact gene is changed to `TTCTAA`.\n    *   Codon changes:\n        *   Intact: `ATG` `TTT` `CTC`\n        *   Mutant 2: `ATG` `TTC` `TAA`\n    *   Protein translation:\n        *   `ATG` -> Met\n        *   `TTC` -> Phe (silent mutation)\n        *   `TAA` -> **STOP**. The codon `TAA` is one of the three stop codons in the genetic code.\n    *   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. It introduces a premature stop codon. Protein synthesis will halt after the second amino acid (Phenylalanine). The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe), which is virtually certain to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`\n    *   Comparison: The original sequence `...TTTCTCG...` has been changed to `...TTTTACG...`. A single 'T' has been inserted after the `TTT` codon.\n        *   Intact: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...`\n        *   Mutant 3: `ATG TTT T ACG CTG GTG...` (The reading frame is shifted from this point on).\n    *   **Effect:** This is a **frameshift mutation**. The insertion of a single nucleotide shifts the reading frame for all subsequent codons. The entire amino acid sequence after the second amino acid (Phe) will be different from the original, creating a \"garbage\" protein. Frameshift mutations often also create a premature stop codon by chance downstream. This type of mutation is highly likely to result in a non-functional protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`\n    *   Comparison: Analysis shows that the codon `GGT` (coding for Glycine) has been deleted, and the codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n        *   Intact: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...` -> Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly-Thr...\n        *   Mutant 4: `ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...` -> Met-Phe-Tyr-Ala-Thr...\n    *   **Effect:** This is an **in-frame deletion** of one amino acid (Glycine) and a **missense mutation** (Leucine to Tyrosine). Because a full codon (3 bases) was deleted, the reading frame is maintained for the rest of the gene. While removing/changing amino acids can disrupt function, it is less severe than a frameshift or nonsense mutation.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude Which Mutation is Most Likely to Succeed**\n*   Mutants 1 (missense) and 4 (in-frame deletion/missense) alter the protein but do not guarantee a complete loss of function.\n*   Mutants 2 (nonsense) and 3 (frameshift) are both severe mutations that are highly likely to create a non-functional protein (a \"null allele\").\n*   However, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most direct and definitive. It causes protein synthesis to stop almost immediately, producing a mere two-amino-acid fragment. There is no ambiguity; the functional protein will not be made. This is the most certain way to eliminate the compound.\n\nTherefore, Mutant 2 offers the highest probability of success.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand how mutations affect gene function. The goal is to find the mutation that is most likely to produce a non-functional protein, thereby eliminating the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound. This is typically achieved by a mutation that severely disrupts the protein's structure, such as a frameshift or a nonsense mutation.\n\nLet's analyze the sequences by breaking them into three-letter codons and comparing them to the intact gene. The translation process starts at the `ATG` (start codon).\n\n**Intact gene:**\n5’-**ATG-TTT-CTC**-GCT-GGT-ACT-TCT-GTG-GAT-GAA-CAT-ATT-TAT-TGT-CGT…TGA-3’\n*   Translation: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr - Ser - Val...\nThis sequence produces the full, functional protein responsible for the unwanted compound.\n\n**Mutant 1:**\n5’-**ATG-TTC-TAC**-GCT-GGT-ACT-TCT-GTG-GAT-GAA-CAT-ATT-TAT-TGT-CGC…TGA-3’\n*   Comparison: The second codon `TTT` is now `TTC` (both code for Phe, a silent mutation), and the third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is now `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n*   Mutation type: This is a **missense mutation**. It changes one amino acid (Leucine to Tyrosine). While this might alter the protein's function, it often does not completely eliminate it. The full-length protein is still produced.\n\n**Mutant 2:**\n5’-**ATG-TTC-TAA**-GCT-GGT-ACT-TCT-GTG-GAT-GAA-CAT-ATT-TAT-TGT-CGC…TGA-3’\n*   Comparison: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAA`.\n*   Mutation type: `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. It causes protein synthesis to stop prematurely after only two amino acids (Met-Phe) have been joined. The resulting peptide will be extremely short and completely non-functional. This is the most effective way to \"knock out\" the gene's function.\n\n**Mutant 3:**\n5’-**ATG-TTT-TAC-GCT-GGT-GTC-ACT**-TCT-GTG-GAT-GAA-CAT-ATT-TAT-TGT-CGT…TGA-3’\n*   Comparison: There are multiple changes. `CTC` (Leu) -> `TAC` (Tyr), `ACT` (Thr) -> `GTC` (Val), `TCT` (Ser) -> `ACT` (Thr).\n*   Mutation type: These are multiple **missense mutations**. A full-length protein with several incorrect amino acids will be produced. It might be non-functional, but this is less certain than the definite truncation caused by a stop codon.\n\n**Mutant 4:**\n5’-**ATG-TTT-TAC-GCT-ACT**-TCT-GTG-GAT-GAA-CAT-ATT-TAT-TGT-CGT…TGA-3’\n*   Comparison: Comparing to the intact gene, the codon `GGT` has been deleted, and the codon `CTC` has been changed to `TAC`.\n*   Mutation type: This is an **in-frame deletion** (a deletion of 3 bases) combined with a **missense mutation**. The reading frame is not shifted, but one amino acid (Glycine) is missing, and another is changed (Leucine to Tyrosine). A nearly full-length protein is produced and may retain some function.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMutant 2 is the most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound because the nonsense mutation introduces a premature stop codon. This leads to the production of a severely truncated and non-functional protein, effectively disabling the gene.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nTo eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, the goal is to inactivate the gene responsible for its synthesis. This is most effectively achieved by a \"loss-of-function\" mutation that prevents the production of a functional protein. Let's analyze the effect of each mutation on the gene's protein-coding sequence.\n\nThe intact gene sequence begins `5’-ATG TTT CTC...`, which codes for the amino acid sequence Methionine-Phenylalanine-Leucine.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** The sequence `5’-ATG TTC TAC...` contains a change in the third codon from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, where one amino acid is substituted for another. While this could potentially disrupt protein function, it is not guaranteed. Many missense mutations have little to no effect, or only partially reduce function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** The sequence `5’-ATG TTC TAA...` contains a change in the third codon from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAA`. On the corresponding mRNA, this would be UAA. UAA is a **stop codon**, which signals the end of protein synthesis. This type of change is called a **nonsense mutation**. A nonsense mutation results in a prematurely shortened, truncated protein that is typically non-functional, especially when it occurs so early in the gene. This is a classic example of a loss-of-function mutation.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** The sequence `5’-ATG TTT TAC...` has a change in the third codon from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, similar to Mutant 1. It results in a single amino acid substitution, which may or may not eliminate the protein's function.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** The sequence `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...` results from a deletion of the `GGT` codon compared to the original `...GCT GGT ACT...`. This is an **in-frame deletion**, which removes a single amino acid (Glycine) but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. The resulting protein will be missing one amino acid, which could harm its function but is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than a premature stop codon.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nA nonsense mutation (Mutant 2) is the most probable type of mutation to completely disrupt protein function and, therefore, eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. It stops protein production near the very beginning, ensuring the resulting polypeptide is too short to perform its intended role.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nTo identify the mutation most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to determine which change would most probably result in a non-functional protein. Let's analyze the effect of each mutation on the gene's protein-coding sequence.\n\nThe beginning of the intact gene is:\n`5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\nThis translates to the amino acid sequence: Methionine (Start) - Phenylalanine - Leucine - Alanine - Glycine...\n\nHere is an analysis of each mutant:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** The sequence `ATGTTTCTCGCT...` changes to `ATGTTCTACGCT...`. This corresponds to a change in the second codon from TTT to TTC and the third codon from CTC to TAC.\n    *   TTT and TTC both code for Phenylalanine, so the first change is a silent mutation.\n    *   CTC codes for Leucine, while TAC codes for Tyrosine. This is a **missense mutation**, which substitutes one amino acid for another. This might alter the protein's function, but there is no guarantee it will completely eliminate it.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** The sequence `ATGTTTCTCGCT...` changes to `ATGTTCTAAGCT...`. This corresponds to a change in the third codon from CTC to TAA.\n    *   TAA is a **stop codon** (also known as a nonsense codon).\n    *   This type of mutation is called a **nonsense mutation**. It signals the cell to stop protein synthesis prematurely. The resulting protein would be extremely short (only two amino acids long) and almost certainly non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** Comparing the intact sequence to `ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTT...` reveals a frameshift mutation. A `T` has been inserted after the second codon.\n    *   Intact frame: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...`\n    *   Mutant frame: `ATG TTT T ACG CTG GTG...`\n    *   This **frameshift mutation** alters the reading frame of the gene. All codons downstream of the insertion will be different, leading to a completely altered amino acid sequence and likely a premature stop codon, resulting in a non-functional protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** Comparing the intact sequence `...GCT GGT ACT...` to the mutant `...GCT ACT TCT...` shows that the codon GGT appears to have been deleted. This is an in-frame deletion of a single amino acid (Glycine). While this could impact protein function, it is generally less severe than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth the nonsense mutation (Mutant 2) and the frameshift mutation (Mutant 3) are highly likely to produce a non-functional protein. However, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a stop codon at the very beginning of the protein (the third amino acid position). This is the most direct and certain method among the choices to ensure the production of a severely truncated and non-functional protein, thereby eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nTo identify which mutation will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to determine which change to the gene sequence would most severely impact the function of the protein it codes for. The most effective mutations for knocking out protein function are those that cause a major disruption, such as a frameshift or a premature stop to protein synthesis.\n\nLet's analyze the impact of each mutation by translating the initial part of its DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence. The genetic code is read in triplets of nucleotides called codons, starting with the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene Sequence Analysis:**\n    `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT...`\n    This translates to the amino acid sequence: Methionine - Phenylalanine - Leucine - Alanine...\n\n*   **Mutant 1 Analysis:**\n    `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...`\n    This translates to: Methionine - Phenylalanine - Tyrosine - Alanine...\n    This is a **missense mutation**, where one amino acid (Leucine) is replaced by another (Tyrosine). This might alter or reduce the protein's function, but it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely.\n\n*   **Mutant 2 Analysis:**\n    `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...`\n    This translates to: Methionine - Phenylalanine - **Stop**\n    This is a **nonsense mutation**. The codon `TAA` is one of the three stop codons (along with TGA and TAG) that signals the ribosome to terminate protein synthesis. This mutation causes the creation of a severely shortened protein, containing only two amino acids. A protein this truncated is almost certain to be non-functional, thus eliminating the production of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3 Analysis:**\n    `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT...`\n    This translates to: Methionine - Phenylalanine - Tyrosine - Alanine...\n    Similar to Mutant 1, this is a **missense mutation** (Leucine is replaced by Tyrosine). It is not the most likely to completely eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 4 Analysis:**\n    `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...`\n    This translates to: Methionine - Phenylalanine - Tyrosine - Alanine - Threonine...\n    This sequence contains multiple **missense mutations** (Leucine to Tyrosine and Glycine to Threonine). While multiple changes increase the likelihood of disrupting function compared to a single missense mutation, it is still less certain than a premature stop codon.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon very early in the sequence. This is the most destructive type of mutation among the choices, as it prevents the full protein from ever being made. Therefore, it is the most likely to successfully eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Goal:** The objective is to find a mutation that eliminates an anti-nutritional compound. This is best achieved by completely knocking out the function of the gene responsible for its synthesis. The most effective way to do this is to create a non-functional or severely truncated protein.\n\n2.  **Understand the Intact Gene:**\n    *   The sequence starts with `5’-ATG...`, which is the universal start codon (codes for Methionine). This is where protein synthesis begins.\n    *   The sequence ends with `...TGA-3’`, which is a stop codon. This is where protein synthesis terminates.\n    *   The mutations are in the first exon, near the beginning of the gene. A mutation early in the sequence has a higher probability of disrupting the entire protein structure and function.\n\n3.  **Analyze Each Mutant's Genetic Change:** We need to compare each mutant sequence to the intact gene, break them down into codons (groups of three DNA bases), and determine the effect on the resulting amino acid sequence.\n\n    *   **Intact Gene Sequence:** `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ...`\n    *   **Amino Acids:** `Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr ...`\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:**\n        *   Sequence: `ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT ...`\n        *   Comparison: The second codon `TTT` changes to `TTC`, and the third codon `CTC` changes to `TAC`.\n        *   Effect: `TTT` -> `TTC` codes for the same amino acid, Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a *silent mutation*. `CTC` (Leucine) -> `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a *missense mutation*.\n        *   Conclusion: The protein has one amino acid swapped for another. This might alter or reduce the protein's function, but it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:**\n        *   Sequence: `ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT ...`\n        *   Comparison: The second codon `TTT` changes to `TTC` (silent mutation, as above). The third codon `CTC` changes to `TAA`.\n        *   Effect: `TAA` is a **STOP codon**. In mRNA, this would be `UAA`.\n        *   Conclusion: This is a **nonsense mutation**. Protein synthesis will halt prematurely after the second amino acid. The resulting product would be a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (`Met-Phe`). A protein this truncated is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional. This is a very strong candidate for eliminating the compound.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:**\n        *   Sequence: `ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT ...`\n        *   Comparison: Let's align the mutant to the intact sequence. It appears there is an insertion of a single nucleotide 'T' after the second codon (`TTT`).\n            *   Intact: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ...`\n            *   Mutant: `ATG TTT T ACG CTG GTG TCA ...`\n        *   Effect: This single base insertion causes a **frameshift mutation**. The three-letter reading frame for codons is shifted. All codons downstream of the insertion are read incorrectly, leading to a completely scrambled sequence of amino acids from that point forward. A frameshift almost always results in a non-functional protein and frequently creates a premature stop codon by chance.\n        *   Conclusion: Like the nonsense mutation, a frameshift is a catastrophic event for the protein and is very likely to eliminate its function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:**\n        *   Sequence: `ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT ...`\n        *   Comparison: `CTC` changes to `TAC` (a missense mutation, Leu -> Tyr). The codon `GGT` (Glycine) has been deleted.\n        *   Effect: This is a combination of a missense mutation and an **in-frame deletion** (a deletion of exactly three bases). Because three bases were deleted, the reading frame is preserved for the rest of the gene.\n        *   Conclusion: The final protein will be missing one amino acid and have another one swapped. While this will alter the protein, it's less likely to cause a complete loss of function compared to a nonsense or frameshift mutation that affects the entire downstream sequence.\n\n4.  **Compare the Strongest Candidates:**\n    *   Both **Mutant 2 (Nonsense)** and **Mutant 3 (Frameshift)** will almost certainly result in a non-functional protein.\n    *   Mutant 2 creates a stop codon at the 3rd position, leading to a 2-amino acid product.\n    *   Mutant 3 scrambles the entire amino acid sequence after the 2nd position.\n    *   Both outcomes effectively eliminate the synthesis of the functional, full-length protein. Therefore, both mutations are highly probable to achieve the desired outcome of eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nGiven the choices, both D (Mutant 2) and A (Mutant 3) are excellent answers. However, a nonsense mutation leading to a stop codon is the most direct and unambiguous way to terminate protein synthesis and guarantee a non-functional product.\n\nFinal evaluation leads us to Mutant 2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nThe goal is to find the mutation that will most likely lead to a non-functional protein, thus eliminating the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound. Let's analyze the effect of each mutation by translating the DNA sequence into its corresponding amino acid sequence. A complete knockout of the gene's function is the desired outcome.\n\n**1. Understand the Genetic Code and Mutations**\n\n*   **Reading Frame:** The genetic code is read in three-base \"words\" called codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** A change in the DNA sequence that results in a different amino acid being incorporated into the protein. The effect can range from negligible to a complete loss of function.\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** A change in the DNA sequence that results in a premature stop codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This halts translation, producing a shortened, usually non-functional, protein. This is the most reliable way to \"knock out\" a gene.\n*   **Deletion/Insertion:** Adding or removing one or more bases. If the number of bases is not a multiple of three, it causes a \"frameshift\" mutation, scrambling all subsequent codons, almost always resulting in a non-functional protein. If it's a multiple of three, it results in an \"in-frame\" deletion/insertion, which is less disruptive but can still affect function.\n\n**2. Analyze the Provided Sequences and the Code Output**\n\nLet's break down the effect of each mutation based on the provided code output, which translated the DNA sequences into amino acid sequences ('_' represents a stop codon):\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...`\n    *   **Translation:** `M F L A G T...` (Methionine-Phenylalanine-Leucine-Alanine-Glycine-Threonine...)\n    *   **Result:** A full-length, functional protein that produces the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...`\n    *   **Code Output:** `MFYAGTSVDEHIYCR`\n    *   **Analysis:** The original sequence `CTC` (Leucine) was changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. The protein is still full-length but has one amino acid substituted. This *might* disrupt its function, but it's not guaranteed.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...`\n    *   **Code Output:** `MF`\n    *   **Analysis:** The original sequence `CTC` (Leucine) was changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**. Translation stops after the second amino acid (Phenylalanine). This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   **Result:** The produced \"protein\" is only a dipeptide (`Met-Phe`). This severely truncated product will be completely non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...`\n    *   **Code Output:** `MFYAGVTSVDEHIYCR`\n    *   **Analysis:** The original `CTC` (Leucine) changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `ACT` (Threonine) changed to `GTC` (Valine). These are two **missense mutations**. The protein is full-length but with two altered amino acids. Like Mutant 1, the effect is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...`\n    *   **Code Output:** `MFYATSVDEHIYCR`\n    *   **Analysis:** The sequence shows a change (`CTC` to `TAC`) and the loss of the `GGT` codon. This is a **missense mutation combined with an in-frame deletion**. The protein is slightly shorter and has one amino acid change. Again, the effect on function is uncertain.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nMutant 2 is the only one that introduces a premature stop codon early in the gene. This leads to the production of a very short, non-functional protein fragment. This is the most definitive way to eliminate the protein's function among the given options. Therefore, Mutant 2 will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the cultivar.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nTo determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to find the mutation that is most likely to result in a completely non-functional protein. This is typically achieved by a mutation that drastically alters the protein's amino acid sequence or causes its production to stop prematurely.\n\nLet's analyze the effect of each mutation by translating the DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence. The genetic code is read in three-base units called codons, starting with `ATG`.\n\n**Intact Gene:**\n*   **Sequence:** 5’-`ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT`...-3’\n*   **Amino Acids:** Methionine - Phenylalanine - Leucine - Alanine - Glycine...\n*   This is the blueprint for the functional protein that produces the unwanted compound.\n\n**Mutant 1:**\n*   **Sequence:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT`...-3’\n*   **Amino Acids:** Methionine - Phenylalanine - Tyrosine - Alanine - Glycine...\n*   **Analysis:** This mutation changes the third amino acid from Leucine (`CTC`) to Tyrosine (`TAC`). This is a **missense mutation**. While changing one amino acid *could* inactivate the protein, it could also have little or no effect. It is not the most reliable way to disable the gene.\n\n**Mutant 2:**\n*   **Sequence:** 5’-`ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT`...-3’\n*   **Amino Acids:** Methionine - Phenylalanine - **STOP**\n*   **Analysis:** This mutation changes the third codon from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAA`, which is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. It causes protein synthesis to terminate after only two amino acids. The resulting peptide is extremely short and guaranteed to be non-functional. This is a very effective way to eliminate the target compound.\n\n**Mutant 3:**\n*   **Sequence:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC`...-3’\n*   **Amino Acids:** Methionine - Phenylalanine - Tyrosine - Alanine - Glycine - Valine...\n*   **Analysis:** Comparing this to the intact gene, there has been a complex change or a frameshift mutation that alters the reading frame. A frameshift mutation changes every amino acid downstream from the mutation site and is very likely to create a non-functional protein.\n\n**Mutant 4:**\n*   **Sequence:** 5’-`ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT`...-3’\n*   **Analysis:** This mutation results in the deletion of the `GGT` codon found in the intact gene. This is an **in-frame deletion**, which removes a single amino acid (Glycine) but leaves the rest of the protein sequence intact. Similar to a missense mutation, this is less likely to completely destroy protein function than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth a nonsense mutation (Mutant 2) and a frameshift mutation (implied in Mutant 3) are very effective at inactivating a gene. However, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a stop codon very early in the sequence. This is the most direct and unambiguous signal to halt protein production, ensuring a non-functional product. Therefore, it is the most probable method among the choices to eliminate the compound.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nTo solve this problem, we must determine which mutation is most likely to result in a non-functional protein, thereby eliminating the anti-nutritional compound. We will analyze the effect of each mutation on the gene's protein-coding sequence. The fundamental principle is that mutations causing a premature stop codon (nonsense mutations) or altering the entire subsequent amino acid sequence (frameshift mutations) are the most destructive to protein function.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Intact Gene:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ...`\n    *   Translation begins at the start codon `ATG` (Methionine).\n    *   The codons translate to: `ATG` (Met) - `TTT` (Phe) - `CTC` (Leu) - `GCT` (Ala) - `GGT` (Gly) - `ACT` (Thr) ...\n    *   This sequence produces the functional protein.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mutant 1:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT ...`\n    *   Comparison: The `CTC` codon (Leu) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyr).\n    *   Mutation type: This is a **missense mutation**, which changes a single amino acid. While this *can* disrupt protein function, it often results in a protein that is still partially or fully functional. It is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mutant 2:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT ...`\n    *   Comparison: The `CTC` codon (Leu) has been changed to `TAA`.\n    *   Mutation type: This is a **nonsense mutation**. `TAA` is one of the three stop codons. The ribosome will terminate translation at this point. The resulting \"protein\" will be only two amino acids long (`Met-Phe`). A severely truncated protein like this is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n4.  **Analyze Mutant 3:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT ...`\n    *   Comparison: This mutation changes `CTC` to `TAC` (a missense mutation like in Mutant 1) and also inserts a `GTC` codon (Val) after the `GGT` codon.\n    *   Mutation type: This is a combination of a missense mutation and an **in-frame insertion** (an insertion of a number of bases that is a multiple of three). This adds an amino acid to the protein chain but does not alter the reading frame for the rest of the gene. Like a simple missense mutation, it is not guaranteed to inactivate the protein.\n\n5.  **Analyze Mutant 4:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...`\n    *   Comparison: A `GGT` codon appears to have been deleted. This is a deletion of three nucleotides.\n    *   Mutation type: Let's re-examine the string alignment, as the changes are complex.\n        `Intact:   ...GTTTCTCGCTGGTACT...`\n        `Mutant 4: ...GTTTTACGCTACTTCT...`\n        This involves multiple substitutions and a deletion, resulting in a **frameshift mutation**. The reading frame is altered from this point onwards. All subsequent amino acids will be incorrect, and a random stop codon is likely to be encountered soon. This is also a very effective way to inactivate a protein.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth Mutant 2 (nonsense) and Mutant 4 (frameshift) are excellent candidates for completely inactivating the gene. However, the mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a stop codon at the very beginning of the protein (the 3rd codon). This is an unambiguous and definitive way to terminate protein synthesis, resulting in a tiny, non-functional peptide. Therefore, it is the most probable mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nTo eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the barley cultivar, the most effective mutation would be one that completely inactivates the gene responsible for its synthesis. This is best achieved by a mutation that results in a non-functional or severely shortened protein. Let's analyze the effects of the mutations in the given mutants.\n\nThe genetic code is read in triplets of nucleotides called codons, where each codon specifies a particular amino acid or a stop signal. The process begins at a \"start\" codon (`ATG`) and ends at a \"stop\" codon (`TGA`, `TAA`, or `TAG`).\n\n*   **Intact Gene Analysis**: The initial sequence is `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT...`.\n    *   `ATG` is the start codon for Methionine.\n    *   `TTT` codes for Phenylalanine.\n    *   `CTC` codes for Leucine.\n\n*   **Mutant 1 Analysis**: The sequence is `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...`.\n    *   This represents a change from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This type of mutation, which results in a different amino acid, is called a **missense mutation**. While a missense mutation can sometimes render a protein non-functional, it might also only slightly alter it or have no effect at all, making it less reliable for completely eliminating the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 2 Analysis**: The sequence is `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...`.\n    *   Here, the codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is one of the three **stop codons**.\n    *   This type of mutation is called a **nonsense mutation**. It causes protein synthesis to terminate prematurely. The resulting protein would be only two amino acids long (Methionine-Phenylalanine), which would be completely non-functional. This is a very effective way to \"knock out\" a gene's function.\n\n*   **Mutant 3 Analysis**: The sequence `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTT...` compared to the intact `5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTT...` suggests a significant change. A plausible interpretation is a single nucleotide insertion, which would cause a **frameshift mutation**. A frameshift alters the three-letter codon reading frame, changing all subsequent amino acids and often leading to a premature stop codon. Like a nonsense mutation, a frameshift is highly likely to produce a non-functional protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 4 Analysis**: Comparing `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGT...` with the intact gene suggests the deletion of the `GGT` codon. This is an **in-frame deletion**, meaning one amino acid (Glycine) is removed without altering the reading frame. This is less likely to be as detrimental as a nonsense or frameshift mutation and may only partially affect the protein's function.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth nonsense (Mutant 2) and frameshift (Mutant 3) mutations are very likely to eliminate the protein's function. However, the mutation in Mutant 2 is definitively a nonsense mutation that introduces a stop codon at the third position. This guarantees the production of a severely truncated, non-functional protein. Therefore, it is the most certain and direct way to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound among the choices provided.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nTo eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the barley cultivar, a loss-of-function mutation is required in the gene responsible for its synthesis. This type of mutation results in a complete or partial loss of the gene's function. Analyzing the different types of mutations found in the mutants reveals which is most likely to achieve this outcome.\n\nThe types of mutations that most reliably cause a loss of function are nonsense and frameshift mutations. A nonsense mutation changes a codon for an amino acid into a premature stop codon, which halts protein synthesis and typically results in a shortened, non-functional protein. A frameshift mutation, caused by an insertion or deletion of nucleotides not in a multiple of three, alters the reading frame of the gene. This changes all subsequent amino acids and almost always results in a non-functional protein. Missense mutations, which substitute one amino acid for another, may or may not eliminate the protein's function and are therefore less reliable for this purpose.\n\nLet's examine the specific mutants:\n*   **Intact gene codons:** 5’-ATG (Met) TTT (Phe) CTC (Leu) ... -3’\n*   **Mutant 1:** The sequence shows a change from CTC to TAC in the third codon. This is a **missense mutation**, changing the amino acid from Leucine to Tyrosine. The protein is still produced and might be functional.\n*   **Mutant 2:** The sequence shows a change from CTC to TAA in the third codon. TAA is a **stop codon**. This nonsense mutation would cause protein synthesis to terminate after only two amino acids. The resulting truncated protein would be non-functional, leading to a loss of function.\n*   **Mutant 3:** The sequence in this mutant is longer than the intact gene, indicating an insertion. This causes a **frameshift mutation**, which would alter the entire amino acid sequence from that point forward, leading to a loss of function. However, the problem states the mutations were induced by EMS, a chemical mutagen that primarily causes point mutations (single base substitutions), specifically G:C to A:T transitions. While EMS can in rare cases cause deletions or insertions, it is not the typical mechanism.\n*   **Mutant 4:** This mutant contains multiple changes, all of which are **missense mutations** that substitute one amino acid for another. While several amino acid changes increase the likelihood of disrupting function compared to a single change, it is not as certain as a premature stop codon.\n\nConsidering the types of mutations and their effects, both Mutant 2 and Mutant 3 would very likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. However, the question asks which is the *most probable* mutation to achieve this. Given that EMS was the mutagen used, a point mutation is the expected event. Mutant 2 contains a point mutation that results in a nonsense codon. This is a very common and effective way to create a knockout or null allele. Mutant 3's frameshift via insertion is not a characteristic EMS mutation. Therefore, Mutant 2 represents the most probable and effective mutation to eliminate the target compound under the specified experimental conditions.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nTo identify which mutation will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we must determine which change in the DNA sequence is most likely to result in a non-functional protein. Let's analyze the effect of each mutation on the gene's protein product.\n\nThe intact gene sequence begins: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’\nTranslating this from the start codon (ATG), the first few amino acids are:\n*   **ATG**: Methionine (Start)\n*   **TTT**: Phenylalanine\n*   **CTC**: Leucine\n*   **GCT**: Alanine\n\nNow, let's examine the mutants:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’\n    *   **ATG**: Methionine\n    *   **TTC**: Phenylalanine (same as TTT, a silent mutation)\n    *   **TAC**: Tyrosine\n    This is a **missense mutation**, which changes a single amino acid (Leucine to Tyrosine). While this could potentially affect protein function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’\n    *   **ATG**: Methionine\n    *   **TTC**: Phenylalanine\n    *   **TAA**: **Stop codon**\n    This mutation is a **nonsense mutation**. It introduces a premature stop codon very early in the sequence. This will cause protein synthesis to terminate, resulting in a drastically shortened and almost certainly non-functional protein, consisting of only two amino acids.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT...-3’\n    *   **ATG**: Methionine\n    *   **TTT**: Phenylalanine\n    *   **TAC**: Tyrosine\n    Similar to Mutant 1, this is a **missense mutation**, changing the amino acid Leucine to Tyrosine. It is less likely to cause a complete loss of function compared to a nonsense mutation.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** The sequence provided for Mutant 4 (`5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCT...-3'`) compared to the intact gene (`5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT...-3'`) shows multiple complex changes. However, if we interpret it as having a `CTC` to `TAC` change, it would also be a missense mutation like Mutants 1 and 3. In any case, it does not introduce a stop codon.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAmong the given options, a nonsense mutation is the most likely to completely abolish the function of the protein. Mutant 2 is the only one that introduces a premature stop codon, which will lead to a severely truncated and non-functional protein. This makes it the most probable candidate for eliminating the targeted anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
