    "Based on the comprehensive analysis of the provided spectral data, the unidentified compound is determined to be **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n### **Analysis Breakdown:**\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS):**\n    *   The molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156** corresponds to the molecular weight of the compound.\n    *   The presence of a significant peak at **m/z = 158** with roughly one-third the intensity of the main peak (a 3:1 ratio) is a definitive indicator of a single chlorine atom.\n    *   The molecular formula for all the chlorobenzoic acid options is C₇H₅ClO₂, which has a molecular weight of approximately 156.5 g/mol, consistent with the data.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The very broad absorption peak spanning from **3500-2700 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the O-H bond stretching in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n    *   The strong, sharp absorption at **1720 cm⁻¹** is indicative of the C=O (carbonyl) bond stretching of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   This combination strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n3.  **¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The singlet at **11.0 ppm** integrating to one proton (1H) is in the typical chemical shift range (10-13 ppm) for a highly deshielded carboxylic acid proton.\n    *   The two doublets in the aromatic region (**8.02 ppm, 2H** and **7.72 ppm, 2H**) are a classic splitting pattern for a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of the molecule results in two sets of chemically equivalent protons.\n    *   This NMR pattern specifically rules out *ortho* (1,2) and *meta* (1,3) substitution, which would produce more complex splitting patterns. For example, the spectrum for 2-chlorobenzoic acid shows four distinct signals in the aromatic region.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** Incorrect. The NMR spectrum would be more complex.\n*   **B) Phenyl chloroformate:** Incorrect. It lacks the carboxylic acid group, so it would not show the broad IR peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ or the NMR peak at 11.0 ppm.\n*   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Incorrect. This compound is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would lack the characteristic NMR and IR signals for a carboxylic acid.\n*   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** **Correct.** The molecular weight, the presence of chlorine, the carboxylic acid signals in the IR spectrum, and the specific *para*-substitution pattern in the ¹H NMR spectrum all perfectly match the provided data.\n\n<<<D>>>"
