    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to identify the unknown substances and determine the molecular symmetry group of product E.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactions:**\n    *   Reaction 1: A(s) + 8 B(g) → C (bright red product)\n    *   Reaction 2: C + 2 D(g) → E (extremely hazardous product)\n    *   Reaction 3: C + H₂O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)\n    *   Reaction 4: D(g) + B(g) → H (solvent) in a 1:1 ratio\n\n2.  **Identify the Substances:** This chemical puzzle can be solved by systematically identifying the components. The synthesis of mustard gas provides a consistent fit for all the described reactions.\n\n    *   **Identify D, B, and H:** Let's test the hypothesis that this series of reactions describes the synthesis of mustard gas. The synthesis of the solvent 1,2-dichloroethane (H) from ethene (D) and chlorine (B) is a well-known industrial process.\n        *   **D = Ethene (C₂H₄)**, a gas.\n        *   **B = Chlorine (Cl₂)**, a gas.\n        *   **H = 1,2-dichloroethane (C₂H₄Cl₂)**, a common solvent.\n        *   Reaction 4: C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l). This is a 1:1 reaction, fitting the description.\n\n    *   **Identify A and C:** Now using B = Cl₂, let's look at Reaction 1.\n        *   A(s) + 8 Cl₂(g) → C (bright red product).\n        *   The 1:8 stoichiometry is a major clue. Sulfur exists as a crown-shaped S₈ molecule, which is a solid. The reaction of elemental sulfur with chlorine is:\n        *   S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l).\n        *   This reaction fits the 1:8 stoichiometry perfectly if we consider the molecular form of sulfur.\n        *   Therefore, **A = S₈** and **C = SCl₂** (sulfur dichloride). Sulfur dichloride is a cherry-red liquid. The description of C as a solid might be a slight inaccuracy in the riddle, or it could refer to the substance at a lower temperature.\n\n    *   **Identify E:** Now we can deduce E from Reaction 2.\n        *   C + 2 D(g) → E (extremely hazardous product).\n        *   SCl₂ + 2 C₂H₄ → E.\n        *   This is the Levinstein process for the synthesis of **mustard gas, (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S**.\n        *   SCl₂(l) + 2C₂H₄(g) → (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S(l). Mustard gas is an extremely hazardous chemical warfare agent. So, **E = Mustard Gas**.\n\n    *   **Verify with Reaction 3:** Let's check the hydrolysis reaction.\n        *   C + H₂O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).\n        *   The hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (SCl₂) is complex, but it is known to produce hydrochloric acid (HCl), a strong acid, and sulfur dioxide (SO₂), which dissolves in water to form sulfurous acid (H₂SO₃), a weak acid. It also produces elemental sulfur.\n        *   2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → SO₂ + 4HCl + S.\n        *   This fits the products: **F = HCl** (strong acid), **G = H₂SO₃** (weak acid), and the regeneration of elemental sulfur (**A**).\n\n3.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E:**\n    *   E has been identified as mustard gas, (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S.\n    *   This molecule is flexible due to free rotation around the C-C and C-S single bonds.\n    *   The question asks for the molecular symmetry group, which typically refers to the point group of the molecule in its most stable conformation.\n    *   While the molecule can exist in many shapes, its lowest energy conformations lack high symmetry. The most stable conformers possess **C₂ symmetry**. A C₂ axis passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the angle between the two ethyl chloride groups.\n    *   The molecule does not possess the vertical mirror planes required for C₂ᵥ symmetry, nor the higher symmetry of D₄h or D∞h groups.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of E (mustard gas) is C₂.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) C2v\nB) D4h\nC) D∞h\nD) C2\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
