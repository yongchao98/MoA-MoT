    "The observed spectral feature, a peak at 790 nm with a significant drop in flux at shorter wavelengths, is characteristic of the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) emission line from a high-redshift quasar. The flux drop is caused by the Lyman-alpha forest, a series of absorption lines from intervening neutral hydrogen clouds.\n\nTo determine the comoving distance, we first need to calculate the redshift (z) of the quasar. The redshift is calculated using the observed wavelength of a spectral line and its known rest-frame wavelength. The rest-frame wavelength of the Lyman-alpha transition is approximately 121.6 nanometers (nm).\n\nThe redshift (z) is given by the formula:\n\nz = (observed wavelength / rest-frame wavelength) - 1\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nz = (790 nm / 121.6 nm) - 1\nz ≈ 6.497 - 1\nz ≈ 5.5\n\nWith the calculated redshift of approximately 5.5 and the provided cosmological parameters (Hubble constant H₀ = 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹, matter density Ω_M = 0.3, and dark energy density Ω_Λ = 0.7), the comoving distance can be calculated. Using a standard cosmological calculator, the comoving radial distance for these parameters is approximately 8,966 Mpc, or about 8.97 Gpc.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 6 Gpc\nB) 7 Gpc\nC) 8 Gpc\nD) 9 Gpc\n\nThe calculated comoving distance of approximately 8.97 Gpc is closest to 9 Gpc.\n\n<<<D>>>"
