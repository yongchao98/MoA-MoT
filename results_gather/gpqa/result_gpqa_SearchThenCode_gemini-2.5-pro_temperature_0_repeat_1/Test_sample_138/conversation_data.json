    "The reaction of a ketone with sodium nitrite (NaNO₂) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) in water is a known method for synthesizing 1,2-diketones. The reaction proceeds through the nitrosation of the enol form of the ketone at the α-carbon. This initially forms a nitroso compound, which then tautomerizes to a more stable oxime. Finally, hydrolysis of the oxime yields the 1,2-diketone.\n\n**Reaction A: Formation of 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione**\n\nThe starting material must be a ketone that can be oxidized at the carbon adjacent (the α-carbon) to the existing carbonyl group. To produce 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione, the starting material must be 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one. The reaction introduces a second carbonyl group at the C2 position, which is an α-methylene group.\n\n**Reaction B: Formation of 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione**\n\nSimilarly, to produce the 1,2-diketone 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione, the starting material must be a ketone. 5-methylhexan-2-one is a suitable precursor. In unsymmetrical ketones, the nitrosation reaction tends to occur at the more substituted α-carbon. For 5-methylhexan-2-one, the α-carbons are at the C1 (methyl) and C3 (methylene) positions. The reaction will preferentially occur at the more substituted C3 position, leading to the formation of 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because they list alcohols or diols as starting materials (Options B, C, and D). While there are methods to synthesize 1,2-diketones from diols, they typically involve different reagents, such as N-bromosuccinimide. The specified reagents (NaNO₂, HCl, H₂O) are characteristic for the α-oxidation of ketones.\n\nTherefore, the correct starting materials are the ketones corresponding to the desired diketone products.\n\n<<<A>>>"
