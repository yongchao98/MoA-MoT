    "To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4, we must first deduce the structure of product 4 by following the given reaction sequence.\n\n1.  **Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂) to form product 1:** This is the α-bromination of a ketone. The bromine atom attaches to the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group, yielding **2-bromocyclohexanone** as product 1.\n\n2.  **Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to form product 2:** When an α-halo ketone like 2-bromocyclohexanone is treated with a base, it undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the formation of a cyclopropanone intermediate, followed by ring contraction. In this case, 2-bromocyclohexanone rearranges to form **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid** (as its sodium salt, which is then protonated).\n\n3.  **Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine to form product 3:** This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. The hydroxyl group of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom. Thus, cyclopentanecarboxylic acid is converted to **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n\n4.  **Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃) to form product 4:** This reagent is a mild reducing agent specifically used to reduce acyl chlorides to aldehydes. It is less reactive than lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) and the reaction stops at the aldehyde stage without further reduction to an alcohol. Therefore, cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride is reduced to **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\nNow, we must determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. The structure consists of a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\nTo count the number of distinct hydrogen environments (which corresponds to the number of signals in a ¹H NMR spectrum), we need to consider the molecule's symmetry and stereochemistry.\n\n*   The cyclopentane ring is not planar and typically exists in a puckered conformation, most commonly a half-chair or envelope form.\n*   Due to the aldehyde substituent, the protons on the ring are no longer all equivalent.\n*   Let's analyze the protons in their different positions:\n    1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. This is one distinct type.\n    2.  **The proton on C1 (the carbon attached to the -CHO group):** This is the only proton directly attached to the ring at the point of substitution. This is a second distinct type.\n    3.  **The protons on C2 and C5 (α-protons):** These two carbons are adjacent to C1. In the most stable (half-chair) conformation, the molecule has a C2 axis of symmetry, making C2 and C5 equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 (one \"axial\" and one \"equatorial\" relative to the ring's pucker) are diastereotopic. This means they are in different chemical environments and are not equivalent. The same applies to the protons on C5. Due to the C2 symmetry, the two axial-type protons (on C2 and C5) are equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial-type protons are equivalent to each other. This gives two more distinct types of hydrogens.\n    4.  **The protons on C3 and C4 (β-protons):** Similarly, the C2 symmetry makes C3 and C4 equivalent. The two geminal protons on C3 are diastereotopic, as are the two on C4. This results in two more distinct sets of hydrogens (axial-type and equatorial-type).\n\nIn total, we have:\n*   1 signal from the aldehyde proton.\n*   1 signal from the C1 proton.\n*   2 signals from the C2/C5 protons.\n*   2 signals from the C3/C4 protons.\n\nThis gives a total of 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6 chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<A>>>"
