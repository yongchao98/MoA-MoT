    "To determine the energy at which the lifetime of high-energy gamma-rays is limited by pair production with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons, we need to calculate the threshold energy for this interaction. The process is $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$, where a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) collides with a CMB photon ($\\gamma_{CMB}$) to produce an electron-positron pair ($e^{+}e^{-}$).\n\nThe fundamental condition for this reaction to occur is that the total energy in the center-of-mass frame of the two photons must be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair. The rest mass of an electron ($m_e$) is approximately 0.511 MeV/cÂ². Therefore, the minimum energy required to create an electron-positron pair is $2 \\times m_e c^2 = 1.022$ MeV.\n\nThe threshold energy for this interaction can be calculated using the following relativistic invariant formula:\n\n$E_{\\gamma} E_{CMB} (1 - \\cos\\theta) \\ge (m_e c^2)^2$\n\nHere:\n*   $E_{\\gamma}$ is the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray.\n*   $E_{CMB}$ is the energy of the CMB photon, given as $10^{-3}$ eV.\n*   $\\theta$ is the angle of collision between the two photons.\n*   $m_e c^2$ is the rest mass energy of an electron, which is $0.511 \\times 10^6$ eV.\n\nThe lifetime of the gamma-ray will be most significantly limited when the probability of this interaction is high. The interaction is possible only at or above a certain threshold energy for the gamma-ray. To find the minimum possible energy for the gamma-ray ($E_{\\gamma}$), we must consider the most favorable condition for the reaction, which is a head-on collision where $\\theta = 180^\\circ$ (or $\\pi$ radians), making $\\cos\\theta = -1$. In this case, the term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ becomes 2.\n\nThe threshold condition then simplifies to:\n\n$2 E_{\\gamma} E_{CMB} \\ge (2m_e c^2)^2 / 2$\nNo, the correct derivation is:\nThe square of the center-of-mass energy, $s$, is given by $s = 2 E_{\\gamma} E_{CMB} (1 - \\cos\\theta)$. The threshold condition is $s \\ge (2m_e c^2)^2 = 4(m_e c^2)^2$.\nFor a head-on collision, this becomes $4 E_{\\gamma} E_{CMB} \\ge 4(m_e c^2)^2$, which simplifies to:\n\n$E_{\\gamma} \\ge \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values into this equation:\n\n*   $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$\n*   $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$\n\n$E_{\\gamma} \\ge \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n\n$E_{\\gamma} \\ge \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n\n$E_{\\gamma} \\ge 0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}$\n\nTo compare this with the given options, we convert the energy to Giga-electron-volts (GeV), where $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$:\n\n$E_{\\gamma} \\ge \\frac{2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}}$\n\n$E_{\\gamma} \\ge 2.61121 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis calculated threshold energy of approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV is the energy from which the lifetime of gamma-rays starts to be limited by pair production with CMB photons. This value corresponds to option D. A search result also indicates that the reaction with the CMB becomes significant when the gamma-ray energy is approximately $E \\ge 3 \\times 10^{14}$ eV, which is $3 \\times 10^5$ GeV, a value very close to our calculated threshold.\n\n<<<D>>>"
