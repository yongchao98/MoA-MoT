    "Here is a breakdown of the three Michael addition reactions to determine the correct reactants and products.\n\n### Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) → (A)\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** Dimethyl malonate. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), removes an acidic α-proton from the carbon between the two ester groups, creating a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The enolate from dimethyl malonate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate (the carbon atom bonded to the p-tolyl group). This is a conjugate (or 1,4-) addition.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is another enolate, which is then protonated by the ethanol (EtOH) solvent to yield the final product.\n\n3.  **Product Structure (A):**\n    *   The new carbon-carbon bond forms between the central carbon of dimethyl malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The resulting structure is `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂COOMe`.\n    *   To name this according to the options provided, we identify a three-carbon main chain (propane). The two ester groups from the malonate are at position 1 (`-CH(COOMe)₂`). The `p-tolyl` group is at position 2. The third ester group is on a methyl group attached to position 3. This naming convention leads to **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) → (B)\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are excellent, neutral nucleophiles for Michael additions in a process known as the Stork enamine synthesis.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, which functions as a Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The subsequent workup with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the resulting iminium ion intermediate back into a ketone.\n\n3.  **Product Structure (B):**\n    *   The α-carbon of the original cyclohexanone attacks the β-carbon of the nitrile. A new bond forms between the C2 of the cyclohexane ring and the C3 of the butanenitrile chain.\n    *   The final product after hydrolysis is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position with a `–CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group.\n    *   The IUPAC name for this molecule, treating the nitrile as the principal functional group, is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The acidic workup ensures the formation of the ketone (oxo) rather than the enol tautomer.\n\n### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) → 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** But-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK).\n    *   **Michael Donor:** Reactant C.\n\n2.  **Reaction Analysis:**\n    *   The Michael addition forms a bond between the α-carbon of the donor and the β-carbon of the acceptor.\n    *   The fragment from the acceptor (MVK) is `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`, which corresponds to the `(3-oxobutyl)` group in the product name.\n    *   This group is attached to position 2 of the other reactant. Position 2 in a cyclohexane-1,3-dione is the highly acidic carbon located between the two carbonyl groups, making it an excellent Michael donor once deprotonated by a base like KOH.\n    *   Therefore, the starting Michael donor (C) must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nThis combination of reactants and products corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
