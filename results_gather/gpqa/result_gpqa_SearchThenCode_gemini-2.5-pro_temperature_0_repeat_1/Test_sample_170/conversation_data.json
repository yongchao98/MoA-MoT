    "Here is a breakdown of the analysis to determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield for the electrophilic bromination of the given substances.\n\n### 1. Classifying the Substituents\n\nFirst, we classify each substituent on the benzene ring (C6H5-) based on its directing effect in electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (in this case, Br+) to the positions ortho (adjacent) and para (opposite) to themselves.\n    *   **Activating:** -CH3 (Toluene, 1), -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene, 5)\n    *   **Deactivating:** -Cl (Chlorobenzene, 3)\n\n*   **Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They are all deactivating.\n    *   -NO2 (Nitrobenzene, 4)\n    *   -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate, 2)\n    *   -COOH (Benzoic acid, 6)\n\n### 2. Estimating Para-Isomer Yield\n\nThe yield of the para-isomer depends on two main factors: the directing effect of the substituent and steric hindrance.\n\n*   **Meta-Directors (4, 2, 6):** These substances will produce the meta-isomer as the major product. The yield of the para-isomer will be very low.\n    *   **Nitrobenzene (-NO2, 4):** The -NO2 group is strongly deactivating. Bromination yields almost exclusively the meta-isomer, with only trace amounts of the ortho and para products. Outside of special laboratory conditions, the para yield is nearly 0%.\n    *   **Benzoic acid (-COOH, 6) and Ethyl benzoate (-COOC2H5, 2):** These are also meta-directors. While the primary product is meta, they typically yield a small but measurable percentage of the para-isomer, which is generally higher than that for nitrobenzene. For example, in nitration (a similar electrophilic substitution), ethyl benzoate gives about 5% para-isomer. The para yield for benzoic acid is also expected to be in this low single-digit range. Comparing the two, the -COOH and -COOC2H5 groups have similar deactivating strengths, leading to very low and comparable para yields.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directors (1, 5, 3):** These substances will produce significant amounts of both ortho and para isomers. The ratio between them is influenced by sterics.\n    *   **Toluene (-CH3, 1):** The methyl group is relatively small. For bromination, the product distribution is approximately 33% ortho and 67% para. Another source reports about 56% para-isomer.\n    *   **Ethylbenzene (-C2H5, 5):** The ethyl group is larger than the methyl group. This increased steric bulk hinders the attack at the ortho positions, thus favoring the formation of the para-isomer even more than in toluene.\n    *   **Chlorobenzene (-Cl, 3):** The chloro group is an ortho, para-director. Due to its electronic properties and size, it strongly favors the para position. For similar reactions like nitration, chlorobenzene gives a product mixture of about 30% ortho and 70% para. For bromination, the para-selectivity is even higher, often yielding close to 90% para-isomer.\n\n### 3. Ranking the Substances\n\nBased on the analysis above, we can arrange the substances in order of increasing yield of the para-isomer:\n\n1.  **Nitrobenzene (4):** Yields virtually no para-isomer (approaching 0%).\n2.  **Benzoic acid (6) and Ethyl benzoate (2):** Yield very small amounts of the para-isomer (low single-digit percentages). It is difficult to definitively order these two without precise experimental data for bromination, but they are clearly next after nitrobenzene.\n3.  **Toluene (1):** Yields a significant amount of para-isomer, around 56-67%.\n4.  **Ethylbenzene (5):** The larger ethyl group leads to greater steric hindrance at the ortho position compared to toluene, resulting in a higher yield of the para-isomer.\n5.  **Chlorobenzene (3):** Exhibits very high para-selectivity, often the highest among common monosubstituted benzenes, with para-isomer yields that can approach or exceed 90%.\n\nTherefore, the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n\n**4 < 6 ≈ 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nLooking at the provided options, option D matches this derived order.\n\n**4 (-NO2) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC2H5) < 1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5) < 3 (-Cl)**\n\n<<<D>>>"
