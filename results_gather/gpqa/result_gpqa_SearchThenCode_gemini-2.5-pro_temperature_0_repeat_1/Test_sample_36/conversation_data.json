    "The final product, E, is produced through a five-step reaction sequence. Let's break down each step to determine the structure of E.\n\n*   **Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 → A**\n    This reaction protects the aldehyde group of propionaldehyde using ethanedithiol (EDT) and a Lewis acid catalyst (BF3). The product, A, is a 1,3-dithiolane derivative.\n\n*   **Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\n    Butyllithium (BuLi) is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton in molecule A. The proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms is acidic and is removed to form a carbanion, B. This type of reaction, where the polarity of the carbonyl carbon is inverted, is known as an umpolung.\n\n*   **Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\n    The carbanion B acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbon in bromoethane, resulting in the addition of an ethyl group.\n\n*   **Step 4: C + HgCl2 / H2O / H+ → D**\n    This step is the deprotection of the dithiolane group to regenerate a carbonyl group. The resulting product, D, is 3-pentanone.\n\n*   **Step 5: D + PPh3 / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n    This is a Wittig reaction. First, triphenylphosphine (PPh3) reacts with 3-bromopentane to form a phosphonium salt. BuLi then deprotonates the carbon adjacent to the phosphorus, creating a Wittig reagent (ylide). This ylide reacts with the ketone, 3-pentanone (D), to form an alkene, E. The carbonyl group of 3-pentanone is replaced by a carbon-carbon double bond from the ylide. The final product, E, is 3,4-diethyl-3-hexene.\n\n**13C-NMR Analysis of 3,4-diethyl-3-hexene (E)**\n\nThe structure of 3,4-diethyl-3-hexene is symmetrical. To determine the number of 13C-NMR signals, we need to identify the number of unique carbon environments in the molecule.\n\nThe structure is:\n(CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂\n\nDue to the plane of symmetry passing through the central carbon-carbon double bond, the carbons on both sides are equivalent.\n\n1.  **sp² Carbons:** The two carbons forming the double bond are in identical chemical environments. Therefore, they will produce a single signal.\n2.  **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-):** All four methylene groups are attached to the sp² carbons and are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry. They will produce one signal.\n3.  **Methyl Carbons (-CH₃):** All four terminal methyl groups are also equivalent because of the symmetry. They will produce one signal.\n\nTherefore, despite having a total of 10 carbon atoms, the high degree of symmetry in 3,4-diethyl-3-hexene results in only **3** distinct signals in its 13C-NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<C>>>"
