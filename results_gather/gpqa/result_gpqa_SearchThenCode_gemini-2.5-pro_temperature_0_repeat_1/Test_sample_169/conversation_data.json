    "To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, ⟨S_y⟩, for an electron in the spin state |ψ⟩ = (3i, 4), we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Normalize the spin state:**\n    The given unnormalized state is a column vector:\n    |ψ⟩ = [ 3i ]\n          [ 4  ]\n\n    First, we find the inner product of the state with itself, ⟨ψ|ψ⟩. The corresponding \"bra\" vector ⟨ψ| is the conjugate transpose of the \"ket\" |ψ⟩:\n    ⟨ψ| = [ -3i  4 ]\n\n    The inner product is:\n    ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = -9i² + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25\n\n    The normalization constant is the reciprocal of the square root of this inner product, which is 1/√25 = 1/5.\n    The normalized state |ψ_norm⟩ is:\n    |ψ_norm⟩ = (1/5) * [ 3i ]\n                      [ 4  ]\n\n2.  **Define the spin operator S_y:**\n    The spin operator S_y is defined in terms of the Pauli matrix σ_y and the reduced Planck constant ħ:\n    S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y\n\n    Given the matrix for σ_y:\n    σ_y = [ 0  -i ]\n          [ i   0 ]\n\n    The S_y operator is:\n    S_y = (ħ/2) * [ 0  -i ]\n                  [ i   0 ]\n\n3.  **Calculate the expectation value:**\n    The expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is calculated using the formula ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ_norm|S_y|ψ_norm⟩. This can also be calculated as ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩. Using the latter approach avoids carrying fractions through the calculation.\n\n    First, we apply the S_y operator to the unnormalized state |ψ⟩:\n    S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [ 0  -i ] [ 3i ] = (ħ/2) * [ (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) ] = (ħ/2) * [ -4i ]\n                  [ i   0 ] [ 4  ]   [ (i)(3i) + (0)(4)  ]   [ -3  ]\n\n    Next, we compute the inner product of ⟨ψ| with the resulting vector S_y|ψ⟩:\n    ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = [ -3i  4 ] * (ħ/2) * [ -4i ]\n                                    [ -3  ]\n\n    ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [(-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3)]\n    ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [12i² - 12]\n    ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [-12 - 12]\n    ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [-24] = -12ħ\n\n    Finally, we divide by the normalization factor ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = 25:\n    ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = -12ħ / 25\n\nThe expectation value of the spin along the y-direction is -12ħ/25.\n\n<<<A>>>"
