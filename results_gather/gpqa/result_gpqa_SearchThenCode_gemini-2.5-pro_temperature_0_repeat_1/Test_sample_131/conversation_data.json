    "The analysis of the 1H NMR spectrum of the mixture and the individual components leads to the identification of the two compounds present. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n### Analysis of the Provided 1H NMR Data\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds. All options—1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene—fit this formula.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this indicates that each compound has only one type of aromatic proton. A singlet means that all aromatic protons within a single molecule are chemically equivalent due to symmetry.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum displays three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. The presence of singlets suggests the signals come from methyl (-CH3) groups, as ethyl groups would produce a more complex pattern (a quartet and a triplet). This allows for the exclusion of 1,4-diethylbenzene, which has ethyl groups. This eliminates option D.\n\n### Predicted 1H NMR Spectra for Each Isomer\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. This results in **one singlet** (2H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** The four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are equivalent. This results in **one singlet** (12H).\n\n2.  **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry exists.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. This gives **one singlet** (2H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent. This produces **two singlets** with a 6H:6H or 1:1 integration ratio.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry exists.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent, yielding **one singlet** (2H).\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1 and C3, the unique one at C2, and the unique one at C5. This leads to **three singlets** with a 6H:3H:3H or 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### Evaluating the Mixture Options\n\nThe mixture's spectrum has two aromatic singlets and three alkyl singlets.\n\n*   **Option A (1,2,3,4- and 1,2,3,5-):** This mixture would produce five alkyl singlets (two from 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and three from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene), which contradicts the data.\n*   **Option B (1,2,4,5- and 1,2,3,4-):**\n    *   **Aromatic:** Both compounds give one singlet each, resulting in two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This matches the data.\n    *   **Alkyl:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one singlet (relative integral 12H). 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives two singlets (each with a relative integral of 6H). The combination gives three singlets with an intensity ratio of 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the observed spectrum.\n*   **Option C (1,2,4,5- and 1,2,3,5-):** This mixture would result in four alkyl singlets (one from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and three from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene), which is inconsistent with the data.\n\nTherefore, the mixture must contain 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
