    "The synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene requires a careful sequence of reactions to ensure the correct placement of the three substituents on the benzene ring. The key is to consider the directing effects of each group as it is added. The target molecule has an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2) in a 1,3,5-relationship.\n\nLet's analyze the directing effects of the substituents:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This is a deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** This is a deactivating group but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** This is a strongly deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n\nA logical and high-yield synthesis route is as follows:\n\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation of Benzene:** The first step is to add the acetyl group to the benzene ring using acetyl chloride (CH3COCl) and a Lewis acid catalyst like aluminum chloride (AlCl3). This reaction forms acetophenone. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director, which is crucial for placing the next substituents at the 3 and 5 positions.\n    *   Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone\n\n2.  **Bromination of Acetophenone:** The next step is the bromination of acetophenone using bromine (Br2) and a catalyst like iron(III) bromide (FeBr3). Since the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, the bromine atom will be added to the C3 position, yielding 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    *   Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone\n\n3.  **Nitration of 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The final step is the nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone using a mixture of nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Now, we have two directing groups on the ring: the acetyl group at C1 (*meta*-directing) and the bromo group at C3 (*ortho, para*-directing).\n    *   The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the C5 position.\n    *   The bromo group directs incoming groups to positions C2, C4, and C6.\n    *   In this case of competing directors, the position that is *meta* to both deactivating groups is the most deactivated. However, the positions that are *meta* to the acetyl group (C5) and *ortho/para* to the bromo group (C2, C4, C6) must be considered. The position C5 is *meta* to the acetyl group and also *meta* to the bromo group. The position C4 is *meta* to the acetyl group and *para* to the bromo group. The position C2 is *meta* to the acetyl group and *ortho* to the bromo group. While complex, the synthesis proceeds to place the nitro group at the C5 position, yielding the final product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. This specific substitution pattern is known and the compound is commercially available.\n\nThis sequence corresponds to the first three steps of option C. The additional steps in option C (iv, v, vi, vii) involve reduction of a nitro group, another nitration, and then diazotization and removal of a group, which are unnecessarily complex and incorrect for synthesizing the target molecule which retains a nitro group. However, among the choices provided, the initial sequence of option C is the only chemically sound pathway to begin the synthesis. The question asks for the sequence that *would lead to* the synthesis, and the initial steps of C are the correct ones. The other options contain fundamental flaws in their initial steps:\n\n*   **Option A:** Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline (produced in step ii) is problematic without protection of the amino group.\n*   **Option B:** Bromination followed by nitration would lead to a mixture of ortho and para isomers, not the desired meta relationship.\n*   **Option D:** The sequence of reducing a nitro group and then removing the resulting amino group (steps i-iv) would just convert benzene back to benzene, making the sequence nonsensical.\n\nTherefore, the sequence starting with acylation, followed by bromination, and then nitration is the most viable route.\n\n<<<C>>>"
