    "The analysis of the reactions is based on the known selectivity of the two reducing agents, Lithium borohydride (LiBH4) and Borane (BH3).\n\n### Reaction A: Reduction with LiBH4\n\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH4) is a reducing agent that is known to selectively reduce esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid monoester, 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule has both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an isobutyl ester group (-COOiBu).\n*   **Reaction Pathway:** LiBH4 will reduce the ester group to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group will be deprotonated but not reduced. The subsequent acidic workup (H+) will protonate the resulting alkoxide and catalyze an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) between the newly formed alcohol and the carboxylic acid to form the six-membered ring lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the ester and the subsequent lactonization do not affect the stereocenter at the 3-position of the starting material. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the product will be the same as the stereochemistry of the starting material A.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Reaction B: Reduction with BH3\n\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH3) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting material B is also 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:** BH3 will reduce the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol, leaving the ester group intact. The acidic workup (H+) will then catalyze an intramolecular transesterification, where the newly formed alcohol attacks the ester carbonyl, forming the lactone and releasing isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** This reaction pathway also does not affect the stereocenter at the 3-position of the starting material. Thus, the stereochemistry of the product will be the same as the stereochemistry of the starting material B.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the product is (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBased on this analysis, starting material A is the (R)-enantiomer and starting material B is the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
