    "To find the partition function Z for the system of three spins, we must sum the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), over all possible states of the system. The energy E is given by the Hamiltonian E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3], and each spin (S1, S2, S3) can take a value of +1 or -1.\n\nFirst, we identify all possible configurations of the three spins and calculate the corresponding energy for each state. There are 2³ = 8 possible microstates.\n\nThe states can be grouped by their energy levels:\n\n*   **Configuration 1: All spins are aligned.**\n    *   State (+1, +1, +1): The energy is E₁ = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -3J.\n    *   State (-1, -1, -1): The energy is E₂ = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J.\n    *   These two states are degenerate, meaning they have the same energy level. So, for the energy level E = -3J, the degeneracy is g₁ = 2.\n\n*   **Configuration 2: Two spins are aligned, and one is anti-aligned.**\n    *   State (+1, +1, -1): The energy is E₃ = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = J.\n    *   This energy level includes all configurations where one spin is different from the other two. There are three ways to have one spin as -1 and two as +1, and three ways to have one spin as +1 and two as -1. Let's verify for another state:\n    *   State (+1, -1, -1): The energy is E₄ = -J[(1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = J.\n    *   All six of these states—(+,+,-), (+,-,+), (-,+,+), (+,-,-), (-,+,-), and (-,-,+)—have the same energy, E = J.\n    *   Therefore, for the energy level E = J, the degeneracy is g₂ = 6.\n\nThe partition function, Z, is the sum over all energy states, weighted by their degeneracy:\nZ = Σᵢ gᵢ * e^(-βEᵢ)\n\nSubstituting the energy levels and their degeneracies we found:\nZ = (g₁ * e^(-βE₁)) + (g₂ * e^(-βE₂))\nZ = (2 * e^(-β(-3J))) + (6 * e^(-β(J)))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nThis result matches one of the provided options.\n\n<<<A>>>"
