    "To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we must first understand the starting material and the reaction it undergoes.\n\n### 1. Starting Material: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\n\nFirst, let's determine the molecular formula of this compound.\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene ring**: A six-carbon ring with one double bond.\n*   **-carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group, which is at position 1.\n*   **2-formyl**: A -CHO group at position 2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A -CH=CH₂ group at position 5.\n\nThe carbon skeleton consists of the 6-carbon ring, 1 carbon in the carboxylic acid group, 1 carbon in the formyl group, and 2 carbons in the vinyl group, for a total of **10 carbon atoms**.\n\nLet's count the hydrogen atoms:\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) has 1 hydrogen.\n*   The formyl group (-CHO) has 1 hydrogen.\n*   The vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) has 3 hydrogens.\n*   On the cyclohexene ring:\n    *   C1 has the -COOH group and is bonded to C2 and C6. It has 1 hydrogen.\n    *   C2 has the -CHO group and is bonded to C1 and C3. It has 1 hydrogen.\n    *   C3 is part of the ring's double bond and is bonded to C2 and C4. It has 1 hydrogen.\n    *   C4 is part of the ring's double bond and is bonded to C3 and C5. It has 1 hydrogen.\n    *   C5 has the vinyl group and is bonded to C4 and C6. It has 1 hydrogen.\n    *   C6 is bonded to C1 and C5. It has 2 hydrogens.\n*   Total hydrogens = 1 (COOH) + 1 (CHO) + 3 (vinyl) + 1 (C1) + 1 (C2) + 1 (C3) + 1 (C4) + 1 (C5) + 2 (C6) = **12 hydrogen atoms**.\n\nThe molecule also contains 2 oxygen atoms from the carboxylic acid and 1 from the formyl group, for a total of **3 oxygen atoms**.\n\nThe molecular formula of the starting material is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for the starting material can be calculated using the formula: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2). Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation.\nIHD_start = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = 5.\nThis can be verified by its structure: 1 ring + 1 C=C in the ring + 1 C=C in the vinyl group + 1 C=O in the formyl group + 1 C=O in the carboxylic acid group = 5.\n\n### 2. The Reaction: Reduction with Red Phosphorus and Excess HI\n\nThe reaction with red phosphorus (P) and excess hydroiodic acid (HI) is a very strong reduction reaction. This reagent is capable of reducing several functional groups to alkanes:\n*   Aldehydes (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Ketones are reduced to methylene groups (-CH₂-).\n*   Alkenes (C=C) are reduced to alkanes (C-C).\n\nIn this reaction, all oxygen-containing functional groups and all carbon-carbon double bonds will be reduced.\n\n### 3. The Product\n\nThe carbon skeleton of the molecule remains intact. The starting material has 10 carbon atoms, so the product will also have 10 carbon atoms. The reaction will proceed as follows:\n*   The cyclohexene ring is reduced to a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The carboxylic acid group at position 1 is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The formyl group at position 2 is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The vinyl group at position 5 is reduced to an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane. Since all double bonds are saturated and all oxygen atoms are removed, the product is a cycloalkane. The general formula for a cycloalkane is CₙH₂ₙ.\n\nAs the product has 10 carbon atoms, its molecular formula will be **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n### 4. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\n\nThe IHD of the final product can be calculated from its molecular formula, C₁₀H₂₀.\nIHD_product = C + 1 - (H/2)\nIHD_product = 10 + 1 - (20/2)\nIHD_product = 11 - 10 = 1\n\nAn IHD of 1 for a hydrocarbon indicates the presence of either one ring or one double bond. Since the reaction saturates all double bonds but preserves the ring structure, the IHD of 1 corresponds to the cyclohexane ring in the product molecule.\n\n<<<A>>>"
