    "To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we can use the Stefan-Boltzmann Law. The information about the masses and radial velocities of the stars is also provided.\n\n### Key Principles:\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is determined by its radius (R) and its surface temperature (T). The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law**: This law states that the wavelength at which a black body is brightest (peak emission wavelength, λ_max) is inversely proportional to its surface temperature (T). Therefore, if the peak wavelengths are the same, the temperatures must also be the same.\n3.  **Doppler Effect**: The observed wavelength of light from a moving object is shifted. If the object is moving away, its light is redshifted (wavelength increases); if it is moving closer, its light is blueshifted (wavelength decreases).\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1.  **Luminosity Ratio**: We need to find the ratio L₁ / L₂. Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law for both stars and dividing one by the other, we get:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    This simplifies to:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² × (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n2.  **Radius Ratio**: The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 × R₂).\n    Therefore, the ratio of their radii is R₁/R₂ = 1.5.\n    Squaring this ratio gives (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n\n3.  **Temperature Ratio**: The problem states that astronomers \"determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same.\" In astronomical terms, \"determining\" a property implies finding its intrinsic value after correcting for observational effects like redshift. This means the intrinsic peak emission wavelengths (λ_max) are identical for both stars.\n    According to Wien's Displacement Law (λ_max ∝ 1/T), if the peak wavelengths are the same, their surface temperatures must be the same (T₁ = T₂).\n    Therefore, the ratio of their temperatures is T₁/T₂ = 1.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation**: Now, we substitute the ratios for radius and temperature back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) × (1)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25\n\nThe information about the stars' masses and the non-zero radial velocity of Star_2 are extraneous details intended to test the understanding of the core physical principles governing luminosity. Since the intrinsic peak wavelengths are the same, the temperatures are the same, and the Doppler effect from Star_2's motion does not need to be factored into the temperature ratio.\n\nThe luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of 2.25.\n\n<<<C>>>"
