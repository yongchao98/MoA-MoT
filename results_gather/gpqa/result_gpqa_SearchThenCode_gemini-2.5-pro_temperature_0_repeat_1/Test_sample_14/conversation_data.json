    "The search results confirm the formulas I used.\n\n*   **Transit Probability**: For a circular orbit, the geometric transit probability is P_transit ≈ R_star / a. This is confirmed in multiple sources. The formula can be more precise, including the planet's radius as (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since the planets are \"Earth-like\" and thus much smaller than their host stars, R_planet is negligible. The problem also implies a simplified model.\n*   **Kepler's Third Law**: The relationship P² ∝ a³ / M_s is correct. The full form is T² = (4π² / (G * (M_s + M_p))) * a³. Since the planet's mass (M_p) is negligible compared to the star's mass (M_s), it simplifies to T² ≈ (4π² / (G * M_s)) * a³. This leads to a³ ∝ M_s * P².\n\nThe derivation and calculation were:\n1.  P_t1 / P_t2 = a2 / a1 (since R_s1 = R_s2)\n2.  a ∝ (M_s * P²)^(1/3)\n3.  a2 / a1 = [(M_s2 * P2²) / (M_s1 * P1²)]^(1/3)\n4.  Given M_s1 = 2 * M_s2 and P2 = 3 * P1\n5.  a2 / a1 = [(M_s2 * (3*P1)²) / (2*M_s2 * P1²)]^(1/3)\n6.  a2 / a1 = (9 * M_s2 * P1²) / (2 * M_s2 * P1²)^(1/3)\n7.  a2 / a1 = (9/2)^(1/3) = 4.5^(1/3)\n8.  4.5^(1/3) ≈ 1.65096\n\nSo, P_t1 / P_t2 ≈ 1.65.\n\nThis means the probability for Planet_1 is about 1.65 times higher than for Planet_2.\n\nTherefore, the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1. This matches option C.\n\nThe logic is sound and confirmed by the search results. I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit. (Incorrect)\nB) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit. (Incorrect)\nC) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit. (Correct)\nD) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit. (Incorrect)\n\nThe calculation is robust.\n\nTo be extremely thorough:\n- The probability of a transit for a planet in a circular orbit, assuming random orbital inclinations, is given by the ratio of the stellar radius (R*) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (a).\n- Probability (P_t) ≈ R* / a\n\nFor Planet_1:\n- P_t1 ≈ R_s1 / a1\n\nFor Planet_2:\n- P_t2 ≈ R_s2 / a2\n\nWe are given that the stellar radii are the same:\n- R_s1 = R_s2\n\nTo compare the probabilities, we take the ratio:\n- Ratio = P_t1 / P_t2 = (R_s1 / a1) / (R_s2 / a2) = a2 / a1\n\nNow, we must find the relationship between the semi-major axes using Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion. The law states that the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) and inversely proportional to the mass of the host star (M_s).\n- P² ∝ a³ / M_s\n- Rearranging for 'a': a³ ∝ P² * M_s\n- So, a ∝ (P² * M_s)^(1/3)\n\nNow we can find the ratio a2 / a1:\n- a2 / a1 = [(P2² * M_s2) / (P1² * M_s1)]^(1/3)\n\nWe are given the following relationships:\n- The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2: P2 = 3 * P1\n- The mass of the host star of Planet_1 is twice that of the host star of Planet_2: M_s1 = 2 * M_s2\n\nSubstitute these into the ratio equation:\n- a2 / a1 = [((3 * P1)² * M_s2) / (P1² * (2 * M_s2))]^(1/3)\n- a2 / a1 = [(9 * P1² * M_s2) / (2 * P1² * M_s2)]^(1/3)\n\nCancel out the P1² and M_s2 terms:\n- a2 / a1 = (9 / 2)^(1/3)\n- a2 / a1 = (4.5)^(1/3)\n\nCalculating the cube root of 4.5:\n- a2 / a1 ≈ 1.65096\n\nSince the probability ratio P_t1 / P_t2 is equal to a2 / a1, Planet_1 has a transit probability that is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2.\n\nTherefore, the researchers should prefer to observe Planet_1. This corresponds to option C. The reasoning is solid.\n\nFinal Answer is C.\nThe probability of a planet transiting its star is proportional to the radius of the star divided by the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (p ∝ R_star / a).\n\nLet's denote the parameters for Planet_1 with subscript 1 and for Planet_2 with subscript 2.\n\nWe are given:\n*   The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: P₂ = 3 * P₁\n*   The mass of the host star of Planet_1 is twice that of the host star of Planet_2: M_s₁ = 2 * M_s₂\n*   The radii of the host stars are the same: R_s₁ = R_s₂\n\nThe ratio of the transit probabilities is:\np₁ / p₂ = (R_s₁ / a₁) / (R_s₂ / a₂)\n\nSince R_s₁ = R_s₂, the equation simplifies to:\np₁ / p₂ = a₂ / a₁\n\nTo find the ratio of the semi-major axes (a₂ / a₁), we use Kepler's Third Law:\nP² ∝ a³ / M_s\n\nRearranging for 'a', we get:\na³ ∝ P² * M_s\na ∝ (P² * M_s)^(1/3)\n\nNow we can write the ratio of the semi-major axes:\na₂ / a₁ = [ (P₂² * M_s₂) / (P₁² * M_s₁) ]^(1/3)\n\nSubstitute the given relationships (P₂ = 3 * P₁ and M_s₁ = 2 * M_s₂):\na₂ / a₁ = [ ((3 * P₁)² * M_s₂) / (P₁² * (2 * M_s₂)) ]^(1/3)\na₂ / a₁ = [ (9 * P₁² * M_s₂) / (2 * P₁² * M_s₂) ]^(1/3)\n\nThe terms P₁² and M_s₂ cancel out:\na₂ / a₁ = (9 / 2)^(1/3)\na₂ / a₁ = (4.5)^(1/3)\na₂ / a₁ ≈ 1.65096\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the transit probabilities is:\np₁ / p₂ ≈ 1.65\n\nThis means Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times more likely to transit than Planet_2.\n\nBased on this calculation, the correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
