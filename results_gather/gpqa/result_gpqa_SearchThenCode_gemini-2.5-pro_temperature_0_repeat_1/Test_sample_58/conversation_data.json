    "To determine the pH of the final solution, we must first calculate the number of moles of acid and base being mixed.\n\n1.  **Calculate the initial moles of each component:**\n    *   **CH3COOH (weak acid):** Moles = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.050 mol\n    *   **HCl (strong acid):** Moles = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 mol. Since HCl is a strong acid, this provides 0.080 moles of H⁺ ions.\n    *   **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):** Moles = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 mol. Since Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base that releases two hydroxide ions per formula unit, the moles of OH⁻ ions are 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol.\n\n2.  **Perform the neutralization reactions.** The strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) and the strong base (OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂) will react first.\n    *   **Reaction:** H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n    *   We have 0.080 mol of H⁺ and 0.180 mol of OH⁻. The H⁺ is the limiting reactant.\n    *   **Moles of OH⁻ remaining:** 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\n3.  **React the remaining strong base with the weak acid.** The 0.100 mol of excess OH⁻ will now react with the weak acid, CH₃COOH.\n    *   **Reaction:** CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n    *   We have 0.050 mol of CH₃COOH and 0.100 mol of OH⁻. The CH₃COOH is the limiting reactant.\n    *   **Moles of OH⁻ in final excess:** 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n4.  **Calculate the final concentration and pH.** The pH of the solution is determined by the concentration of the excess strong base (OH⁻).\n    *   **Total volume of the solution:** 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n    *   **Final concentration of OH⁻:** [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n    *   **Calculate pOH:** pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n    *   **Calculate pH:** pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.\n\nThe final pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<A>>>"
