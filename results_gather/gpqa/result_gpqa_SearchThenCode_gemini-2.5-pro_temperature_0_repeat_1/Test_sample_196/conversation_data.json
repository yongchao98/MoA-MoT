    "The analysis of the provided spectroscopic data and the chemical reaction leads to the following conclusion:\n\n### **Step 1: Identification of Compound X**\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The broad absorption band in the range of 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The absorptions at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are indicative of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (broad singlet, 1H):** This signal is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   **8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals in the aromatic region suggest a para-substituted benzene ring. The downfield shift to 8.0 ppm is caused by the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield 7.2 ppm signal is adjacent to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   **Alkyl Region Signals (2.9 ppm, 1.7 ppm, 1.4 ppm, 0.9 ppm):** This pattern corresponds to a *sec*-butyl group attached to the benzene ring.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (triplet, 3H):** A methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (doublet, 3H):** A methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (multiplet, 2H):** A methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to both a methyl and a methine group.\n        *   **2.9 ppm (multiplet, 1H):** A methine group (-CH-) attached to the aromatic ring and also to a methyl and a methylene group.\n\nCombining these observations, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n### **Step 2: Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI**\n\nThe reaction of a carboxylic acid with red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI) is a powerful reduction reaction. This reagent combination completely reduces the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   **Reagents:** Red P / HI\n*   **Transformation:** The -COOH group is reduced to a -CH₃ group.\n*   **Final Product:** The resulting molecule is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the spectroscopic analysis, Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Its reaction with red phosphorus and HI reduces the carboxylic acid to a methyl group, yielding 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
