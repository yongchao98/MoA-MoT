    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as an extension of the Standard Model, incorporating higher-dimensional operators to parameterize potential new physics at energy scales beyond the electroweak scale. The construction of the SMEFT Lagrangian adheres to certain fundamental symmetries.\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry:** The SMEFT is built upon the principles of quantum field theory in four-dimensional spacetime. A core assumption is that the underlying physics is described by a manifestly Lorentz-invariant local quantum theory. This means all operators in the SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry.\n\n2.  **Poincare Symmetry:** Poincare symmetry is the full symmetry of special relativity, encompassing Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) and spacetime translations. The assumption of a Poincar√©-invariant local quantum theory is fundamental to the construction of SMEFT. Therefore, all operators must be invariant under Poincare transformations.\n\n3.  **CP Symmetry:** CP symmetry, the combination of charge conjugation (C) and parity (P) transformations, is known to be violated in the Standard Model. The SMEFT framework allows for additional sources of CP violation beyond what is present in the Standard Model. There is extensive research dedicated to classifying and constraining these new CP-violating operators within SMEFT. Consequently, CP symmetry is not a requirement for all operators in the SMEFT.\n\n4.  **CPT Symmetry:** The CPT theorem is a fundamental result in quantum field theory which states that any Lorentz-invariant local quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be CPT invariant. Since SMEFT is constructed as a Lorentz-invariant local quantum field theory, it inherently respects CPT symmetry.\n\nBased on this, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\n<<<A>>>"
