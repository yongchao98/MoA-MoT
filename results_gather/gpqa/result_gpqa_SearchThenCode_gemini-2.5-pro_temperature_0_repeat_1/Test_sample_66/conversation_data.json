    "In the quantum mechanical coupling of angular momenta, a coupled state $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the uncoupled states $|l_1, m_1\\rangle|l_2, m_2\\rangle$. The coefficients of this expansion are known as the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, denoted by $\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$.\n\nThe expansion is given by the formula:\n$|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} \\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle |l_1, m_1\\rangle|l_2, m_2\\rangle$\n\nA fundamental property and a selection rule for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is that they are non-zero only if the magnetic quantum numbers of the individual angular momenta sum up to the total magnetic quantum number. That is, the condition $m_1 + m_2 = m$ must be satisfied. If this condition is not met, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n\nIn the given problem, we have two electrons in a p orbital, so their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$. The coupled state of the two-electron system is given as $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, which means the total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$ and the total magnetic quantum number is $m=-1$.\n\nWe are asked to find the joint probability of measuring the orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ and obtaining the eigenvalues of $-\\hbar$ for both. The eigenvalue of the $L_z$ operator is $m_l\\hbar$. Therefore, an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ corresponds to a magnetic quantum number of $m_l = -1$.\n\nThis means we are looking for the probability of finding the first electron in the state with $m_1 = -1$ and the second electron in the state with $m_2 = -1$. The corresponding uncoupled state is $|l_1, m_1\\rangle|l_2, m_2\\rangle = |1, -1\\rangle|1, -1\\rangle$.\n\nThe probability of this measurement outcome is the square of the absolute value of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$.\n\nLet's check the condition $m_1 + m_2 = m$ for this coefficient.\nHere, $m_1 = -1$, $m_2 = -1$, and $m = -1$.\nSo, $m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\nSince $m_1 + m_2 = -2 \\neq m = -1$, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$ is zero.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of the state $|1, -1\\rangle|1, -1\\rangle$ in the expansion of the state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is zero. The probability of measuring the system to be in this state is the square of this coefficient, which is $0^2 = 0$.\n\n<<<B>>>"
