    "The analysis of the provided 1H NMR data leads to the identification of the unknown compound. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the spectral data and its interpretation:\n\n1.  **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, singlet):** This signal, integrating to three protons and appearing as a singlet (meaning it has no adjacent protons to couple with), is characteristic of the methyl group (CH₃) in an acetate ester (CH₃COO-). All four possible compounds are acetates, so this signal is consistent with all options.\n\n2.  **Signals in the Alkene Region (7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm):** The presence of signals between 4.5 and 7.5 ppm indicates protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (alkenyl protons).\n\n3.  **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, doublet, J = 16.0 Hz):** This signal corresponds to one alkenyl proton.\n    *   The **doublet (d)** splitting pattern means it is coupled to only one other proton.\n    *   The **coupling constant (J)** of **16.0 Hz** is crucial for determining the stereochemistry. For protons on a double bond, a large coupling constant in the range of 12-18 Hz is indicative of a *trans* configuration. A smaller coupling constant, typically 6-12 Hz, would suggest a *cis* configuration. The high chemical shift (downfield position) of 7.0 ppm suggests this proton is on the carbon atom attached to the electron-withdrawing ester oxygen (-O-CH=CH-).\n\n4.  **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, doublet of quartets):** This signal is for the second alkenyl proton.\n    *   The **doublet (d)** portion of the splitting arises from coupling to the first alkenyl proton (at 7.0 ppm), and it shares the same J-coupling constant of 16.0 Hz.\n    *   The **quartet (q)** portion arises from coupling to an adjacent methyl group (three protons), according to the n+1 rule (3+1=4).\n\n5.  **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, doublet):** This signal represents a methyl group (3H). The **doublet (d)** splitting indicates it is coupled to a single proton (1+1=2), which is the alkenyl proton at 5.5 ppm.\n\n**Conclusion from the Data:**\n\n*   The molecule contains an acetate group (from the 2.1 ppm singlet).\n*   The molecule has a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃) based on the signals at 7.0, 5.5, and 1.6 ppm. The butenyl acetate options are eliminated because they would show different splitting patterns and integrations for the alkyl part of the chain.\n*   The large coupling constant of 16.0 Hz between the two alkenyl protons unequivocally indicates they are in a *trans* orientation.\n\nBased on this comprehensive analysis, the unknown compound is identified as **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
