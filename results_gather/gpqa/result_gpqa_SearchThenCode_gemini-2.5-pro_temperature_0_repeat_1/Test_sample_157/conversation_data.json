    "A dominant-negative mutation produces a mutant protein that interferes with the function of the wild-type protein. In the case of transcription factors that must form dimers to function, a dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain can have a significant impact.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the molecular events:\n\n1.  **Dimerization is essential:** The transcription factor subunit must pair up (dimerize) to become active and carry out its function of gene transcription.\n2.  **Formation of non-functional heterodimers:** In a heterozygous individual, both normal (wild-type) and mutant (Y) protein subunits are produced. The mutant Y subunit is still able to dimerize with the wild-type subunit. However, the resulting mixed dimer (heterodimer) is inactive.\n3.  **Interference with wild-type function:** Because the mutant protein can bind to and sequester the wild-type protein in these non-functional complexes, it effectively prevents the wild-type protein from forming functional pairs. This interference is the \"dominant\" aspect of the mutation.\n4.  **Loss-of-function of the wild-type allele:** The wild-type allele itself is not damaged, but its protein product is rendered ineffective by the mutant protein. One possible mechanism for this is that the abnormal heterodimer is recognized by the cell's quality control machinery and targeted for degradation. This would lead to the degradation of both the mutant and the wild-type subunits that are paired with it.\n\nConsidering the options:\n\n*   **A) loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype:** This is incorrect. If the mutation prevented dimerization, the mutant protein could not interfere with the wild-type protein, likely resulting in a recessive, not dominant, phenotype.\n*   **B) protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype:** While protein aggregation can cause a loss-of-function, it is not the most precise description of a dominant-negative mechanism, which is characterized by direct interference with the wild-type protein's function.\n*   **C) change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype:** This is incorrect. A dominant-negative mutation causes a loss-of-function, not a gain-of-function.\n*   **D) protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele:** This is the most plausible outcome. The formation of an aberrant heterodimer can lead to its degradation, which in turn causes a functional loss of the wild-type protein that is trapped in that complex. This effectively represents a loss-of-function of the wild-type allele.\n\n<<<D>>>"
