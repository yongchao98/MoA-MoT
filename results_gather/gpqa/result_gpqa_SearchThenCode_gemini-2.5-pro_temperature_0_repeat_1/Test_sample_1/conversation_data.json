    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the number of carbon atoms in product 3.\n\n**Step 1: trans-cinnamaldehyde + methylmagnesium bromide → product 1**\n\n*   **trans-cinnamaldehyde (C₉H₈O):** This is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde with a phenyl group. Its structure consists of a benzene ring attached to a three-carbon aldehyde chain with a double bond (Ph-CH=CH-CHO). It has a total of 9 carbon atoms (6 in the phenyl ring and 3 in the propenal chain).\n*   **Reaction:** Methylmagnesium bromide (a Grignard reagent) reacts with the aldehyde. In this case, the methyl group attacks the carbonyl carbon (a 1,2-addition). After an acidic workup, this forms a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Product 1 (4-phenylbut-3-en-2-ol):** The resulting structure is Ph-CH=CH-CH(OH)-CH₃. One carbon atom from the methylmagnesium bromide has been added to the 9 carbons of cinnamaldehyde.\n*   **Carbon Count for Product 1:** 9 + 1 = 10 carbon atoms.\n\n**Step 2: product 1 + pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) → product 2**\n\n*   **Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC):** This is an oxidizing agent that converts secondary alcohols into ketones. It is known for being a milder oxidant that stops the oxidation at the ketone or aldehyde stage without proceeding to a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Reaction:** PCC oxidizes the secondary alcohol group (-CH(OH)-) in product 1 to a ketone group (-C(=O)-).\n*   **Product 2 (Benzalacetone or (E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one):** The structure becomes Ph-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃. This reaction is an oxidation and does not add or remove any carbon atoms.\n*   **Carbon Count for Product 2:** 10 carbon atoms.\n\n**Step 3: product 2 + (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane → product 3**\n\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent, (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane, is more commonly known as the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent (dimethylsulfoxonium ylide).\n*   **Reaction:** When the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent reacts with α,β-unsaturated ketones (like product 2), it performs a conjugate addition, adding a methylene group (–CH₂–) across the carbon-carbon double bond to form a cyclopropane ring.\n*   **Product 3 (1-(2-phenylcyclopropyl)ethan-1-one):** The reaction adds a single carbon atom (from the ylide's methylene group) to the structure of product 2, forming a three-membered ring.\n*   **Carbon Count for Product 3:** 10 + 1 = 11 carbon atoms.\n\nTherefore, product 3 has a total of 11 carbon atoms.\n\n<<<C>>>"
