    "To find the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay of a stationary pion (π⁺), we apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\nThe decay process is:\nπ⁺ → μ⁺ + ν\n\nGiven:\n*   The pion (π⁺) is stationary.\n*   Rest mass of π⁺ (m_π) = 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of μ⁺ (m_μ) = 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   The neutrino (ν) is considered massless.\n\n**1. Conservation of Energy:**\nSince the pion is at rest, its total energy is its rest mass energy. This energy is converted into the total energies of the muon (μ⁺) and the neutrino (ν).\n*   E_π = E_μ + E_ν\n*   m_πc² = (KE_μ + m_μc²) + KE_ν\n\nThe total energy released as kinetic energy (Q-value) is the difference in rest mass between the initial and final particles.\n*   Q = (m_π - m_μ)c² = KE_μ + KE_ν\n*   Q = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum:**\nThe initial momentum is zero because the pion is stationary. Therefore, the final products must have equal and opposite momenta.\n*   p_μ = p_ν = p\n\n**3. Calculation of Kinetic Energies:**\nFor a two-body decay from a stationary particle, the kinetic energy of the heavier product (the muon, KE_μ) can be calculated with the following formula derived from the conservation laws:\n\nKE_μ = (m_πc² - m_μc²)² / (2 * m_πc²)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n*   KE_μ = (139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV)² / (2 * 139.6 MeV)\n*   KE_μ = (33.9 MeV)² / (279.2 MeV)\n*   KE_μ = 1149.21 / 279.2 MeV\n*   KE_μ ≈ 4.12 MeV\n\nNow, we can find the kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_ν) using the total kinetic energy released:\n*   KE_ν = Q - KE_μ\n*   KE_ν = 33.9 MeV - 4.12 MeV\n*   KE_ν ≈ 29.78 MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon (μ⁺) and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino (ν). This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
