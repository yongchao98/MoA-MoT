    "### Breakdown of the Reaction and Stereochemistry\n\n1.  **Reactants**: The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition between 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (the diene) and maleic anhydride (the dienophile).\n2.  **Product Formation**: This [4+2] cycloaddition forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative. The reaction can produce two different stereoisomers: an *endo* and an *exo* product.\n3.  **The \"Endo Rule\"**: In most Diels-Alder reactions, the *endo* product is the major product because it is formed faster (it is the kinetic product). This preference is due to a stabilizing interaction between the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile and the developing pi system of the diene in the transition state.\n4.  **Identifying Endo vs. Exo**:\n    *   In the context of a cyclopentadiene diene, the bicyclic product has a one-carbon bridge (C7).\n    *   The **endo** product is the isomer where the anhydride ring is tucked *under* the larger six-membered ring, on the opposite side of the one-carbon bridge. This places the anhydride protons close to the vinyl methyl groups on the newly formed double bond.\n    *   The **exo** product is the isomer where the anhydride ring is on the same side as the one-carbon bridge, pointing away from the vinyl methyl groups.\n\n### Analyzing the NMR Data\n\n*   **Product Structure**: The product is 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene-5,6-dicarboxylic anhydride. Due to a plane of symmetry, the molecule has:\n    *   Two equivalent protons on the anhydride portion (H-5 and H-6).\n    *   Two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (vinyl methyls).\n    *   Two equivalent methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons (bridgehead methyls).\n\n*   **¹H NMR Signals**:\n    *   The two anhydride protons (H-5, H-6) are adjacent to carbonyl groups and are in a rigid bicyclic system. They will appear as a **2H singlet** at a chemical shift around **~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   The six protons of the two vinyl methyl groups are equivalent and will appear as a **6H singlet**. Their chemical shift is typically around **~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   The six protons of the two bridgehead methyl groups are also equivalent and will appear as another **6H singlet**, but at a more shielded (lower) chemical shift, likely around ~1.0-1.2 ppm.\n\n*   **2D NOESY Spectrum**: This technique shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (< 5 Å). The problem states a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor one. This key difference allows us to identify the major product's stereochemistry.\n    *   In the **endo (major) product**, the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm) are spatially close to the vinyl methyl groups (~1.7 ppm). Therefore, a NOESY cross-peak is expected between these two signals.\n    *   In the **exo (minor) product**, the anhydride protons are far from the vinyl methyl groups, so this cross-peak would be absent or very weak.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe cross-peak that is present in the major product and absent in the minor product connects the protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer. This corresponds to the interaction between the anhydride protons and the vinyl methyl protons.\n\nBased on the typical chemical shifts:\n*   The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** corresponds to the anhydride protons.\n*   The **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** corresponds to the vinyl methyl protons.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak in the spectrum of the major product connects these two resonances.\n\n<<<A>>>"
