    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the approximate flux ratio.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial State of the Sun\n\nThe Sun produces neutrinos through several nuclear reaction pathways:\n\n*   **The pp (proton-proton) Chain:** This is the dominant energy source in the Sun (about 99%). It has three main branches:\n    *   **pp-I:** The most common branch.\n    *   **pp-II:** This branch produces a very strong flux of mono-energetic neutrinos from the electron capture of Beryllium-7 (`7Be`). These neutrinos have a specific energy of about 862 keV.\n    *   **pp-III:** This is a rare branch that produces high-energy neutrinos from the decay of Boron-8 (`8B`). These neutrinos have a continuous energy spectrum up to about 15 MeV.\n*   **The CNO (Carbon-Nitrogen-Oxygen) Cycle:** This process contributes only about 1% of the Sun's energy but also produces neutrinos with a continuous energy spectrum.\n\n### 2. Analyzing the Hypothetical Scenario\n\nThe problem states that the **pp-III branch suddenly stops**. This has a key consequence:\n\n*   The flux of `8B` neutrinos, which are produced exclusively in the pp-III branch, drops to zero.\n\nAll other neutrino sources, including the `7Be` neutrinos (from pp-II) and the CNO neutrinos, remain unaffected. The information reaches Earth about 8.5 minutes later, which means we are observing the effects of this stoppage *now*.\n\n### 3. Examining the Neutrino Flux in Each Energy Band\n\nWe need to determine which neutrino sources contribute to the two specified energy bands *after* the `8B` neutrinos have disappeared.\n\n*   **Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n    *   `8B` neutrinos: Flux is now zero.\n    *   `7Be` neutrinos: These are at 862 keV, which is *outside* this band.\n    *   **Remaining source:** The only significant contributors left in this energy range are the neutrinos from the **CNO cycle**, which have a continuous energy spectrum that covers this band.\n\n*   **Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n    *   `8B` neutrinos: Flux is now zero.\n    *   **Dominant source:** This band contains the very intense, sharp energy line of the **`7Be` neutrinos** at 861-862 keV.\n    *   Other sources: There is also a small contribution from CNO neutrinos in this band.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Flux Ratio\n\nThe ratio we need to find is:\n\nFlux (Band 1) / Flux (Band 2)\n\nBased on our analysis:\n\n*   Flux (Band 1) ≈ Flux from CNO neutrinos in the 700-800 keV range.\n*   Flux (Band 2) ≈ Flux from the `7Be` line at 862 keV + Flux from CNO neutrinos in the 800-900 keV range.\n\nThe total flux of `7Be` neutrinos is vastly larger than the flux of CNO neutrinos within a narrow 100 keV band. Therefore, the flux in Band 2 is overwhelmingly dominated by the `7Be` neutrinos.\n\nThe ratio simplifies to approximately:\n**Ratio ≈ Flux_CNO (in a 100 keV slice) / Flux_7Be (total)**\n\nTo estimate this, we can compare the total fluxes of the parent reactions:\n*   The total flux of all CNO neutrinos is about 10% of the total flux of `7Be` neutrinos.\n*   However, the CNO flux is spread across a wide energy range (roughly 1 MeV), while the `7Be` flux is concentrated in a single energy line. We are only considering the CNO flux within a 100 keV (or 0.1 MeV) window.\n*   This window represents roughly 1/10th of the total CNO energy range (0.1 MeV / 1 MeV).\n\nTherefore, we can approximate the ratio:\n\nRatio ≈ (Total CNO Flux / 10) / (Total `7Be` Flux)\nRatio ≈ (Ratio of Total Fluxes) / 10\nRatio ≈ 0.1 / 10 = **0.01**\n\nThis means the flux in the first band is approximately 1% of the flux in the second band.\n\n<<<C>>>"
