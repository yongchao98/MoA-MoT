    "The decay of a hydrogen atom from an initial state to a final state via dipole transitions is governed by specific selection rules. For an electric dipole transition, the quantum numbers must change as follows:\n\n1.  The orbital angular momentum quantum number, *l*, must change by ±1 (Δ*l* = ±1).\n2.  The magnetic quantum number, *m*, must change by 0 or ±1 (Δ*m* = 0, ±1).\n\nThe transition from the initial state |3,0,0⟩ to the final state |1,0,0⟩ cannot occur directly in a single dipole transition because Δ*l* = 0, which violates the selection rule. Therefore, it must proceed via an intermediate state.\n\n**Step 1: Transition from |3,0,0⟩ to an intermediate state**\n\n*   **Initial state:** |*n*,*l*,*m*⟩ = |3,0,0⟩\n*   Applying the selection rule Δ*l* = ±1, the intermediate state must have *l*' = 1.\n*   Applying the selection rule Δ*m* = 0, ±1, the intermediate state can have *m*' = 0, 1, or -1.\n*   For a decay process, the principal quantum number *n* must decrease. The logical intermediate step is to *n*' = 2.\n\nThus, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩.\n\n**Step 2: Transition from the intermediate state to |1,0,0⟩**\n\nLet's check if a transition from these intermediate states to the final state |1,0,0⟩ is allowed:\n\n*   **Intermediate states:** |2,1,*m*'⟩\n*   **Final state:** |1,0,0⟩\n*   The change in *l* is Δ*l* = 0 - 1 = -1, which is allowed.\n*   The change in *m* from any of the *m*' = {0, 1, -1} to *m*'' = 0 is also allowed (Δ*m* = 0, -1, or 1).\n\nTherefore, all three decay routes are possible:\n*   |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n*   |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n*   |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Probability**\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific transition route. This corresponds to the branching ratio of the first decay step. The initial state |3,0,0⟩ is spherically symmetric. Because there is no preferred direction in space, the probability of transitioning to any of the three magnetic sublevels (*m*' = -1, 0, 1) of the |2,1⟩ state is equal.\n\nSince there are three equally probable decay channels for the first step, the probability for any single channel is 1/3.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n\n*   A) The path is correct, but the probability is 2/3. Incorrect.\n*   B) The path is correct, but the probability is 1/4. Incorrect.\n*   C) The path is $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and the probability is 1/3. Correct.\n*   D) The path is correct, but the probability is 1/4. Incorrect.\n\n<<<C>>>"
