    "An analysis of the reactions and the resulting products is required to determine the number of peaks in the chromatograms.\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. The stereocenter is at the C5 position.\n*   **Reaction:** It is treated with lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH reduces the ketone at C3 to a hydroxyl group.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting material is chiral and the reducing agent is achiral, the hydride can attack the planar carbonyl from either face. This results in the formation of two products that are diastereomers of each other:\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n\nThese two compounds are diastereomers because one stereocenter is the same (S at C5) while the other is different (R or S at C3).\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reaction:** It is treated with excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4), which reduces both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Products:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. This leads to the formation of three stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol:\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** This is a pair of enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images).\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol:** This is a meso compound. It is achiral because it has a plane of symmetry, and it is a diastereomer of the other two products.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n### **Chromatographic Separation**\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC:**\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated by normal-phase HPLC.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated by a normal-phase (achiral) column.\n\nBased on this, we can predict the number of peaks:\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, will separate into **two peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will co-elute as a **single peak**.\n*   The meso compound, (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have a different retention time, resulting in a **separate peak**.\n*   The products of Reaction I (methoxy-alcohols) and Reaction II (diols) are structurally distinct molecules with different polarities and will be separated from each other.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks in the normal-phase HPLC will be 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC:**\nChiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase that can differentiate between stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n*   It can separate diastereomers.\n*   It can separate enantiomers.\n\nTherefore, all five unique stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 1)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 2)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 3)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 4)\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 5)\n\nThis results in a total of **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<D>>>"
