    "To identify the unknown compound, a detailed analysis of the provided spectroscopic data is necessary.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** The presence of a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic indicator of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid, with the broadness resulting from hydrogen bonding. The strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also characteristic of a carboxylic acid. This confirms that the unknown compound is one of the four given carboxylic acids.\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The ¹H NMR data is crucial for distinguishing between the four possible isomers.\n    *   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to carbon-carbon double bonds, which is consistent with all four proposed structures being saturated carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This complex splitting pattern arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons. According to the n+1 rule, this proton must be adjacent to:\n        *   One proton (1+1 = 2, doublet)\n        *   A set of two protons (2+1 = 3, triplet)\n        *   A set of three protons (3+1 = 4, quartet)\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This pattern indicates a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One proton (1+1 = 2, doublet)\n        *   A set of two protons (2+1 = 3, triplet)\n        *   Another, chemically non-equivalent set of two protons (2+1 = 3, triplet)\n\n### Evaluation of Potential Structures\n\nLet's analyze the expected ¹H NMR splitting patterns for the key protons in each of the candidate molecules.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at C3 is adjacent to the proton at C2 (1H), the CH₂ group at C4 (2H), and its own methyl group (3H). This would result in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   However, no other proton in this molecule would produce a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt). The proton at C2 would be a doublet of quartets (dq). Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at C3 is adjacent to the CH₂ group at C2 (2H), the proton at C4 (1H), and its own methyl group (3H). This would give a **triplet of doublets of quartets (tdq)**, which is equivalent to a dtq.\n    *   No proton in this structure would yield a dtt signal. The proton at C4 would be split by one proton at C3, three protons from its own methyl group, and three protons from the terminal methyl group, resulting in a complex multiplet (dqq). This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at C3 is adjacent to the proton at C2 (1H), the CH₂ group of the ethyl group at C3 (2H), and the CH₂ group at C4 (2H). This would produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *   However, the proton at C2 is only split by the proton at C3 (1H) and the CH₂ of its own ethyl group (2H), resulting in a doublet of triplets (dt), not a dtq. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid):**\n    The condensed formula provided is unconventional, but its molecular formula is C₉H₁₈O₂. The structure that fits this formula and the IUPAC name 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid is the only one that matches all the NMR data.\n    *   Let's analyze the key protons in **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**:\n        `CH₃(a)-CH(b)(CH₃)-CH(c)(CH₂CH₃)-CH₂(d)-COOH`\n    *   **Proton H(c):** This proton is on C3. It is coupled to:\n        1.  The proton at C4, H(b) (1H) → **doublet**\n        2.  The methylene protons at C2, H(d) (2H) → **triplet**\n        3.  The methylene protons of its own ethyl group (2H) → **triplet**\n        This combination results in a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**, matching the second signal.\n    *   **Proton H(b):** This proton is on C4. It is coupled to:\n        1.  The proton at C3, H(c) (1H) → **doublet**\n        2.  The methylene protons of the terminal ethyl group (which is what CH₃-CH- implies) (2H) → **triplet**\n        3.  The protons of its own methyl group, H(a) (3H) → **quartet**\n        This combination results in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**, matching the first signal.\n\nThis is the only structure among the options whose predicted ¹H NMR spectrum contains both a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets.\n\n<<<C>>>"
