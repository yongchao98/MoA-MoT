    "To determine the maximum orbital period of the second planet that will exhibit both transit and occultation events, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Understand the Geometry**: For a planet to transit, its orbit must be aligned in such a way that it passes in front of its star from our point of view. The impact parameter, `b`, is the projected distance between the center of the star and the center of the planet at mid-transit, measured in units of the star's radius. Since both planets share the same orbital plane, their orbital inclination `i` relative to our line of sight is the same.\n\n2.  **Relate the Two Planets**: The impact parameter `b` is related to the semi-major axis `a`, the stellar radius `R_s`, and the orbital inclination `i` by the formula `b = (a * cos(i)) / R_s`.\n    *   For Planet 1: `b₁ = (a₁ * cos(i)) / R_s`\n    *   For Planet 2: `b₂ = (a₂ * cos(i)) / R_s`\n\n    By dividing the second equation by the first, we can establish a relationship between the two planets' orbits: `b₂ / b₁ = a₂ / a₁`.\n\n3.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law**: Kepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (`a`). For two planets orbiting the same star, this gives the relation: `(a₂ / a₁)³ = (P₂ / P₁)²,` which can be rearranged to `a₂ / a₁ = (P₂ / P₁)⅔`.\n\n4.  **Combine the Relationships**: Substituting the result from Kepler's Law into the impact parameter relation, we get: `b₂ / b₁ = (P₂ / P₁)⅔`.\n\n5.  **Determine the Maximum Period**: The maximum orbital period corresponds to the maximum possible semi-major axis for which a transit can still occur. A transit is guaranteed if the center of the planet passes in front of the stellar disk. The limiting case for this condition is when the planet's center grazes the edge of the star's disk, which corresponds to a maximum impact parameter for the second planet (`b₂_max`) of 1.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Result**: We can now solve for the maximum period of the second planet, `P₂_max`.\n    *   `1 / b₁ = (P₂_max / P₁)⅔`\n    *   `P₂_max = P₁ * (1 / b₁)³ᐟ²`\n\n    Plugging in the given values:\n    *   `P₁ = 3` days\n    *   `b₁ = 0.2`\n\n    `P₂_max = 3 * (1 / 0.2)¹·⁵`\n    `P₂_max = 3 * (5)¹·⁵`\n    `P₂_max = 3 * 11.18`\n    `P₂_max ≈ 33.54` days\n\nThe maximum orbital period for the second planet is approximately 33.5 days. This calculation assumes that for a transit to occur, the center of the planet must pass across the star's disk.\n\n<<<A>>>"
