    "In a universe with magnetic monopoles, which are isolated North or South poles, two of Maxwell's equations would be fundamentally different. These equations are Gauss's law for magnetism and Faraday's law of induction.\n\nIn our universe, Gauss's law for magnetism states that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero (∇ ⋅ B = 0). This is a mathematical expression of the observation that there are no magnetic monopoles. If magnetic monopoles existed, they would act as sources or sinks for the magnetic field, similar to how electric charges are sources and sinks for the electric field. Consequently, this law would be modified to include a term for the magnetic charge density (ρm), becoming ∇ ⋅ B = ρm (the exact constant depends on the system of units). This equation relates to the divergence of the magnetic field.\n\nThe other equation that would change is Faraday's law of induction, which in its standard form is ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t. This equation describes how a changing magnetic field creates a circulating electric field. If magnetic monopoles could move, they would constitute a \"magnetic current\" (Jm). This magnetic current would, in turn, induce a circulating electric field, adding another term to Faraday's law. The modified equation would look something like ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - Jm. The term \"circulation\" is often used to describe the curl of a vector field.\n\nTherefore, the two equations that would be different are the one related to the divergence of the magnetic field and the one related to the circulation (curl) of the electric field.\n\n<<<B>>>"
