    "### Analysis of the Chemical Structure\n\n1.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** The core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two groups attached to it.\n2.  **Total of 8 carbon atoms:** A benzene ring contains 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents together must contribute the remaining 2 carbon atoms.\n3.  **Carbonyl group (C=O) present:** The FTIR data indicates one of the substituents contains a carbonyl group.\n4.  **Aromatic-halogen bond present:** The FTIR data also indicates a halogen atom is directly bonded to the aromatic ring.\n\nBased on these facts, we can deduce the structure:\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n*   The other substituent must contain 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. The most common and stable group fitting this description is an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n\nThus, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The total number of carbons is 6 (from the benzene ring) + 2 (from the acetyl group) = 8. This matches the information provided. The general formula is C₈H₇XO.\n\n### 1H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis\n\nNow, let's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for a haloacetophenone and compare it with the given options. The two substituents can be in ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4) positions.\n\n*   **Aromatic Protons (on the benzene ring):** The pattern of these signals depends on the substitution pattern.\n    *   For a **para-substituted** ring (like 4-chloroacetophenone), the molecule has a plane of symmetry. This results in two distinct sets of aromatic protons. The two protons ortho to the acetyl group are equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the halogen are equivalent. They split each other, giving rise to two doublets. We would expect to see two signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm), each integrating to 2 hydrogens (2H).\n    *   For **ortho** or **meta** substitution, the four aromatic protons would all be chemically non-equivalent, leading to a more complex pattern of four signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to 1 hydrogen (1H).\n\n*   **Acetyl Group Protons (-COCH₃):** The methyl group (-CH₃) is attached to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, these 3 protons will appear as a singlet (s). The chemical shift for a methyl ketone is typically around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This option does not fit. It shows only one aromatic proton and has unusual signals in the 4-5 ppm range. The total proton count is 7, which is correct for C₈H₇XO, but the splitting and chemical shifts are inconsistent with a haloacetophenone structure.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Aromatic region:** `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`. This pattern of two doublets, each for two protons, is the classic signature of a para-di-substituted benzene ring. The chemical shifts are downfield, which is consistent with the electron-withdrawing effects of both the carbonyl group and the halogen.\n    *   **Aliphatic region:** `2.3 (3H, s)`. This is a singlet for three protons, which perfectly matches the methyl group of an acetyl substituent. The chemical shift is also in the expected range.\n    *   This data is fully consistent with a **para-haloacetophenone**, such as 4-chloroacetophenone or 4-bromoacetophenone. For example, the reported 1H NMR for 4-chloroacetophenone is δ 7.91 (d, 2H), 7.45 (d, 2H), 2.61 (s, 3H). The values in option B are very similar.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at `9.9 (1H, s)` is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone. If the compound were an aldehyde, the structure would have to be something like halo-phenylacetaldehyde (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO) to have 8 carbons. However, the methylene (-CH₂) and aldehyde protons should couple, resulting in triplets, not singlets.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This option lacks any signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm), which immediately disqualifies it as the compound is stated to be aromatic.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe provided information points to a para-haloacetophenone structure. The 1H NMR data in option B is the only one that correctly represents the signals expected from such a compound: two doublets in the aromatic region for a para-substituted ring and a singlet for the acetyl methyl group.\n\n<<<B>>>"
