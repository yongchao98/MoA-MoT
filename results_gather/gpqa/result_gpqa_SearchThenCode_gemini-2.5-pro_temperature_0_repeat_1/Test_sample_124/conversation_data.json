    "The problem describes a three-dimensional isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator. The energy eigenvalues for such a system are given by the formula:\n\n$E_n = (n + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega$\n\nHere, $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers representing the quantum numbers for the three Cartesian directions. The ground state corresponds to $n=0$.\n\nThe energy levels are as follows:\n*   **Ground state (n=0):** $E_0 = (0 + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega = (3/2) \\hbar \\omega$\n*   **First excited state (n=1):** $E_1 = (1 + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega = (5/2) \\hbar \\omega$\n*   **Second excited state (n=2):** $E_2 = (2 + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega = (7/2) \\hbar \\omega$\n*   **Third excited state (n=3):** $E_3 = (3 + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega = (9/2) \\hbar \\omega$\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to $n$. The formula for the degeneracy, $g_n$, is:\n\n$g_n = (n+1)(n+2)/2$\n\nFor the third excited state, we have $n=3$. Plugging this into the degeneracy formula:\n\n$g_3 = (3+1)(3+2)/2 = (4)(5)/2 = 10$\n\nTherefore, the energy of the third excited state is $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega$, and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to this energy.\n\nThis can be verified by listing the possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3:\n*   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) - **3 states**\n*   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) - **6 states**\n*   The combination (1, 1, 1) - **1 state**\n\nThe total number of states is 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\n<<<B>>>"
