    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded hydrogen atom.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated to 240°C with an excess of potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂).\n*   **Product 1 Analysis:** The product is described as a light yellow solid with an IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a ketone functional group. The ¹H NMR spectrum shows a total of 14 protons, indicating that no hydrogen atoms were lost during the reaction. The molecular formula of the product is therefore C₁₀H₁₄O.\n*   **Identification of Product 1:** The reaction of 1,3-dihalo-adamantanes with a strong base is a known method for synthesizing adamantan-2-one via rearrangement. The given IR data strongly supports the formation of a ketone. Although the provided NMR data is anomalous for adamantan-2-one, the reaction conditions and IR spectrum point convincingly to **adamantan-2-one** as Product 1. The unusual NMR data in the prompt is likely a red herring or erroneous.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (adamantan-2-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Reagents and Reaction Type:** This set of reagents is used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which converts ketones and aldehydes to their corresponding alcohols.\n*   **Identification of Product 2:** The MPV reduction of adamantan-2-one (a ketone) yields the corresponding secondary alcohol, **adamantan-2-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analysis of Reaction 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (adamantan-2-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Reagents and Reaction Type:** The sequence of ozone followed by a reductive workup (with DMS) is the classic procedure for ozonolysis, which cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds. However, Product 2, adamantan-2-ol, is a saturated alcohol and has no C=C double bonds.\n*   **Alternative Reactivity:** While not its most common application, ozone can oxidize secondary alcohols to ketones. Given the context of the problem, this is the most plausible transformation. The dimethylsulfide serves to quench any excess ozone.\n*   **Identification of Product 3:** The oxidation of adamantan-2-ol (a secondary alcohol) regenerates the ketone, **adamantan-2-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Product for Analysis:** The final product, Product 3, is adamantan-2-one.\n*   **Most Deshielded Hydrogen:** In a saturated ketone like adamantan-2-one, the most deshielded protons (those with the highest chemical shift) are the ones on the carbons alpha (adjacent) to the carbonyl group. In this case, these are the bridgehead protons at the C1 and C3 positions.\n*   **Coupling Pattern:** To determine the splitting pattern of the H1 proton, we must consider its neighboring protons. The adamantane cage is rigid, and coupling occurs over three bonds (vicinal coupling). The H1 proton is three bonds away from the protons on three different methylene (CH₂) groups: C6, C8, and C9.\n    *   Due to the molecule's symmetry, the couplings to the protons on C6 and C8 are equivalent. These four protons can be considered as two sets of two equivalent protons.\n    *   A simplified and common interpretation for the coupling in this rigid system is to consider the major interactions. The H1 proton couples to the two pairs of non-equivalent protons on the adjacent C6 and C8 bridges.\n    *   Coupling to one pair of equivalent protons would result in a triplet. Coupling to a second, non-equivalent pair of protons would split each line of that triplet into another triplet.\n*   **Conclusion:** This leads to a theoretical splitting pattern of a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
