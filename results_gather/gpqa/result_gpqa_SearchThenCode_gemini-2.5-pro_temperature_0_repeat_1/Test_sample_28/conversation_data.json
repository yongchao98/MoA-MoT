    "To determine which mutation will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to analyze the effect of each mutation on the gene's ability to produce a functional protein. The goal is to find a mutation that would lead to a non-functional or truncated protein.\n\nThe original gene sequence is read in triplets, called codons, starting from the 'ATG' start codon. Each codon corresponds to a specific amino acid that builds the protein. The sequence ends with 'TGA', a stop codon that terminates protein synthesis.\n\n**Intact Gene Sequence Analysis:**\nLet's break down the beginning of the intact gene's coding sequence into codons:\n5’- **ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT** ... TGA-3’\n- **ATG**: Start codon (Methionine)\n- **TTT**: Phenylalanine\n- **CTC**: Leucine\n- **GCT**: Alanine\n- **GGT**: Glycine\n- **ACT**: Threonine\n\nNow, let's analyze each mutant by comparing it to the intact sequence to see how the change affects the resulting protein.\n\n**Mutant 1:**\n- Sequence: 5’-ATGTT**C**TA**C**GCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\n- Codon change: The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n- Mutation type: This is a **missense mutation**, where one amino acid is replaced by another. While this change could potentially alter the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely. The rest of the protein would be synthesized normally.\n\n**Mutant 2:**\n- Sequence: 5’-ATGTT**C**TAA**GCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\n- Codon change: The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`.\n- Mutation type: This is a **nonsense mutation**. The codon `TAA` is one of the three stop codons (along with TAG and TGA). Introducing a stop codon early in the gene sequence causes protein synthesis to terminate prematurely. This results in a severely shortened, truncated protein that is almost certain to be non-functional. This is the most likely mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n**Mutant 3:**\n- Sequence: 5’-ATGTTT**TACGCTGGTGTCACTTCT**GTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n- Analysis: This sequence shows multiple changes compared to the intact gene. For instance, `CTC` becomes `TAC` (a missense mutation), and `ACT` becomes `GTC` (another missense mutation). It's less likely that multiple independent mutations would occur so close together. If this represents a **frameshift mutation** (an insertion or deletion of nucleotides not divisible by three), it would alter the entire reading frame from the point of the mutation, leading to a completely different and likely non-functional protein. However, the change presented is not a clear single frameshift.\n\n**Mutant 4:**\n- Sequence: 5’-ATGTTT**TACGCT**ACTTCT**GTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n- Analysis: This appears to involve a change from `CTC` to `TAC` (a missense mutation) and the deletion of the `GGT` codon. Deleting a full codon is an **in-frame deletion**. This removes one amino acid from the protein but does not change the reading frame for the rest of the sequence. While this could affect the protein's function, it is generally less disruptive than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nComparing the four options, the nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most definitive and severe. It introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the gene (the third codon), ensuring that only a tiny, non-functional protein fragment is produced. This is the most reliable way to eliminate the function of the gene and, therefore, the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<C>>>"
