    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation.** The reaction of (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene) with mCPBA results in a *syn*-addition of the oxygen atom. This forms a trans-epoxide. Because the attack can occur from either face of the alkene, a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane, is produced.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening.** The subsequent treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) opens the epoxide ring. This is an *anti*-addition process (specifically, an Sₙ2-type attack by water).\n    *   The attack of water on the (4R,5R)-epoxide results in the (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The attack of water on the (4S,5S)-epoxide results in the (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 1.** The two products, (4R,5S) and (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol, are actually the same molecule. This compound has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a *meso* compound. Thus, Reaction 1 produces a single, achiral product.\n\n### **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation.** The reaction of (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene) with mCPBA is also a *syn*-addition. This forms a cis-epoxide, which is a meso compound: (4R,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening.** The acid-catalyzed ring-opening proceeds via *anti*-addition.\n    *   Attack of water at one carbon of the meso-epoxide yields (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon yields (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 2.** These two products are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, meaning they are a pair of enantiomers. Reaction 2 produces a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n*   The meso-diol from Reaction 1.\n*   The pair of enantiomeric diols from Reaction 2.\n\n### **Chromatographic Analysis**\n\nThe chemist analyzes this three-component mixture using two types of HPLC.\n\n1.  **Standard (Achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated; they will elute as a single peak.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated by standard HPLC.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **two peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the co-eluting pair of enantiomers.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This method uses a chiral stationary phase, which interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The two enantiomers from Reaction 2 will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n    *   The meso compound from Reaction 1 is achiral and will also be separated from the two enantiomers, eluting as its own distinct peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **three peaks**: one for the meso compound, and one for each of the two enantiomers.\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<B>>>"
