    "To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the wavelength of the emitted light.**\n    The energy (E) of the emitted light is given as 2.3393 eV. The relationship between energy in electronvolts (eV) and wavelength (λ) in nanometers (nm) is approximated by the formula:\n    λ ≈ 1240 / E\n\n    Plugging in the given energy:\n    λ ≈ 1240 / 2.3393 eV ≈ 530 nm.\n\n2.  **Identify the color of the emitted light.**\n    A wavelength of approximately 530 nm corresponds to green light in the visible spectrum.\n\n3.  **Determine the color of the absorbed light.**\n    The phenomenon described, where a substance absorbs light and then emits light of a different color, is fluorescence. A fundamental principle of fluorescence is the Stokes shift, which states that the emitted light always has a lower energy and therefore a longer wavelength than the absorbed light. This is because some of the absorbed energy is lost as heat before the light is re-emitted.\n\n    Therefore, the absorbed light must have a wavelength shorter than the emitted wavelength of 530 nm.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the options.**\n    *   A) Violet: Wavelength is approximately 380–450 nm.\n    *   B) Blue: Wavelength is approximately 450–495 nm.\n    *   C) Red: Wavelength is approximately 620–750 nm.\n    *   D) Yellow: Wavelength is approximately 570–590 nm.\n\n    Based on the Stokes shift principle, the absorbed wavelength must be less than 530 nm. This eliminates Red and Yellow as possibilities. Both Violet and Blue light have shorter wavelengths and higher energies than the emitted green light.\n\n    In fluorescent dyes, the absorption and emission spectra are often close to each other. A dye that emits green light (around 530 nm) typically has its maximum absorption in the adjacent, higher-energy region of the spectrum, which is blue light. For example, the common fluorescent dye fluorescein absorbs blue light (at ~494 nm) and emits green light (at ~521 nm). Therefore, blue is the most plausible color of light absorbed by the compound.\n\n<<<B>>>"
