    "Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the principle:** Radioactive decay is a random process that follows an exponential law. A key feature of this process is that it is \"memoryless.\" This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. The fact that the atom has survived for 50 minutes does not change its intrinsic decay probability.\n\n2.  **Define the decay probability:** The probability `P(t)` that an atom decays within a time `t` is given by the formula:\n    `P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n    where `λ` is the decay constant and `e` is the base of the natural logarithm. The probability of survival is `S(t) = e^(-λt)`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the decay constant (λ):** We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    *   `0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)`\n    *   `e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\n4.  **Calculate the new probability:** We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. Because of the memoryless property, this is equivalent to finding the probability that a fresh atom would decay in 150 minutes.\n    *   `P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n    *   We can rewrite `e^(-150λ)` as `(e^(-100λ))^(1.5)`.\n    *   From step 3, we know `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`.\n    *   So, `e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5`\n    *   `(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.56`\n    *   Now, substitute this back into the probability formula:\n    *   `P(150) = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is 0.44, or 44%.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
