    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the relationship between the number of stars per unit range of parallax and the parallax itself, assuming a uniform distribution of stars in the sky.\n\n1.  **Relationship between Distance and Parallax:** The distance to a star (`d`) is inversely proportional to its parallax (`plx`). This fundamental relationship in astronomy is expressed as:\n    `d ∝ 1/plx`\n\n2.  **Uniform Star Distribution:** The assumption of a uniform distribution means that the density of stars (`ρ`) is constant everywhere in space.\n\n3.  **Number of Stars in a Given Volume:** For a uniform distribution, the number of stars (`N`) in a given volume (`V`) is directly proportional to that volume. If we consider a sphere of radius `d` centered on the observer, the volume is `V = (4/3)πd³`. Therefore, the number of stars within this distance `d` is:\n    `N(d) = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πd³`\n    This shows that the total number of stars up to a distance `d` is proportional to `d³`.\n\n4.  **Number of Stars in a Thin Shell:** To find how the number of stars changes with distance, we can consider a thin spherical shell at a distance `d` with a small thickness `dd`. The volume of this shell (`dV`) is its surface area (`4πd²`) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`):\n    `dV = 4πd² dd`\n    The number of stars (`dN`) in this thin shell is:\n    `dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² dd`\n    From this, we can see that the number of stars per unit distance range (`dN/dd`) is proportional to `d²`.\n\n5.  **Expressing the Relationship in Terms of Parallax:** Our goal is to find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/d(plx)`. We can use the chain rule for derivatives:\n    `dN/d(plx) = (dN/dd) * (dd/d(plx))`\n\n    We already know that `dN/dd ∝ d²`. Since `d ∝ 1/plx`, it follows that `dN/dd ∝ (1/plx)² = 1/plx²`.\n\n    Next, we need to find the derivative of the distance with respect to parallax, `dd/d(plx)`. Starting from `d = 1/plx`:\n    `dd/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n    Since we are interested in the number of stars, we consider the magnitude of this change, so `|dd/d(plx)| = 1/plx²`.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** Now we can combine these proportionalities:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) = 1/plx⁴`\n\nTherefore, for a uniform distribution of stars, the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the inverse fourth power of the parallax.\n\n<<<C>>>"
