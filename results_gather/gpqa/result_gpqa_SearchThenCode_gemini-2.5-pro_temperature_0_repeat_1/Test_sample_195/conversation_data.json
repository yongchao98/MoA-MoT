    "The search results confirm that the problem of the relativistic harmonic oscillator is a well-studied topic. The key physical principle to use is the relativistic work-energy theorem. This theorem states that the work done on a particle is equal to the change in its relativistic kinetic energy.\n\nMy derivation followed this principle:\n1.  **Work Done:** The work done by the spring force `F = -kx` in moving the mass from its maximum amplitude `x = A` to the equilibrium position `x = 0` is `W = ∫_A^0 (-kx) dx = (1/2)kA^2`.\n2.  **Change in Relativistic Kinetic Energy:** The relativistic kinetic energy is `K = (γ - 1)mc^2`, where `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`.\n    *   At `x = A`, the velocity `v = 0`, so the initial kinetic energy `K_i = 0`.\n    *   At `x = 0`, the velocity is maximum, `v = v_max`, so the final kinetic energy is `K_f = (γ_max - 1)mc^2`.\n3.  **Applying the Work-Energy Theorem:** `W = K_f - K_i`\n    `(1/2)kA^2 = (γ_max - 1)mc^2`\n\nThis leads to:\n`γ_max = 1 + (kA^2) / (2mc^2)`\n\nSubstituting the expression for `γ_max`:\n`1 / sqrt(1 - v_max^2/c^2) = 1 + (kA^2) / (2mc^2)`\n\nSolving for `v_max`:\n`sqrt(1 - v_max^2/c^2) = 1 / (1 + (kA^2) / (2mc^2))`\n`1 - v_max^2/c^2 = 1 / (1 + (kA^2) / (2mc^2))^2`\n`v_max^2/c^2 = 1 - 1 / (1 + (kA^2) / (2mc^2))^2`\n`v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1 / (1 + (kA^2) / (2mc^2))^2)`\n\nThis derivation is consistent with the principles described in the search results. The result matches option B.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) `v > c`, impossible.\nB) `v < c`, physically possible. Matches derivation.\nC) Classical result, incorrect for relativistic case.\nD) `v > c`, impossible.\n\nThe derivation is sound and confirmed by the literature. The answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
