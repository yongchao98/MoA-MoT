    "The experiment described tracks the immune response to an orally delivered viral protein. Here's a breakdown of the events and why one process is the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Antigen Delivery and Targeting:** The GFP-tagged rotavirus proteins are delivered orally. They travel through the stomach and intestines, where some are lost, but a portion successfully reaches the Peyer's patches. Peyer's patches are key immune surveillance sites in the small intestine, designed to sample antigens from the gut.\n2.  **Immune Activation in Peyer's Patches:** The fluorescent signal in the Peyer's patches indicates the antigen has been taken up. Peyer's patches contain lymphoid follicles, which are structures where B cells and T cells are activated. The presence of a \"proliferating cell population\" points to the clonal expansion of lymphocytes that have recognized the antigen.\n3.  **B Cell Response and Gene Sequencing:** The experiment specifically isolates proliferating cells and sequences their *variable heavy chain gene*. This gene is a component of the B cell receptor (and the antibodies it will produce).\n4.  **High Variability in the Variable Region:** The key finding is \"high variability\" in this specific gene region. This points directly to a process that introduces mutations into the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes *after* an initial antigen encounter.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\n*   **A) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a process that occurs in activated B cells within specialized structures called germinal centers, which are found in Peyer's patches. SHM introduces a high rate of point mutations specifically into the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes. The purpose is to generate B cell receptors with higher affinity for the antigen. This perfectly matches the observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating B cells in a Peyer's patch following antigen stimulation.\n*   **B) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that initially creates the diverse repertoire of B cell receptors, but it occurs in the bone marrow during B cell development, *before* they encounter an antigen. While it generates diversity, it is not the process causing high variability in an already-activated, proliferating B cell population in a secondary lymphoid organ.\n*   **C) Complement activation:** This is a system of proteins in the blood that helps to clear pathogens. It is part of the broader immune response but does not involve the genetic mutation of B cell genes.\n*   **D) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process also occurs in activated B cells in germinal centers, often at the same time as SHM. However, CSR changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain gene, which alters the antibody's function (e.g., switching from IgM to IgA), not its antigen-binding specificity. The experiment specifically found variability in the *variable* region, making SHM the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the high variability observed in the variable heavy chain gene is a direct result of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
