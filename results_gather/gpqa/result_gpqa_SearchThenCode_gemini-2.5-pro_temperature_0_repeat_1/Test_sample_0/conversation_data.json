    "To clearly distinguish between two quantum energy levels, their energy difference must be greater than the energy uncertainty, or \"width,\" of each level. This is a direct consequence of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\nThe uncertainty in the energy (ΔE) of a quantum state is inversely related to its lifetime (Δt) by the formula:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / Δt\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately equal to 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s. A shorter lifetime leads to a larger uncertainty in the energy of the state.\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy uncertainty for each of the two states:\n\n*   **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime (Δt₁) = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty (ΔE₁) ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime (Δt₂) = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty (ΔE₂) ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nTo be clearly resolved, the energy difference between the two levels (|E₁ - E₂|) must be significantly larger than the energy widths of the states. The larger of the two uncertainties is ΔE₁, which is approximately 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Therefore, the energy difference must be greater than this value.\n\nNow, let's examine the given options:\n\n*   **A) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This value is much larger than the calculated energy uncertainty of ~10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   **B) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This is significantly smaller than the energy uncertainty.\n*   **C) 10⁻⁹ eV:** This is smaller than the energy uncertainty.\n*   **D) 10⁻⁸ eV:** This is also smaller than the energy uncertainty.\n\nOnly an energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is substantially larger than the energy broadening of the levels, allowing them to be clearly distinguished.\n\n<<<A>>>"
