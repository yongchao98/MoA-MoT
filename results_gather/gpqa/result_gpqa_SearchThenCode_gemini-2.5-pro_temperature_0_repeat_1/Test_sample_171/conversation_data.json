    "The problem requires the application of the Boltzmann equation, which describes the relative populations of atomic energy levels in a gas in thermal equilibrium. The assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) allows us to use this equation for stellar photospheres.\n\nThe Boltzmann equation is given by:\n\nN_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-(E_b - E_a) / (k * T)]\n\nWhere:\n*   N_b and N_a are the number of atoms in the excited state and a lower energy state, respectively.\n*   g_b and g_a are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of these energy levels.\n*   E_b - E_a is the energy difference between the levels, denoted as ΔE.\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nLet the excitation ratio for a given star be X = N_b / N_a. We can write this equation for each star:\n\nFor star 1 (temperature T_1):\nX_1 = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n\nFor star 2 (temperature T_2):\nX_2 = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nThe problem states that the excitation in star 1 is twice that in star 2, so X_1 = 2 * X_2.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for X_1 and X_2:\n\n(g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nThe term for the statistical weights (g_b / g_a) is the same for the same energy levels of the same atomic species (iron) and thus cancels out:\n\nexp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nTo solve for the temperatures, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nexp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] / exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] = 2\n\nUsing the property of exponents e^a / e^b = e^(a-b):\n\nexp[(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_2))] = 2\nexp[(ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)] = 2\n\nTaking the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\n(ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n\nNow, we combine the terms in the parenthesis:\n\n(1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\n\nSubstituting this back into our equation gives:\n\n(ΔE / k) * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)] = ln(2)\n\nThe problem provides the energy difference ΔE as approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. The Boltzmann constant, k, has a value of approximately 1.380649 × 10⁻²³ J/K. Therefore, the ratio ΔE / k is approximately 1.\n\nSubstituting ΔE / k ≈ 1 into the equation:\n\n1 * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)] = ln(2)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
