    "The step-by-step synthesis of the final product is as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Nitration of Benzene**\nBenzene is treated with a mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO₃) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction known as nitration. The reaction introduces a nitro group (-NO₂) onto the benzene ring, forming **nitrobenzene** (Product 1).\n\n**Step 2: Bromination of Nitrobenzene**\nProduct 1, nitrobenzene, is treated with bromine (Br₂) and iron powder (Fe), which acts as a Lewis acid catalyst. The nitro group is a deactivating and meta-directing group. Therefore, the incoming bromine atom is directed to the position meta (position 3) to the nitro group. This results in the formation of **1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene** (Product 2).\n\n**Step 3: Reduction of the Nitro Group**\nProduct 2 is then stirred with Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂). This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction that selectively reduces the nitro group (-NO₂) to an amino group (-NH₂). The bromo group remains unchanged under these conditions. The resulting compound is **3-bromoaniline** (Product 3).\n\n**Step 4: Diazotization**\nProduct 3, 3-bromoaniline, is treated with sodium nitrite (NaNO₂) and tetrafluoroboric acid (HBF₄). This is a diazotization reaction, where the primary aromatic amine is converted into a diazonium salt. The product is **3-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate** (Product 4).\n\n**Step 5: Gomberg-Bachmann Reaction**\nProduct 4 is heated and then treated with anisole (methoxybenzene). This reaction is a Gomberg-Bachmann reaction, which involves the coupling of two aryl groups via a diazonium salt. Heating the diazonium salt generates a 3-bromophenyl radical. This radical then attacks the anisole molecule. The methoxy group (-OCH₃) on anisole is an ortho, para-director. Due to less steric hindrance, the para-position is the preferred site of attack. The coupling at the para-position results in the final product, **3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl** (Product 5).\n\nTherefore, the correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
