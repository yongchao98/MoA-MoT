    "The search results confirm the procedure I outlined. Here's a summary of the key principles from the search results that apply to this problem:\n\n1.  **Measurement Outcomes and Eigenvalues**: The only possible result of a measurement is an eigenvalue of the operator corresponding to the physical quantity being measured.\n2.  **Probability of Measurement**: The probability of obtaining a specific eigenvalue is the squared magnitude of the projection of the system's state vector onto the corresponding eigenvector. This is often expressed as `p(a_n) = |<n|ψ>|^2`, where `|n>` is the eigenvector for eigenvalue `a_n` and `|ψ>` is the state of the system.\n3.  **State Collapse**: After a measurement, the system's state \"collapses\" to the eigenvector corresponding to the measured eigenvalue. The new state is the normalized eigenvector associated with the measurement outcome.\n4.  **Sequential Measurements**: For a sequence of measurements, the probability of the entire sequence is the product of the probabilities of each step. The probability of a later measurement depends on the collapsed state from the previous measurement.\n\nMy step-by-step calculation followed these principles exactly.\n\n*   **Step 1 & 2**: Normalize the initial state `|ψ⟩ = (-1, 2, 1)`.\n    *   `||ψ||² = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 6`.\n    *   Normalized state `|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * (-1, 2, 1)`.\n\n*   **Step 3 & 4**: Find the eigenvector of P for the eigenvalue 0.\n    *   Eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, -1.\n    *   The normalized eigenvector for eigenvalue `λ_P = 0` is `|v_P=0⟩ = (1/√2) * (-1, 0, 1)`.\n\n*   **Step 5**: Calculate the probability of measuring P=0.\n    *   `Prob(P=0) = |⟨v_P=0|ψ_norm⟩|²`.\n    *   `⟨v_P=0|ψ_norm⟩ = [(1/√2) * (-1, 0, 1)] ⋅ [(1/√6) * (-1, 2, 1)] = (1/√12) * (1 + 0 + 1) = 2/√12 = 1/√3`.\n    *   `Prob(P=0) = (1/√3)² = 1/3`.\n\n*   **Step 6**: The state collapses to the eigenvector of P=0.\n    *   New state `|ψ'⟩ = |v_P=0⟩ = (1/√2) * (-1, 0, 1)`.\n\n*   **Step 7**: Find the eigenvector of Q for the eigenvalue -1.\n    *   Eigenvalues of Q are 1, 0, -1.\n    *   The eigenvector for `λ_Q = -1` is `|v_Q=-1⟩ = (0, 0, 1)`.\n\n*   **Step 8**: Calculate the probability of measuring Q=-1 in the new state `|ψ'⟩`.\n    *   `Prob(Q=-1 after P=0) = |⟨v_Q=-1|ψ'⟩|²`.\n    *   `⟨v_Q=-1|ψ'⟩ = [(0, 0, 1)] ⋅ [(1/√2) * (-1, 0, 1)] = 1/√2`.\n    *   `Prob(Q=-1 after P=0) = (1/√2)² = 1/2`.\n\n*   **Step 9**: Calculate the total probability.\n    *   `Total Prob = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 after P=0) = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`.\n\nThe calculation is robust and confirmed by the principles found in the search results. The final answer is 1/6.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) 2/3\nB) 1/6\nC) 1/2\nD) 1/3\n\nMy calculated answer matches option B.\n\nTo solve this problem, we must follow the principles of quantum mechanics for sequential measurements.\n\n**Step 1: Normalize the initial state vector**\n\nThe initial state of the system is given by the column matrix `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]ᵀ`.\nFirst, we need to normalize this state vector. The squared norm is:\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\nThe normalization constant is `1/√6`.\nThe normalized state vector is `|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]ᵀ`.\n\n**Step 2: Find the eigenvector of operator P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0**\n\nThe operator P is given by the matrix:\n`P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\nWe need to find the eigenvalues (λ) of P by solving the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`.\n`det([[ -λ, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, -λ, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, -λ]]) = -λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = -λ³ + λ = λ(1 - λ²) = 0`\nThe eigenvalues of P are `λ = 0, 1, -1`.\n\nWe are interested in the outcome P=0. We need to find the eigenvector `|v_P=0⟩` corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ = 0`.\n`P|v⟩ = 0|v⟩`\n`[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [x, y, z]ᵀ = [0, 0, 0]ᵀ`\nThis gives the equations:\n1.  `y/√2 = 0  => y = 0`\n2.  `x/√2 + z/√2 = 0 => x = -z`\nAn unnormalized eigenvector is `[-1, 0, 1]ᵀ`.\nNormalizing this eigenvector: `√((-1)² + 0² + 1²) = √2`.\nThe normalized eigenvector for P=0 is `|v_P=0⟩ = (1/√2) * [-1, 0, 1]ᵀ`.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the probability of measuring P=0**\n\nThe probability of measuring the eigenvalue 0 for the observable P is the squared magnitude of the projection of the initial state onto the corresponding eigenvector.\n`Prob(P=0) = |⟨v_P=0|ψ_norm⟩|²`\n`⟨v_P=0|ψ_norm⟩ = [(1/√2) * [-1, 0, 1]] ⋅ [(1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]]`\n`= (1/√12) * ((-1)*(-1) + 0*2 + 1*1) = 2/√12 = 1/√3`\n`Prob(P=0) = (1/√3)² = 1/3`.\n\n**Step 4: State collapse after the first measurement**\n\nAfter measuring P=0, the state of the system collapses to the corresponding normalized eigenvector.\nThe new state of the system is `|ψ'⟩ = |v_P=0⟩ = (1/√2) * [-1, 0, 1]ᵀ`.\n\n**Step 5: Find the eigenvector of operator Q corresponding to the eigenvalue -1**\n\nThe operator Q is given by the matrix:\n`Q = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`\nSince Q is a diagonal matrix, its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements: `λ = 1, 0, -1`. The corresponding eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.\nThe eigenvector for the eigenvalue `λ = -1` is `|v_Q=-1⟩ = [0, 0, 1]ᵀ`. This vector is already normalized.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the probability of measuring Q=-1 in the new state**\n\nThe probability of measuring the eigenvalue -1 for the observable Q in the new state `|ψ'⟩` is:\n`Prob(Q=-1 after P=0) = |⟨v_Q=-1|ψ'⟩|²`\n`⟨v_Q=-1|ψ'⟩ = [[0, 0, 1]] ⋅ [(1/√2) * [-1, 0, 1]ᵀ]`\n`= (1/√2) * (0*(-1) + 0*0 + 1*1) = 1/√2`\n`Prob(Q=-1 after P=0) = (1/√2)² = 1/2`.\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the total probability**\n\nThe probability of the sequence of events (measuring P=0 and then measuring Q=-1) is the product of the individual probabilities.\n`Total Probability = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 after P=0)`\n`Total Probability = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`.\n\nThe final answer is 1/6.\n\nFinal Answer is B.\n<<<B>>>The final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."
