    "To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we can follow these steps:\n\n**1. Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is related to its distance from the host star. For planets orbiting the same star, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis (a) of the orbit, assuming the planets have the same albedo. The problem states the albedo is the same for all three planets.\n\nThis relationship can be expressed as:\nT_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n\nTherefore, the semi-major axis is related to the equilibrium temperature as:\na ∝ 1 / T_eq²\n\n**2. Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**\n\nWe are given the ratios of the equilibrium temperatures:\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 1.4\n*   T_eq2 / T_eq3 ≈ 2.3\n\nUsing the relationship from step 1, we can find the ratios of the semi-major axes:\n*   a2 / a1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2)² = 1.4² = 1.96\n*   a3 / a2 = (T_eq2 / T_eq3)² = 2.3² = 5.29\n\nTo find the ratio of the semi-major axis of Planet3 to Planet1 (a3 / a1), we multiply these two ratios:\na3 / a1 = (a3 / a2) * (a2 / a1) = 5.29 * 1.96 ≈ 10.37\n\n**3. Apply Kepler's Third Law**\n\nKepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a).\n\nThis can be written as:\nP² ∝ a³ or P ∝ a^(3/2)\n\n**4. Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods**\n\nUsing the relationship from Kepler's Third Law and the ratio of the semi-major axes calculated in step 2, we can find the ratio of the orbital periods (P3 / P1):\n\nP3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2)\nP3 / P1 = (10.37)^(3/2)\nP3 / P1 ≈ 33.4\n\n**Alternative Method**\n\nWe can also establish a direct relationship between the orbital period (P) and the equilibrium temperature (T_eq):\n*   From step 1: a ∝ T_eq⁻²\n*   From step 3: P ∝ a^(3/2)\n\nCombining these, we get:\nP ∝ (T_eq⁻²)^(3/2) = T_eq⁻³\n\nThis means the orbital period is inversely proportional to the cube of the equilibrium temperature. So, the ratio of the periods is:\nP3 / P1 = (T_eq3 / T_eq1)⁻³ = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)³\n\nFirst, we find the temperature ratio T_eq1 / T_eq3:\nT_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3) = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22\n\nNow, we cube this value to find the period ratio:\nP3 / P1 = (3.22)³ ≈ 33.4\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The information regarding the planets' masses and the TTV discovery method is not necessary for this calculation, as the planetary masses are assumed to be negligible compared to the star's mass, which is a standard practice in such problems.\n\nThe orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of approximately 33.4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
