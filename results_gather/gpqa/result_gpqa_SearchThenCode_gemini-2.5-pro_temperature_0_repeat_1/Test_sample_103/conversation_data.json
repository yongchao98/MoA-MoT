    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relating Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity:** The periodic shift in the spectral line (Δλ) is caused by the star's motion as it orbits the common center of mass with the planet. This motion, projected along our line of sight, is the radial velocity (RV). The amplitude of the RV, denoted as K, is directly proportional to the maximum observed wavelength shift (Δλ_max).\n    *   K ∝ Δλ_max\n\n    Therefore, the ratio of the RV amplitudes of the two stars is:\n    *   K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 miliangstrom / 5 miliangstrom = 1.4\n\n2.  **The Radial Velocity Amplitude Formula:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is given by the formula:\n    *   K ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))\n    *   Where:\n        *   P is the orbital period.\n        *   mₚ is the planet's mass.\n        *   M_star is the star's mass.\n        *   i is the inclination of the orbit.\n        *   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n3.  **Applying the Given Information:** The problem states that:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: M_star₁ = M_star₂.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: In the context of the RV method, this implies that the measured minimum mass, mₚ sin(i), is approximately the same for both planets. So, (mₚ sin(i))₁ ≈ (mₚ sin(i))₂.\n\n    Because M_star and mₚ sin(i) are the same for both systems, they can be treated as constants in the comparison. The formula simplifies to a proportionality between K and the orbital period P:\n    *   K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3) or K ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n4.  **Calculating the Period Ratio:** We can now set up a ratio between the two systems:\n    *   K₂ / K₁ = (P₂)^(-1/3) / (P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    We want to find the ratio P₂ / P₁, so we can invert the equation:\n    *   K₁ / K₂ = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Substitute the known values for the RV amplitudes (or the wavelength shifts):\n    *   5 / 7 = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n\n    To solve for P₂ / P₁, we cube both sides of the equation:\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343\n    *   P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\nThe orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
