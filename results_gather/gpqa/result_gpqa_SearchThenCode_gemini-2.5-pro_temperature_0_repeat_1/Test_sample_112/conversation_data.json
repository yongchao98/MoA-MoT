    "To identify the unknown compound, the data from each characterization technique must be analyzed.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The significant broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between molecules.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch (1650-1750 cm⁻¹). Specifically, a C=O stretch for a carboxylic acid dimer is often seen around 1710 cm⁻¹.\n    *   Another strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens (protons attached to a C=C double bond) confirms the presence of an alkene functional group. These protons typically resonate in the 4.6-5.9 ppm range.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a strong indicator of a carboxylic acid. This fragment corresponds to the [COOH]⁺ cation.\n\n### Integration of Data and Formula Determination:\n\n1.  The combined FTIR and mass spectrometry data strongly suggest the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This functional group contains two oxygen atoms, which eliminates the possibilities of C6H12O and C6H10O.\n\n2.  The remaining options are C6H10O2 and C6H12O2.\n\n3.  The FTIR and ¹H NMR data both confirm the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n\n4.  To determine the correct formula, we can calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) for the remaining options. The DoU represents the total number of rings and/or π bonds in a molecule. The formula for the degree of unsaturation is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n    *   **For C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n    *   **For C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n\n5.  The presence of a carboxylic acid (with one C=O double bond) accounts for one degree of unsaturation. The presence of a C=C double bond accounts for a second degree of unsaturation. Therefore, the molecule must have a total of two degrees of unsaturation.\n\n6.  The calculated DoU of 2 for the formula C6H10O2 is consistent with all the provided spectral data (one C=O bond and one C=C bond). The DoU of 1 for C6H12O2 only accounts for the carboxylic acid and not the additional C=C bond.\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemical formula of the unknown compound is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
