    "To determine how many of the listed stars would be detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we must evaluate two criteria for each star:\n1.  **Visibility**: The star must be observable from the Paranal Observatory in Chile.\n2.  **Brightness**: The star must be bright enough to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 in a one-hour exposure.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine ESPRESSO's Detection Limit**\n\nThe problem specifies that ESPRESSO is coupled with one of the 8m VLT telescopes (1-UT mode). According to documentation for ESPRESSO, in this 1-UT mode, a signal-to-noise ratio of 10 can be achieved for a star with an apparent visual magnitude (V) of 17.1 in a total exposure time of one hour (e.g., three 20-minute exposures). Therefore, any star with an apparent magnitude of **V ≤ 17.1** is considered detectable.\n\n### **Step 2: Check Visibility from Paranal Observatory**\n\nParanal Observatory is located at a latitude of approximately 24.6° South. This location restricts which parts of the sky can be observed. A star's visibility is determined by its declination (DEC). Stars with a very high northern declination are not visible from the Southern Hemisphere. The theoretical limit for observation at Paranal is a declination below approximately +65°.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Each Star**\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Visibility**: Canopus has a declination of about -52° 41'. As a southern star, it is perfectly visible from Paranal.\n*   **Brightness**: Its apparent visual magnitude is approximately -0.74, making it the second brightest star in the night sky.\n*   **Conclusion**: Since -0.74 is much brighter than the limit of 17.1, **Canopus is detectable**.\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Visibility**: Polaris, the North Star, has a declination of about +89° 15'. This is far above the visibility limit of ~+65° for Paranal.\n*   **Brightness**: Its apparent magnitude is around 1.98.\n*   **Conclusion**: Despite being bright enough, Polaris is not visible from the VLT's location. Therefore, **Polaris is not detectable**.\n\n**c) Star with Mv = 15 at 10 pc**\n*   **Visibility**: The star's declination is given as 0°, which is on the celestial equator and easily observable from Paranal.\n*   **Brightness**: We calculate the apparent magnitude (mv) using the absolute magnitude (Mv = 15) and distance (d = 10 pc) with the distance modulus formula: `mv = Mv + 5 * log10(d) - 5`.\n    *   `mv = 15 + 5 * log10(10) - 5`\n    *   `mv = 15 + 5 * 1 - 5 = 15`\n*   **Conclusion**: An apparent magnitude of 15 is brighter than the 17.1 limit. **This star is detectable**.\n\n**d) Star with Mv = 15 at 200 pc**\n*   **Visibility**: The declination is 0°, so it is visible.\n*   **Brightness**: We calculate the apparent magnitude:\n    *   `mv = 15 + 5 * log10(200) - 5`\n    *   `mv = 15 + 5 * (2.30) - 5`\n    *   `mv = 15 + 11.5 - 5 = 21.5`\n*   **Conclusion**: An apparent magnitude of 21.5 is much fainter than the 17.1 limit. **This star is not detectable**.\n\n**e) Star with Mv = 15 at 5 pc**\n*   **Visibility**: The declination is 0°, so it is visible.\n*   **Brightness**: We calculate the apparent magnitude:\n    *   `mv = 15 + 5 * log10(5) - 5`\n    *   `mv = 15 + 5 * (0.70) - 5`\n    *   `mv = 15 + 3.5 - 5 = 13.5`\n*   **Conclusion**: An apparent magnitude of 13.5 is brighter than the 17.1 limit. **This star is detectable**.\n\n**f) Star with Mv = 15 at 50 pc**\n*   **Visibility**: The declination is 0°, so it is visible.\n*   **Brightness**: We calculate the apparent magnitude:\n    *   `mv = 15 + 5 * log10(50) - 5`\n    *   `mv = 15 + 5 * (1.70) - 5`\n    *   `mv = 15 + 8.5 - 5 = 18.5`\n*   **Conclusion**: An apparent magnitude of 18.5 is fainter than the 17.1 limit. **This star is not detectable**.\n\n### **Final Count**\n\nThe stars that are detectable by ESPRESSO under the given conditions are:\n1.  Canopus\n2.  Star with Mv = 15 at 10 pc\n3.  Star with Mv = 15 at 5 pc\n\nIn total, 3 of the listed stars are detectable.\n\n<<<A>>>"
