    "To solve this problem, we will perform a step-by-step calculation to determine the required volume of acid and the final pH of the solution.\n\n### Calculation Steps:\n\n1.  **Determine the moles of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃.**\n    First, we need the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃. The molar mass is approximately 106.87 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass\n    *   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol ≈ 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n\n2.  **Write the reaction for dissolution in acid.**\n    Iron(III) hydroxide is a basic salt that reacts with a strong acid (represented by H⁺) in a neutralization reaction:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n3.  **Calculate the moles of H⁺ needed for the reaction.**\n    From the stoichiometry of the reaction, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺.\n    *   Moles of H⁺ (reacted) = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)₃\n    *   Moles of H⁺ (reacted) = 3 * 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol ≈ 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol\n\n4.  **Determine the final concentration of Fe³⁺.**\n    The 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ is dissolved in a total volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L).\n    *   [Fe³⁺] = Moles of Fe(OH)₃ / Volume\n    *   [Fe³⁺] = 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol / 0.1 L ≈ 9.357 x 10⁻³ M\n\n5.  **Calculate the equilibrium H⁺ concentration needed to keep Fe(OH)₃ dissolved.**\n    For the Fe(OH)₃ to remain dissolved, the ion product [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ must be less than or equal to the solubility product constant, Ksp. We will calculate the condition at the limit, where the solution is saturated. The Ksp for Fe(OH)₃ at 25°C is approximately 2.0 x 10⁻³⁹ mol⁴dm⁻¹².\n    *   Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³\n    *   2.0 x 10⁻³⁹ = (9.357 x 10⁻³ M) * [OH⁻]³\n    *   [OH⁻]³ = (2.0 x 10⁻³⁹) / (9.357 x 10⁻³) ≈ 2.139 x 10⁻³⁷\n    *   [OH⁻] = (2.139 x 10⁻³⁷)^(1/3) ≈ 5.98 x 10⁻¹³ M\n\n    Now, we use the ion product of water (Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C) to find the required hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺].\n    *   [H⁺] = Kw / [OH⁻]\n    *   [H⁺] = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (5.98 x 10⁻¹³) ≈ 0.0167 M\n\n6.  **Calculate the final pH of the solution.**\n    *   pH = -log[H⁺]\n    *   pH = -log(0.0167) ≈ 2.78\n\n7.  **Calculate the total moles of H⁺ required.**\n    The total amount of acid needed is the sum of the acid that reacts with Fe(OH)₃ and the acid that remains in the solution to maintain the pH.\n    *   Moles of H⁺ (remaining) = [H⁺] * Total Volume\n    *   Moles of H⁺ (remaining) = 0.0167 M * 0.1 L = 1.67 x 10⁻³ mol\n    *   Total moles of H⁺ = Moles of H⁺ (reacted) + Moles of H⁺ (remaining)\n    *   Total moles of H⁺ = 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol + 1.67 x 10⁻³ mol = 4.477 x 10⁻³ mol\n\n8.  **Calculate the minimum volume of the 0.1 M strong acid.**\n    *   Volume = Total moles of H⁺ / Concentration of acid\n    *   Volume = 4.477 x 10⁻³ mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.04477 L\n    *   Volume in cm³ = 0.04477 L * 1000 cm³/L = 44.77 cm³\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe calculated pH is approximately 2.78, and the required volume of the strong acid is 44.77 cm³. Comparing these results to the given options:\n\n*   A) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³\n*   B) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³\n*   C) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³\n*   D) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³\n\nNone of the options perfectly match the calculated values. However, option D has a pH of 2.69, which is the closest to our calculated pH of 2.78. The discrepancy in volume may arise from using slightly different values for the molar mass or Ksp, or from a different interpretation of the problem's conditions. Given the choices, option D is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
