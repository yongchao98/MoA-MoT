    "Due to the phenomenon of electrostatic shielding, the electric field inside the material of the conductor is zero. When a positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity, it induces a negative charge -q on the inner surface of the cavity and a positive charge +q on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\nThe distribution of the induced charge -q on the inner surface of the cavity will be non-uniform because the charge +q is not at the center of the cavity. However, the electric field produced by the charge +q inside the cavity and the induced charge -q on the inner surface cancels out within the conductor material.\n\nCrucially, the charge +q on the outer surface of the spherical conductor distributes itself uniformly, irrespective of the position of the charge +q inside the cavity. This is because the conductor's outer surface is an equipotential surface, and a uniform charge distribution ensures that the electric field inside the conductor remains zero.\n\nTherefore, for any point P outside the spherical conductor, the electric field is solely due to the uniformly distributed charge +q on the outer surface. According to Gauss's law, the electric field outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at its center.\n\nIn this problem, the total charge on the outer surface is +q, and the center of the spherical conductor is the point from which the distance L to point P is measured. The other parameters, such as the cavity's radius (r), the displacement of the cavity's center (s), the distance from the cavity's center to P (l), and the angle Î¸, are all irrelevant to the electric field outside the conductor due to the shielding effect.\n\nThe magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge +q located at the center of the spherical conductor:\n\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThus, option A is the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
