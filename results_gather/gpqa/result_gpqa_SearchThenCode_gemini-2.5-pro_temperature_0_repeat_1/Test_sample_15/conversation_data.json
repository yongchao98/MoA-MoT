    "Here is an analysis of the optical activity for each of the seven compounds:\n\n1.  ***(Z)*-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule has a double bond, and the atoms attached to the double bond are different, which allows for E/Z isomerism. However, it does not contain any chiral centers (a carbon atom with four different substituents). The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that includes the double bond, making it achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n2.  ***(3aR,7aS,E)*-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name of this compound includes stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS, E), which specify a particular stereoisomer. The presence of these \"R\" and \"S\" designations indicates the existence of chiral centers. A specific enantiomer like this is, by definition, chiral and will exhibit optical activity.\n\n3.  ***(2R,3S)*-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the (2R, 3S) configuration results in a molecule with a plane of symmetry between these two centers. The substituents on one side of the plane are a mirror image of the substituents on the other. This type of compound is called a \"meso\" compound. Despite having chiral centers, meso compounds are achiral overall and thus optically inactive.\n\n4.  ***(2R,3R)*-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This compound also has two chiral centers. Unlike its meso counterpart, the (2R, 3R) configuration does not have a plane of symmetry. This molecule is chiral and will be optically active. Its non-superimposable mirror image is the (2S, 3S) enantiomer.\n\n5.  ***(R)*-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The \"(R)\" in the name indicates that this is a specific enantiomer of a chiral molecule. The chiral center is the carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group (C1). This carbon is attached to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, the hydroxyl group, a -CH=CH- group within the ring, and a -CH2-CH2- group within the ring. As a specific enantiomer, it is optically active.\n\n6.  ***(1s,3s,5s)*-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound has the three hydroxyl groups in a cis configuration, meaning they are all on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This arrangement gives the molecule multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane can pass through one hydroxyl group and the carbon opposite to it, bisecting the ring. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: To determine if this molecule is chiral, we must look for a chiral center. The structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon, which is bonded to a butyl chain with a methyl group at position 3. The carbon at position 3 is bonded to a hydrogen, a -CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl group, and two identical methyl groups. Since it is bonded to two identical groups, it is not a chiral center. The molecule has no chiral centers and is achiral, making it optically inactive.\n\nIn summary:\n*   Optically active: **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**, **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**, and **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**.\n*   Optically inactive: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol, and 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one.\n\nTherefore, 3 of the compounds will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<C>>>"
