    "To determine the reason for the failed protein overexpression, the provided DNA sequence must be analyzed in the context of protein translation.\n\nThe plan is to express a GADD45G protein with an N-terminal influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag. The HA tag's amino acid sequence is YPYDVPDYA. The provided DNA sequence begins with `5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCC...`.\n\nLet's translate this initial portion of the DNA sequence into amino acids by reading it in groups of three nucleotides (codons) starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **ATG**: Methionine (Start codon)\n*   **TAC**: Tyrosine (Y)\n*   **CCA**: Proline (P)\n*   **TAC**: Tyrosine (Y)\n*   **GAT**: Aspartic Acid (D)\n*   **GTT**: Valine (V)\n*   **CCA**: Proline (P)\n*   **GAT**: Aspartic Acid (D)\n*   **TAC**: Tyrosine (Y)\n*   **GCC**: Alanine (A)\n\nThis translates to the amino acid sequence `M-YPYDVPDYA`, which is the correct sequence for a start codon followed by the HA tag. Therefore, the sequence for the antigenic determinant is correct, ruling out option D.\n\nNow, let's examine the codons immediately following the HA tag sequence:\n\n*   **AAA**: Lysine (K)\n*   **TGA**: **Stop Codon**\n\nThe sequence contains a `TGA` codon immediately after the codon for Lysine. `TGA` is one of the three standard stop codons (along with `TAA` and `TAG`) that signal the ribosome to terminate protein synthesis. The presence of this premature termination codon (PTC) means that the ribosome would stop translation after synthesizing only a very short peptide (`M-YPYDVPDYA-K`), and the full-length GADD45G protein would not be produced. This directly explains the observed failure to overexpress the desired protein.\n\nEvaluating the other options:\n*   **A) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** While linkers can sometimes improve protein stability, the primary issue here is that the full protein is not being synthesized in the first place due to the premature stop codon.\n*   **B) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** This is incorrect. First, the codon in question is `TGA`, not `TAA`. Second, stop codons are recognized by protein release factors, not tRNAs, to terminate translation. This mechanism is conserved in mammals like mice and hamsters.\n\nTherefore, the correct reason for the failed expression is the early termination of translation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
