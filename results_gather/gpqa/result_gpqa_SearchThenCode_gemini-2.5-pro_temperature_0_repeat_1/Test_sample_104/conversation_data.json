    "The initial calculation appears to be correct. The search results confirm the fundamental formulas used.\n\n1.  **Amplitude of Starspot Modulation:** The brightness variations are attributed to temperature variations from starspots co-rotating with the star. The amplitude of this modulation is related to the spot size and temperature contrast. My formula, `Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`, where `f` is the spot filling factor, correctly models this by considering the flux difference based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law (Flux ∝ T⁴).\n\n2.  **Amplitude of Exoplanet Transit (Transit Depth):** The search results consistently state that the transit depth is equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area, which simplifies to `(R_pl / R_star)²`.\n\nThe problem requires equating these two amplitudes. My step-by-step derivation did exactly that.\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spotted hemisphere.**\n    *   `Amplitude = f * (1 - (Teff_spot / Teff_star)⁴)`\n    *   `Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)`\n    *   `Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)`\n    *   `Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - 625 / 1296)`\n    *   `Amplitude = 0.20 * (671 / 1296)`\n    *   `Amplitude ≈ 0.10355`\n\n*   **Step 2: Equate this amplitude to the transit depth of a hypothetical exoplanet.**\n    *   `Transit Depth = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n    *   `(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.10355`\n\n*   **Step 3: Solve for the relative radius of the exoplanet.**\n    *   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.10355)`\n    *   `R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218`\n\nThis result strongly corresponds to option C. The logic and calculations are sound and supported by the fundamental principles of stellar photometry confirmed in the search results.\n\nFinal check of the question and options:\n*   Question: what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star (i.e. Rpl/Rstar)?\n*   A) ~0.07\n*   B) ~0.39\n*   C) ~0.32\n*   D) ~0.11\n\nMy calculated value is ~0.32. Option D (~0.11) would be the answer if one forgot to take the square root of the amplitude, a common mistake. The other options do not seem to be reachable through simple miscalculation. The answer is C.\n\nTo produce a signal with the same amplitude as the rotational modulation caused by the starspots, a hypothetical exoplanet would need to block the same amount of light.\n\nFirst, we calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the starspots. The brightness of a star is proportional to the integral of its flux over the visible disk. According to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the flux is proportional to the fourth power of the effective temperature (Teff).\n\nThe maximum brightness (F_max) occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The flux is proportional to Teff_star⁴.\n\nThe minimum brightness (F_min) occurs when the spotted hemisphere is facing the observer. This hemisphere has a fraction of its area, the filling factor (f = 0.20), covered by cooler spots. The flux from this hemisphere is a combination of the flux from the normal surface and the spotted surface.\nF_min is proportional to `(1 - f) * Teff_star⁴ + f * Teff_spot⁴`.\n\nThe amplitude of the variation is the relative change in flux:\nAmplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\nAmplitude = `(Teff_star⁴ - [(1 - f) * Teff_star⁴ + f * Teff_spot⁴]) / Teff_star⁴`\nAmplitude = `(f * Teff_star⁴ - f * Teff_spot⁴) / Teff_star⁴`\nAmplitude = `f * (1 - (Teff_spot / Teff_star)⁴)`\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   f = 0.20\n*   Teff_star = 6000 K\n*   Teff_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n\nAmplitude = `0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)`\nAmplitude = `0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)`\nAmplitude = `0.20 * (1 - 625 / 1296)`\nAmplitude = `0.20 * (671 / 1296)`\nAmplitude ≈ 0.10355\n\nNext, we consider the dimming caused by an exoplanet transit. The transit depth, which is the amplitude of the signal, is the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\nTransit Depth = `(π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\nTo have the same amplitude signal, we set the transit depth equal to the amplitude from the starspots:\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.10355`\n\nFinally, we solve for the relative radius of the planet (R_pl / R_star):\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.10355)`\n`R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\n<<<C>>>"
