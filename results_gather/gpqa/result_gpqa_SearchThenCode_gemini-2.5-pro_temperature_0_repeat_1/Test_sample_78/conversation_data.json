    "### Analysis of the Reaction and Product\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product's NMR Spectra:**\n    *   **¹H NMR:** The spectrum shows two singlets at δ 2.28 (3H) and 2.31 (3H), indicating two distinct methyl groups that are not coupled to any protons. The signals in the aromatic/vinylic region include two doublets at δ 7.08 (2H) and 7.71 (2H), which is a classic pattern for a para-substituted benzene ring. Two additional doublets at δ 6.75 (1H) and 7.68 (1H) suggest two coupled vinyl protons on a double bond.\n    *   **¹³C NMR:** A signal at δ 197.7 is characteristic of a ketone carbonyl carbon. The signals at δ 21.3 and δ 28.4 correspond to the two methyl carbons. The remaining signals in the δ 126-145 range are consistent with the carbons of a para-substituted aromatic ring and a carbon-carbon double bond.\n\n2.  **Deduce the Product Structure:**\n    *   The NMR data strongly suggest the product is 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n    *   The para-substituted ring is a tolyl group (a methyl-substituted benzene ring), which accounts for one methyl singlet (e.g., δ 2.31) and the corresponding carbon signal (δ 21.3).\n    *   The rest of the molecule is a butenone chain (-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃). This accounts for the other methyl singlet (the acetyl methyl, δ 2.28), its carbon (δ 28.4), the ketone carbonyl (δ 197.7), and the two vinyl protons and carbons.\n    *   The molecular formula of this product is C₁₁H₁₂O, which matches the starting material, Compound X.\n\n3.  **Identify the Reaction:**\n    *   Compound X (C₁₁H₁₂O) is treated with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K (130 °C).\n    *   DABCO is a nucleophilic, non-hindered base. The reaction conditions are suitable for a rearrangement.\n    *   Research indicates that DABCO catalyzes the Meinwald rearrangement of terminal epoxides (specifically 2-aryl-, 2-alkenyl-, and 2-alkynyl-substituted oxiranes) to yield methyl ketones. This reaction proceeds with inverse selectivity compared to acid-catalyzed rearrangements, which typically yield aldehydes. The reaction conditions described in the literature (DABCO in mesitylene at 130°C) are very similar to those in the problem.\n\n4.  **Determine the Structure of Compound X:**\n    *   The reaction is an isomerization of a terminal epoxide to a methyl ketone: R-CH(O)CH₂ → R-C(=O)CH₃.\n    *   The product is 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one, so the R group is the 4-methylstyryl group (p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-).\n    *   Therefore, the starting material, Compound X, must be the terminal epoxide with this R group attached: p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂.\n    *   This structure is named **2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane**.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) 2-styrylepoxide: This would have a phenyl group, not a tolyl group, and the molecular formula would be C₁₀H₁₀O.\n    *   B) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane: This is an internal epoxide and would not yield the specific methyl ketone product. It also lacks the methyl group on the phenyl ring.\n    *   C) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane: This is a terminal epoxide with the correct substituent (4-methylstyryl group) and molecular formula (C₁₁H₁₂O). Its rearrangement via the DABCO-catalyzed Meinwald reaction would yield 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one, matching the spectral data.\n    *   D) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane: This compound has a different substitution pattern on the double bond and a phenyl instead of a tolyl group. Its rearrangement would lead to a different ketone.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of the product's NMR spectra and the known reactivity of DABCO with terminal epoxides, Compound X is identified as 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<C>>>"
