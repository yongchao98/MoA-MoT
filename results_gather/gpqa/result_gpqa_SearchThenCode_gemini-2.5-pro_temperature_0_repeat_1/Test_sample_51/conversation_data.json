    "To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes, we can use the Boltzmann equation, which describes the relative populations of atomic energy levels in a system in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE).\n\n### 1. The Boltzmann Equation\n\nThe ratio of the number of atoms in a higher energy level (level 2) to the number of atoms in a lower energy level (level 1) is given by:\n\n<sup>N₂</sup>⁄<sub>N₁</sub> = (<sup>g₂</sup>⁄<sub>g₁</sub>) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁)/(k * T)]\n\nWhere:\n*   N₂ and N₁ are the number of atoms in level 2 and level 1, respectively.\n*   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels.\n*   E₂ - E₁ is the energy difference between the two levels.\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant (1.380649 × 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nThe problem states that this ratio decreases when the star has spots (i.e., at a lower temperature), which is consistent with the formula.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Energy Difference (E₂ - E₁)\n\nThe energy difference between the levels corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given wavelength (λ = 1448 Å). The energy of a photon is calculated using the Planck-Einstein relation.\n\nE = h * c / λ\n\nWhere:\n*   h is Planck's constant (6.62607015 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n*   c is the speed of light (2.998 × 10⁸ m/s).\n*   λ is the wavelength (1448 Å = 1.448 × 10⁻⁷ m).\n\nLet's calculate the energy difference (ΔE = E₂ - E₁):\n\nΔE = (6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s * 2.998 × 10⁸ m/s) / (1.448 × 10⁻⁷ m)\nΔE ≈ 1.372 × 10⁻¹⁸ J\n\n### 3. Setting up the Ratio of Ratios\n\nWe need to find the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. Let's define the ratio R = N₂/N₁.\n\n*   R_nospots is the ratio at T_nospots = 6000 K.\n*   R_spots is the ratio at T_spots = 5500 K.\n\nThe factor is R_nospots / R_spots.\n\nFactor = { (<sup>g₂</sup>⁄<sub>g₁</sub>) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)] } / { (<sup>g₂</sup>⁄<sub>g₁</sub>) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_spots)] }\n\nThe statistical weights (g₂/g₁) cancel out:\n\nFactor = exp[-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)] / exp[-ΔE / (k * T_spots)]\nFactor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]\n\n### 4. Calculation\n\nFirst, let's calculate the term ΔE / k:\n\nΔE / k = (1.372 × 10⁻¹⁸ J) / (1.381 × 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 99348 K\n\nNow, plug this and the temperatures into the factor equation:\n\nFactor = exp[ 99348 * (1/5500 - 1/6000) ]\nFactor = exp[ 99348 * ( (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) ) ]\nFactor = exp[ 99348 * (500 / 33,000,000) ]\nFactor = exp[ 99348 / 66000 ]\nFactor = exp(1.505)\nFactor ≈ 4.50\n\nThe ratio of the populations of the two energy levels is approximately 4.5 times higher when the star has no spots (Teff = 6000 K) compared to when 40% of its surface is covered by spots (Teff = 5500 K). The information about the star's radius, mass, and the specific percentage of spot coverage is not needed for this calculation since the effective temperatures for both scenarios are provided.\n\n<<<C>>>"
