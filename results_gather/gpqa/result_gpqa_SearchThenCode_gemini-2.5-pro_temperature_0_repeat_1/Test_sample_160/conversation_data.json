    "The mean free path (λ) of a particle is the average distance it travels between successive collisions. It is determined by the formula:\n\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\n\nwhere:\n*   **n** is the number density of the target particles (the number of gas molecules per unit volume).\n*   **σ** is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective area that a target particle presents to the moving particle for a collision to occur.\n\nLet's analyze the two scenarios presented:\n\n**Scenario 1: Mean free path of gas molecules (λ1)**\n\nIn this case, the moving particles are the gas molecules themselves, and they are colliding with other gas molecules.\n*   The number density of target particles is *n*.\n*   The collision cross-section, **σ1**, is determined by the physical size of the gas molecules. For a collision between two spherical molecules of radius *r*, the cross-section is σ1 = π(2r)² = 4πr². This represents the area within which the center of another molecule must come for a collision to happen.\n\nTherefore, **λ1 = 1 / (n * σ1)**.\n\n**Scenario 2: Mean free path of electrons (λ2)**\n\nHere, the moving particles are electrons from the electron beam, and they are colliding with the stationary gas molecules.\n*   The number density of the target gas molecules, *n*, remains the same as the temperature and pressure in the compartment are constant.\n*   The collision cross-section, **σ2**, now describes the interaction between an electron and a gas molecule. An electron is a charged particle, and it interacts with the gas molecule via the electromagnetic force. This interaction is not a simple \"hard-sphere\" collision. The electron interacts with the molecule's electron cloud and atomic nuclei. This electromagnetic interaction has a longer range than the physical contact required for two neutral gas molecules to collide. Consequently, the effective target area that a gas molecule presents to an electron (σ2) is significantly larger than the physical cross-section for a molecule-molecule collision (σ1).\n\nTherefore, **λ2 = 1 / (n * σ2)**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSince the conditions in the sample compartment (number of gas particles, temperature) remain the same, the number density *n* is constant for both calculations. However, the collision cross-sections are different:\n\n*   **σ2 (electron-molecule) > σ1 (molecule-molecule)**\n\nBecause the mean free path is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section, a larger cross-section results in a shorter mean free path.\n\nGiven that σ2 > σ1, it follows that:\n\n**λ2 < λ1**\n\nThe mean free path for electrons scattering off gas molecules is shorter than the mean free path for gas molecules colliding with each other.\n\n<<<C>>>"
