    "When a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment **μ** = γ**S** is in a magnetic field **B**, the Hamiltonian of the system is given by H = -**μ** · **B**. The time evolution of the spin is governed by the torque equation d**S**/dt = **μ** x **B**, which leads to the precession of the spin vector **S** (and thus the magnetic moment **μ**) around the direction of the magnetic field. The angular frequency of this precession is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nInitially, the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the spin is in an eigenstate of the S<sub>z</sub> operator, let's say \"spin up\". At this point, the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, <μ<sub>z</sub>>, is at its maximum positive value.\n\nSuddenly, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude B. The Hamiltonian changes to H = -γB*S<sub>y</sub>. The spin, which was pointing in the Z direction, is no longer aligned with the magnetic field. It will therefore begin to precess around the new direction of the magnetic field, which is the Y-axis.\n\nThis precession occurs in the plane perpendicular to the new magnetic field, which is the X-Z plane. As the magnetic moment vector rotates in the X-Z plane around the Y-axis, its projection onto the Z-axis will oscillate. The frequency of this oscillation is precisely the Larmor precession frequency.\n\nThe Larmor frequency (ω) is given by the formula:\n\nω = γB\n\nwhere:\n*   γ is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   B is the magnitude of the magnetic field.\n\nThe expectation value of the z-component of the spin, <S<sub>z</sub>(t)>, will vary sinusoidally with time as:\n\n<S<sub>z</sub>(t)> = <S<sub>z</sub>(0)> * cos(ωt)\n\nConsequently, the average of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment, <μ<sub>z</sub>(t)> = γ<S<sub>z</sub>(t)>, will also oscillate with the same angular frequency ω.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment is γB.\n\n<<<A>>>"
