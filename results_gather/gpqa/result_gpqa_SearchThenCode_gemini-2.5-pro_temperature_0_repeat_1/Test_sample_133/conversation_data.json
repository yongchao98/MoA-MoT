    "Here is the step-by-step calculation for the enthalpy of neutralization:\n\n**1. Calculate the moles of H+ ions from the acids:**\n\n*   **HCl:** 0.500 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.10 mol H+\n*   **H2SO4:** 0.300 L * 0.3 mol/L * 2 H+/molecule = 0.18 mol H+\n*   **Total moles of H+:** 0.10 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol\n\n**2. Calculate the moles of OH- ions from the base:**\n\n*   **Ba(OH)2:** 0.200 L * 0.5 mol/L * 2 OH-/molecule = 0.20 mol OH-\n\n**3. Determine the limiting reactant:**\n\nThe neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.\nWe compare the moles of H+ (0.28 mol) to the moles of OH- (0.20 mol). Since there are fewer moles of OH-, it is the limiting reactant. This means that 0.20 moles of water will be formed.\n\n**4. Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization:**\n\nThe standard enthalpy of neutralization for a strong acid and a strong base is approximately -57.1 kJ/mol or -13.7 kcal/mol. This value represents the heat released per mole of water formed.\n\n*   **Calculation in kJ:**\n    Enthalpy change = moles of water formed × enthalpy of neutralization per mole\n    Enthalpy change = 0.20 mol * (-57.1 kJ/mol) = -11.42 kJ\n\n*   **Calculation in kcal:**\n    Enthalpy change = 0.20 mol * (-13.7 kcal/mol) = -2.74 kcal\n\n**5. Consider the precipitation of BaSO4:**\n\nIn this specific mixture, a precipitation reaction also occurs between barium ions (from Ba(OH)2) and sulfate ions (from H2SO4):\nBa²⁺(aq) + SO₄²⁻(aq) → BaSO₄(s)\n\nHowever, in typical stoichiometry problems of this nature, unless the enthalpy of precipitation is explicitly provided or requested, the calculation is based solely on the heat of neutralization. The calculated value of -2.74 kcal is very close to one of the options.\n\n**6. Compare with the given options:**\n\n*   A) -16.0 kJ\n*   B) -2.72 kcal\n*   C) -11.42 kcal\n*   D) -3.80 kcal\n\nOur calculated value of -2.74 kcal is closest to option B. The minor difference can be attributed to the precise value of the standard enthalpy of neutralization used (-13.7 kcal/mol vs. a value that would yield exactly -2.72 kcal).\n\n<<<B>>>"
