  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the experimental results to determine the interactions between genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n### Analysis of Single Mutants\n\n*   **Wild-type (Control):** 100% resistance.\n*   **g1 mutant (75% resistance):** The loss of G1 function causes a 25% drop in resistance. This indicates that G1 plays a role in the plant's defense, but other genes can still provide a high level of resistance.\n*   **g3 mutant (50% resistance):** The loss of G3 function leads to a 50% drop in resistance. This suggests G3 has a more significant role in resistance than G1.\n*   **g2 mutant (0% resistance):** The loss of G2 function results in a complete loss of resistance. This indicates that G2 is essential for the resistance phenotype.\n\n### Analysis of Double Mutants and Gene Interactions\n\n1.  **Interaction of G2 with G1 and G3 (Epistasis):**\n    *   The `g2` single mutant has 0% resistance.\n    *   The `g1g2` and `g2g3` double mutants also have 0% resistance.\n    *   When the phenotype of a double mutant is identical to that of one of the single mutants, it indicates an epistatic interaction. Specifically, the allele of the gene that masks the effect of the other gene is called epistatic. In this case, the `g2` mutation's effect (0% resistance) masks the effects of the `g1` and `g3` mutations. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3**.\n    *   Given that G2 is essential for resistance and is epistatic to the other genes, it is the most likely candidate for the **transcription factor** mentioned in the problem description. A transcription factor often acts as a master switch; if it's turned off, the downstream genes it regulates won't be expressed, leading to a complete loss of function.\n\n2.  **Interaction between G1 and G3 (Gene Redundancy):**\n    *   The `g1` mutant has 75% resistance (a 25% loss).\n    *   The `g3` mutant has 50% resistance (a 50% loss).\n    *   If the genes acted independently, one might expect the double mutant to have a resistance level reflecting the sum of the losses, but this is not a simple calculation.\n    *   Crucially, the `g1g3` double mutant has only 10% resistance, a much more severe phenotype than either single mutant alone. This synergistic effect, where the combined loss of function is far greater than the individual losses, is a classic indicator of **gene redundancy**. This suggests that G1 and G3 perform similar or overlapping functions in parallel pathways. When one is absent, the other can partially compensate, but when both are absent, the function is almost entirely lost.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** This is incorrect. Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits, for which there is no evidence here. Also, G1 is not epistatic to G3; the double mutant phenotype (10%) is different from the `g1` phenotype (75%).\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** This option correctly identifies G2 as the likely transcription factor and correctly describes the relationship between G1 and G3 as gene redundancy. However, it incorrectly states that G1 is epistatic towards G3. Despite this last inaccuracy, this option captures the two most important conclusions from the data.\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:** This is incorrect. There is no evidence about the gene promoters. Also, G3 is not epistatic towards G1.\n*   **D) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1:** This is incorrect. G1 is a poor candidate for the primary transcription factor because its mutant has a mild phenotype compared to `g2`. While G2 is indeed epistatic to G1, the primary assertion that G1 is the transcription factor is not supported.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption B provides the best description of the genetic interactions. It correctly identifies G2 as the upstream transcription factor due to its essential role and epistatic relationship with the other genes. It also correctly identifies the synergistic relationship between G1 and G3 as gene redundancy. The final clause, \"G1 is epistatic towards G3,\" is an inaccurate description of the synergistic interaction, but the first two clauses represent the major findings of the experiment.\n\n<<<B>>>"
