    "The reaction of an epoxide with an organocuprate (Gilman reagent) is a well-established method in organic synthesis. The reaction proceeds via an SN2 mechanism, which dictates both the regioselectivity and stereoselectivity of the ring-opening.\n\n**Analysis of the Reaction:**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** The substrate is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with a fused epoxide. The epoxide involves carbons C1 and C6. C1 has a methyl substituent, making it a quaternary center, while C6 is a tertiary center.\n2.  **Reagent:** The reagent is Me2CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate), which provides a methyl nucleophile (Me-). Organocuprates are considered strong nucleophiles.\n3.  **Regioselectivity:** For reactions with strong nucleophiles like organocuprates, the nucleophilic attack occurs at the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. Comparing the two epoxide carbons, C1 (quaternary) and C6 (tertiary), C6 is the less hindered position. Therefore, the methyl group will attack C6.\n4.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds through an SN2 mechanism, which involves a backside attack by the nucleophile. This results in an inversion of the stereochemical configuration at the carbon being attacked. The initial configuration at C6 is S. A backside attack by the methyl nucleophile will invert this center to an R configuration. The C1-O bond of the epoxide breaks, and after an aqueous workup, it becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The configurations of the other stereocenters (C1, C3, and C4) are not affected by the reaction.\n\n**Determining the Product:**\n\n*   **Attack at C6:** The methyl group adds to C6, inverting its stereochemistry from S to R.\n*   **Ring Opening:** The C1-O bond cleaves, forming an alcohol at C1. The stereocenter at C1 (R) remains unchanged.\n*   **Unaffected Centers:** The stereocenters at C3 (R) and C4 (R) are remote from the reaction site and retain their configuration.\n\n**Product Naming and Stereochemistry:**\n\nThe resulting product is a substituted cyclohexanol. Following IUPAC nomenclature rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated C1. This corresponds to the original C1 of the starting material. The ring is then numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n\n*   **C1 (original C1):** Has an -OH group and a methyl group. Its configuration remains R.\n*   **C2 (original C6):** Now has a new methyl group. Its configuration has inverted from S to R.\n*   **C4 (original C3):** Has a methyl group. Its configuration remains R.\n*   **C5 (original C4):** Has a methyl group. Its configuration remains R.\n\nTherefore, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\n\n*   A) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   B) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   C) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   D) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nThe correct product is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
