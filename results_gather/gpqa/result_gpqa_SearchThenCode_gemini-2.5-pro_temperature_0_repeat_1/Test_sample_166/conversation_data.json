    "Here is a step-by-step calculation of the non-Gaussianity (nG) for the given Schrödinger cat state.\n\n**1. Define the State and Parameters**\n\nThe Schrödinger cat state is given by:\n|ψ⟩ = (cos(φ)|α⟩ + sin(φ)|-α⟩) / N\n\nWith the parameters:\n*   Amplitude `α = 0.5`\n*   Phase `φ = -π/4`\n\nFor `φ = -π/4`, we have `cos(φ) = 1/√2` and `sin(φ) = -1/√2`. The state simplifies to the odd Schrödinger cat state:\n|ψ⟩ ∝ |α⟩ - |-α⟩\n\nThe density matrix of this pure state is `ρ = |ψ⟩⟨ψ|`.\n\n**2. The Measure of Non-Gaussianity**\n\nThe relative entropy measure of non-Gaussianity is defined as the difference between the von Neumann entropy of a reference Gaussian state (`τ`) and the von Neumann entropy of the state in question (`ρ`).\nnG = S(τ) - S(ρ)\n\n*   Since `ρ` represents a pure state, its von Neumann entropy `S(ρ) = -Tr(ρ ln ρ)` is zero.\n*   Therefore, the non-Gaussianity is simply the entropy of the reference Gaussian state: `nG = S(τ)`.\n\nThe reference Gaussian state `τ` is defined as the Gaussian state that has the same first and second moments (displacement vector and covariance matrix) as `ρ`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Moments of the State `ρ`**\n\nWe need to calculate the first moment `⟨a⟩` and the second moments `⟨a²⟩` and `⟨a†a⟩`.\n\n*   **First moment (displacement):** `⟨a⟩ = Tr(ρa) = 0`.\n*   **Second moments:**\n    *   `⟨a²⟩ = Tr(ρa²) = α² = 0.25`.\n    *   The mean photon number is `⟨a†a⟩ = Tr(ρa†a) = α² * coth(α²)`.\n\nFor `α = 0.5`, we have `α² = 0.25`.\n`⟨a†a⟩ = 0.25 * coth(0.25) ≈ 0.25 * 4.0834 ≈ 1.02085`.\nLet's denote this mean photon number as `n`.\n\n**4. Determine the Covariance Matrix of the Reference State `τ`**\n\nThe elements of the covariance matrix `V` for a single-mode state with zero displacement are given by the variances of the quadrature operators `q = (a + a†)/√2` and `p = (a - a†)/(i√2)`. These can be expressed in terms of the moments `n = ⟨a†a⟩` and `m = ⟨a²⟩`.\n\n*   `V_qq = ⟨q²⟩ = (⟨a²⟩ + ⟨a†²⟩ + 2⟨a†a⟩ + 1)/2 = (m + m* + 2n + 1)/2`\n*   `V_pp = ⟨p²⟩ = (-⟨a²⟩ - ⟨a†²⟩ + 2⟨a†a⟩ + 1)/2 = (-m - m* + 2n + 1)/2`\n\nSubstituting the calculated moments (`m = 0.25` and `n ≈ 1.02085`):\n*   `V_qq = (0.25 + 0.25 + 2 * 1.02085 + 1) / 2 = (2 * 1.02085 + 1.5) / 2 = n + 0.75 ≈ 1.77085`\n*   `V_pp = (-0.25 - 0.25 + 2 * 1.02085 + 1) / 2 = (2 * 1.02085 + 0.5) / 2 = n + 0.25 ≈ 1.27085`\n*   The off-diagonal elements are zero because `⟨a²⟩` is real.\n\n**5. Calculate the Entropy of the Reference State `τ`**\n\nThe von Neumann entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state `τ` is given by:\nS(τ) = g(ν - 1/2)\nwhere `ν = sqrt(det(V))` is the symplectic eigenvalue and `g(x) = (x+1)ln(x+1) - xln(x)`.\n\n*   `det(V) = V_qq * V_pp ≈ 1.77085 * 1.27085 ≈ 2.2503`\n*   `ν = sqrt(2.2503) ≈ 1.5001`\n*   The argument for the function `g` is `x = ν - 0.5 ≈ 1.5001 - 0.5 = 1.0001`.\n\nNow, we calculate `g(1)`:\n`g(1) = (1+1)ln(1+1) - 1*ln(1) = 2ln(2) - 0`\n`g(1) ≈ 2 * 0.693147 = 1.386294`\n\nThe amount of non-Gaussianity is approximately 1.386.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.25\nB) 2.48\nC) 0\nD) 1.38\n\nThe calculated value is extremely close to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
