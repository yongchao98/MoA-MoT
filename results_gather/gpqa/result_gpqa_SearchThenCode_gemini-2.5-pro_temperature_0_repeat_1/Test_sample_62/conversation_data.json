    "### Calculation of the Photon Momentum for a Rovibrational Transition\n\nTo solve this problem, we first identify the initial and final states of the molecule and then calculate the energy difference, which corresponds to the energy of the absorbed photon. Finally, we determine the photon's momentum.\n\n**1. Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** The molecule is in its fundamental (ground) state, which for the rotation-vibration model corresponds to a vibrational quantum number `v=0` and a rotational quantum number `J=0`. The energy of this state is given by:\n    *   E(v, J) = (v + 1/2)ħω + B J(J+1)\n    *   E_initial = E(0, 0) = (1/2)ħω\n\n*   **Final State:** The problem asks for the transition to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\". In the context of rovibrational spectroscopy, this typically implies a transition to the next vibrational level (`v=1`). The selection rules for such transitions are Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1. Since the initial state is J=0, the only possible rotational change is ΔJ = +1, leading to a final state of `J=1`. A transition to J=0 (ΔJ=0) is forbidden for this type of molecule.\n    *   Therefore, the final state is (v=1, J=1).\n    *   E_final = E(1, 1) = (1 + 1/2)ħω + B(1)(1+1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B\n\n**2. Energy of the Absorbed Photon (ΔE)**\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon is the difference between the final and initial energy states:\n*   ΔE = E_final - E_initial\n*   ΔE = [ (3/2)ħω + 2B ] - [ (1/2)ħω ]\n*   ΔE = ħω + 2B\n\nTo calculate this energy, we need to find the rotational constant, B.\n\n**3. Calculation of the Rotational Constant (B)**\n\nThe rotational constant B is defined as B = ħ² / (2I), where I is the moment of inertia.\n\n*   **Reduced Mass (μ):** The moment of inertia depends on the reduced mass of the molecule.\n    *   μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)\n    *   μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.8182 amu\n    *   Converting to kilograms: μ ≈ 1.8182 * (1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg/amu) ≈ 3.0192 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n*   **Moment of Inertia (I):** The moment of inertia for a diatomic molecule is I = μR².\n    *   I = (3.0192 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)²\n    *   I = (3.0192 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (4 x 10⁻²⁰ m²)\n    *   I ≈ 1.2077 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\n*   **Rotational Constant (B):**\n    *   B = ħ² / (2I) where ħ (reduced Planck constant) ≈ 1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   B = (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (2 * 1.2077 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²)\n    *   B ≈ 1.1121 x 10⁻⁶⁸ J²·s² / 2.4154 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n    *   B ≈ 4.604 x 10⁻²³ J\n\n**4. Total Energy and Momentum Calculation**\n\nNow we can calculate the total energy change ΔE.\n\n*   **Vibrational Energy Term (ħω):**\n    *   ħω = (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s)\n    *   ħω ≈ 4.2183 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n\n*   **Rotational Energy Term (2B):**\n    *   2B = 2 * (4.604 x 10⁻²³ J) ≈ 9.208 x 10⁻²³ J\n\n*   **Total Energy (ΔE):**\n    *   ΔE = ħω + 2B = 4.2183 x 10⁻²⁰ J + 9.208 x 10⁻²³ J\n    *   ΔE ≈ 4.2183 x 10⁻²⁰ J + 0.0009208 x 10⁻²⁰ J ≈ 4.2192 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n    (Note: The rotational energy contribution is very small compared to the vibrational energy.)\n\n*   **Photon Momentum (p):** The energy and momentum of a photon are related by E = pc.\n    *   p = ΔE / c where c (speed of light) ≈ 2.9979 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   p = (4.2192 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (2.9979 x 10⁸ m/s)\n    *   p ≈ 1.407 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThis result is approximately 1.4 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s.\n\nComparing this calculated value with the given options:\nA) p = 1.9*10⁻²⁸ N·s\nB) p = 2.3*10⁻²⁷ N·s\nC) p = 1.4*10⁻²⁸ N·s\nD) p = 1.1*10⁻²⁷ N·s\n\nThe calculated momentum matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
