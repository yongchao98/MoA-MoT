    "To determine the factor by which the mass of system_1 compares to system_2, we can use the principles of orbital mechanics for binary star systems. For a double-lined spectroscopic binary, where the radial velocities of both stars can be measured, the total mass of the system (M1 + M2) is related to the orbital period (P) and the radial velocity amplitudes (K1 and K2) of the two stars.\n\nSince both systems are described as eclipsing, it is reasonable to assume that the inclination of their orbits to our line of sight is approximately 90 degrees. This simplifies the calculations as the sine of the inclination angle (sin i) becomes 1.\n\nThe total mass of a binary system can be derived from Kepler's Third Law and is proportional to the orbital period and the cube of the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes. The formula for the sum of the masses is:\n\nM₁ + M₂ = [P / (2πG)] * (K₁ + K₂)³ / (sin³i)\n\nWhere:\n*   M₁ and M₂ are the masses of the two stars\n*   P is the orbital period\n*   G is the gravitational constant\n*   K₁ and K₂ are the amplitudes of the radial velocities\n*   i is the orbital inclination\n\nGiven that we are calculating a ratio of the masses of the two systems, the constant term (1 / 2πG) will cancel out. Also, with the assumption of an eclipsing binary, sin³i is taken as 1.\n\n**For System 1:**\n*   Orbital Period (P₁) = 2 years\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_total₁) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\nThe mass of system 1 (M_total₁) is proportional to P₁ * (K_total₁)³:\nM_total₁ ∝ 2 * (15)³ = 2 * 3375 = 6750\n\n**For System 2:**\n*   Orbital Period (P₂) = 1 year\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_total₂) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\nThe mass of system 2 (M_total₂) is proportional to P₂ * (K_total₂)³:\nM_total₂ ∝ 1 * (25)³ = 1 * 15625 = 15625\n\nTo find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we calculate the ratio of their masses:\n\nRatio = M_total₁ / M_total₂ = 6750 / 15625 ≈ 0.432\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
