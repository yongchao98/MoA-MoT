    "Here is a step-by-step solution to determine the velocity of particle A.\n\n### 1. Principle of Conservation of Energy\n\nThe fundamental principle governing this annihilation process is the conservation of energy. The total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after the annihilation. The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible. We assume the annihilation happens with the proton and antiproton effectively at rest.\n\n### 2. Initial Energy\n\nThe initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest energies of the proton ($p$) and the antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n*   The rest energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   An antiparticle has the same mass as its corresponding particle, so the rest energy of the antiproton ($m_{\\bar{p}} c^2$) is also 938 MeV.\n\nTherefore, the total initial energy is:\n$E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 938 \\text{ MeV} + 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n### 3. Final Energy\n\nThe final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n*   The rest energy of each particle A is given as $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   Since these particles are the result of an annihilation from a state of rest, they will be moving at high velocity. Their total energy is the sum of their rest energy and kinetic energy.\n\nThe total energy for a single relativistic particle is given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n\nSince the initial momentum was zero, the total final momentum must also be zero. This implies that the energy is distributed equally among the four resulting particles. Thus, the total final energy ($E_{final}$) is:\n$E_{final} = 4 \\times (\\gamma m_A c^2)$\n\n### 4. Calculation\n\nBy equating the initial and final energies:\n$E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n$1876 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\text{ MeV})$\n\nFirst, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1876}{4 \\times 300} = \\frac{1876}{1200} \\approx 1.5633$\n\nNow, we can use the definition of the Lorentz factor to find the velocity, $v$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for $v/c$:\n$(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nSubstituting the calculated value of $\\gamma$:\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.444}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.409}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{0.591} \\approx 0.7688$\n\nThe calculated velocity is approximately 0.77c.\n\n<<<A>>>"
