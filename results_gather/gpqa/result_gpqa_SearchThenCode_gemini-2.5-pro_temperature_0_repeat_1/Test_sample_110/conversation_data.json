    "### Analysis of Reactions\n\nBoth reactions presented are examples of the Michael addition, a fundamental carbon-carbon bond-forming reaction in organic chemistry. This reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile (a Michael donor) to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound (a Michael acceptor).\n\n#### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Reactants**: The Michael donor is the enolate of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, and the Michael acceptor is ethyl acrylate. The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is used to deprotonate the ketone to form the nucleophilic enolate.\n2.  **Enolate Formation**: The starting ketone has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group), C2 and C6. The C2 carbon is quaternary (bonded to an ethyl and a methyl group) and has no protons to be removed. The C6 carbon has one proton. Therefore, the bulky base t-BuOK will deprotonate the only available α-proton at the C6 position, forming the enolate.\n3.  **Michael Addition**: The C6 of the enolate then attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. This is a 1,4-conjugate addition. A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate moiety.\n4.  **Product Structure and Naming**: The resulting product has an ethyl propanoate group attached to the C6 position of the original ketone. To name this compound according to IUPAC rules as presented in the options, the ethyl propanoate is treated as the parent chain. The cyclohexanone ring is then a substituent attached to the third carbon of the propanoate chain. The numbering of the cyclohexyl ring starts from the point of attachment (the original C6).\n    *   C1 of the substituent ring is the original C6 (now bonded to the propanoate chain and a methyl group).\n    *   C2 is the original C1 (bearing the oxo group).\n    *   C3 is the original C2 (bearing an ethyl and a methyl group).\n    Following this numbering, the substituent is named **3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl**. Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n#### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Reactants**: This is another Michael addition. The Michael donor is the carbanion of 1-nitropropane, and the acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile). Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is the base.\n2.  **Carbanion Formation**: The protons on the carbon adjacent to the nitro group (the α-carbon) in 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂) are acidic. KOH removes one of these protons to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate).\n3.  **Michael Addition**: This carbanion attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃CH=CHCN). A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n4.  **Product Structure and Naming**: The resulting molecule's main functional group is the nitrile (-CN), which dictates the parent chain naming.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon is six carbons long, making it a hexanenitrile.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   The methyl group from the original butenenitrile is at the C3 position.\n    *   The nitro group from the original nitropropane is at the C4 position.\n    The correct IUPAC name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
