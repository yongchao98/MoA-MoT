    "The problem describes five binary compounds of fluorine with an element Y. Based on the chemical properties described, particularly the ability of compounds A1 and A3 to oxidize xenon, the element Y is identified as Gold (Au). Gold forms several binary fluorides and its higher valence fluorides are extremely powerful oxidizing agents.\n\nHere is the identification of each compound:\n\n*   **Element Y:** Gold (Au).\n*   **A1 (AuF₇ or more accurately AuF₅·F₂):** This compound is described as a bright-red substance that decomposes and oxidizes xenon. While early reports suggested AuF₇, later studies indicated it is more likely a complex, AuF₅·F₂. It is known to be highly reactive and decomposes. The description of \"bright-red\" is more closely associated with AuF₅, but the extreme oxidizing power points towards the highest oxidation state species.\n*   **A2 (AuF₅):** A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine. This points to A2 being AuF₅. Let's verify the mass percentage of fluorine (ωF) in AuF₅. The molar mass of AuF₅ is 196.97 g/mol + 5 * 19.00 g/mol = 291.97 g/mol. The mass percentage of fluorine is (5 * 19.00 / 291.97) * 100% ≈ 32.54%. This value is very close to the given 31.96%, confirming A2 is likely AuF₅. Gold(V) fluoride is a red solid.\n*   **A3 (AuF₅):** This compound also interacts with xenon and is formed by the direct fluorination of gold. Gold pentafluoride (AuF₅) is a powerful oxidizing agent and can be synthesized via fluorination pathways. It is known to react with xenon difluoride (XeF₂).\n*   **A4 (AuF₃):** Gold(III) fluoride, AuF₃, is an orange-yellow crystalline solid.\n*   **A5 (AuF):** The problem states that A5 is obtained by adding element Y (Au) to a solution of A4 (AuF₃) in a 1:1 molar ratio. This suggests a comproportionation reaction: 2AuF₃ + Au → 3AuF₂ (unstable) or more likely AuF₃ + 2Au → 3AuF. The formation of AuF is plausible in this context. AuF is a known binary compound of gold.\n*   **Hydrolysis of A5:** A5 (AuF) decomposes in water. This is consistent with the behavior of many gold compounds. The hydrolysis of AuF would likely lead to gold metal and an oxygenated gold species or hydrofluoric acid.\n\nThe question asks for the range in which the molecular weight of substance **A4** falls.\n\n*   **A4** is identified as Gold(III) fluoride (AuF₃).\n*   The atomic weight of Gold (Au) is approximately 196.97 g/mol.\n*   The atomic weight of Fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n*   The molecular weight of AuF₃ is 196.97 + 3 * 19.00 = 196.97 + 57.00 = 253.97 g/mol.\n\nThis calculated molecular weight does not fall into any of the provided ranges. Let's re-examine the premises.\n\nThere might be a misunderstanding of the reaction to form A5. Let's reconsider the compounds.\nWhat if Y is not Gold? Let's re-check the mass percentage calculation.\nAr(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n.\nIf n=4, Ar(Y) ≈ 161.8. This doesn't match a plausible element.\nIf n=5, Ar(Y) ≈ 202.25. This is close to Au (197.0) and Pt (195.1). The chemistry strongly points to one of these. The discrepancy between the calculated %F (32.54% for AuF₅) and the given value (31.96%) might be an error in the problem statement, but it's the closest fit.\n\nLet's assume the identification of the compounds is correct and there is an error in the question's options or my interpretation.\nA1 = AuF₇ (or AuF₅·F₂)\nA2 = AuF₅\nA3 = AuF₅\nA4 = AuF₃\nA5 = AuF\n\nMolecular weight of A4 (AuF₃) = 253.97 g/mol. None of the ranges match.\n\nLet's reconsider the assignment of the compounds.\nMaybe A4 is not AuF₃.\nThe reaction is: Y + A4 -> A5 (1:1 molar ratio).\nAu + A4 -> A5.\nIf A4 is AuF₅, then Au + AuF₅ -> ? This is not a standard, simple reaction.\nIf A4 is a different fluoride, how would it be identified? The problem gives little information on A4 directly, only its role in forming A5.\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in the fluorine percentage for A2. The identification of Y as Gold seems the most chemically sound deduction due to the reaction with xenon. The existence of multiple binary fluorides also fits well.\n\nLet's re-read the problem carefully: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\nThis is a synthesis description. Let's search for reactions of gold fluorides.\nA known reaction is the thermal decomposition of AuF₃: 2AuF₃ → AuF + AuF₅. This doesn't fit the description.\nAnother is the comproportionation: AuF₃ + 2Au → 3AuF. This is a 1:2 ratio, not 1:1.\n\nWhat if the element is Platinum (Pt)?\nPt also forms multiple fluorides (PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, PtF₆). PtF₆ is famous for oxidizing xenon.\nLet's check the fluorine percentage for PtF₅. M(PtF₅) = 195.08 + 5*19 = 290.08. %F = (95/290.08)*100 = 32.75%. This is also close to 31.96%.\nLet's check PtF₄. M(PtF₄) = 195.08 + 4*19 = 271.08. %F = (76/271.08)*100 = 28.04%.\nThe value 31.96% fits PtF₅ or AuF₅ reasonably well.\n\nLet's assume Y=Pt.\nA1 = PtF₆ (decomposes to PtF₅ + F)\nA2 = PtF₅ (%F = 32.75%, close to 31.96%)\nA3 = PtF₆ (oxidizes xenon, formed by fluorination of Pt)\nReaction: Pt + A4 -> A5 (1:1 ratio)\nKnown Pt fluorides are PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, PtF₆.\nIf A4 = PtF₄, then Pt + PtF₄ -> 2PtF₂. This is a 1:1 reaction.\nSo, A4 could be PtF₄ and A5 could be PtF₂.\nLet's check the molecular weight of A4 = PtF₄.\nMW(PtF₄) = 195.08 + 4 * 19.00 = 195.08 + 76 = 271.08 g/mol.\nThis value does not fit any of the ranges.\n\nLet's go back to Y=Au. The %F for AuF₅ (32.54%) is closer to the given value (31.96%) than PtF₅ (32.75%) is.\nA1: AuF₇ (or complex)\nA2: AuF₅\nA3: AuF₅\nA4: ?\nA5: ?\nReaction: Au + A4 -> A5 (1:1)\nThe known binary fluorides of gold are AuF, AuF₃, AuF₅. A theoretical AuF₆ has also been discussed.\nIf A4 is a complex fluoride, the problem becomes much harder. The problem states \"binary compounds of fluorine\".\nLet's reconsider the reaction AuF₃ + 2Au → 3AuF. The stoichiometry is 1:2.\nWhat if the \"solution of A4\" is key? Perhaps A4 is not the fluoride itself but a complex in solution. However, the problem refers to \"five binary compounds\".\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in the reaction ratio and it is indeed the comproportionation of Au and AuF₃.\nIf A4 = AuF₃, its molecular weight is ~254 g/mol. This is not in the options.\nIf A5 = AuF₃, then Au + A4 -> AuF₃. A4 would have to be something like AuF₅. Then Au + AuF₅ -> ? Not a simple 1:1 to get AuF₃.\n\nLet's reconsider the initial calculation.\nAr(Y) = 40.4493 * n\nIf n=4, Ar(Y) = 161.79. This is very close to Terbium (Tb, 162.5) or Dysprosium (Dy, 162.5). However, their fluorides (like TbF₆ or DyF₆) are not known to be bright red and oxidize xenon. Their stable oxidation state is +3.\nIf n=3, Ar(Y) = 121.35. This is very close to Antimony (Sb, 121.76). SbF₅ is a powerful Lewis acid and fluorinating agent, but it does not oxidize xenon under normal conditions.\nThe xenon oxidation is the strongest clue, pointing towards Pt, Au, or maybe Ru or Rh.\n\nLet's stick with Gold (Au) as the most plausible candidate and assume there is an error in the provided options or the reaction stoichiometry.\nA1: AuF₇ (complex)\nA2: AuF₅ (MW=292, %F=32.5%)\nA3: AuF₅\nA4: AuF₃ (MW=254)\nA5: AuF (MW=216)\n\nNone of the molecular weights for the simple binary fluorides of gold fit the options directly.\nLet's look at the options again:\nA) 160-180\nB) 220-240\nC) 140-160\nD) 110-130\n\nWhat if A4 is a dimer or a complex? The problem says \"binary compounds\". Gold pentafluoride is dimeric in the solid state, Au₂F₁₀. Its monomeric formula is AuF₅.\nMW(Au₂F₁₀) = 583.9 g/mol.\nGold trifluoride, AuF₃, is polymeric.\n\nLet's reconsider the reaction: Y + A4 -> A5 (1:1).\nWhat if A4 is an adduct? For example, BrF₃·AuF₃ is known. But this is not a binary compound of Y and F.\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in the question and A5 is the substance whose molecular weight is sought.\nMW(A5 = AuF) = 196.97 + 19.00 = 215.97 g/mol. This is also not in the ranges.\n\nLet's reconsider the reaction: Au + A4 -> A5 (1:1).\nWhat if A5 is a mixed-valence compound?\nWhat if A4 is not a simple fluoride? The problem says \"Five binary compounds... are known\". It doesn't say A1-A5 are all of them, or that they are all different. We have identified A2=A3=AuF₅. So we have AuF₇, AuF₅, AuF₃, AuF. That's four. What is the fifth? Maybe AuF₂ or a different one.\n\nLet's assume the answer lies in one of the options.\nIf MW(A4) is in range B) 220-240.\nThis doesn't match any simple AuF_n compound.\nAuF₂: MW = 197 + 38 = 235 g/mol. This falls in range B.\nIs AuF₂ a known binary compound? It is mentioned as an intermediate or in complexes, but its existence as a stable binary compound is less established than the others. However, let's test this hypothesis.\nIf A4 = AuF₂ (MW=235).\nReaction: Au + AuF₂ -> A5 (1:1). This would give \"Au₂F₂\" or 2AuF.\nSo, A5 = AuF. This is chemically plausible.\nLet's check the other clues.\nA1 decomposes to A2.\nA1 oxidizes Xe. -> A1 is a high-valent fluoride, e.g., AuF₅ or higher.\nA2 has %F = 31.96%. Let's check %F in AuF₂. (38/235)*100 = 16.17%. No.\nLet's check %F in AuF. (19/216)*100 = 8.8%. No.\nThe compound with %F=31.96% must be A2. And our calculation showed A2 is most likely AuF₅.\n\nSo we have:\nY = Au\nA2 = AuF₅\nA1 = A species that decomposes to AuF₅ (e.g., AuF₇ complex)\nA3 = AuF₅\nReaction: Au + A4 -> A5 (1:1)\nA5 decomposes in water.\n\nIf the reaction is Au + AuF₃ -> 2AuF, the molar ratio is 1:1 between Au and AuF₃ if we consider the product to be 2AuF. But the problem says a 1:1 molar ratio is *added*. This usually implies reactants.\nLet's assume the reaction is Au + A4 -> A5 and A4 = AuF₃. This is a 1:1 addition. What is A5? A5 would be Au₂F₃. Is this a known compound? It is not one of the commonly cited binary gold fluorides.\n\nThere seems to be an inconsistency in the problem statement's data (the %F, the reaction ratio, and the final options). However, the chemical properties strongly point to Gold. Let's re-evaluate the molecular weights and options.\nMW(AuF) = 216\nMW(AuF₂) = 235\nMW(AuF₃) = 254\nMW(AuF₅) = 292\n\nThe range B) 220-240 contains MW(AuF₂) = 235.\nIf we assume A4 is AuF₂, the reaction Au + AuF₂ -> 2AuF (1:1 reactant ratio) makes sense, and A5 is AuF.\nBut this contradicts the identification of A2 from the mass percentage.\n\nLet's assume the mass percentage refers to a different compound.\nIf A2 = AuF₃, %F = (57/254)*100 = 22.4%. No.\nIf A2 = AuF, %F = 8.8%. No.\n\nLet's trust the xenon oxidation and the mass percentage as the strongest clues.\nY = Au, A2 = AuF₅.\nThis means the other fluorides are AuF, AuF₃, and maybe AuF₂ and AuF₇.\nThe question asks for the MW of A4. The options are 110-130, 140-160, 160-180, 220-240.\nNone of the MWs (216, 235, 254, 292) fit except for 235 (AuF₂) which is in the 220-240 range.\nIf A4 is AuF₂, then the puzzle must fit together.\n- Five binary compounds: AuF, AuF₂, AuF₃, AuF₅, AuF₇(complex). This is plausible.\n- A1 (AuF₇) decomposes to A2 (?) and fluorine. If A2 is AuF₅, this works.\n- A2 has %F = 31.96%. This points to AuF₅.\n- A1 oxidizes xenon. AuF₇/AuF₅ do.\n- A3 (AuF₅) interacts with xenon.\n- Reaction: Au + A4(AuF₂) -> A5(2AuF) in a 1:1 ratio. This works.\n- A5 (AuF) decomposes in water. This is true.\n\nThe only contradiction is that A2 must be AuF₅ based on the mass percentage, but the decomposition of A1 (AuF₇) would be AuF₇ -> AuF₅ + F₂. The problem says A1 -> A2 + F₂. So A2 is AuF₅.\nThe entire logical chain seems to hold if we accept AuF₂ as one of the five binary compounds and that it is A4. The molecular weight of AuF₂ is ~235 g/mol, which falls in the range 220-240.\n\nFinal check:\n- Element Y: Gold (Au)\n- A1: AuF₇ (or AuF₅·F₂)\n- A2: AuF₅ (from decomposition of A1 and %F data)\n- A3: AuF₅ (interacts with Xe)\n- A4: AuF₂ (to fit the MW options and reaction stoichiometry)\n- A5: AuF (from reaction of Au + AuF₂)\n- The five compounds are AuF, AuF₂, AuF₃, AuF₅, AuF₇. This seems to be the intended set.\n- The molecular weight of A4 (AuF₂) is 196.97 + 2*19.00 = 234.97 g/mol.\n- This value falls within the range 220-240.\n\n<<<B>>>"
