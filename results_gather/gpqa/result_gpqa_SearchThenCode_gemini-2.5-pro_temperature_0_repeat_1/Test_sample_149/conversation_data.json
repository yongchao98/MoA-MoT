    "The final answer is C. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n**Step 1: Identification of the Starting Material**\n\nThe molecular formula is C8H9NO, and the degree of unsaturation is 5. This suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (C=O or C=C).\n\nThe 1H-NMR data is interpreted as follows:\n*   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet splitting indicates it is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n*   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region are indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n*   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical for a primary amine group (-NH2).\n*   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet for two protons, coupled to the aldehyde proton, confirms the -CH2-CHO fragment.\n\nCombining these pieces, the starting compound is identified as **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n1.  **NaNO2 + HCl:** These reagents are used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The amino group (-NH2) on the benzene ring is converted into a diazonium salt group (-N2+Cl-). The intermediate is **4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride**.\n\n2.  **H2O:** Adding water to the diazonium salt, typically with gentle heating, results in the hydrolysis of the diazonium group, replacing it with a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This reaction forms **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n3.  **aq. KOH, Heat:** This step involves a strong base (KOH) and heat, which are the classic conditions for an aldol condensation. 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde can react with itself in a self-condensation reaction.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The base removes a proton from the α-carbon (the CH2 group) of one molecule to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. After protonation, this forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option B).\n    *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The application of heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. This dehydration forms a double bond between the α and β carbons, resulting in a more stable, conjugated system. The final product is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n**Step 3: Identification of the Final Product**\n\nThe dehydration of the intermediate, 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal, leads to the formation of **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This corresponds to option C. The heat supplied in the final step ensures the reaction proceeds to the more stable condensation product rather than stopping at the aldol adduct.\n\n<<<C>>>"
