    "To estimate the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds for detection with ground-based optical telescopes, we must consider the wavelength at which Earth's atmosphere becomes transparent to light and the rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha transition.\n\nThe Lyman-alpha (Ly-α) transition of neutral hydrogen has a rest wavelength of approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å) or 121.6 nanometers. This wavelength falls within the ultraviolet (UV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Earth's atmosphere is largely opaque to UV radiation, meaning this light is absorbed by the atmosphere and does not reach ground-based telescopes.\n\nFor a celestial object's light to be detected by a ground-based optical telescope, its wavelength must be \"redshifted\" into the optical atmospheric window. This window is the range of wavelengths that can pass through the atmosphere, which begins at approximately 3500-4000 Å. The process of redshift stretches the light's wavelength to longer, redder wavelengths due to the expansion of the universe.\n\nThe relationship between the observed wavelength (λ_observed), the rest wavelength (λ_rest), and the redshift (z) is given by the formula:\n\n1 + z = λ_observed / λ_rest\n\nTo find the minimum redshift, we set the observed wavelength to the minimum wavelength that can penetrate the atmosphere, which we'll take as approximately 3500 Å.\n\nUsing the values:\n*   λ_rest = 1216 Å\n*   λ_observed = 3500 Å\n\nWe can calculate the redshift (z):\n\nz = (λ_observed / λ_rest) - 1\nz = (3500 Å / 1216 Å) - 1\nz ≈ 2.878 - 1\nz ≈ 1.878\n\nThis calculated redshift value is very close to 1.9. Therefore, the neutral hydrogen clouds must have a redshift of at least 1.9 for their Lyman-alpha absorption feature to be shifted into the visible spectrum and be detectable by ground-based optical telescopes.\n\n<<<A>>>"
