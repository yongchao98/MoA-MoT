    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the number of hydrogen signals in the final product's ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Reaction Sequence Analysis\n\n1.  **Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n    *   Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is treated with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride. This is a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction, which causes the alpha-halogenation of the carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Product 1** is α-bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n    *   Product 1 (BrCH₂COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a Fischer esterification reaction.\n    *   **Product 2** is ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n    *   Product 2 (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   **Product 3** is ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n    *   Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH₂)₅-Br). This is an intramolecular cyclization reaction known as the Thorpe-Ziegler reaction.\n    *   First, NaH removes an acidic proton from the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate.\n    *   The resulting carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromide ion.\n    *   Since excess NaH is used, it deprotonates the remaining acidic proton on the α-carbon of the newly formed intermediate.\n    *   This second carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 attack on the other end of the pentane chain, displacing the second bromide ion and forming a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4** is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 4\n\nThe final product is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**. To determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule consists of a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethyl carboxylate group (-COOCH₂CH₃) attached to the same carbon atom (C1).\n\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, its two substituents, and the opposite carbon, C4. This symmetry makes the two halves of the ring chemically equivalent.\n\nLet's count the chemically distinct sets of hydrogens:\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-COOCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-O-**CH₂**-CH₃) are equivalent to each other but distinct from all other protons. This gives **one signal**.\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-O-CH₂-**CH₃**) are equivalent to each other. This gives a second, distinct **signal**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n    *   Due to the plane of symmetry, the protons on C2 are equivalent to the protons on C6, and the protons on C3 are equivalent to those on C5.\n    *   On any given carbon of the cyclohexane ring (that is not C1), the two attached protons (one axial, one equatorial in the chair conformation) are diastereotopic. This means they are in different chemical environments and are not equivalent.\n    *   **C2 and C6 Protons:** There are four protons in total. The two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) are equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons are equivalent to each other. This results in **two distinct signals**.\n    *   **C3 and C5 Protons:** Similarly, the four protons on these carbons give rise to **two distinct signals** (one for the two axial protons, one for the two equatorial protons).\n    *   **C4 Protons:** The two protons on C4 are also diastereotopic and not equivalent to any other protons in the molecule. This gives another **two distinct signals**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nAdding them all up:\n*   2 signals from the ethyl group.\n*   6 signals from the cyclohexane ring (2 from C2/C6, 2 from C3/C5, and 2 from C4).\n\nTotal = 2 + 6 = **8 distinct hydrogen signals**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
