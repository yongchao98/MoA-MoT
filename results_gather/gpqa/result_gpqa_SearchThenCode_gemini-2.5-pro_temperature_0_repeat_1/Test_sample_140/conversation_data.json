    "The reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in condensed ammonia is a classic example of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a benzyne intermediate. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of possible organic products:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe strong base, amide anion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions:\n*   **Position 6, which has a hydrogen (H) atom.**\n*   **Position 2, which has a deuterium (D) atom.**\n\nDue to the kinetic isotope effect, a C-H bond is weaker and broken more easily than a C-D bond. This means two different elimination pathways are possible, leading to two different benzyne intermediates:\n\n1.  **Major Pathway (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion, forming a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom remains at position 2. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n2.  **Minor Pathway (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. This is a slower process but still possible. The elimination of the bromide ion results in a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium was removed, this intermediate is the non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the highly reactive triple bond in each benzyne intermediate. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Addition to 3-deuterobenzyne (from the major pathway):**\n    *   Attack at C1: The amino group attaches to C1, and subsequent protonation at C6 yields **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   Attack at C6: The amino group attaches to C6, and subsequent protonation at C1 yields **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Addition to benzyne (from the minor pathway):**\n    *   Attack at either C1 or C2 of the symmetrical benzyne intermediate, followed by protonation, yields a single product: **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the products from both possible pathways, we find three distinct organic products:\n1.  2-deuterioaniline\n2.  3-deuterioaniline\n3.  Aniline\n\nTherefore, there are three possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
