    "To determine the time it will take for the astronaut to reach Earth from their perspective, we need to use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n**1. Determine the Distance:**\nThe destination is Earth, and the starting point is the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately 163,000 light-years.\n\n**2. Calculate Travel Time from Earth's Perspective:**\nFirst, we calculate the time it would take for the spacecraft to travel this distance as measured by an observer on Earth.\n*   **Distance (d):** 163,000 light-years\n*   **Velocity (v):** 0.99999987 * c (where c is the speed of light)\n\nTime (t) = Distance / Velocity\nt = 163,000 light-years / (0.99999987 * c)\nSince a light-year is the distance light travels in a year, the time is:\nt ≈ 163,000.02 years\n\nFrom an observer on Earth's point of view, the journey takes just over 163,000 years.\n\n**3. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\nThe Lorentz factor is a key component of the time dilation formula and depends on the spacecraft's velocity.\nThe formula is: γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n*   v/c = 0.99999987\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.99999987²)\n*   γ ≈ 1 / √(1 - 0.99999974)\n*   γ ≈ 1 / √0.00000026\n*   γ ≈ 1 / 0.0005099\n*   γ ≈ 1961.17\n\n**4. Calculate Time from the Astronaut's Perspective (Proper Time):**\nTime dilation means that time passes slower for the moving astronaut relative to a stationary observer on Earth. The formula for the time experienced by the astronaut (t') is:\nt' = t / γ\n*   t' ≈ 163,000.02 years / 1961.17\n*   t' ≈ 83.11 years\n\n**5. Determine if the Astronaut Survives:**\nThe astronaut is 22 years old when the journey begins. The trip will take approximately 83.11 years from their perspective.\n*   Astronaut's age upon arrival = 22 + 83.11 = 105.11 years.\nThe average lifetime of the alien species is 150 years. Since 105.11 is less than 150, the astronaut will survive the journey. This eliminates option C.\n\n**6. Conclusion:**\nThe calculated travel time for the astronaut is approximately 83.11 years. Looking at the options provided:\nA) 72 years\nB) 81 years\nC) The astronaut will die before reaching to the Earth.\nD) 77 years\n\nThe calculated value of ~83 years is closest to 81 years. The minor difference can be attributed to using a slightly different value for the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud when the problem was formulated. Based on the calculations, 81 years is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
