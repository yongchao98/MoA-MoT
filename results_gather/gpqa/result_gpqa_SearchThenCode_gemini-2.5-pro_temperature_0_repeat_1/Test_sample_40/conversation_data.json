    "This problem requires the application of the relativistic velocity addition formula.\n\nHere's a step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Identify the reference frames.** We have the laboratory frame (observer) and the moving frame of the glass.\n2.  **Determine the velocity of the glass.** The glass is moving with a velocity `v` relative to the laboratory.\n3.  **Determine the speed of light within the glass.** The speed of light in a medium with a refractive index `n` is given by `u' = c/n`. Since the problem states that the speed of light in a vacuum `c=1`, the speed of light within the glass, as measured in the glass's own reference frame, is `u' = 1/n`.\n4.  **Apply the relativistic velocity addition formula.** The formula for adding velocities in special relativity is:\n\n    `u = (v + u') / (1 + v*u'/c^2)`\n\n    Where:\n    *   `u` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) relative to the stationary observer (the laboratory).\n    *   `v` is the velocity of the moving reference frame (the glass) relative to the stationary observer.\n    *   `u'` is the velocity of the object relative to the moving reference frame.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\n5.  **Substitute the known values into the formula.** We have `v = v`, `u' = 1/n`, and `c = 1`.\n\n    `u = (v + 1/n) / (1 + v*(1/n)/1^2)`\n\n6.  **Simplify the expression.**\n\n    `u = (v + 1/n) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To get rid of the fractions in the numerator and denominator, multiply both by `n`:\n\n    `u = n * (v + 1/n) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (n*v + 1) / (n + v)`\n\n7.  **Compare the result with the given options.** The derived expression `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)` matches option C.\n\nThis result is a direct consequence of Einstein's theory of special relativity and correctly describes the speed of light in a moving medium as observed from a stationary frame. This phenomenon was experimentally verified in the Fizeau experiment.\n\n<<<C>>>"
