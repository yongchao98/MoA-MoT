    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** An absorption peak for an ester group (-COO-) is present. This functional group contains one carbon and two oxygen atoms.\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. The base structure is a benzene ring with two substituents, which corresponds to a C₆H₄ fragment.\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** The presence of two signals for the four aromatic protons suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern on the benzene ring, which results in a symmetrical structure.\n    *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals):** There are two hydrogens on a carbon-carbon double bond. The splitting patterns are key:\n        *   A **doublet of quartets (dq)** indicates a hydrogen that is split by one adjacent hydrogen (doublet) and by a group of three hydrogens, like a methyl group (quartet).\n        *   A **doublet (d)** indicates a hydrogen that is split by only one adjacent hydrogen.\n        *   This splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). The hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group appears as a doublet of quartets, and the other vinyl hydrogen appears as a doublet.\n    *   **-CH₃ Groups (2 signals):** There are two distinct methyl groups. One belongs to the propenyl group identified above. The other must be part of the ester group (e.g., a methyl ester or an acetate).\n    *   **No -CH₂ Groups:** The absence of any methylene (-CH₂) signals is a crucial constraint for the final structure.\n\n### 2. Assemble the Molecular Fragments\n\nBased on the analysis, we can identify the following pieces of the molecule:\n\n1.  **Aromatic Ring:** C₆H₄\n2.  **Substituent 1 (from vinyl and one CH₃ signal):** A propenyl group, -CH=CH-CH₃. This fragment has the formula C₃H₅.\n3.  **Substituent 2 (from FTIR and the second CH₃ signal):** An ester group containing a methyl group. To avoid having a -CH₂- group, this must be either a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate group (-OCOCH₃). Both of these fragments have the formula C₂H₃O₂.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Chemical Formula\n\nNow, we add up the atoms from all the identified fragments to determine the molecular formula:\n\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from C₃H₅) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **11 carbons**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from C₃H₅) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **12 hydrogens**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **2 oxygens**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ matches the spectral data perfectly. It accounts for the di-substituted aromatic ring, the ester group, the propenyl group with its specific NMR splitting pattern, two distinct methyl groups, and the absence of any methylene groups. Comparing this to the given options, it corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
