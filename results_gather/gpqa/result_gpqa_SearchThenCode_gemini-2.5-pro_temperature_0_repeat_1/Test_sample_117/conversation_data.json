    "The reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine is an example of an alpha-halogenation of a ketone, which proceeds through an enol intermediate. Enols, which feature a hydroxyl group attached to a carbon-carbon double bond, are the reactive intermediates in this type of reaction.\n\nThe mechanism involves the following steps:\n1.  The starting material, 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, is the enol form of 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.\n2.  The electron-rich double bond of the enol acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic bromine (Br₂).\n3.  This attack results in the formation of a new carbon-bromine bond at the alpha-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the one bearing the hydroxyl group).\n4.  Simultaneously, the enol's hydroxyl group is deprotonated to form a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\nIn the case of 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, the double bond is between C1 (with the -OH group) and C2. The bromine atom will add to the C2 position, and the C1 will become a carbonyl. This results in the formation of 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. This reaction is a common method for synthesizing α-halo ketones.\n\nOptions A and B describe dibromo-alcohols, which would be the product of a standard electrophilic addition to an alkene, but the reactivity of the enol functional group favors alpha-halogenation. Option C is incorrect because bromination occurs at the activated alpha-position, not the C4 position.\n\nTherefore, the major product is 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.\n\n<<<D>>>"
