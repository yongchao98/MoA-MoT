    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided experimental data:\n\n1.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:** The spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. These peaks have similar chemical shifts and a combined integral of one proton. This indicates the presence of two different chemical environments for that specific proton. Since spin-spin coupling has been ruled out, the two environments must arise from two different species being present in the sample in roughly equal amounts.\n\n2.  **Analyze the LC-MS Data:** The liquid chromatography (LC) separates the crude mixture into two distinct peaks of equal intensity. The mass spectrometry (MS) analysis shows that both of these peaks correspond to compounds with the same mass, and this mass is consistent with the expected peptidic product. This confirms that the two species are isomers of the target molecule, not impurities or precursors with different chemical formulas.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n\n    *   **B) Mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical and chemical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by standard liquid chromatography (which typically uses an achiral stationary phase) and they would give identical signals in a standard 1H NMR spectrum. The observations of two peaks in both the LC and the NMR spectrum rule out this option.\n\n    *   **C) Contamination with a precursor:** A precursor from the synthesis would almost certainly have a different molecular weight from the final product. The MS data shows both separated peaks have the same, expected mass, which contradicts this explanation.\n\n    *   **D) 'Double coupling':** This is not a standard term in peptide chemistry. If it were to mean a side reaction creating a product with a different structure (e.g., coupling of an extra amino acid), the mass would be different. If it is meant to describe epimerization (a change in stereochemistry at one chiral center) during the coupling reaction, this would result in the formation of diastereomers. Therefore, this option is either incorrect due to the mass data or is simply a cause for the situation described in option A.\n\n    *   **A) Mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical properties and are expected to behave differently in both NMR spectroscopy and chromatography.\n        *   **NMR:** Diastereomers have distinct NMR spectra, so it is expected that corresponding protons in two different diastereomers would have different chemical shifts. This is consistent with observing two peaks for the alpha-proton.\n        *   **LC-MS:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereomers can often be separated by standard chromatography techniques like LC. The observation of two peaks with identical mass is the classic sign of a diastereomeric mixture.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe experimental evidence strongly points to the presence of two diastereomers in a roughly 1:1 ratio. A very common reason for this in peptidic compounds is the restricted rotation around an amide (peptide) bond, leading to stable *cis* and *trans* isomers. Because peptides contain chiral centers (the alpha-carbons of the amino acids), these *cis/trans* isomers are diastereomeric to each other. This phenomenon is also known as atropisomerism. The two species are stable enough to be separated on the chromatography timescale and to give distinct signals on the NMR timescale.\n\nTherefore, the most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n<<<A>>>"
