    "To solve this problem, we will first calculate the relative speed of the two astronauts using the relativistic velocity addition formula. Then, we will determine the total energy of the system by summing the individual relativistic energies of each astronaut.\n\n### 1. Relative Speed (v_rel)\n\nFor objects moving in the same direction, the relativistic formula for relative velocity is:\n\nv_rel = (v₁ - v₂) / (1 - (v₁ * v₂) / c²)\n\nGiven:\n*   Velocity of the first astronaut (v₁) = 0.6 c\n*   Velocity of the second astronaut (v₂) = 0.5 c\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nv_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\nv_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)\nv_rel = 0.1c / 0.7\n**v_rel ≈ 0.14c**\n\n### 2. Total Energy (E)\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic particle is given by the formula E = γmc², where γ (the Lorentz factor) is 1 / √(1 - v²/c²). The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the two astronauts.\n\n**Astronaut 1:**\n*   Mass (m₁) = 2m\n*   Velocity (v₁) = 0.6c\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ₁) for the first astronaut:\nγ₁ = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.36) = 1 / √0.64 = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\n\nNow, calculate the energy (E₁) of the first astronaut:\nE₁ = γ₁ * m₁ * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = 2.5 mc²\n\n**Astronaut 2:**\n*   Mass (m₂) = 3m\n*   Velocity (v₂) = 0.5c\n\nNext, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ₂) for the second astronaut:\nγ₂ = 1 / √(1 - (0.5c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.25) = 1 / √0.75 ≈ 1 / 0.866 ≈ 1.1547\n\nNow, calculate the energy (E₂) of the second astronaut:\nE₂ = γ₂ * m₂ * c² ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c² ≈ 3.464 mc²\n\n**Total System Energy:**\nThe total energy (E) is the sum of E₁ and E₂:\nE = E₁ + E₂ = 2.5 mc² + 3.464 mc²\n**E ≈ 5.96 mc²**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately 0.14c, and the total energy of the system is approximately 5.96 mc². These results match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
