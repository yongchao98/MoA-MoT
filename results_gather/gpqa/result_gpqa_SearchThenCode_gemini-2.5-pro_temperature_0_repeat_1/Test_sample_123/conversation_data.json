    "The problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and its effect on particle decay. The search results confirm the relevant physics concepts.\n\n*   **Exponential Decay Law**: The number of particles, N, remaining from an initial sample, N₀, after a time, t, follows the exponential decay law N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t/τ), where τ is the proper mean lifetime of the particle.\n*   **Time Dilation**: For a particle moving at a relativistic speed, its internal clock runs slower as observed from the lab frame. The lifetime as measured in the lab, t_lab, is related to the proper lifetime, τ, by the Lorentz factor, γ (gamma). The lab-frame lifetime is t_lab = γτ.\n*   **Relativistic Decay in Lab Frame**: Combining these, the number of particles remaining after a time t_lab in the lab frame is N(t_lab) = N₀ * exp(-t_lab / (γτ)).\n*   **Distance and Time**: For ultra-relativistic particles, their velocity, v, is approximately the speed of light, c. The time taken to travel a distance, d, in the lab is t_lab ≈ d/c.\n\nThis allows us to write the fraction of surviving particles as a function of distance d:\nN(d)/N₀ = exp(-d / (γ * c * τ))\n\nHere is the step-by-step solution:\n\n**1. Analyze the Initial Scenario**\n\nWe are given:\n*   Fraction of surviving particles (N₁/N₀) = 1/3\n*   Distance traveled (d) = 30 m\n*   Initial Lorentz factor (γ₁) = 20\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 * cτ))\n\nTo solve for the unknown proper decay length (cτ), we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\nln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * cτ)\n-ln(3) = -1.5 / (cτ)\nln(3) = 1.5 / (cτ)\n\nThis gives us a relationship for the constant term cτ:\ncτ = 1.5 / ln(3)\n\n**2. Analyze the Target Scenario**\n\nWe need to find the new Lorentz factor (γ₂) that results in a different fraction of surviving particles:\n*   Fraction of surviving particles (N₂/N₀) = 2/3\n*   Distance traveled (d) = 30 m\n\nUsing the same decay equation:\n2/3 = exp(-30 / (γ₂ * cτ))\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\nln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)\n-ln(3/2) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)\nln(1.5) = 30 / (γ₂ * cτ)\n\n**3. Solve for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂)**\n\nNow we have two equations:\n1.  cτ = 1.5 / ln(3)\n2.  ln(1.5) = 30 / (γ₂ * cτ)\n\nSubstitute the expression for cτ from the first equation into the second one:\nln(1.5) = 30 / (γ₂ * [1.5 / ln(3)])\nln(1.5) = (30 * ln(3)) / (1.5 * γ₂)\nln(1.5) = (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂\n\nNow, rearrange the equation to solve for γ₂:\nγ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)\n\nUsing the approximate values for the natural logarithms (ln(3) ≈ 1.0986 and ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055):\nγ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)\nγ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709\nγ₂ ≈ 54.18\n\nThis value is very close to 54.\n\n<<<C>>>"
