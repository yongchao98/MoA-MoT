    "To determine what is most likely observed with the specified absorption line in the Milky Way, a multi-step analysis is required.\n\nFirst, it is essential to identify the rest-frame energy of the observed absorption line. The observation is made of a structure at a cosmological distance of 2.1 gigaparsecs (Gpc), which means the detected energy of 3.9 micro-electron volts (µeV) has been affected by the expansion of the universe, an effect known as redshift.\n\nThe redshift (z) can be estimated from the distance using the Hubble-Lemaître law. A distance of 2.1 Gpc corresponds to a significant redshift. The relationship between the observed energy (E_obs) and the rest-frame energy (E_rest) is given by the formula: E_rest = E_obs * (1 + z).\n\nCalculating the precise redshift:\n*   A distance of 2.1 Gpc (2100 Mpc) and a standard Hubble constant of approximately 70 km/s/Mpc gives a recession velocity (v) of about 147,000 km/s.\n*   This velocity corresponds to a redshift (z) of approximately 0.5.\n*   Using this redshift, the rest-frame energy is calculated as: 3.9 µeV * (1 + 0.5) = 5.85 µeV.\n\nThis calculated rest-frame energy of approximately 5.87 µeV is famously associated with the 21-cm line of neutral hydrogen. This spectral line arises from the hyperfine transition in the ground state of a hydrogen atom, which occurs when the spin of the electron flips relative to the spin of the proton.\n\nThe 21-cm line is a cornerstone of radio astronomy because it allows astronomers to map the distribution and properties of neutral hydrogen (HI) throughout galaxies, including our own Milky Way. This radiation can penetrate interstellar dust clouds that obscure observations in visible light.\n\nThe interstellar medium (ISM) is composed of different phases. The 21-cm line is particularly crucial for tracing the Cold Neutral Medium (CNM), which consists of cold, dense filaments of atomic hydrogen. While warmer atomic gas also contains neutral hydrogen, absorption lines are more prominently weighted toward colder gas. The conditions in the cold atomic ISM, with temperatures around 100 K, are ideal for observing this transition. Molecular media, by contrast, are characterized by the presence of molecules like H₂ and are studied using different spectral lines.\n\nTherefore, an absorption line with a rest-frame energy corresponding to the 21-cm line is a primary indicator of the cold atomic interstellar medium.\n\n<<<C>>>"
