    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Frames of Reference**\n\n*   **Galaxy's Frame (S):** This is the stationary frame of reference. We want to find the distance traveled by the ejecta as measured in this frame.\n*   **Ejecta's Frame (S'):** This is the moving frame of reference. The time of 50 seconds is measured in this frame.\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information**\n\n*   The relative velocity between the two frames (v) is 60,000 km/s.\n*   The time elapsed in the ejecta's frame (the proper time, Δt') is 50 s.\n*   The speed of light (c) is approximately 300,000 km/s.\n\n**3. Apply the Principle of Time Dilation**\n\nAccording to Einstein's theory of special relativity, time passes slower for a moving object (the ejecta) as measured by a stationary observer (in the Galaxy's frame). This effect is called time dilation.\n\nThe formula for time dilation is:\nΔt = γ * Δt'\n\nWhere:\n*   Δt is the time elapsed in the stationary frame (Galaxy's frame).\n*   Δt' is the time elapsed in the moving frame (ejecta's frame), which is 50 s.\n*   γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n**4. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\n\nThe Lorentz factor is calculated using the formula:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nFirst, let's find the ratio of the ejecta's velocity to the speed of light:\nv/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2\n\nNow, substitute this into the Lorentz factor formula:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04)\nγ = 1 / √(0.96)\nγ ≈ 1.02062\n\n**5. Calculate the Time Elapsed in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt)**\n\nNow we can find the time that passes in the Galaxy's frame:\nΔt = γ * Δt'\nΔt ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s\nΔt ≈ 51.031 s\n\nThis means that while 50 seconds pass for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy's reference frame would measure about 51.031 seconds.\n\n**6. Calculate the Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame**\n\nFinally, to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's frame, we multiply its velocity by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame:\nDistance (d) = v * Δt\nd = 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s\nd ≈ 3,061,860 km\n\n**7. Compare with the Options**\n\nThe calculated distance is approximately 3,061,860 km. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) 3,060,000 km\nB) 2,880,000 km\nC) 3,000,000 km (This would be the answer if relativistic effects were ignored)\nD) 2,940,000 km\n\nThe calculated value is closest to option A. The small difference is due to rounding.\n\n<<<A>>>"
