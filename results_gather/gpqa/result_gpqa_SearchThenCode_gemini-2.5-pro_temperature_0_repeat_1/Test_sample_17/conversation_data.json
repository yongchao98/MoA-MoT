    "To calculate the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we will use the provided elemental abundance data. The notation [X/Y] represents the logarithmic abundance ratio of element X to element Y in a star, compared to the same ratio in the Sun.\n\nThe formula is:\n[X/Y] = log₁₀(Nₓ/Nᵧ)ₛₜₐᵣ - log₁₀(Nₓ/Nᵧ)ₛᵤₙ\nwhere Nₓ and Nᵧ are the number of atoms of elements X and Y, respectively.\n\nOur goal is to find the ratio of the silicon abundance in Star 1 to that in Star 2, which can be expressed as (Nₛᵢ/Nₕ)₁ / (Nₛᵢ/Nₕ)₂.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the silicon abundance for Star 1**\n\nWe are given the following for Star 1:\n*   [Fe/H]₁ = 0 dex\n*   [Si/Fe]₁ = 0.3 dex\n\nFrom the definition of [Fe/H]:\nlog₁₀(N₋ₑ/Nₕ)₁ - log₁₀(N₋ₑ/Nₕ)ₛᵤₙ = 0\nThis implies:\nlog₁₀(N₋ₑ/Nₕ)₁ = log₁₀(N₋ₑ/Nₕ)ₛᵤₙ\n\nFrom the definition of [Si/Fe]:\nlog₁₀(Nₛᵢ/N₋ₑ)₁ - log₁₀(Nₛᵢ/N₋ₑ)ₛᵤₙ = 0.3\nThis implies:\nlog₁₀(Nₛᵢ/N₋ₑ)₁ = 0.3 + log₁₀(Nₛᵢ/N₋ₑ)ₛᵤₙ\n\nWe can express the silicon-to-hydrogen abundance in Star 1 as:\nlog₁₀(Nₛᵢ/Nₕ)₁ = log₁₀(Nₛᵢ/N₋ₑ)₁ + log₁₀(N₋ₑ/Nₕ)₁\nSubstituting the relations above:\nlog₁₀(Nₛᵢ/Nₕ)₁ = (0.3 + log₁₀(Nₛᵢ/N₋ₑ)ₛᵤₙ) + (log₁₀(N₋ₑ/Nₕ)ₛᵤₙ)\nlog₁₀(Nₛᵢ/Nₕ)₁ = 0.3 + (log₁₀(Nₛᵢ/N₋ₑ)ₛᵤₙ + log₁₀(N₋ₑ/Nₕ)ₛᵤₙ)\nlog₁₀(Nₛᵢ/Nₕ)₁ = 0.3 + log₁₀(Nₛᵢ/Nₕ)ₛᵤₙ\n\n**Step 2: Determine the silicon abundance for Star 2**\n\nWe are given the following for Star 2:\n*   [Mg/H]₂ = 0 dex\n*   [Mg/Si]₂ = 0.3 dex\n\nFrom the definition of [Mg/H]:\nlog₁₀(Nₘ₉/Nₕ)₂ - log₁₀(Nₘ₉/Nₕ)ₛᵤₙ = 0\nThis implies:\nlog₁₀(Nₘ₉/Nₕ)₂ = log₁₀(Nₘ₉/Nₕ)ₛᵤₙ\n\nFrom the definition of [Mg/Si]:\nlog₁₀(Nₘ₉/Nₛᵢ)₂ - log₁₀(Nₘ₉/Nₛᵢ)ₛᵤₙ = 0.3\nThis implies:\nlog₁₀(Nₘ₉/Nₛᵢ)₂ = 0.3 + log₁₀(Nₘ₉/Nₛᵢ)ₛᵤₙ\n\nWe can express the silicon-to-hydrogen abundance in Star 2 by rearranging the magnesium-to-silicon ratio:\nlog₁₀(Nₛᵢ/Nₕ)₂ = log₁₀(Nₘ₉/Nₕ)₂ - log₁₀(Nₘ₉/Nₛᵢ)₂\nSubstituting the relations above:\nlog₁₀(Nₛᵢ/Nₕ)₂ = (log₁₀(Nₘ₉/Nₕ)ₛᵤₙ) - (0.3 + log₁₀(Nₘ₉/Nₛᵢ)ₛᵤₙ)\nlog₁₀(Nₛᵢ/Nₕ)₂ = log₁₀(Nₘ₉/Nₕ)ₛᵤₙ - 0.3 - (log₁₀(Nₘ₉/Nₕ)ₛᵤₙ - log₁₀(Nₛᵢ/Nₕ)ₛᵤₙ)\nlog₁₀(Nₛᵢ/Nₕ)₂ = -0.3 + log₁₀(Nₛᵢ/Nₕ)ₛᵤₙ\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the ratio of silicon abundances**\n\nWe need to find the ratio R = (Nₛᵢ/Nₕ)₁ / (Nₛᵢ/Nₕ)₂. To do this, we can subtract the logarithmic abundances:\nlog₁₀(R) = log₁₀((Nₛᵢ/Nₕ)₁) - log₁₀((Nₛᵢ/Nₕ)₂)\nlog₁₀(R) = (0.3 + log₁₀(Nₛᵢ/Nₕ)ₛᵤₙ) - (-0.3 + log₁₀(Nₛᵢ/Nₕ)ₛᵤₙ)\nlog₁₀(R) = 0.3 + 0.3\nlog₁₀(R) = 0.6\n\nTo find the ratio R, we calculate the antilogarithm:\nR = 10⁰.⁶\nR ≈ 3.981\n\nThis value is approximately 3.9. The information regarding the stellar masses, the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the Equivalent Width (EW) method, and the specific solar abundances of Iron and Magnesium are not required for this calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
