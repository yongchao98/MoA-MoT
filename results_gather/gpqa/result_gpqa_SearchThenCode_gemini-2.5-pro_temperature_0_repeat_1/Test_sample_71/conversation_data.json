    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product and the number of its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reaction Analysis\n\n1.  **Formation of Product 1:** The first step involves the reaction of 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene with 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at an elevated temperature. The reagent 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene is likely a precursor that generates a reactive diene in situ. A common and plausible interpretation, despite the potentially confusing name of the starting material, is the in-situ generation of *o*-xylylene (also known as *o*-quinodimethane). The standard precursor for *o*-xylylene is 1,2-bis(halomethyl)benzene, and it's reasonable to assume this is the intended reactive species. *o*-Xylylene then acts as a diene in a Diels-Alder reaction with the norbornadiene derivative, which serves as the dienophile. One of the two double bonds of the norbornadiene reacts to form a complex tetracyclic adduct, which is product **1**.\n\n2.  **Formation of Product 2:** Product **1** is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid. This is a standard method for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of a *tert*-butyl ether. The *tert*-butoxy group at the 7-position is cleaved to form a secondary alcohol (-OH) and *tert*-butanol. Product **2** is therefore the corresponding alcohol derivative of **1**.\n\n3.  **Formation of Product 3:** Product **2** is treated with sulfur trioxide pyridine complex (SO₃•py) in DMSO. This set of reagents is used for the Parikh-Doering oxidation, which converts primary and secondary alcohols to aldehydes and ketones, respectively, under mild conditions. The secondary alcohol at the 7-position of the bicyclic system is oxidized to a ketone (C=O). Product **3** is thus a tetracyclic ketone, which contains a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-7-one core structure.\n\n4.  **Formation of Final Product 4:** Product **3** is heated to 150°C. Polycyclic ketones containing the bicyclo[2.2.1]hepten-7-one or bicyclo[2.2.1]heptadien-7-one framework are known to undergo thermal retro-Diels-Alder reactions. In this case, the reaction proceeds via a retro-Diels-Alder pathway that regenerates the initial diene and dienophile components. The adduct **3** fragments back into *o*-xylylene and 7-ketonorbornadiene. The 7-ketonorbornadiene is itself thermally unstable and readily extrudes carbon monoxide (CO) in another retro-Diels-Alder reaction to form the very stable aromatic compound, benzene.\n\nThe final mixture of products consists of benzene, carbon monoxide, and *o*-xylylene. Since the question asks for the analysis of a single \"final product 4,\" it is logical to conclude that it refers to the major organic product of interest, *o*-xylylene, which is regenerated in the final step.\n\n### Analysis of Product 4 (o-Xylylene)\n\nThe structure of *o*-xylylene is 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze its symmetry. The molecule possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry that passes through the midpoints of the C1-C2 and C4-C5 bonds (using the cyclohexadiene numbering).\n\nThis symmetry makes pairs of hydrogen atoms equivalent:\n*   The two hydrogens on the inner part of the diene ring (at positions 2 and 3) are equivalent to each other.\n*   The two hydrogens on the outer part of the diene ring (at positions 1 and 4) are equivalent to each other.\n*   The exocyclic methylene (=CH₂) groups are equivalent due to the C₂ axis. Within each methylene group, the two hydrogen atoms are diastereotopic (one points \"in\" and one points \"out\" relative to the ring). Therefore, all \"in\" protons are equivalent, and all \"out\" protons are equivalent.\n\nThis results in four distinct sets of hydrogen atoms:\n1.  Two equivalent ring hydrogens (inner).\n2.  Two equivalent ring hydrogens (outer).\n3.  Two equivalent exocyclic methylene hydrogens (\"in\").\n4.  Two equivalent exocyclic methylene hydrogens (\"out\").\n\nTherefore, *o*-xylylene has 4 chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms, which would give rise to 4 signals in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>"
