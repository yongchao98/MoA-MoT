    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 3 and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Product 1\n\nToluene is treated with nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a classic electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction known as nitration. The methyl group (-CH₃) on toluene is an ortho-, para-directing group, meaning it directs the incoming nitro group (-NO₂) to the positions ortho (adjacent) and para (opposite) to it. The reaction yields a mixture of ortho-nitrotoluene and para-nitrotoluene. For the purpose of this multi-step synthesis, we will assume the major, less sterically hindered isomer, **p-nitrotoluene**, is carried forward as Product 1.\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2\n\nProduct 1 (p-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This combination of reagents acts as an oxidizing agent. While strong oxidizing agents like KMnO₄ readily convert the methyl group of p-nitrotoluene to a carboxylic acid (p-nitrobenzoic acid), the conditions with MnO₂/H₂SO₄ can be controlled to oxidize the benzylic methyl group to an aldehyde. This reaction would form **p-nitrobenzaldehyde** as Product 2. If the reaction were to proceed to the carboxylic acid, the subsequent reaction in step 3 would not proceed as described.\n\n### Step 3: Formation of Product 3\n\nProduct 2 (p-nitrobenzaldehyde) is treated with acetone ((CH₃)₂CO) and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This reaction is a base-catalyzed crossed-aldol condensation, specifically a Claisen-Schmidt condensation. The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) removes an acidic α-proton from acetone to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde. The resulting β-hydroxy ketone intermediate readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone. The final structure, Product 3, is **4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\n### Molecular Symmetry of Product 3\n\nTo determine the molecular symmetry group, we must analyze the symmetry elements of 4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\nThe structure is: O₂N-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃\n\nDue to the extensive conjugation between the phenyl ring, the double bond, and the carbonyl group, the most stable conformation of the molecule is planar.\n\n*   **Identity (E):** All molecules have this element.\n*   **Planes of Symmetry (σ):** Because the molecule is planar, the plane containing all the heavy atoms (and the hydrogens of the ring and double bond) is a plane of symmetry. A molecule that possesses only a plane of symmetry (in addition to the identity element) belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n*   **Axes of Rotation (Cₙ):** The molecule does not possess any C₂, C₃, or higher-order rotation axes.\n*   **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule does not have a center of inversion.\n\nSince the only symmetry element present besides the identity is a single plane of symmetry, the molecular symmetry group of Product 3 is Cₛ.\n\n<<<C>>>"
