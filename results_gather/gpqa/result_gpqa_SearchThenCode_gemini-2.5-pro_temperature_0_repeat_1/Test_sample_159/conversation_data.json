    "### Analysis of the Problem\n\nAn N-sided polygon with an infinitely large number of sides (N → ∞) and a constant apothem 'a' approximates a circle of radius 'a'. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the angular distance between the first two minima in the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern of a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n### Fraunhofer Diffraction by a Circular Aperture\n\nThe intensity distribution for Fraunhofer diffraction from a circular aperture is described by the Airy pattern. The angular positions of the minima (dark rings) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x).\n\nThe condition for the minima is given by:\n`sin(θ) = m * λ / a`\nwhere `m` is a constant derived from the zeros of the Bessel function, `λ` is the wavelength of the light, and `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n\nUsing the small angle approximation (sin(θ) ≈ θ), the angular position `θ` of the minima is:\n`θ = m * λ / a`\n\nThe minima of the diffraction pattern correspond to the zeros of the Bessel function J₁(ρ), where `ρ = (2πa/λ)sin(θ)`. The first few non-trivial zeros occur at ρ values of approximately 3.8317, 7.0156, and 10.1735.\n\n### Calculation of Minima Positions\n\n**First Minimum (θ₁):**\nThe first minimum corresponds to the first zero of the Bessel function, which is at `ρ₁ ≈ 3.8317`.\n`(2πa/λ) * sin(θ₁) ≈ (2πa/λ) * θ₁ = 3.8317`\n`θ₁ = (3.8317 / 2π) * (λ / a)`\n`θ₁ ≈ 0.6098 * λ / a`\n\nThis is often expressed using the diameter D (D=2a) as `θ₁ ≈ 1.22 * λ / D`.\n\n**Second Minimum (θ₂):**\nThe second minimum corresponds to the second zero of the Bessel function, which is at `ρ₂ ≈ 7.0156`.\n`(2πa/λ) * sin(θ₂) ≈ (2πa/λ) * θ₂ = 7.0156`\n`θ₂ = (7.0156 / 2π) * (λ / a)`\n`θ₂ ≈ 1.1166 * λ / a`\n\nThis can also be written in terms of diameter as `θ₂ ≈ 2.23 * λ / D`.\n\n### Angular Distance Between the First Two Minima\n\nThe angular distance between the first and second minima is the difference between their angular positions:\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`\n`Δθ ≈ (1.1166 * λ / a) - (0.6098 * λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * λ / a`\n\nRounding this value gives `0.507 * λ / a`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.610 λ / a (This is the position of the first minimum)\nB) 1.220 λ / a (This is the angular diameter of the central maximum)\nC) 0.506 λ / a (This matches the calculated angular separation)\nD) 0.500 λ / a\n\nThe calculated angular distance is approximately 0.506 λ / a.\n\n<<<C>>>"
