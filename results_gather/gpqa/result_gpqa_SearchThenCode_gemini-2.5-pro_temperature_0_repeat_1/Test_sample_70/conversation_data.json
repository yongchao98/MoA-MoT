    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2.\n\n### **1. Equilibrium Temperature**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature of a planet is achieved when the power absorbed from its host star equals the power it radiates back into space. The formula for the equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is given by:\n\nT_eq = [L(1-A) / (16 * π * σ * a²)]^(1/4)\n\nWhere:\n*   L is the star's luminosity.\n*   A is the planet's albedo.\n*   σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nFor two planets orbiting the same star, L and σ are constant. The problem states that the planets have the same albedo (A). Therefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet_4 and Planet_2, can be simplified as follows:\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = [(1/a₄²)]^(1/4) / [(1/a₂²)]^(1/4)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (a₂ / a₄)^(1/2)\n\n### **2. Kepler's Third Law**\n\nKepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is directly proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a). For planets orbiting the same star, this can be expressed as:\n\nP² ∝ a³\n\nTherefore, for Planet_4 and Planet_2:\n\n(P₄ / P₂)² = (a₄ / a₂)³\n\n### **3. Combining the Relationships**\n\nFrom Kepler's Third Law, we can find the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n\na₄ / a₂ = (P₄ / P₂)^(2/3)\n\nNow, we can substitute this into our simplified temperature ratio equation:\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = [1 / (a₄ / a₂)]^(1/2)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = [1 / (P₄ / P₂)^(2/3)]^(1/2)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P₂ / P₄)^(1/3)\n\n### **4. Calculation**\n\nThe problem provides the ratio of the orbital periods as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for Planet_1 through Planet_5. Therefore, the ratio of the orbital periods for Planet_4 and Planet_2 is:\n\nP₄ / P₂ = 3.5 / 2 = 1.75\n\nNow, we can calculate the temperature ratio:\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (1 / 1.75)^(1/3)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3)\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.83\n\nThus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately 0.83.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.83\nB) ~0.69\nC) ~0.57\nD) ~0.75\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
