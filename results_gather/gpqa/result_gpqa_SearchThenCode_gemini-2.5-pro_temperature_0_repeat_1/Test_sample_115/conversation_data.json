    "Here is a step-by-step identification of compound D:\n\n**1. Identification of Compound A**\n\n*   The proton NMR spectrum of Compound A shows two signals.\n*   A triplet at 0.9 ppm with an integration of 6H indicates two equivalent methyl groups (-CH₃), each adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂).\n*   A quartet at 1.3 ppm with an integration of 4H indicates two equivalent methylene groups (-CH₂), each adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   This pattern of a triplet and a quartet with a 3:2 proton ratio is characteristic of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). Since the integrations are 6H and 4H, there must be two equivalent ethyl groups.\n*   A simple, symmetrical alkane containing two ethyl groups is n-butane (CH₃CH₂CH₂CH₃). While the internal methylene groups (-CH₂-) in n-butane technically give a sextet, it can appear as a quartet at lower resolutions. Given the subsequent reactions, n-butane is the most logical structure for Compound A.\n\n**2. Identification of Compound B**\n\n*   Compound A (n-butane) undergoes monobromination to form Compound B. The bromination of n-butane can occur at C1 or C2.\n*   To satisfy the next step, we consider the product that leads to geometrical isomers. Monobromination at C2 yields 2-bromobutane.\n\n**3. Identification of Compound C**\n\n*   Compound B (2-bromobutane) reacts with alcoholic KOH. This is a dehydrohalogenation (elimination) reaction.\n*   According to Zaitsev's rule, the major product is the more substituted alkene, which is but-2-ene (CH₃-CH=CH-CH₃).\n*   But-2-ene exists as two geometrical isomers: *cis*-but-2-ene ((Z)-but-2-ene) and *trans*-but-2-ene ((E)-but-2-ene). Therefore, Compound C is but-2-ene.\n\n**4. Identification of Compound D**\n\n*   The *cis*-isomer of C (*cis*-but-2-ene) acts as a dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction with the diene, (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol.\n\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** *cis*-but-2-ene.\n    *   **Diene:** (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol (HO-CH=CH-CH=CH-CH₃).\n\n*   **Reaction and Product Structure:**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition, forming a six-membered ring.\n    *   The product is a cyclohexene derivative with four substituents: an -OH group and a -CH₃ group from the diene, and two -CH₃ groups from the dienophile.\n    *   Numbering the resulting ring according to IUPAC nomenclature for a cyclohexenol gives the structure 4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol.\n\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    The stereochemistry of the product is determined by the stereochemistry of the reactants and the endo rule of the Diels-Alder reaction.\n    1.  **Dienophile Stereospecificity:** The reaction is stereospecific with respect to the dienophile. Since *cis*-but-2-ene is used, the two methyl groups it provides (at positions C5 and C6 of the product) will be *cis* to each other.\n    2.  **Diene Stereospecificity:** The reaction is also stereospecific regarding the diene. For a diene with (E,E) configuration, the substituents on its termini (the -OH at C1 and -CH₃ at C4) will be *trans* to each other in the product.\n    3.  **Endo Selectivity:** The reaction preferentially proceeds via an *endo* transition state. This determines the relative orientation of the substituents from the diene versus the dienophile. The endo product has the following relative stereochemistry: the methyl groups at C5 and C6 are *cis*; the hydroxyl group at C1 and the methyl group at C4 are *trans*; the methyl groups at C4 and C5 are *cis*; the hydroxyl group at C1 and the methyl group at C6 are *trans*.\n\n*   **Assigning Absolute Stereochemistry:**\n    *   Let's analyze the stereochemistry of the product based on these relative relationships. One of the two possible enantiomers formed will have the following configuration:\n        *   The -OH at C1 and the -CH₃ at C4 are *trans*.\n        *   The -CH₃ at C4 and the -CH₃ at C5 are *cis*.\n        *   The -CH₃ at C5 and the -CH₃ at C6 are *cis*.\n    *   Assigning the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priorities to the stereocenters of this structure reveals the absolute configuration to be (1S, 4R, 5S, 6S).\n\nThis configuration matches option B.\n\nTherefore, compound D is (1S,4R,5S,6S)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol.\n\n<<<B>>>"
