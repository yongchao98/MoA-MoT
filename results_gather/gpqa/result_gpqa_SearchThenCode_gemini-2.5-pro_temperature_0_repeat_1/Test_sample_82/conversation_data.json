    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.\n\n### 1. Initial Dilution of Acetic Acid\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after dilution.\n*   **Initial moles of acetic acid (HA):**\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.02000 L = 0.001 mol\n*   **New total volume:**\n    *   Volume = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³ = 0.04000 L\n*   **New concentration of acetic acid ([HA]):**\n    *   [HA] = Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.04000 L = 0.025 M\n\n### 2. pH at 25% Titration\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻). This creates a buffer solution.\n\n*   The reaction is: CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O\n*   At this point, 75% of the original acetic acid remains, and 25% has been converted to acetate.\n*   The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used to find the pH of a buffer solution.\n    *   pH = pKa + log ([A⁻]/[HA])\n*   First, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   The ratio [A⁻]/[HA] is equivalent to the ratio of the moles, which is 25/75 or 1/3.\n*   Now, calculate the pH:\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n    *   pH ≈ 4.256\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n### 3. pH at the Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by the NaOH, forming sodium acetate (NaA). The solution now contains only the conjugate base, acetate (A⁻), which will hydrolyze in water.\n\n*   **Volume of NaOH to reach equivalence:**\n    *   Moles of NaOH must equal the initial moles of acetic acid (0.001 mol).\n    *   Volume NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   **Total volume at equivalence:**\n    *   Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.05000 L\n*   **Concentration of acetate ([A⁻]):**\n    *   [A⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.05000 L = 0.02 M\n*   The acetate ion hydrolyzes water, producing hydroxide ions (OH⁻):\n    *   A⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HA + OH⁻\n*   We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate, which can be calculated from the Ka of acetic acid and the ion-product constant for water (Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25 °C).\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n*   Set up an equilibrium expression to find the [OH⁻]:\n    *   Kb = [HA][OH⁻] / [A⁻] = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n*   Since Kb is very small, we can approximate (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    *   5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.02\n    *   x² ≈ (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 ≈ 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] ≈ √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   Calculate the pOH:\n    *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n*   Finally, calculate the pH:\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are pH = 4.26 at 25% titration and pH = 8.52 at the equivalence point.\n\n<<<C>>>"
