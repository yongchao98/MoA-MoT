    "**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTo determine which compound does not exhibit tautomerism, we must look for the presence of an alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone:** In the structure of p-benzoquinone, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of a double bond within the ring and do not have any alpha-hydrogens available for tautomerization. Attempting to form a tautomer would result in a highly unstable structure with cumulated double bonds within the ring. Therefore, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has methylene groups (-CH2-) located between the carbonyl groups. These are alpha-carbons, and they possess alpha-hydrogens. This allows the compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), is aromatic and particularly stable.\n\nThus, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is a chiral center, a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The central carbon atom (C2) in this molecule is bonded to four distinct groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methyl ester group (-COOCH3). Because it has a chiral center, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and exhibits optical isomerism.\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the trans-isomer of an alkene. It has a plane of symmetry and is therefore achiral. It does not contain any chiral centers. While it is a stereoisomer of dimethyl maleate (a geometric isomer), it does not have a non-superimposable mirror image and thus does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nCombining these findings, A = benzoquinone and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
