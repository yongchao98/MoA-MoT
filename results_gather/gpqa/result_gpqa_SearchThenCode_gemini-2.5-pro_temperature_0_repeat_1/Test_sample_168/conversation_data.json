    "The user's question describes a nuclear decay analogous to double-beta decay and asks how the energy spectrum of the emitted electrons (particles E) changes when the decay products are altered.\n\n### Analysis of the Decay Process\n\n1.  **Original Decay: 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V**\n    This process is analogous to the standard two-neutrino double-beta decay (2νββ). In this decay, the available energy (the Q-value) is shared among the final state particles: the two B nucleons, the two E particles, and the two V particles. Because there are more than two particles in the final state, their individual energies are not fixed. This results in a continuous energy spectrum for the E particles, as stated in the problem.\n\n2.  **Variant Decay: 2A -> 2B + 2E + M**\n    This variant is analogous to a specific model of neutrinoless double-beta decay where a single, massless particle called a Majoron (M) is emitted. In this case, the final state consists of the two B nucleons, the two E particles, and the single M particle. Since this is still a multi-body decay (five particles in the final state), the decay energy is shared among them. Consequently, the total energy spectrum of the two E particles remains continuous. This eliminates options B and D, which propose a discrete spectrum. The shape of the continuous spectrum is altered because the phase space of the final state has changed (one M particle instead of two V particles).\n\n### Comparison of the Endpoint Energy\n\nThe endpoint of the energy spectrum represents the maximum possible kinetic energy of the particles of interest (the total energy of the two E particles). This maximum value is determined by the total energy released in the decay, which is the difference in rest mass between the initial and final particles.\n\nLet's define the total energy released that can be converted to kinetic energy as Q'.\n\n*   **Original Decay Endpoint:** The total available kinetic energy is the initial mass energy minus the rest mass energy of all final particles.\n    *   Q' (original) = Mass(2A)c² - [Mass(2B)c² + 2*Mass(E)c² + 2*Mass(V)c²]\n    The endpoint of the total energy spectrum for the E particles is this available kinetic energy (minus the small recoil energy of the 2B nucleus).\n\n*   **Variant Decay Endpoint:** Similarly, the total available kinetic energy is:\n    *   Q' (variant) = Mass(2A)c² - [Mass(2B)c² + 2*Mass(E)c² + Mass(M)c²]\n\nThe problem states that particle M is massless (Mass(M) = 0). The V particles (analogous to neutrinos) have a small but non-zero mass (Mass(V) > 0).\n\nTherefore:\n*   Q' (original) = Q_base - 2*Mass(V)c²\n*   Q' (variant) = Q_base - 0 = Q_base\n    (where Q_base = Mass(2A)c² - Mass(2B)c² - 2*Mass(E)c²)\n\nSince 2*Mass(V)c² is a positive value, the total kinetic energy available in the variant decay is greater than in the original decay. This means the endpoint of the total energy spectrum for the E particles increases.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn the variant decay, the energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles remains continuous because it is still a multi-body decay. However, because a single massless particle (M) is emitted instead of two particles with mass (2V), more energy is available to the E particles, causing the endpoint of their energy spectrum to increase.\n\n<<<A>>>"
