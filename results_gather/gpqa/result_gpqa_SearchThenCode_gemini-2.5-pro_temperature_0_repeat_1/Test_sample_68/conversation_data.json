    "To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Determine the particle's properties in the lab frame:** The particle is moving at a relativistic speed. We are given its total energy (E) and its rest mass ($m_0$). The proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) is the lifetime in the particle's own rest frame. Due to time dilation, its lifetime in the bubble chamber (the lab frame) will be longer.\n2.  **Calculate the mean decay length:** This is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying.\n3.  **Use the exponential decay law:** The decay of particles is a random process that follows an exponential distribution. We need to find the specific distance (resolution) for which the probability of the particle traveling *at least* that far is 30%.\n\nHere are the detailed calculations:\n\n*   **Given values:**\n    *   Total Energy (E) = 27 GeV\n    *   Rest Mass ($m_0$) = 3.41 GeV (in units where c²=1)\n    *   Proper Lifetime ($\\tau_0$) = 8 x 10⁻¹⁶ s\n    *   Speed of light (c) ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate the particle's momentum (p).**\n    The relativistic energy-momentum relation is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$. We can solve for the momentum, p.\n    $p = \\sqrt{E^2 - m_0^2}$\n    $p = \\sqrt{27^2 - 3.41^2} \\text{ GeV/c}$\n    $p = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} \\text{ GeV/c}$\n    $p = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\text{ GeV/c} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV/c}$\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$) in the lab frame.**\n    The average distance a relativistic particle travels before decaying is given by the formula:\n    $\\lambda = \\frac{p}{m_0} \\times c \\times \\tau_0$\n    Plugging in the values:\n    $\\lambda = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV/c}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV/c}^2} \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    $\\lambda \\approx 7.854 \\times (24 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ m})$\n    $\\lambda \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the required resolution length (L).**\n    The probability that a particle survives to travel a distance `x` or more is given by the exponential decay law: $P(x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$. We want to find the length `L` where this probability is 30% (or 0.30).\n    $e^{-L/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n    To solve for L, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-L/\\lambda = \\ln(0.30)$\n    $L = -\\lambda \\times \\ln(0.30)$\n    Using $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$:\n    $L = -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (-1.204)$\n    $L \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n*   **Step 4: Compare with the given options.**\n    The calculated value is $L \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n    The options are:\n    A) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n    B) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n    C) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\n    D) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\n\n    The calculated result ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is closest to option A ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). The other options differ by several orders of magnitude. The small discrepancy between the calculated value and option A is likely due to slight variations in the constants used or a minor typo in the problem's given values. Based on the calculation, option A is the only plausible answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
