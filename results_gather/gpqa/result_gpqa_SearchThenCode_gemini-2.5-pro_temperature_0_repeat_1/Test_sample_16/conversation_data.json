    "To determine the concentration of calcium ions, we must consider the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the following equilibrium:\nCa²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻ (where Y⁴⁻ is the EDTA anion)\n\nThe formation constant (K_f) is given as:\nK_f = [[CaY]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\nWe are starting with a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, [CaY]²⁻. This complex will dissociate into free calcium ions (Ca²⁺) and EDTA ions (Y⁴⁻). Let's denote the concentration of Ca²⁺ at equilibrium as 'x'. According to the stoichiometry of the dissociation, the concentration of Y⁴⁻ will also be 'x', and the concentration of the remaining complex will be (0.02 - x).\n\nThe equilibrium expression is:\n5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n\nBecause the formation constant (K_f) is very large, the equilibrium strongly favors the complex, meaning the amount of dissociation ('x') will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex. Therefore, we can simplify the expression by assuming that (0.02 - x) is approximately equal to 0.02.\n\nThe equation becomes:\n5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\nx² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is therefore approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 2.0x10⁻² M\nB) 1.0x10⁻² M\nC) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\nD) 5.0x10⁻³ M\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
