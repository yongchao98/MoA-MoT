    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the answer:\n\n**1. Analyze the Gas Separation Process**\n\n*   The mixture of gases from the decomposition is passed through a series of tubes to identify its components.\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of the water (H₂O) produced.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which reacts with acidic gases like CO₂ to form a precipitate (calcium carbonate), which would increase the tube's weight. Since the weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form black copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase of 0.80 g corresponds to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n*   **Gas C:** The remaining gas, measuring 2.24 liters at standard temperature and pressure (STP), is inert to the previous reagents. This volume corresponds to a specific number of moles.\n\n**2. Calculate the Moles of Each Gaseous Product**\n\n*   **Water (H₂O):**\n    *   Mass = 3.60 g\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol\n\n*   **Oxygen (O₂):**\n    *   Mass = 0.80 g\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol\n\n*   **Gas C:**\n    *   Volume = 2.24 L at STP\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol\n    *   Given that the original salts are nitrogen-based (a common feature of salts that decompose into gases), Gas C is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**3. Identify the Salts Based on Decomposition Products**\n\nWe need to find two nitrogen-containing salts that, when decomposed in an equimolar ratio, produce 0.2 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.1 mol N₂. Let's consider common ammonium salts.\n\n*   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)**\n    *   The thermal decomposition of ammonium nitrite produces nitrogen gas and water.\n    *   Reaction: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n\n*   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n    *   The decomposition of ammonium nitrate is complex and depends on temperature. At around 200°C, it typically produces N₂O and H₂O. However, a different decomposition pathway can occur, especially under certain conditions, that yields nitrogen, oxygen, and water.\n    *   Reaction: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n\n**4. Verify the Molar Ratios and Mass**\n\nLet's assume the mixture contains 'x' moles of Salt A (NH₄NO₂) and 'x' moles of Salt B (NH₄NO₃). Based on the stoichiometry of their decomposition reactions:\n\n*   From **x mol of NH₄NO₂**: Produces **x mol of N₂** and **2x mol of H₂O**.\n*   From **x mol of NH₄NO₃**: Produces **x mol of N₂**, **(x/2) mol of O₂**, and **2x mol of H₂O**.\n\nNow, let's sum the total moles of each product:\n*   **Total N₂:** x + x = 2x\n*   **Total H₂O:** 2x + 2x = 4x\n*   **Total O₂:** x/2\n\nFrom our initial calculations, we know:\n*   Total N₂ = 0.1 mol\n*   Total H₂O = 0.2 mol\n*   Total O₂ = 0.025 mol\n\nLet's solve for 'x' using the products:\n*   2x = 0.1 mol  =>  x = 0.05 mol\n*   4x = 4 * 0.05 = 0.2 mol (This matches the H₂O produced)\n*   x/2 = 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 mol (This matches the O₂ produced)\n\nThe value x = 0.05 mol is consistent for all products. This confirms we have 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\nLet's check if the total mass matches the given 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.04 g/mol\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 64.04 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80.04 g/mol)\n*   Total mass = 3.202 g + 4.002 g = 7.204 g\nThis matches the initial weight of the mixture.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to count the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two salts, A and B.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite - NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) atoms\n    *   4 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n    *   2 Oxygen (O) atoms\n    *   Total: 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate - NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) atoms\n    *   4 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n    *   3 Oxygen (O) atoms\n    *   Total: 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms\n\n*   **Total atoms in both salts = 8 + 9 = 17 atoms**\n\n<<<B>>>"
