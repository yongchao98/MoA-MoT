    "To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ and the renormalizability of the theory, we will analyze the provided Lagrangian interaction term using dimensional analysis in natural units (where ħ = c = 1).\n\n1.  **Mass Dimension of the Lagrangian Density:** In a 4-dimensional spacetime, the action S = ∫d⁴x L must be dimensionless. Since the spacetime volume element d⁴x has a mass dimension of [d⁴x] = M⁻⁴, the Lagrangian density L must have a mass dimension of [L] = M⁴. This means every term in the Lagrangian, including the interaction term \\mathcal{L}_{int}, must have a mass dimension of 4.\n\n2.  **Mass Dimension of the Fields:**\n    *   **Fermion field (ψ):** The kinetic term for a fermion field in the Lagrangian is  \\bar{\\psi}(i\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu - m)\\psi . For the kinetic part  \\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu\\psi  to have a mass dimension of 4, and knowing that the derivative operator ∂μ has a mass dimension of [∂μ] = M¹, we can deduce the dimension of the fermion field. We have [\\bar{\\psi}] + [ψ] + [∂μ] = 4. Since [\\bar{\\psi}] = [ψ], this gives 2[ψ] + 1 = 4, which leads to [ψ] = M³/².\n    *   **Electromagnetic field strength tensor (F<sup>μν</sup>):** The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is  -\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu} . For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, we must have 2[F^{\\mu\\nu}] = 4, which means [F^{\\mu\\nu}] = M².\n    *   **The σ<sub>μν</sub> term:** The term σ<sub>μν</sub> is defined as  \\frac{i}{2}[\\gamma_{\\mu},\\gamma_{\\nu}] . Since the gamma matrices (γμ) are dimensionless, σ<sub>μν</sub> is also dimensionless.\n\n3.  **Mass Dimension of the Coupling Constant (κ):**\n    Now we can determine the mass dimension of κ by ensuring the interaction term \\mathcal{L}_{int} has a total mass dimension of 4.\n    [\\mathcal{L}_{int}] = [κ] [\\bar{\\psi}] [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] [ψ] [F^{\\mu\\nu}] = M⁴\n    Plugging in the known mass dimensions:\n    [κ] · M³/² · M⁰ · M³/² · M² = M⁴\n    [κ] · M³ · M² = M⁴\n    [κ] · M⁵ = M⁴\n    [κ] = M⁻¹\n\n    So, the mass dimension of κ is -1.\n\n4.  **Renormalizability of the Theory:**\n    A key criterion for determining the renormalizability of a quantum field theory by \"power counting\" is the mass dimension of its coupling constants.\n    *   If all coupling constants have a mass dimension greater than or equal to zero, the theory is generally renormalizable (or super-renormalizable if strictly positive).\n    *   If any coupling constant has a negative mass dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable. This is because interactions with negative mass dimension couplings become stronger at higher energies, leading to uncontrollable divergences in loop calculations that cannot be absorbed by a finite number of counterterms.\n\n    Since the mass dimension of κ is -1, the theory is non-renormalizable.\n\nCombining these findings, the mass dimension of κ is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
