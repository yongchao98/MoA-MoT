    "To evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the vector field **f**(r), we can use the Divergence Theorem. The Divergence Theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume V is equal to the flux of the field through the closed surface S that encloses the volume.\n\nThe theorem is expressed as:\n\n∫∫∫<sub>V</sub> (∇ ⋅ **f**) dV = ∬<sub>S</sub> (**f** ⋅ **n**) dS\n\nWhere:\n*   **f**(r) is the vector field, which is given as **f**(r) = (1/r²) **r̂**.\n*   ∇ ⋅ **f** is the divergence of the vector field.\n*   V is the volume of the sphere of radius R.\n*   S is the surface of the sphere of radius R.\n*   **n** is the outward-pointing unit normal vector to the surface S. For a sphere centered at the origin, the outward normal vector is the radial unit vector, **r̂**.\n*   dS is the differential surface area element. In spherical coordinates, dS = R² sin(θ) dθ dφ.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the divergence of the vector field **f**(r) in spherical coordinates. The formula for the divergence of a vector field with only a radial component is:\n\n∇ ⋅ **f** = (1/r²) ∂(r² f<sub>r</sub>)/∂r\n\nGiven that f<sub>r</sub> = 1/r², we have:\n\n∇ ⋅ **f** = (1/r²) ∂(r² * (1/r²))/∂r = (1/r²) ∂(1)/∂r = 0\n\nThis result holds for all r ≠ 0. At the origin (r = 0), the vector field is singular, and the divergence is undefined. This singularity at the origin is a key feature of this problem.\n\nBecause of the singularity at the origin, a direct calculation of the volume integral of the divergence (which is zero everywhere except at the origin) is not straightforward. However, the Divergence Theorem allows us to calculate this by evaluating the surface integral over the boundary of the sphere.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the surface integral (the flux) over the sphere of radius R:\n\n∬<sub>S</sub> (**f** ⋅ **n**) dS\n\nOn the surface of the sphere, r = R, so the vector field is **f**(R) = (1/R²) **r̂**. The outward unit normal vector **n** is **r̂**.\n\nThe dot product **f** ⋅ **n** is:\n\n**f** ⋅ **n** = [(1/R²) **r̂**] ⋅ **r̂** = 1/R² (since **r̂** ⋅ **r̂** = 1)\n\nNow, we integrate this over the surface of the sphere:\n\n∬<sub>S</sub> (1/R²) dS = (1/R²) ∬<sub>S</sub> dS\n\nThe surface integral ∬<sub>S</sub> dS is simply the total surface area of the sphere, which is 4πR².\n\nSo, the integral becomes:\n\n(1/R²) * (4πR²) = 4π\n\nTherefore, the volume integral of the divergence of the field inside the sphere of radius R is 4π.\n\n<<<D>>>"
