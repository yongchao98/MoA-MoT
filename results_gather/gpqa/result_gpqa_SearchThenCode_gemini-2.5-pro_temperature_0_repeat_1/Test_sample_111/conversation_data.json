    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n### 1. Normalize the State Vector\n\nThe given state `|alpha>` is proportional to `(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>`. Let the normalized state be `|alpha> = C * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`.\n\nTo find the normalization constant C, we use the condition `<alpha|alpha> = 1`.\n\n`<alpha|alpha> = |C|^2 * [<(1+i)up| + <(2-i)down|] * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\nSince `|up>` and `|down>` are orthonormal (`<up|up> = 1`, `<down|down> = 1`, `<up|down> = 0`), the inner product simplifies to:\n`1 = |C|^2 * [|1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2]`\n`1 = |C|^2 * [(1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + (-1)^2)]`\n`1 = |C|^2 * [2 + 5]`\n`1 = 7 * |C|^2`\n`|C|^2 = 1/7`, so we can choose the real constant `C = 1/sqrt(7)`.\n\nThe normalized state is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\n\nIn vector notation, where `|up> = [1, 0]` and `|down> = [0, 1]`, the state is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [1+i, 2-i]`\n\n### 2. Define the Operator and Find its Eigenstates/Eigenvalues\n\nThe operator A has matrix elements `Aij = hbar/2` for `i != j` and `Aij = 0` for `i = j`. This gives the 2x2 matrix:\n`A = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`:\n`det([[-λ, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -λ]]) = 0`\n`λ^2 - (hbar/2)^2 = 0`\n`λ^2 = (hbar/2)^2`\nThe eigenvalues are `λ1 = +hbar/2` and `λ2 = -hbar/2`.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors:\n*   For `λ1 = +hbar/2`:\n    `[[ -hbar/2, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, -hbar/2 ]] * [v1, v2] = 0`\n    This gives `-v1 + v2 = 0`, so `v1 = v2`. The eigenvector is proportional to `[1, 1]`.\n    The normalized eigenvector is `|a1> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 1] = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> + |down>)`.\n\n*   For `λ2 = -hbar/2`:\n    `[[ hbar/2, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, hbar/2 ]] * [v1, v2] = 0`\n    This gives `v1 + v2 = 0`, so `v1 = -v2`. The eigenvector is proportional to `[1, -1]`.\n    The normalized eigenvector is `|a2> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, -1] = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> - |down>)`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Probabilities\n\nThe probability of measuring the system in an eigenstate `|ai>` is given by `P(ai) = |<ai|alpha>|^2`.\n\n*   **Probability for eigenstate `|a1>` (with eigenvalue `+hbar/2`)**:\n    `P(a1) = |<a1|alpha>|^2`\n    `<a1|alpha> = [(1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| + <down|)] * [(1/sqrt(7)) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n    `<a1|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [(1+i) + (2-i)] = 3/sqrt(14)`\n    `P(a1) = |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.643`\n\n*   **Probability for eigenstate `|a2>` (with eigenvalue `-hbar/2`)**:\n    `P(a2) = |<a2|alpha>|^2`\n    `<a2|alpha> = [(1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| - <down|)] * [(1/sqrt(7)) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n    `<a2|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [(1+i) - (2-i)] = (1/sqrt(14)) * [-1 + 2i]`\n    `P(a2) = |(-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)|^2 = ((-1)^2 + 2^2) / 14 = (1 + 4) / 14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.357`\n\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Average Value\n\nThe average (or expectation) value of the operator A is `<A> = <alpha|A|alpha>`. A simpler way is to use the eigenvalues and their probabilities:\n`<A> = P(a1) * λ1 + P(a2) * λ2`\n`<A> = (9/14) * (hbar/2) + (5/14) * (-hbar/2)`\n`<A> = (hbar/28) * (9 - 5)`\n`<A> = 4*hbar/28 = hbar/7`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of the operator is `hbar/7`. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
