    "The synthesis of 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane requires a multi-step process. The target molecule is the product of a self-aldol addition reaction of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Therefore, the primary goal of the initial steps is to convert ethynylcyclohexane into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n\nLet's analyze the correct sequence of reactions:\n\n1.  **Alkylation of the Alkyne:** The starting material, ethynylcyclohexane, has a terminal alkyne. To form cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which has a -CHO group attached to the ring, we first need to add a carbon atom. This is achieved by deprotonating the terminal alkyne with a strong base like sodium amide (NaNH₂) to form a sodium acetylide. This acetylide then acts as a nucleophile and reacts with methyl chloride (CH₃Cl) to form 1-propynylcyclohexane.\n    *   `Cyclohexyl-C≡CH + NaNH₂ → Cyclohexyl-C≡C⁻Na⁺`\n    *   `Cyclohexyl-C≡C⁻Na⁺ + CH₃Cl → Cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH₃`\n\n2.  **Partial Hydrogenation:** The resulting internal alkyne is then converted to a *cis*-alkene. This is accomplished through catalytic hydrogenation using Lindlar's catalyst (H₂/Pd-CaCO₃), which is poisoned to prevent over-reduction to the alkane. This step yields (Z)-1-cyclohexylprop-1-ene.\n    *   `Cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH₃ + H₂/Pd-CaCO₃ → (Z)-Cyclohexyl-CH=CH-CH₃`\n\n3.  **Ozonolysis:** The *cis*-alkene is cleaved at the double bond using ozone (O₃) followed by a reductive workup with dimethyl sulfide ((CH₃)₂S). This cleavage breaks the molecule into two smaller carbonyl compounds: cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and acetaldehyde.\n    *   `(Z)-Cyclohexyl-CH=CH-CH₃ + O₃; then (CH₃)₂S → Cyclohexyl-CHO + CH₃CHO`\n\n4.  **Aldol Addition:** The final step is a base-catalyzed aldol reaction. In the presence of a strong base like barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)₂), the alpha-proton of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is removed to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of another molecule of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Subsequent protonation yields the final product, 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n    *   `2 x Cyclohexyl-CHO --(Ba(OH)₂)--> 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct sequence of reagents is provided in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
