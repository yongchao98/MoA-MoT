    "To find the numerical value of \"a\", we must normalize the wave function. The normalization condition in quantum mechanics dictates that the total probability of finding the particle in all possible locations must be equal to 1. This is expressed by integrating the square of the modulus of the wave function, |Ψ(x)|², over the entire space where the particle can exist.\n\nThe given wave function is:\nΨ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\nThe problem states that the particles are only found in the region between x=1 and x=3. Therefore, the integral for normalization will be from 1 to 3.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the square of the modulus of the wave function, |Ψ(x)|². The wave function is a complex number with a real part, Re(Ψ) = a / sqrt(1 + x), and an imaginary part, Im(Ψ) = -0.5.\n\nThe square of the modulus is calculated as:\n|Ψ(x)|² = [Re(Ψ)]² + [Im(Ψ)]²\n|Ψ(x)|² = [a / sqrt(1 + x)]² + (-0.5)²\n|Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\nNext, we set up the normalization integral and set it equal to 1:\n∫[from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\nNow, we solve the integral:\n∫(a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = a² * ∫(1 / (1 + x)) dx + ∫0.25 dx\nThe integral of 1/(1+x) is ln|1+x|.\nSo, the integral becomes:\n[a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25 * x] evaluated from 1 to 3.\n\nNow, we evaluate the definite integral at the limits x=3 and x=1:\nAt x = 3: a² * ln(1 + 3) + 0.25 * 3 = a² * ln(4) + 0.75\nAt x = 1: a² * ln(1 + 1) + 0.25 * 1 = a² * ln(2) + 0.25\n\nSubtract the value at the lower limit from the value at the upper limit:\n(a² * ln(4) + 0.75) - (a² * ln(2) + 0.25)\n= a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + (0.75 - 0.25)\n= a² * ln(4/2) + 0.5\n= a² * ln(2) + 0.5\n\nFinally, we set this result equal to 1 to solve for \"a\":\na² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nUsing the approximate value for the natural logarithm of 2, ln(2) ≈ 0.693:\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.693\na² ≈ 0.7215\n\na ≈ sqrt(0.7215)\na ≈ 0.849\n\nThis value is closest to the option 0.85.\n\n<<<B>>>"
