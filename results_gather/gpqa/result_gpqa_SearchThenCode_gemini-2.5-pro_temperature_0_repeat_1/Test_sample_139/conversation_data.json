    "The step-by-step deduction to identify Substance X and calculate the required value is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of B is stated to be very close to 277 K. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C). This strongly indicates that substance B is heavy water.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The gas W released in the reaction has a molecule containing the same number of neutrons and protons. Deuterium gas (D₂) fits this description perfectly. A deuterium atom (D) has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n\n3.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** Substance X reacts with liquid Y to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases D₂O (Substance B). This implies that X is a deuterated compound that reacts with a deuterated liquid (Y, likely D₂O) to produce D₂ gas. The precipitate G must be a deuteroxide compound that decomposes upon heating to yield an oxide and D₂O.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Potential Candidates for Substance X:**\n    *   **Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄):** While it is a deuterated reagent used in organic chemistry, its reaction with D₂O (NaBD₄ + 4D₂O → NaOD + B(OD)₃ + 4D₂) would produce soluble products (sodium deuteroxide and boric acid/deuteroxide), not a precipitate. Therefore, NaBD₄ is not Substance X.\n    *   **Calcium Deuteride (CaD₂):** Its analog, calcium hydride (CaH₂), is used in organic chemistry as a drying agent. CaD₂ reacts with D₂O to produce D₂ gas and calcium deuteroxide (Ca(OD)₂). Calcium hydroxide is sparingly soluble in water and would form a precipitate (G). Heating Ca(OD)₂ would yield CaO and D₂O (B). This is a plausible candidate.\n    *   **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄):** Its analog, LiAlH₄, is a very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry, fitting the clue perfectly. LiAlD₄ reacts violently with water (or D₂O). The reaction with D₂O is: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD(aq) + Al(OD)₃(s) + 4D₂(g).\n        *   This reaction produces D₂ gas (W).\n        *   It forms a precipitate, aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃), as aluminum hydroxide is insoluble in water (G).\n        *   Heating aluminum deuteroxide (G) causes it to decompose, releasing heavy water (B).\n        *   LiAlD₄ is a classic reagent for reducing keto acids.\n    *   Comparing CaD₂ and LiAlD₄, the latter (and its analog LiAlH₄) is far more prominent as a reactive reagent for transformations like reducing keto acids, making it the stronger candidate.\n\n5.  **Confirm Substance X:** Based on the evidence, Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n\n6.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:** The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within LiAlD₄.\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D), which is an isotope of Hydrogen (H).\n    *   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen.\n    *   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum.\n    *   The formula contains one atom of the heaviest element (Al) and four atoms of the lightest element's isotope (D).\n    *   The calculation requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the formula.\n    *   Using the mass numbers of the most common isotopes:\n        *   Mass of one Aluminum (Al) atom ≈ 27.\n        *   Mass of one Deuterium (D) atom ≈ 2.\n        *   Total mass = (1 × Mass of Al) + (4 × Mass of D)\n        *   Total mass = (1 × 27) + (4 × 2) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<D>>>"
