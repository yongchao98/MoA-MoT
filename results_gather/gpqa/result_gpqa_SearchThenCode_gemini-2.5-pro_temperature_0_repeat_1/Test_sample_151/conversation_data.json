    "The question asks which protein complex will be least observed in an assay designed to recover the proteome of *active chromatin* from a yeast shmoo.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the cellular state and the function of each complex:\n*   **Yeast Shmoo:** When *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* is exposed to a mating pheromone, it undergoes morphological changes to form a shmoo. This process involves arresting the cell cycle in the G1 phase and significantly altering gene expression to prepare for mating.\n*   **Active Chromatin:** This refers to regions of the genome that are being actively transcribed. An assay to recover the proteome of active chromatin, such as ChIP-MS, would be enriched for proteins involved in gene transcription.\n\nLet's evaluate each option in this context:\n*   **B) Nucleosome histone complex:** Nucleosomes are the fundamental structural units of all chromatin, both active and inactive. They are composed of histone proteins around which DNA is wrapped. They will be ubiquitously present and therefore highly abundant in the recovered sample.\n*   **C) Pre-initiation complex (PIC):** This complex, which includes RNA polymerase II and general transcription factors, assembles on gene promoters to initiate transcription. Since shmoo formation requires the active transcription of many genes, the PIC is a hallmark of active chromatin and will be abundant.\n*   **D) Enhancer protein complex:** Enhancers are DNA regions bound by transcription factors that activate and increase the rate of transcription. These complexes are essential for the high-level expression of genes needed for mating and are a defining feature of active chromatin. They will be abundant.\n*   **A) Pre-replication complex (pre-RC):** This complex assembles at origins of replication during the G1 phase to license the DNA for replication, which occurs in the S phase. The yeast shmoo is arrested in G1, so pre-RCs are indeed assembled on the chromatin. However, their function is to prepare for DNA replication, a process that is actively inhibited in the G1-arrested shmoo. The primary activity in the shmoo is transcription for mating, not preparation for cell division. Therefore, in an assay specifically targeting the proteome of *transcriptionally active* chromatin, the pre-RC, whose function is unrelated to transcription, would be the least represented complex compared to those directly involved in or fundamental to gene expression.\n\n<<<A>>>"
