    "To find the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical particle, we first need to express the given potential in Cartesian coordinates. The potential is:\n\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²(θ)\n\nUsing the transformations x = r cos(θ) and y = r sin(θ), we can identify that r² = x² + y² and x² = r² cos²(θ). Substituting these into the potential equation gives:\n\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x² + y²) + 3/2 kx²\n\nBy simplifying this expression, we get:\n\nV(x, y) = 1/2 kx² + 1/2 ky² + 3/2 kx²\nV(x, y) = 2kx² + 1/2 ky²\n\nThis potential can be rewritten as:\n\nV(x, y) = 1/2 (4k)x² + 1/2 ky²\n\nThis form of the potential shows that the system is equivalent to two independent one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillators, one in the x-direction and one in the y-direction. The problem is thus separable in Cartesian coordinates.\n\nThe energy of a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator is given by the formula E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω, where ω = sqrt(k'/m) and k' is the effective spring constant.\n\nFor the motion in the x-direction, the effective spring constant is k_x = 4k. The angular frequency is:\n\nω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n\nThe energy for the x-component is:\n\nE_nx = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k/m) = (2n_x + 1)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nFor the motion in the y-direction, the spring constant is k_y = k. The angular frequency is:\n\nω_y = sqrt(k/m)\n\nThe energy for the y-component is:\n\nE_ny = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nThe total energy E of the system is the sum of the energies of the two independent oscillators:\n\nE = E_nx + E_ny\nE = (2n_x + 1)ħ * sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
