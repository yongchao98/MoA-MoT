    "To determine which exoplanet has the highest density, let's analyze each option:\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This describes a planet essentially identical to Earth. Earth's average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm続.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm続:** The density is explicitly given as about 5.5 g/cm続, which is nearly the same as Earth's density.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** For a planet with the same composition as Earth, having less mass means there is less gravitational force to compress the material. Consequently, its density would be lower than Earth's.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** A fundamental principle in planetary science is that for planets with the same composition, a more massive planet will have a higher density due to greater gravitational compression. The immense gravity of a 5-Earth-mass planet would squeeze its materials more tightly than Earth's gravity does, resulting in a significantly higher average density.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the options, the planet with 5 times the mass of Earth (c) will be compressed by its own gravity to a much greater extent than the others, leading to the highest density. The planets in options (a) and (b) have densities around 5.5 g/cm続, while the planet in option (d) would be even less dense.\n\n<<<D>>>"
