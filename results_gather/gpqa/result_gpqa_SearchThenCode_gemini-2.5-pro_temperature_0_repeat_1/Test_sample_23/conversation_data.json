    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the answer:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:**\n    *   Substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.\n    *   The mass percentage of hydrogen in a cycloalkane (general formula CnH2n) is calculated as (2n / (12n + 2n)) * 100 = (2n / 14n) * 100 = (1/7) * 100 ≈ 14.286%. This matches the given data.\n    *   Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states Z is widely used as a solvent and is the sole product after hydrogenating mixtures X and Y. A very common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   Let's assume Z is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. Its molar mass is 84.16 g/mol, and the hydrogen mass fraction is (12.096 / 84.16) * 100 ≈ 14.37%, which is consistent with the provided value.\n\n2.  **Identify Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, indicating saturation.\n    *   One component of Y is substance Z, which is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only cyclohexane. This implies the other component of Y can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n    *   A compound that does not readily decolorize bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene's aromaticity makes it unreactive toward bromine water without a catalyst, but it can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under more severe conditions.\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n3.  **Identify Mixture X and the Reaction:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water, indicating unsaturation.\n    *   Heating mixture X with platinum causes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y (cyclohexane + benzene). A disproportionation reaction in this context involves hydrogen transfer, where one molecule is hydrogenated and another is dehydrogenated.\n    *   The overall reaction is: Liquid A + Liquid B → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6).\n    *   Since the reactants (A and B) and products are equimolar, we can balance the atoms. The total atoms in the products are C12H18 (from C6H12 + C6H6). Therefore, the two molecules in mixture X must have a total of 12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   As A and B are in an equimolar mixture and hydrogenation of mixture X gives only cyclohexane, both A and B must be C6 cyclic hydrocarbons.\n    *   Let A be C6Hx and B be C6Hy. We have x + y = 18.\n    *   Both A and B are unsaturated (decolorize bromine water), so x and y must be less than 12 (the number of hydrogens in saturated cyclohexane).\n    *   The problem also states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the compounds of mixture X.\n    *   A logical pair of C6 unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons that fits these criteria is **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n        *   Cyclohexene has one double bond and is not conjugated.\n        *   1,4-cyclohexadiene has two double bonds that are separated by CH2 groups, so they are not conjugated. 1,3-cyclohexadiene, an isomer, has conjugated double bonds and is thus excluded.\n    *   Let's check the reaction: Cyclohexene (C6H10) + 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6).\n        *   In this hydrogen transfer, the cyclohexene gains two hydrogens to become cyclohexane, and the 1,4-cyclohexadiene loses two hydrogens to become benzene. The atoms (C12H18) are balanced. This is a known catalytic disproportionation.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X:**\n    *   The two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each liquid is the sum of the hydrogens in each.\n    *   Total Hydrogen Atoms = (Hydrogens in C6H10) + (Hydrogens in C6H8) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
