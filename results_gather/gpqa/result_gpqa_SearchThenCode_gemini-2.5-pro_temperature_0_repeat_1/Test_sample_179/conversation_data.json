    "To determine the minimum energy of the system, we need to calculate the total electrostatic potential energy. The system consists of two parts:\n1.  The potential energy resulting from the interaction between the central charge and the 12 charges on the sphere.\n2.  The potential energy resulting from the interactions among the 12 charges on the sphere.\n\nThe total minimum energy of the system is the sum of these two energy contributions.\n\n**Physical Constants:**\n*   Coulomb's constant, k ≈ 8.98755 × 10⁹ N⋅m²/C²\n*   Elementary charge, e ≈ 1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹ C\n*   Charge of each particle, q = 2e = 2 × (1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹ C) = 3.204353268 × 10⁻¹⁹ C\n\n**1. Potential Energy between the Central Charge and the 12 Spherical Charges (U_interaction)**\n\nEach of the 12 charges on the sphere is at a distance R = 2 m from the central charge at point P. The potential energy of a single pair of charges (the central charge and one on the sphere) is given by the formula U = k * q₁ * q₂ / r. Since all charges are identical (q₁ = q₂ = q), the energy for one pair is:\nU_pair = k * q² / R\n\nThere are 12 such pairs, so the total interaction energy is:\nU_interaction = 12 * (k * q²) / R\nU_interaction = 12 * (8.98755 × 10⁹ N⋅m²/C² * (3.204353268 × 10⁻¹⁹ C)²) / 2 m\nU_interaction = 6 * (8.98755 × 10⁹ * 1.0267878 × 10⁻³⁷) J\nU_interaction = 6 * (9.2285 × 10⁻²⁸) J\nU_interaction ≈ 5.537 × 10⁻²⁷ J\n\n**2. Potential Energy of the 12 Charges on the Sphere (U_sphere)**\n\nTo achieve a minimum energy configuration, the 12 identical charges constrained to the surface of the sphere will arrange themselves to be as far apart as possible. This is a classic problem in physics known as the Thomson problem. For N=12 charges, the proven minimum energy configuration is at the vertices of a regular icosahedron.\n\nThe potential energy of this system of 12 charges is the sum of the potential energies of all possible pairs of charges. The number of pairs is (12 × 11) / 2 = 66.\n\nThe distances between the vertices of a regular icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius R = 2 m are of three distinct types:\n*   30 pairs of adjacent vertices. The distance is r₁ ≈ 2.10292 m.\n*   30 pairs of non-adjacent, non-opposite vertices. The distance is r₂ ≈ 3.40260 m.\n*   6 pairs of opposite vertices. The distance is the diameter of the sphere, r₃ = 2 * R = 4 m.\n\nThe total potential energy of the 12 charges on the sphere is:\nU_sphere = Σ (k * q²) / r_ij (sum over all 66 pairs)\nU_sphere = k * q² * (30/r₁ + 30/r₂ + 6/r₃)\nU_sphere = (8.98755 × 10⁹ * (3.204353268 × 10⁻¹⁹)²) * (30/2.10292 + 30/3.40260 + 6/4.0)\nU_sphere ≈ (9.2285 × 10⁻²⁸) * (14.266 + 8.817 + 1.5) J\nU_sphere ≈ (9.2285 × 10⁻²⁸) * (24.583) J\nU_sphere ≈ 2.2685 × 10⁻²⁶ J\n\n**Total Minimum Energy (U_total)**\n\nThe total minimum energy of the system is the sum of the two calculated components:\nU_total = U_interaction + U_sphere\nU_total ≈ 5.537 × 10⁻²⁷ J + 2.2685 × 10⁻²⁶ J\nU_total ≈ 0.5537 × 10⁻²⁶ J + 2.2685 × 10⁻²⁶ J\nU_total ≈ 2.8222 × 10⁻²⁶ J\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 122.330\nB) 7.056 x 10⁻²⁷\nC) 5.645 x 10⁻²⁶\nD) 2.822 x 10⁻²⁶\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
