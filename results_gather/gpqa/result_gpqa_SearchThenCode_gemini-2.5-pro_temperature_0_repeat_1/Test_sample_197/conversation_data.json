    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], we first need to calculate its mole fraction among all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\nThe cobalt-containing species in the solution are:\n*   Free Co(II) ion (Co²⁺)\n*   Monothiocyanato cobalt(II) complex ([Co(SCN)]⁺)\n*   Dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex ([Co(SCN)₂])\n*   Trithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex ([Co(SCN)₃]⁻)\n*   Tetrathiocyanato cobalt(II) complex ([Co(SCN)₄]²⁻)\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of these species:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nUsing the given overall stability constants (β), we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, [Co²⁺], and the thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻]:\n*   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nThe mole fraction (α₂) of the dithiocyanato complex is the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration. The formula for the mole fraction of a specific complex species is derived from these relationships.\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\nα₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nBy factoring out [Co²⁺] from the denominator, it cancels with the numerator, simplifying the equation:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nSince the total concentration of the ligand ([SCN⁻] = 0.1 M) is ten times greater than the total concentration of the metal ion (c(Co) = 0.01 M), we can approximate the free ligand concentration [SCN⁻] to be equal to its total concentration, 0.1 M.\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values into the formula:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the denominator (let's call it S):\nS = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.1²) + (63 × 0.1³) + (16 × 0.1⁴)\nS = 1 + 0.9 + (40 × 0.01) + (63 × 0.001) + (16 × 0.0001)\nS = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\nS = 2.3646\n\nNext, calculate the value of the numerator:\nNumerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4\n\nNow, we can find the mole fraction α₂:\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 × 100 ≈ 16.92%\n\nThis value is closest to 16.9%.\n\n<<<C>>>"
