    "To calculate the enthalpy of formation of the given compound, (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2, we will use the provided bond energies and enthalpy of atomization values. The calculation involves determining the energy required to break the bonds of the elemental reactants and the energy released when forming the bonds of the product molecule.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula and Bond Types\n\nFirst, we need to identify the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms and the types of bonds in the molecule.\n\nThe structure is: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\n\n*   **Carbon (C) atoms:** 2 (in (CH3)2) + 1 (at C=) + 1 (at =CH) + 1 (in -CH2-) + 2 (in -CH(CH3)-) + 1 (in -CH2-) + 1 (at =CH) + 3 (in =C(CH3)2). This gives a total of 12 Carbon atoms.\n*   **Hydrogen (H) atoms:** 6 (in (CH3)2) + 1 (in =CH) + 2 (in -CH2-) + 4 (in -CH(CH3)-) + 2 (in -CH2-) + 1 (in =CH) + 6 (in =C(CH3)2). This gives a total of 22 Hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\nNext, we count the number of each type of bond:\n*   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C bonds:** There are two double bonds indicated by `C=C`. So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds:** The total number of connections between the 12 carbon atoms in a non-cyclic molecule is 11 (n-1). Since 2 of these are double bonds, the remaining must be single bonds. Thus, there are 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactants\n\nThe formation of C12H22 from its elements in their standard state is represented by the equation:\n12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization of the reactants is the energy required to convert them into gaseous atoms:\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of solid carbon: 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   Energy to break 11 moles of H-H bonds: 11 mol * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n\nTotal enthalpy of atomization for reactants = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Product\n\nThis is the total energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the product molecule, which is the sum of all its bond energies.\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds: 9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds: 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds: 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ/mol\n\nTotal sum of bond energies in the product = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the enthalpy of atomization of the reactants and the sum of the bond energies of the product.\n\nΔH_f = (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants) - (Sum of bond energies of product)\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n### Step 5: Convert to kJ/g\n\nThe options are given in different units. Let's convert our result from kJ/mol to kJ/g. For this, we need the molar mass of C12H22.\n*   Molar Mass (M) = (12 * 12.0 g/mol) + (22 * 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n\nNow, convert the enthalpy of formation to kJ/g:\nΔH_f (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.44 kJ/g**.\n\nThis value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
