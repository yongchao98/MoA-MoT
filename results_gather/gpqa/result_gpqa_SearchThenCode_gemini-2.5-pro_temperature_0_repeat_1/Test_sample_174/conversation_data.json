    "An oscillating spheroidal charge distribution with its symmetry axis along the z-axis can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole. The radiated power per unit solid angle for such a dipole is a function of the angle θ with the z-axis and the wavelength λ.\n\n### Angular Dependence of Radiated Power\n\nThe time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (dP/dΩ) by an oscillating electric dipole is given by:\n\ndP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the observation direction and the dipole axis (z-axis).\n\nThe maximum radiated power, A, occurs when sin²(θ) is at its maximum value. The maximum value of sin²(θ) is 1, which occurs at θ = 90° (perpendicular to the axis of oscillation).\n\nTo find the fraction of the maximum power radiated at an angle of θ = 30°, we calculate the ratio:\n\n(Power at 30°) / (Maximum Power) = sin²(30°) / sin²(90°)\n\nSince sin(30°) = 1/2 and sin(90°) = 1, the fraction is:\n\n(1/2)² / 1² = 1/4\n\n### Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power\n\nThe total power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency (ω⁴). The angular frequency ω is related to the wavelength λ by the equation ω = 2πc/λ, where c is the speed of light.\n\nTherefore, the radiated power P is proportional to (1/λ)⁴, which can be written as λ⁻⁴. This means the function f, representing the radiated power per unit solid angle, will also have this wavelength dependence.\n\nCombining these two findings, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at 30° is 1/4, and a possible form for the wavelength dependence of the radiated power function f is λ⁻⁴.\n\n<<<B>>>"
