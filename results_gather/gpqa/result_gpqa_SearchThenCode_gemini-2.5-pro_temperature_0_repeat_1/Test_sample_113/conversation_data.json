    "The first reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone (butan-2-one) using sodium cyanide (NaCN). This reaction involves the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) on the carbonyl carbon. The resulting alkoxide intermediate is then protonated to yield the final 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. While hydrogen cyanide (HCN) can be used directly, a common and safer laboratory procedure involves using NaCN followed by an acidic workup (represented by H₃O⁺) to protonate the intermediate. The acid is necessary to provide the proton for the hydroxyl group in the final product.\n\nThe second reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile (in this case, the cyanohydrin 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile) to a carboxylic acid (2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid). This transformation is a standard reaction in organic synthesis. The hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid is typically achieved by heating with a strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl) or sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄), in the presence of water. This process is known as acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. A weak acid like acetic acid (CH₃COOH) would be far less effective for this conversion.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n*   Reagent **A** for the first reaction should be **H₃O⁺** for the acidic workup.\n*   Reagent **B** for the second reaction should be **HCl** for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination of reagents is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.\n\n<<<B>>>"
