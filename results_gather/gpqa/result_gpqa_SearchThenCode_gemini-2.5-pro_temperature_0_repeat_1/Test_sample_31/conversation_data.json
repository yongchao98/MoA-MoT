    "To determine the energy required to accelerate a Lithium-6 nucleus to 0.96c, we must first calculate the kinetic energy of the nucleus at this speed.\n\n### 1. Identify the Nucleus and its Rest Mass\n\nThe nucleus in question is Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Lithium has an atomic number of 3 (3 protons). With 3 neutrons, the mass number is 3 + 3 = 6. Therefore, the nucleus is Lithium-6 ($^{6}_{3}Li$).\n\nThe rest mass of a neutral Lithium-6 atom is 6.015122887 u. To find the mass of the nucleus, we must subtract the mass of its 3 electrons. However, for energy calculations at this scale, it is more precise to use the established nuclide mass or the energy equivalent.\n\nThe isotopic mass of a Lithium-6 atom is 6.015122887 u. One atomic mass unit (u) is equivalent to 931.494 MeV/c².\n\nFirst, let's calculate the rest mass energy (E₀) of the Lithium-6 nucleus:\n*   **Rest Mass of $^{6}$Li nucleus**: 6.0134771 u.\n*   **Energy Equivalent of 1 u**: 931.494 MeV/c².\n*   **Rest Mass Energy (E₀)** = 6.0134771 u * 931.49410372 MeV/u\n    E₀ ≈ 5601.49 MeV\n\n### 2. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)\n\nThe speed (v) is given as 0.96c. The Lorentz factor is calculated as:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - (0.96c)²/c²)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216)\nγ = 1 / √(0.0784)\nγ = 1 / 0.28\nγ ≈ 3.57142857\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total and Kinetic Energy\n\nThe total energy (E) of the nucleus is given by E = γE₀. The kinetic energy (K) is the additional energy due to its motion, calculated as:\nK = E - E₀ = (γ - 1)E₀\n\nUsing the values calculated:\n*   K = (3.57142857 - 1) * 5601.49 MeV\n*   K = 2.57142857 * 5601.49 MeV\n*   K ≈ 14403.85 MeV\n\n### 4. Convert to GeV\n\nSince the options are in Giga-electron Volts (GeV), we convert our result from Mega-electron Volts (MeV):\n1 GeV = 1000 MeV\nK ≈ 14403.85 MeV / 1000\nK ≈ 14.404 GeV\n\nThis calculated kinetic energy does not match any of the options provided. Let's re-evaluate the \"energy of the RHIC\". The energy of a collider is often specified as the kinetic energy *per nucleon*. The Lithium-6 nucleus has 6 nucleons (3 protons and 3 neutrons).\n\n### 5. Calculate Energy per Nucleon\n\nLet's calculate the total kinetic energy for each option and see if the energy per nucleon is consistent. The question asks for the energy of the collider *so that* the speed is 0.96c. This implies we should calculate the required kinetic energy for the Li-6 ion itself.\n\nLet's re-check the mass calculation.\n*   Mass of a proton: ~938.27 MeV/c²\n*   Mass of a neutron: ~939.57 MeV/c²\n*   Total mass of 3 protons and 3 neutrons = 3 * 938.27 + 3 * 939.57 = 2814.81 + 2818.71 = 5633.52 MeV/c²\n*   This sum is greater than the actual nuclear mass due to the binding energy. The binding energy for Li-6 is 31.994 MeV.\n*   Calculated mass = 5633.52 - 31.994 = 5601.526 MeV/c². This is very close to our previously used value.\n\nLet's re-calculate with higher precision.\n*   **Atomic mass of $^{6}$Li**: 6.015122887 u\n*   **Mass of 3 electrons**: 3 * 0.00054858 u = 0.00164574 u\n*   **Nuclear mass of $^{6}$Li**: 6.015122887 u - 0.00164574 u = 6.013477147 u\n*   **Rest Energy (E₀)** = 6.013477147 u * 931.49410372 MeV/u ≈ 5601.490 MeV\n*   **Kinetic Energy (K)** = (γ - 1) * E₀ = 2.57142857 * 5601.490 MeV ≈ 14403.83 MeV ≈ 14.404 GeV.\n\nThe result remains inconsistent with the provided options. There might be a misunderstanding of the question's premise or an error in the options. However, if we are forced to choose the \"best\" fit, none of the options are close to the calculated value.\n\nLet's analyze the options to see if they represent another quantity. For instance, what if the energy given is the total energy E = γmc², not the kinetic energy?\n*   Total Energy E = γ * E₀ = 3.57142857 * 5601.49 MeV ≈ 20005.32 MeV ≈ 20.005 GeV.\n\nThis value (20.005 GeV) is very close to option C (20.132 GeV). The slight difference could be due to rounding or slightly different values for physical constants. Let's assume the question is asking for the **total relativistic energy (E)** and not the kinetic energy.\n\nLet's recalculate using the energy from option C to see what velocity it yields.\n*   E = 20.132 GeV = 20132 MeV\n*   E₀ = 5601.49 MeV\n*   γ = E / E₀ = 20132 / 5601.49 ≈ 3.5940\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²) => v = c * √(1 - 1/γ²)\n*   v = c * √(1 - 1/3.5940²) = c * √(1 - 0.0774) = c * √0.9226 ≈ 0.9605c\n\nThis speed is extremely close to the 0.96c given in the problem. Therefore, it is highly probable that the question is asking for the total relativistic energy of the nucleus.\n\nFinal check of the calculation:\n*   Nucleus: Lithium-6 (3 protons, 3 neutrons).\n*   Rest mass energy (E₀) ≈ 5.601 GeV.\n*   Velocity (v) = 0.96c, which gives a Lorentz factor (γ) of approximately 3.5714.\n*   Total Relativistic Energy (E) = γ * E₀ ≈ 3.5714 * 5.601 GeV ≈ 20.003 GeV.\n\nThis value is closest to 20.132 GeV.\n\n<<<C>>>"
