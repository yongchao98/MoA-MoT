    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments\n\n*   The initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus is `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the two fragments (m1 and m2) is 99% of the initial mass M: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   Therefore, the sum of their rest-mass energies is `(m1 + m2) * c^2 = 0.99 * M*c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   We can set up a system of equations for their rest-mass energies:\n    1.  `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m1*c^2 = 2 * (m2*c^2)`\n*   Substituting the second equation into the first: `2*(m2*c^2) + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`, which gives `3*(m2*c^2) = 297 GeV`.\n*   Solving for the rest-mass energies:\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment: `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment: `m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q-value) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy.\n*   `Q = T1 + T2 = (Initial M*c^2) - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) Kinetic Energy (T1)\n\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum of the two fragments must be zero. This means their momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: `p1 = p2 = p`.\n\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass energy (m*cÂ²) is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`. Also, total energy is the sum of kinetic energy (T) and rest-mass energy: `E = T + m*c^2`.\n\nTherefore, `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`.\n\nSince the momenta are equal:\n*   `(p*c)^2 = T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2)`\n*   `(p*c)^2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n\nSetting them equal and substituting `T2 = 3 GeV - T1`:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\n`396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Classical Kinetic Energy (T1_classical)\n\nIn the non-relativistic approximation, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2*m)`.\nSince the momenta are equal (`p1 = p2`), the kinetic energies are inversely proportional to the masses:\n*   `T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / 2*m1) / (p^2 / 2*m2) = m2 / m1 = 1/2`.\n*   So, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy:\n*   `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n### 5. Find the Difference\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation is:\n*   `Difference = T1 - T1_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, convert the result to MeV:\n*   `Difference = 0.005 GeV * (1000 MeV / 1 GeV) = 5 MeV`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
