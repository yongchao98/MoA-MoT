    "The search results confirm the fundamental principles used in the calculation. Specifically, the conservation of energy and momentum is the correct approach for this type of problem. The formulas for relativistic energy (E = γmc²) and momentum (p = √(γ² - 1)mc) are standard. The relationship between a photon's energy and momentum (p = E/c) is also correct.\n\nThe search results also discuss that when the initial net momentum is not zero (as is the case here), the angle between the photons will deviate from 180 degrees. This aligns with the problem statement and the calculation performed. The calculation correctly determined the net initial momentum and used it to find the final momentum components of the photons.\n\nThe steps taken were:\n1.  **Calculate Total Initial Energy:** Sum the relativistic energies of the electron and positron.\n    *   E_initial = (γ_electron + γ_positron) * m * c²\n2.  **Calculate Final Photon Energy:** Apply energy conservation. Since the two resulting photons have equal energy, the energy of each is half the total initial energy.\n    *   E_final = 2 * E_photon = E_initial  => E_photon = E_initial / 2\n3.  **Calculate Total Initial Momentum:** Calculate the relativistic momentum of the electron and positron and find the net momentum. Since they are moving in opposite directions along the same axis, this is a subtraction of magnitudes.\n    *   P_initial = p_electron - p_positron = (√(γ_electron² - 1) - √(γ_positron² - 1)) * m * c\n4.  **Calculate Final Momentum:** The final momentum is the vector sum of the two photons' momenta. Since the photons have equal energy, their momenta have equal magnitude (p_photon = E_photon / c). Due to conservation of momentum in the perpendicular direction, the angles with the horizontal axis must be equal and opposite (θ and -θ).\n    *   P_final_x = 2 * p_photon * cos(θ)\n5.  **Solve for the Angle:** Equate the initial and final x-momentum to solve for the angle θ.\n    *   P_initial = P_final_x\n6.  **Find the Angle Between Photons:** The total angle between the two photons is 2θ.\n\nThe calculation performed followed these steps precisely.\n\n*   **Initial Energy:** E_initial = (4 + 2)mc² = 6mc²\n*   **Photon Energy:** E_photon = 6mc² / 2 = 3mc²\n*   **Initial Momentum:** P_initial = (√(4² - 1) - √(2² - 1))mc = (√15 - √3)mc\n*   **Photon Momentum:** p_photon = 3mc² / c = 3mc\n*   **Final Momentum:** P_final_x = 2 * (3mc) * cos(θ) = 6mc * cos(θ)\n*   **Equating Momenta:** (√15 - √3)mc = 6mc * cos(θ)\n*   **Solving for θ:** cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6 ≈ 0.3568\n    *   θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°\n*   **Angle between photons:** 2θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°\n\nThis result is very close to 138. The logic is sound and confirmed by the principles outlined in the search results.\n\nFinal check of the question and options:\nA) 74\nB) 138\nC) 96\nD) 172\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 138.2 degrees matches option B.\n\nFinal answer is B.\n\nTo solve this problem, we must apply the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of linear momentum from special relativity.\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy**\n\n    The total energy before the collision must equal the total energy after the collision.\n\n    *   The energy of a relativistic particle is given by E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light.\n    *   The rest mass of an electron and a positron are the same, let's call it 'm'.\n    *   Energy of the electron (E_e) = γ_e * mc² = 4mc²\n    *   Energy of the positron (E_p) = γ_p * mc² = 2mc²\n    *   Total initial energy (E_initial) = E_e + E_p = 4mc² + 2mc² = 6mc²\n\n    After the annihilation, two photons of equal energy (E_ph) are produced.\n    *   Total final energy (E_final) = E_ph + E_ph = 2E_ph\n\n    Equating initial and final energy:\n    6mc² = 2E_ph\n    E_ph = 3mc²\n    So, each photon has an energy of 3mc².\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum**\n\n    The total momentum before the collision must equal the total momentum after the collision. Momentum is a vector quantity. Let's consider the horizontal (x-axis) as the direction of motion. The electron moves from the left (+x direction) and the positron from the right (-x direction).\n\n    *   The momentum of a relativistic particle is given by p = √(γ² - 1)mc.\n    *   Momentum of the electron (p_e) = √(4² - 1)mc = √(15)mc (in the +x direction).\n    *   Momentum of the positron (p_p) = √(2² - 1)mc = √(3)mc (in the -x direction).\n    *   Total initial momentum (P_initial) is the vector sum:\n        P_initial_x = √(15)mc - √(3)mc = (√15 - √3)mc\n        Since there is no initial vertical motion, P_initial_y = 0.\n\n    After the collision, we have two photons. The momentum of a photon is p = E/c.\n    *   Momentum of each photon (p_ph) = E_ph / c = (3mc²) / c = 3mc.\n\n    The photons move away in the upper-right and lower-right directions. Because the initial vertical momentum was zero, the final vertical momenta of the two photons must cancel each other out. This happens if they are emitted at symmetric angles, θ and -θ, with respect to the horizontal axis.\n\n    *   The horizontal component of the final momentum (P_final_x) is the sum of the horizontal components of each photon's momentum:\n        P_final_x = p_ph * cos(θ) + p_ph * cos(-θ) = 2 * p_ph * cos(θ) = 2 * (3mc) * cos(θ) = 6mc * cos(θ).\n    *   The vertical component of the final momentum (P_final_y) is:\n        P_final_y = p_ph * sin(θ) + p_ph * sin(-θ) = p_ph * sin(θ) - p_ph * sin(θ) = 0. This confirms our symmetric angle assumption.\n\n    Equating the horizontal components of the initial and final momentum:\n    (√15 - √3)mc = 6mc * cos(θ)\n\n    We can cancel 'mc' from both sides:\n    cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6\n\n3.  **Calculate the Angle**\n\n    Now, we calculate the value of θ.\n    *   √15 ≈ 3.873\n    *   √3 ≈ 1.732\n    *   cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 = 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568\n    *   θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1 degrees\n\n    The question asks for the angle *between* the directions of the two photons. This is the sum of the angle of the first photon above the horizontal and the angle of the second photon below the horizontal.\n    *   Total Angle = θ - (-θ) = 2θ\n    *   Total Angle ≈ 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°\n\nThis value is closest to 138.\n\n<<<B>>>"
