    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs.\n\n### **Observational Criteria**\n\n1.  **Brightness Limits:**\n    *   ESPRESSO (Paranal) can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude (m_v) brighter than 17 (i.e., m_v < 17).\n    *   HIRES (Keck) can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude (m_v) brighter than 16 (i.e., m_v < 16).\n    *   Therefore, for a star to be detectable by **both** instruments, its apparent V magnitude must be **m_v < 16**.\n\n2.  **Location and Visibility:**\n    *   The Paranal Observatory is located in Chile at a latitude of approximately -24.6 degrees.\n    *   The W. M. Keck Observatory is in Hawaii at a latitude of approximately +19.8 degrees.\n    *   A star is visible from an observatory if its declination is within the observable range. For Paranal, stars with declinations between +65.4° and -90° are visible. For Keck, stars with declinations between +90° and -70.2° are visible.\n\n### **Star-by-Star Analysis**\n\n**Star 1**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_v):** The absolute magnitude (M_v) is 15.5 at a distance (d) of 10 parsecs. The apparent magnitude is calculated as m_v = M_v + 5*log10(d/10), which gives m_v = 15.5 + 5*log10(1) = 15.5.\n*   **Brightness Check:** An m_v of 15.5 is brighter than 16, so it is detectable by both instruments.\n*   **Visibility Check:** The declination is -75°. This is not visible from Keck, whose southern limit is -70.2°.\n*   **Conclusion:** Not detectable by both.\n\n**Star 2**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_v):** Given as 16.5.\n*   **Brightness Check:** An m_v of 16.5 is not brighter than 16, so it cannot be detected by HIRES.\n*   **Conclusion:** Not detectable by both.\n\n**Star 3**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_v):** The apparent V magnitude is stated as 15.5 mag. The additional information about color excess is considered extraneous for this calculation, as \"apparent magnitude\" typically refers to the brightness observed from Earth.\n*   **Brightness Check:** An m_v of 15.5 is brighter than 16, making it detectable by both instruments.\n*   **Visibility Check:** The declination is +48°. This is visible from both Paranal (limit +65.4°) and Keck (limit +90°).\n*   **Conclusion:** Detectable by both.\n\n**Star 4**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_v):** The absolute magnitude is 15.5 at 10 parsecs, but there is also interstellar absorption. The absorption (A_v) is 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag. The final apparent magnitude is m_v = 15.5 + 5*log10(10/10) + 1.24 = 16.74.\n*   **Brightness Check:** An m_v of 16.74 is not brighter than 16, so it cannot be detected by HIRES.\n*   **Conclusion:** Not detectable by both.\n\n**Star 5**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_v):** The absolute magnitude is 16.5 at a distance of 5 parsecs. The apparent magnitude is m_v = 16.5 + 5*log10(5/10) = 16.5 + 5*(-0.301) ≈ 15.0.\n*   **Brightness Check:** An m_v of 15.0 is brighter than 16, making it detectable by both instruments.\n*   **Visibility Check:** The declination is +60°. This is visible from both Paranal (limit +65.4°) and Keck (limit +90°).\n*   **Conclusion:** Detectable by both.\n\nBased on the analysis, only Star 3 and Star 5 meet both the brightness and visibility criteria for both observatories.\n\n<<<D>>>"
