    "Optical isomerism is a property exhibited by chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. Let's analyze each of the given compounds:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Due to the presence of bulky substituents (nitro groups and carboxylate groups) at the ortho-positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') of the phenyl rings, the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings is severely restricted. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, leads to a stable chiral conformation. The molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable, resulting in a pair of enantiomers. Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism. A closely related compound, 6,6'-dinitro-2,2'-diphenic acid, is a classic example of a molecule that is optically active due to this phenomenon.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** This compound, also known as methyl lactate, is the methyl ester of lactic acid. The carbon atom at the second position is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom attached to four different substituents is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are optically active. Indeed, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exists as two distinct enantiomers: (R)-methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and (S)-methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\n3.  **benzophenone:** The chemical formula for benzophenone is (C₆H₅)₂CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. This molecule does not contain a chiral center. It possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbonyl group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image and is therefore achiral. Consequently, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The molecule has a center of symmetry (an inversion center) and a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. While it is a stereoisomer (a geometric isomer or diastereomer of dimethyl maleate), it is not optically active.\n\nBased on the analysis, only dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>"
