    "The Mott-Gurney equation is valid under a specific set of assumptions. To determine which of the provided statements is true, we must examine the fundamental conditions required for the equation's applicability.\n\nThe key assumptions for the validity of the Mott-Gurney law are:\n*   The device is a **single-carrier** (unipolar) device, meaning that either electrons or holes are the sole charge carriers contributing to the current.\n*   The semiconductor is **trap-free**, meaning there are no localized states within the bandgap that can immobilize charge carriers.\n*   The electrical contacts are **Ohmic**, which implies there is no energy barrier to the injection of charge carriers from the electrode into the semiconductor.\n*   The current is dominated by the **drift** of charge carriers under the influence of the applied electric field, and the **diffusion current** (due to carrier concentration gradients) is negligible.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options based on these principles:\n\n**A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.**\nThis statement is incorrect because the Mott-Gurney law is derived for a single-carrier device.\n\n**B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.**\nThis statement accurately reflects the conditions for the Mott-Gurney law's validity. A \"trap-free single-carrier device\" is a primary requirement. \"No carrier injection barrier\" is synonymous with an Ohmic contact. \"Negligible diffusion current\" is a core assumption in the derivation, with the current being drift-dominated.\n\n**C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The Mott-Gurney equation specifically describes a current that is dominated by the drift mechanism.\n\n**D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.**\nThis statement is incorrect because a Schottky contact creates an energy barrier to charge injection, which violates the assumption of an Ohmic contact (no injection barrier).\n\nTherefore, the only statement that correctly describes the conditions for the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
