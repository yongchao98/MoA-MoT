    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine how the number of stars changes with distance:\n\n1.  **Define the given relationship:** The problem states that the number of stars observed varies with parallax (plx) as 1/plx⁵. Let's denote the number of stars per unit parallax interval as N(plx). So, we have:\n    N(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵\n\n2.  **Recall the relationship between distance and parallax:** In astronomy, the distance (r) to a star is inversely proportional to its parallax (plx). This relationship is given by:\n    r ∝ 1/plx\n    This implies that:\n    plx ∝ 1/r\n\n3.  **Determine the goal:** The question asks how the number of stars changes per unit range of distance, r. Let's call this quantity N(r). We need to find the proportionality between N(r) and r.\n\n4.  **Relate the number densities:** The total number of stars in a given section of the sky is constant, regardless of whether we measure it using intervals of parallax or intervals of distance. Therefore, the number of stars in a small parallax interval, d(plx), must be equal to the number of stars in the corresponding distance interval, dr.\n    N(r) dr = N(plx) d(plx)\n\n5.  **Find the relationship between the intervals dr and d(plx):** We start with the relationship from step 2: plx = k/r (where k is a constant of proportionality). To find the relationship between the differentials, we take the derivative of plx with respect to r:\n    d(plx)/dr = -k/r²\n    When considering the size of the intervals, we can ignore the negative sign (which just indicates that as one quantity increases, the other decreases). So:\n    d(plx) ∝ (1/r²) dr\n\n6.  **Substitute and solve for N(r):** Now we substitute the relationships for N(plx), plx, and d(plx) into the equation from step 4.\n    *   N(r) dr ∝ N(plx) d(plx)\n    *   N(r) dr ∝ (1/plx⁵) * (1/r²) dr\n    *   Now, substitute plx ∝ 1/r:\n    *   N(r) ∝ (1/(1/r)⁵) * (1/r²)\n    *   N(r) ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²)\n    *   N(r) ∝ r³\n\nTherefore, the number of stars in that region of the sky changes with distance (per unit range of distance, r) as r³.\n\n<<<B>>>"
