    "To calculate the net potential energy of the system, we can use the method of images. A charge *q* placed a distance *d* from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius *R* induces a charge distribution on the surface of the sphere. The electric field and potential outside the sphere are equivalent to the field produced by the original charge *q* and an \"image\" charge *q'* located inside the sphere.\n\nThe magnitude and position of this image charge are given by:\n*   **Image charge (q'):** q' = -(R/d)q\n*   **Position of image charge (b):** b = R²/d from the center, along the line connecting the center and the charge *q*.\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge *q* from infinity to the distance *d*. This work is equal to half of the interaction potential energy between the charge *q* and its image *q'*. The factor of 1/2 arises because the induced charge on the sphere is not a fixed charge distribution; its own energy changes as the external charge is brought in.\n\nThe interaction potential energy between the charge *q* and the image charge *q'* is:\nU_interaction = k * q * q' / (distance between q and q')\n\nThe distance between the charge *q* (at distance *d* from the center) and the image charge *q'* (at distance *b* from the center) is *d - b*.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for *q'* and *b*:\nDistance = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d\n\nNow, we can calculate the interaction energy:\nU_interaction = k * q * [-(R/d)q] / [(d² - R²)/d]\nU_interaction = -k * q² * R / (d² - R²)\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is half of this interaction energy:\nU = (1/2) * U_interaction\nU = (1/2) * [-k * q² * R / (d² - R²)]\nU = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
