    "The initial calculation steps appear to be correct. The search results confirm that for a polyprotic acid buffer like the phosphate buffer, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation can be used for the dominant equilibrium to find the pH or [H+]. In this case, the major species are H2PO4- and HPO4^2-, so the relevant equilibrium is the one associated with Ka2.\n\nThe calculation for [H+] is:\n[H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n\nThen, to find the concentration of the fully deprotonated species, PO4^3- (orthophosphate), the third equilibrium must be considered.\nKa3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n\nRearranging this gives:\n[PO4^3-] = Ka3 * ([HPO4^2-] / [H+])\n\nThe initial calculations were:\nMoles of KH2PO4 = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\nMoles of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\nVolume = 0.200 L\n[H2PO4-] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n[HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\nUsing these concentrations and the given Ka values:\n[H+] = (6.2x10^-8) * (0.03674 / 0.02809) ≈ 8.11 x 10^-8 M\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8x10^-12) * (0.02809 / 8.11 x 10^-8) ≈ 6.234 x 10^-7 M\n\nThis result is extremely close to option B. The minor difference is likely due to rounding during intermediate steps or slight variations in the molar masses or Ka values used. The methodology is sound and confirmed by the search results.\n\nFinal check of the calculation:\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / ((6.2e-8 * 0.03674) / 0.02809)\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809 * 0.02809) / (6.2e-8 * 0.03674)\n[PO4^3-] = (1.4202e-15) / (2.27788e-9)\n[PO4^3-] = 6.2347 x 10^-7 M\n\nThe calculation is robust. The answer is B.\n\nTo determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4³⁻), we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the moles of each component:**\n    *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial concentrations:**\n    *   The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 0.200 L.\n    *   The concentration of H₂PO₄⁻ is from KH₂PO₄: [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M.\n    *   The concentration of HPO₄²⁻ is from Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O: [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M.\n\n3.  **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺]:**\n    *   The solution contains a buffer system of a weak acid (H₂PO₄⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻). The relevant equilibrium is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid, governed by Ka₂.\n    *   H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    *   We can use the expression for Ka₂ to find the [H⁺]:\n        Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    *   Rearranging for [H⁺]:\n        [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n        [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n        [H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n4.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO₄³⁻]:**\n    *   The orthophosphate ion is formed from the dissociation of HPO₄²⁻, which is governed by Ka₃.\n    *   HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    *   We use the expression for Ka₃:\n        Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   Rearranging to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n        [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    *   Substituting the values we have:\n        [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n        [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.23 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis calculated value is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
