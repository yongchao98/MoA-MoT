    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the expectation value of the operator O = 10σ_z + 5σ_x for the given spin state.\n\nThe spin state is given by the linear superposition:\n|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩\n\nIn matrix notation, the spin states and Pauli matrices are represented as:\n*   Spin-up state |↑⟩ =\n*   Spin-down state |↓⟩ =\n*   The given state |ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2]\n*   Pauli matrix σ_z = [, [0, -1]]\n*   Pauli matrix σ_x = [,]\n\nThe expectation value of an operator O is calculated as ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩. The calculation can be simplified by using the linearity of the expectation value:\n⟨O⟩ = ⟨10σ_z + 5σ_x⟩ = 10⟨σ_z⟩ + 5⟨σ_x⟩\n\nFirst, we calculate the expectation value of σ_z:\n⟨σ_z⟩ = ⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩\nThis involves the operation σ_z|ψ⟩:\nσ_z|ψ⟩ = [, [0, -1]] * [0.5, √3/2] = [0.5, -√3/2]\nThen, we compute the inner product ⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩:\n⟨σ_z⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [0.5, -√3/2] = (0.5 * 0.5) + ( (√3)/2 * (-√3)/2 ) = 0.25 - 3/4 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5\n\nNext, we calculate the expectation value of σ_x:\n⟨σ_x⟩ = ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩\nThis involves the operation σ_x|ψ⟩:\nσ_x|ψ⟩ = [,] * [0.5, √3/2] = [√3/2, 0.5]\nThen, we compute the inner product ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩:\n⟨σ_x⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [√3/2, 0.5] = (0.5 * √3/2) + ( (√3)/2 * 0.5 ) = √3/4 + √3/4 = 2√3/4 = √3/2\n\nNow, we combine these results to find the total expectation value:\n⟨O⟩ = 10 * (-0.5) + 5 * (√3/2)\n⟨O⟩ = -5 + 2.5 * √3\n\nUsing the approximation √3 ≈ 1.732:\n⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 2.5 * 1.732\n⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 4.33\n⟨O⟩ ≈ -0.67\n\nRounding the result to one decimal place, we get -0.7.\n\n<<<A>>>"
