    "Here is the step-by-step calculation for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n### 1. Energy Levels of a Single Particle\n\nFor a single particle of mass 'm' in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length 'L', the allowed energy levels are quantized and given by the formula:\nE_n = n² * (h² / 8mL²) or equivalently E_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²) where 'n' is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n\nThe problem defines E = (π²ħ² / 2mL²). Therefore, the energy of the n-th level is:\nE_n = n²E\n\n### 2. The Pauli Exclusion Principle\n\nSpin-1/2 particles, such as electrons, are fermions. According to the Pauli exclusion principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. In this system, a quantum state is defined by the spatial quantum number 'n' and the spin quantum number (spin-up or spin-down). This means each energy level 'n' can accommodate a maximum of two particles, one with spin-up and the other with spin-down.\n\n### 3. Ground State Energy (E_ground)\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles, respecting the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\n*   **n = 1 level:** We can place two particles in this lowest energy level. Their combined energy is 2 × E₁ = 2 × (1²E) = 2E.\n*   **n = 2 level:** The remaining two particles are placed in the next available energy level. Their combined energy is 2 × E₂ = 2 × (2²E) = 2 × 4E = 8E.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\nE_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E\n\n### 4. First Excited State Energy (E_first)\n\nTo obtain the first excited state, we move one particle from the highest occupied energy level of the ground state (n=2) to the next unoccupied energy level (n=3). This represents the lowest possible excitation energy.\n\n*   The new particle configuration is: two particles in the n=1 level, one particle in the n=2 level, and one particle in the n=3 level.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\nE_first = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃)\nE_first = (2 × 1²E) + (1 × 2²E) + (1 × 3²E)\nE_first = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E\n\n### 5. Second Excited State Energy (E_second)\n\nFor the second excited state, we must consider the next possible low-energy excitations from the ground state. There are a few possibilities for the second-lowest total energy configuration:\n\n*   **Possibility 1:** Excite one particle from n=1 to n=3. The configuration would be one particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (1 × 1²E) + (2 × 2²E) + (1 × 3²E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n*   **Possibility 2:** Excite both particles from n=2 to n=3. The configuration would be two particles in n=1 and two in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₃) = (2 × 1²E) + (2 × 3²E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n*   **Possibility 3:** Excite one particle from n=2 to n=4. The configuration would be two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4.\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₄) = (2 × 1²E) + (1 × 2²E) + (1 × 4²E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n\nComparing these possibilities, the lowest energy for the second excited state is 18E.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated energies for the three states are:\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
