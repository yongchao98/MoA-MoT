    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the relationship between λ₂ and λ₁.\n\n*   **Step 1: Understand the Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n    The mean free path (λ) represents the average distance a particle travels before colliding with another particle. Its general formula depends on the number density of target particles (n) and the collision cross-section (σ).\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze λ₁ (Gas Molecule - Gas Molecule Collision)**\n    λ₁ is the mean free path of gas molecules colliding with each other. In this case, the moving particles are identical to the target particles. The standard formula for this scenario is:\n    λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n    Here, `n` is the number density of the gas molecules, σ_gg is the collision cross-section between two gas molecules, and the √2 factor is crucial as it accounts for the relative motion between identical moving particles in the gas.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze λ₂ (Electron - Gas Molecule Collision)**\n    λ₂ is the mean free path for an electron from the beam colliding with a gas molecule. Two key things change:\n    1.  **Target and Projectile:** The projectile (electron) is no longer identical to the target (gas molecule). Electrons accelerated at 1000 kV are moving vastly faster than the gas molecules' thermal motion. Therefore, the gas molecules can be considered stationary targets. This removes the √2 factor from the MFP formula.\n    2.  **Collision Cross-Section:** The collision cross-section (σ) is the effective \"target area\" a particle presents.\n        *   For σ_gg, two molecules of diameter `d` collide. The effective target diameter is `d`, so σ_gg ≈ πd².\n        *   For σ_eg, a point-like electron collides with a molecule of radius `r = d/2`. The effective target area is simply the area of the molecule, so σ_eg ≈ πr² = π(d/2)² = (πd²)/4.\n        *   This means the electron-gas cross-section (σ_eg) is approximately 4 times smaller than the gas-gas cross-section (σ_gg).\n\n    The formula for λ₂ is therefore:\n    λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n\n*   **Step 4: Compare λ₁ and λ₂**\n    Let's find the ratio λ₂ / λ₁:\n    λ₂ / λ₁ = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]\n    Substitute σ_gg ≈ 4 * σ_eg:\n    λ₂ / λ₁ = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * 4 * σ_eg)]\n    λ₂ / λ₁ = (√2 * n * 4 * σ_eg) / (n * σ_eg)\n    λ₂ / λ₁ = 4√2 ≈ 4 * 1.414 = 5.656\n\n*   **Step 5: Conclusion**\n    Our calculation shows that λ₂ ≈ 5.66 * λ₁. This means the mean free path for an electron is significantly *longer* than the mean free path for a gas molecule under the same conditions. A longer path between collisions occurs because the electron is a smaller \"projectile\" and the √2 factor from the gas-gas MFP formula is absent.\n    Comparing our result (λ₂ ≈ 5.66 * λ₁) with the given options:\n    A) λ₂ >= 1.22 * λ₁: This is true, as 5.66 is much greater than 1.22.\n    B) λ₂ < λ₁: This is false.\n    C) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22 * λ₁: This is false.\n    D) λ₂ = λ₁: This is false.\n\n    Therefore, the only correct conclusion is A.\n\n```python\n# The problem asks for the relationship between the mean free path of gas molecules\n# colliding with each other (λ1) and the mean free path of an electron colliding\n# with those same gas molecules (λ2).\n\n# 1. Formula for λ1 (gas-gas collision):\n#    λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n#    - n is the number density of gas molecules.\n#    - σ_gg is the collision cross-section between two gas molecules.\n#    - The √2 factor is present because the colliding particles are identical and in thermal motion.\n\n# 2. Formula for λ2 (electron-gas collision):\n#    λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n#    - n is the same number density of gas molecules.\n#    - σ_eg is the collision cross-section for an electron hitting a gas molecule.\n#    - The √2 factor is absent because the electron is much faster than the gas molecules,\n#      making the gas molecules effectively stationary targets.\n\n# 3. Comparing Collision Cross-Sections (σ):\n#    - For two molecules of diameter 'd', σ_gg ≈ π * d^2.\n#    - For a point-like electron and a molecule of radius 'r' (where r=d/2), σ_eg ≈ π * r^2 = π * (d/2)^2 = (π * d^2) / 4.\n#    - Therefore, σ_gg ≈ 4 * σ_eg.\n\n# 4. Finding the Ratio λ2 / λ1:\n#    λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]\n#    λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)\n#    Substitute σ_gg ≈ 4 * σ_eg:\n#    λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * 4 * σ_eg) / (n * σ_eg)\n#    λ2 / λ1 = 4 * √2\n#    Since √2 is approximately 1.414, the ratio is about 4 * 1.414 = 5.656.\n\n# 5. Final Conclusion:\n#    We found that λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1.\n#    This means λ2 is significantly larger than λ1.\n#    Let's check the options:\n#    A) λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1  <-- This is TRUE because 5.66 > 1.22.\n#    B) λ2 < λ1          <-- False.\n#    C) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 <-- False.\n#    D) λ2 = λ1          <-- False.\n\n# The correct choice is A.\nfinal_choice = \"A\"\nprint(f\"The analysis shows that λ2 is substantially larger than λ1 (approximately 5.66 times larger).\")\nprint(f\"This is because the collision cross-section for an electron is smaller than for a gas molecule,\")\nprint(f\"and the formula for the mean free path of an electron beam in a gas does not have the √2 factor.\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, the relationship λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1 is correct.\")\nprint(\"The correct option is A.\")\n<<<A>>>\n```"
