  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n\nA) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nB) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nC) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\nD) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>",

    "Here is my step-by-step plan to analyze the genetic experiment and determine the correct conclusion:\n\n1.  **Represent the Data**: First, I will store the resistance percentages for the wild-type and all mutants in a Python dictionary for easy access.\n2.  **Analyze the Role of G2**: The strongest phenotype is the complete loss of resistance (0%) in the `g2` mutant. I will check if this phenotype masks the phenotypes of `g1` and `g3` in the double mutants (`g1g2` and `g2g3`). If a double mutant has the same phenotype as a single mutant, it signifies an epistatic relationship, where the epistatic gene often acts upstream. This will test the hypothesis that G2 is a transcription factor.\n3.  **Analyze the G1-G3 Interaction**: I will examine the `g1g3` double mutant. If the genes acted independently and their effects were purely additive, the resistance of the double mutant would be predictable. I'll calculate this expected additive resistance and compare it to the observed resistance (10%). A significant deviation, particularly a much lower observed resistance, points to a synergistic interaction.\n4.  **Evaluate Epistasis between G1 and G3**: I will directly check the definition of epistasis for G1 and G3. For G1 to be epistatic to G3, the `g1g3` phenotype must be the same as the `g1` phenotype. I will perform this comparison.\n5.  **Synthesize and Conclude**: I will print the results of each analytical step. By combining these logical deductions, I will evaluate the given options (A, B, C, D) to find the one that aligns best with the experimental evidence, even if the terminology in the option is imperfect.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_gene_interaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the results of a genetic experiment to determine gene interactions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Represent the experimental data\n    resistance = {\n        'wild_type': 100,\n        'g1': 75,\n        'g2': 0,\n        'g3': 50,\n        'g1g2': 0,\n        'g1g3': 10,\n        'g2g3': 0\n    }\n\n    print(\"--- Analysis of Gene Interactions ---\")\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze the role of G2\n    print(\"\\n1.
