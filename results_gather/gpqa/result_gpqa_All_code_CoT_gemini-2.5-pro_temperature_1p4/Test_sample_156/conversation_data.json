    "Retroviruses, like HIV and the virus that causes COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2), have an RNA genome. To detect them using PCR-based methods, their RNA must first be converted into DNA. Here is the step-by-step plan to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the nature of the virus:** The question specifies a \"retrovirus,\" which means its genetic material is RNA.\n2.  **Evaluate the identification method:** Any diagnostic approach that relies on detecting the virus's genetic material must first handle its RNA genome. Standard DNA sequencing (Option D) would not work directly. Sequencing based on symptoms (Option B) is unreliable for designing a specific molecular test. Detecting antibodies (Option C) identifies the body's response, not the virus itself, and is often delayed, making it unsuitable for *quick* diagnosis in an early outbreak. The correct method is to first convert the viral RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA) using an enzyme called reverse transcriptase, and then sequence this cDNA (Option A).\n3.  **Evaluate the diagnostic kit type:**\n    *   **ELISA (Option C):** Detects antibodies (like IgG or IgM). IgG indicates a later or past infection, not necessarily a current, acute one. This is not ideal for rapid, early detection.\n    *   **Nested PCR (Option B):** While sensitive, it is more complex and has a higher risk of contamination than modern alternatives.\n    *   **Real-time PCR (Option A):** Often combined with reverse transcription (RT-qPCR), this method is the gold standard. It is extremely sensitive, specific, fast (providing results in hours), and quantitative (it can measure the amount of virus, or viral load).\n4.  **Conclusion:** The best approach is to first characterize the retrovirus's genetic sequence by creating and sequencing its cDNA. Then, use this information to design a highly sensitive, specific, and rapid real-time PCR kit for diagnosis. This perfectly matches the description in Option A.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef solve_diagnostic_challenge():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function presents the options for designing a retrovirus diagnostic kit\n    and prints the correct choice with an explanation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Dictionary of options\n    options = {\n        'A': \"First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing. You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.\",\n        'B': \"First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms, provided by the affected patients.

You then develop a PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.\"\n    }\n\n    # Explanation for the correct choice\n    explanation = \"\"\"\n    The correct approach for designing a molecular diagnostic kit for a new retrovirus outbreak is Option A. Here's why:\n    1.  Retroviruses have an RNA genome. Therefore, to sequence its genetic material, it must first be converted into complementary DNA (cDNA) via reverse transcription. Direct DNA sequencing (Option D) is not possible.\n    2.  Real-time PCR (qPCR), specifically Reverse Transcription qPCR (RT-qPCR), is the gold standard for viral detection. It is rapid, highly sensitive, and specific, making it ideal for diagnosing an active outbreak.\n    3.  Relying on symptoms (Option B) is unreliable for designing a specific molecular test. Antibody tests like ELISA for IgG (Option C) detect the immune response, which occurs later in the infection, and are therefore not suitable for early detection.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The correct answer\n    correct_answer = 'A'\n\n    print(\"Question: How would you design a molecular diagnostic kit for a retrovirus outbreak?\\n\")\n    for key, value in options.items():\n        print(f\"{key}) {value}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"---\nSolution ---\")\n    print(f\"The best choice is: {correct_answer}\")\n    print(\"\\nExplanation:\")\n    # Use textwrap to format the explanation nicely\n    wrapped_explanation = textwrap.fill(textwrap.dedent(explanation).strip(), width=80)\n    print(wrapped_explanation)\n\n# Execute the function\nsolve_diagnostic_challenge()\n\nprint(\"\\n<<<A>>>\")\n```"
