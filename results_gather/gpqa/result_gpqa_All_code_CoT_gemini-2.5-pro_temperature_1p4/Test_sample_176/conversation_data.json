    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Luminosity Ratio Formula**: The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it's a black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: `L = 4 * π * R² * σ * T⁴`, where `R` is the radius and `T` is the surface temperature. The ratio of luminosities for the two stars is therefore `L₁/L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴`.\n\n2.  **Radius Ratio**: The problem states that `R₁ = 1.5 * R₂`, so the ratio `R₁/R₂` is 1.5.\n\n3.  **Temperature Ratio**: The temperature of a black body is related to its peak emission wavelength (`λ_max`) by Wien's Displacement Law: `T ∝ 1/λ_max_rest`, where `λ_max_rest` is the peak wavelength in the star's own rest frame. We are told the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same. We must use the Doppler effect to relate the observed wavelength to the rest-frame wavelength. The formula is `λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + vᵣ/c)`, where `vᵣ` is the radial velocity.\n    *   For Star 1, `vᵣ₁ = 0`, so `λ_obs₁ = λ_rest₁`.\n    *   For Star 2, `vᵣ₂ = 700 km/s`, so `λ_obs₂ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + vᵣ₂/c)`.\n    *   Since `λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂`, we have `λ_rest₁ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + vᵣ₂/c)`.\n    *   The temperature ratio `T₁/T₂` is `λ_rest₂/λ_rest₁`, which simplifies to `1 / (1 + vᵣ₂/c)`.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation**: I will substitute the radius ratio and the calculated temperature ratio into the luminosity ratio formula to find the final numerical answer. This result will then be compared to the given options to find the correct choice.\n\n```python\n# Import the math library for constants if needed, but defining it is fine.\n# Define the constants and given values from the problem statement.\n# R1/R2, the ratio of the radii of Star_1 to Star_2.\nradius_ratio = 1.5\n\n# v2, the radial velocity of Star_2 in km/s. Star_1 is at rest (v1 = 0).\nv2_kms = 700\n\n# c, the speed of light in km/s.\nc_kms = 299792.458\n\n# The core of the problem is to find the ratio of luminosities L1/L2.\n# According to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, L is proportional to R^2 * T^4.\n# So, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.\n\n# We need to find the temperature ratio T1/T2.\n# According to Wien's Displacement Law, T is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength in the rest frame (λ_rest).\n# So, T1/T2 = λ_rest2 / λ_rest1.\n\n# The problem states the observed peak wavelengths (λ_obs) are the same.\n# We relate observed wavelength to rest-frame wavelength using the Doppler effect: λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c).\n# For Star 1 (v1=0): λ_obs1 = λ_rest1\n# For Star 2: λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2_kms/c_kms)\n# Since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, we have: λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2_kms/c_kms).\n\n# From this, we find the ratio of rest-frame wavelengths:\n# λ_rest2 / λ_rest1 = 1 / (1 + v2_kms / c_kms)\n# This is our temperature ratio, T1/T2.\ntemp_ratio = 1 / (1 + v2_kms / c_kms)\n\n# Now, substitute the radius and temperature ratios into the luminosity ratio formula.\nluminosity_ratio = (radius_ratio**2) * (temp_ratio**4)\n\n# Print the final result and the options to find the closest match.\nprint(f\"The computed factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 is: {luminosity_ratio:.4f}\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this to the options:\")\nprint(\"A) ~2.25\")\nprint(\"B) ~2.23\")\nprint(\"C) ~2.35\")\nprint(\"D) ~2.32\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated result is closest to option B.\")\n```\n<<<B>>>"
