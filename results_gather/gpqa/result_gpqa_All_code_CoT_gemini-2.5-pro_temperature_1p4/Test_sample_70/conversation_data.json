    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant information:** The key data is the ratio of orbital periods for the five exoplanets: 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. We need to compare Planet_4 and Planet_2.\n2.  **Determine the ratio of orbital periods (P) between Planet_4 and Planet_2:** From the given ratio, P_4 corresponds to 3.5 and P_2 corresponds to 2. So, the ratio P_4 / P_2 is 3.5 / 2.\n3.  **Relate orbital period (P) to orbital radius (a):** According to Kepler's Third Law for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (orbital radius for circular orbits): P² ∝ a³. This can be written as (P_4 / P_2)² = (a_4 / a_2)³.\n4.  **Relate orbital radius (a) to equilibrium temperature (T_eq):** The equilibrium temperature of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital radius: T_eq ∝ 1 / √a or T_eq ∝ a⁻⁰⁵. The albedo is the same for both planets, so it cancels out when taking the ratio.\n5.  **Combine the relationships to find the temperature ratio:**\n    *   From step 4, the ratio of temperatures is T_4 / T_2 = (a_4 / a_2)⁻⁰⁵.\n    *   From step 3, we can find the radius ratio: a_4 / a_2 = (P_4 / P_2)^(2/3).\n    *   Substituting the radius ratio into the temperature ratio equation gives: T_4 / T_2 = [ (P_4 / P_2)^(2/3) ]⁻⁰⁵ = (P_4 / P_2)^(-1/3).\n6.  **Calculate the final value:** Substitute the period ratio (3.5 / 2) into the final formula and compute the result. This will give us the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the ratio of orbital periods for Planet_4 and Planet_2.\nperiod_ratio_p4_p2 = 3.5 / 2.0\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the ratio of equilibrium temperatures.\n# The relationship is T_ratio = (P_ratio)^(-1/3).\ntemperature_ratio = period_ratio_p4_p2 ** (-1/3)\n\n# Print the calculated ratio\nprint(f\"The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is: {temperature_ratio:.3f}\")\n\n# Print the given options to compare\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\nprint(\"A) ~0.57\")\nprint(\"B) ~0.69\")\nprint(\"C) ~0.83\")\nprint(\"D) ~0.75\")\n\n# Determine the closest option\noptions = {'A': 0.57, 'B': 0.69, 'C': 0.83, 'D': 0.75}\nclosest_option = min(options, key=lambda k: abs(options[k] - temperature_ratio))\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated value is closest to option {closest_option}.\")\n\n# Final answer choice\nprint(f\"The final answer is {closest_option}\")\n```\n<<<C>>>"
