    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Scenario:** The problem describes a hypothetical situation where the pp-III branch of the Sun's nuclear reactions has stopped. We need to understand which neutrino sources are affected. The pp-III branch is responsible for producing Boron-8 (`⁸B`) neutrinos. The stoppage is observed on Earth now, meaning it happened in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago (the light/neutrino travel time). Therefore, we will not detect any `⁸B` neutrinos. All other sources, like `pp`, `⁷Be` (from the pp-II branch), and CNO neutrinos, remain unchanged.\n\n2.  **Examine the Energy Bands:** We need to find the ratio of neutrino flux in two specific energy bands:\n    *   **Band 1:** 700-800 keV (0.7-0.8 MeV)\n    *   **Band 2:** 800-900 keV (0.8-0.9 MeV)\n\n3.  **Identify Neutrino Sources in Each Band (in the new scenario):**\n    *   **Band 1 (700-800 keV):** With the `⁸B` neutrinos gone, the main contributors in this energy range are the neutrinos from the CNO cycle, specifically from `¹³N` decay (max energy ~1.2 MeV) and `¹⁵O` decay (max energy ~1.73 MeV). These sources have a continuous energy spectrum.\n    *   **Band 2 (800-900 keV):** This band is critically important because it contains the very strong, discrete energy line from `⁷Be` electron capture at 861 keV (0.861 MeV). Since this reaction is part of the pp-II branch, it is unaffected by the change. This single line contributes a massive flux compared to the continuous spectra in the same region. The CNO neutrinos also contribute a small continuous background flux here.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Ratio:**\n    *   The flux in Band 1 will be the integrated flux from the continuous CNO spectra over the 100 keV width.\n    *   The flux in Band 2 will be overwhelmingly dominated by the total flux of the 861 keV `⁷Be` line. The contribution from the CNO continuous spectrum is negligible in comparison.\n    *   The ratio will be `Flux (Band 1) / Flux (Band 2) ≈ (Integrated CNO Flux from 700-800 keV) / (Total ⁷Be Line Flux)`.\n\n5.  **Estimate the Values and Calculate:** We will use standard solar model values for the fluxes.\n    *   The total flux of the `⁷Be` line at 861 keV is approximately 4.8 x 10⁹ neutrinos per cm² per second. This is `Flux (Band 2)`.\n    *   The total flux of CNO neutrinos is spread over a wide energy range. We can estimate the portion in Band 1. The total flux from `¹³N` and `¹⁵O` is roughly 5.2 x 10⁸ neutrinos per cm² per second, spread across a range of about 1.7 MeV. The flux in a 0.1 MeV slice (700-800 keV) will be a small fraction of this total. A reasonable approximation gives a flux of about 4 x 10⁷ neutrinos per cm² per second for `Flux (Band 1)`.\n    *   The ratio is therefore approximately (4 x 10⁷) / (4.8 x 10⁹) ≈ 0.83 x 10⁻², which is very close to 0.01.\n\nThe Python code below will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the known physical quantities based on the Standard Solar Model.\n# We are calculating the ratio Flux(Band 1) / Flux(Band 2)\n# where Band 1 is 700-800 keV and Band 2 is 800-900 keV.\n# The pp-III branch (Boron-8 neutrinos) is stopped.\n\n# --- Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV) ---\n# This band is dominated by the Beryllium-7 neutrino line at 861 keV.\n# This line comes from the pp-II branch, which is unaffected.\n# Its contribution is so large that we can approximate the flux in Band 2\n# as the total flux of this line.\n# Units are neutrinos / (cm^2 * s)\nflux_band_2 = 4.8e9  # Flux of the ⁷Be line at 861 keV\n\n# --- Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV) ---\n# With Boron-8 neutrinos gone, the flux in this band comes from the CNO cycle.\n# We need to estimate the flux from the continuous spectra of ¹³N and ¹⁵O\n# within this 100 keV (0.1 MeV) window.\n\n# Total fluxes and energy ranges for the main CNO contributors:\ntotal_flux_N13 = 2.96e8\nmax_energy_N13 = 1.2  # in MeV\n\ntotal_flux_O15 = 2.23e8\nmax_energy_O15 = 1.73 # in MeV\n\nband_width = 0.1 # 800 keV - 700 keV = 100 keV = 0.1 MeV\n\n# To estimate the flux in the band, we can approximate the average differential flux\n# (flux per MeV) and multiply by the band width.
