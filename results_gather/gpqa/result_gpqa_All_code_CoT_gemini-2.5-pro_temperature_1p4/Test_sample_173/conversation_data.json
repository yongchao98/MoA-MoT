    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define Constants and Initial Values:** We are given the rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus, `E_M = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`. We'll work with energies directly as it simplifies the calculations.\n\n2.  **Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies:**\n    *   We are given two conditions for the rest-mass energies of the fragments, `E_m1` and `E_m2`:\n        1.  The sum of their rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`, which translates to `E_m1 + E_m2 = 0.99 * E_M`.\n        2.  One fragment is twice as massive: `m1 = 2 * m2`, which translates to `E_m1 = 2 * E_m2`.\n    *   We will solve this system of two linear equations to find `E_m1` (the more massive fragment) and `E_m2`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Total Kinetic Energy Released:**\n    *   By the principle of conservation of energy, the initial total energy (`E_M`, since it's at rest) must equal the final total energy (sum of rest-mass energies and kinetic energies of the fragments).\n    *   `E_M = (E_m1 + T1) + (E_m2 + T2)`.\n    *   The total kinetic energy released is `T_total = T1 + T2 = E_M - (E_m1 + E_m2)`. This energy comes from the conversion of the \"missing\" mass (mass defect).\n\n4.  **Calculate Kinetic Energy `T1` using Classical Approximation:**\n    *   In classical mechanics, from the conservation of momentum (`p1 = -p2` or `m1*v1 = -m2*v2`), the kinetic energies of the two fragments are shared in inverse proportion to their rest-masses.\n    *   The kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`m1`) is `T1_classical = T_total * (m2 / (m1 + m2))`. Since `m1 = 2*m2`, this simplifies to `T1_classical = T_total * (m2 / (2*m2 + m2)) = T_total / 3`.\n\n5.  **Calculate Kinetic Energy `T1` using Relativistic Mechanics:**\n    *   Relativistically, we must use the energy-momentum relation: `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n    *   Conservation of momentum requires the momenta of the two fragments to be equal in magnitude: `p1 = p2`.\n    *   Therefore, `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`, which means `E1^2 - E_m1^2 = E2^2 - E_m2^2`.\n    *   Here, `E1 = E_m1 + T1` and `E2 = E_m2 + T2`. We also know `T2 = T_total - T1`.\n    *   By substituting these into the momentum equation and solving for `T1`, we can find the correct relativistic kinetic energy. The derived formula is `T1 = T_total * (T_total + 2*E_m2) / (2 * E_M)`.\n\n6.  **Find the Difference:**\n    *   Finally, we calculate the difference: `Î”T1 = T1_relativistic - T1_classical`. We'll convert the result to MeV as requested by the options.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define initial values\nE_M_GeV = 300  # Rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus in GeV\nGeV_to_MeV = 1000 # Conversion factor\n\n# Step 2: Calculate fragment rest-mass energies\n# We have a system of two equations:\n# 1) E_m1 + E_m2 = 0.99 * E_M_GeV\n# 2) E_m1 = 2 * E_m2\n# Substitute (2) into (1): 2*E_m2 + E_m2 = 0.99 * E_M_GeV\nE_sum_m_GeV = 0.99 * E_M_GeV\n# 3 * E_m2 = E_sum_m_GeV\nE_m2_GeV = E_sum_m_GeV / 3\nE_m1_GeV = 2 * E_m2_GeV\n\nprint(f\"Initial rest-mass energy (M*c^2): {E_M_GeV} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Rest-mass energy of more massive fragment (m1*c^2): {E_m1_GeV:.2f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Rest-mass energy of less massive fragment (m2*c^2): {E_m2_GeV:.2f} GeV\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate total kinetic energy released\nT_total_GeV = E_M_GeV - E_sum_m_GeV\nprint(f\"Total kinetic energy released: {T_total_GeV} GeV\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate T1 using classical approximation\n# T1_classical / T_total = m2 / (m1 + m2) = (m2*c^2) / (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2) = E_m2 / E_sum_m\n# T1_classical = T_total * (E_m2 / (E_m1 + E_m2))\n# Since E_m1 = 2*E_m2, this is T_total * (E_m2 / (3*E_m2)) = T_total / 3\nT1_classical_GeV = T_total_GeV / 3\nT1_classical_MeV = T1_classical_GeV * GeV_to_MeV\nprint(f\"Classical kinetic energy of massive fragment (T1_classical): {T1_classical_GeV:.4f} GeV = {T1_classical_MeV:.1f} MeV\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 5: Calculate T1 using relativistic mechanics\n# From conservation of momentum p1=p2 -> (p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2\n# E1^2 - E_m1^2 = E2^2 - E_m2^2\n# Where E1 = E_m1 + T1 and E2 = E_m2 + T2 = E_m2 + (T_total - T1)\n# Solving this for T1 gives: T1 = T_total * (T_total + 2*E_m2) / (2*E_M)\nT1_relativistic_GeV = T_total_GeV * (T_total_GeV + 2 * E_m2_GeV) / (2 * E_M_GeV)\nT1_relativistic_MeV = T1_relativistic_GeV * GeV_to_MeV\nprint(f\"Relativistic kinetic energy of massive fragment (T1): {T1_relativistic_GeV:.4f} GeV = {T1_relativistic_MeV:.1f} MeV\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 6: Find the difference\ndifference_MeV = T1_relativistic_MeV - T1_classical_MeV\nprint(f\"The difference (T1_relativistic - T1_classical) is: {difference_MeV:.1f} MeV.\")\n\n# Comparing the result with the options\n# A) 10 MeV\n# B) 2 MeV\n# C) 20 MeV\n# D) 5 MeV\nprint(\"The calculated difference is 5.0 MeV, which corresponds to option D.\")\n```\n<<<D>>>"
