    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Particle Decay and Relativity:** The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive after a time `t` in the lab frame is given by the exponential decay law, `f = exp(-t / T_lab)`, where `T_lab` is the particle's mean lifetime as measured in the lab.\n2.  **Time Dilation:** Due to special relativity, the lifetime of a fast-moving particle is dilated. The lab-frame lifetime `T_lab` is related to the particle's proper lifetime `τ` (its lifetime in its own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor `γ`: `T_lab = γ * τ`.\n3.  **Travel Time:** The particles are created at the center of the detector and travel to the wall. The time this takes in the lab frame is `t = R / v`, where `R` is the detector's radius and `v` is the particle's velocity. Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`. So, `t ≈ R / c`.\n4.  **Combining the Formulas:** Substituting these into the decay equation, we get:\n    `f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ))`\n    The values `R`, `c`, and `τ` are all constants for a given particle and detector. We can group them into a single constant, let's call it `C = R / (c * τ)`. The formula simplifies to:\n    `f = exp(-C / γ)`\n5.  **Using the Initial Data:** We are given that when `γ₁ = 20`, the fraction of surviving particles is `f₁ = 1/3`. We can use this to find the constant `C`.\n    `1/3 = exp(-C / 20)`\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: `ln(1/3) = -C / 20`, which simplifies to `C = 20 * ln(3)`.\n6.  **Solving for the New Lorentz Factor:** Now we need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, for which `f₂ = 2/3`. We use the same formula with our calculated constant `C`.\n    `2/3 = exp(-C / γ₂)`\n    Taking the natural logarithm: `ln(2/3) = -C / γ₂`.\n    Solving for `γ₂`: `γ₂ = -C / ln(2/3)`.\n7.  **Calculation:** Substitute the expression for `C` back into the equation for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = - (20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3) = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`.\n    The following Python code will calculate this value and identify the correct option.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the known variables from the initial condition.\ngamma_1 = 20\nf_1 = 1/3\n\n# Step 2: Use the formula f = exp(-C / gamma) to find the constant C.\n# ln(f_1) = -C / gamma_1\n# C = -gamma_1 * ln(f_1)\n# Note: ln(1/3) = -ln(3)\n# So, C = -20 * (-ln(3)) = 20 * ln(3)\nC = -gamma_1 * math.log(f_1)\n\n# Step 3: Define the target condition.\nf_2 = 2/3\n\n# Step 4: Use the same formula and the calculated constant C to find the new Lorentz factor, gamma_2.\n# ln(f_2) = -C / gamma_2\n# gamma_2 = -C / ln(f_2)\ngamma_2 = -C / math.log(f_2)\n\n# Step 5: Print the calculated result and the available options.\nprint(f\"The required Lorentz factor (gamma_2) is: {gamma_2:.2f}\")\nprint(\"The options are:\")\nprint(\"A) 54\")\nprint(\"B) 28\")\nprint(\"C) 68\")\nprint(\"D) 40\")\n\n# Determine the closest option\noptions = {'A': 54, 'B': 28, 'C': 68, 'D': 40}\nclosest_option = min(options, key=lambda k: abs(options[k] - gamma_2))\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated value is closest to option {closest_option}.\")\n\n```\n<<<A>>>"
