    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by:\n    `T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))`\n    where `T_star` is the star's temperature, `A` is the planet's albedo, `R_star` is the star's radius, and `a` is the orbital distance (semi-major axis).\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** To find T_eq1 / T_eq2, we divide the formula for Planet1 by the formula for Planet2:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [T_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]`\n    Since `T_star`, `R_star`, and the albedo (`A1 = A2`) are the same for both, they cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)`\n\n4.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Given Quantities:** We need to find the ratio `a2 / a1`. We are given the planet masses and the Doppler shifts they induce on the star. The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) of a star due to a planet in a circular orbit is related to the planet's mass (m_p) and orbital distance (a) by:\n    `K ∝ m_p / sqrt(a)`\n    This means `sqrt(a) ∝ m_p / K`, and therefore `a ∝ (m_p / K)^2`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Orbital Distance Ratio (a2 / a1):**\n    `a2 / a1 = (m2 / K2)^2 / (m1 / K1)^2 = (m2 / m1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2`\n\n6.  **Relate Radial Velocity (K) to Doppler Shift (Δλ):** The Doppler shift formula is `Δλ / λ = v_r / c`. The maximum radial velocity is K, so `K = c * (Δλ / λ)`. The ratio of the radial velocities is therefore equal to the ratio of their Doppler shifts:\n    `K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2`\n\n7.  **Combine the Formulas:** Substitute the Doppler shift ratio back into the orbital distance ratio equation:\n    `a2 / a1 = (m2 / m1)^2 * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)^2`\n    Now substitute this into our simplified temperature ratio formula:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt((m2 / m1)^2 * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)^2)`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (m2 / m1) * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)`\n\n8.  **Execute the Calculation:** Plug in the given values for the masses (`m1 = 7`, `m2 = 5`) and Doppler shifts (`Δλ1 = 0.03`, `Δλ2 = 0.04`) to find the final ratio.\n\n```python\n# Planetary and Doppler shift data\n# Mass of Planet1 in Earth masses\nm1 = 7.0\n# Mass of Planet2 in Earth masses\nm2 = 5.0\n\n# Doppler shift induced by Planet1 in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda1 = 0.03\n# Doppler shift induced by Planet2 in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda2 = 0.04\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq1 / T_eq2 can be derived as:\n# T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n# And the orbital distance 'a' is related to planet mass 'm' and RV semi-amplitude 'K' by:\n# a is proportional to (m / K)^2\n# The RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to the Doppler shift delta_lambda.\n# So, T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(((m2/K2)^2) / ((m1/K1)^2))\n# This simplifies to T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (m2/m1) * (K1/K2) = (m2/m1) * (delta_lambda1/delta_lambda2)\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the masses (m2 / m1)\nmass_ratio = m2 / m1\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the Doppler shifts (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2)\ndoppler_ratio = delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2\n\n# Calculate the final ratio of the equilibrium temperatures\ntemp_ratio = mass_ratio * doppler_ratio\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(f\"The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2) is: {temp_ratio:.2f}\")\n\n# Print the options for comparison\nprint(\"A) ~ 0.53\")\nprint(\"B) ~ 0.98\")\nprint(\"C) ~ 1.30\")\nprint(\"D) ~ 1.05\")\n```\n<<<A>>>"
