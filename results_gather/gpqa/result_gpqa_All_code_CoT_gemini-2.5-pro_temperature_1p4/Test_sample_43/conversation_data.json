    "To determine which experiment is unsuitable for investigating a drug's effect on mitochondria, I will analyze the biological principle behind each proposed method.\n\n1.  **Analyze Option A:** The luciferase/luciferin system is a well-established biochemical assay that measures ATP levels. Since mitochondria are the primary producers of ATP in the cell, measuring changes in ATP concentration is a direct way to assess mitochondrial function. Therefore, this experiment is relevant.\n2.  **Analyze Option B:** Mito-RTP is a fluorescent probe that specifically accumulates in mitochondria, allowing for their visualization. Confocal microscopy can then be used to observe changes in mitochondrial morphology (e.g., fragmentation or elongation), which are key indicators of mitochondrial health and stress. Therefore, this experiment is relevant.\n3.  **Analyze Option C:** This option proposes to isolate mitochondria via differential centrifugation and then perform a glucose uptake assay. This is fundamentally flawed. Glucose uptake is the process of transporting glucose across the cell's plasma membrane into the cytoplasm. This process is mediated by glucose transporters (GLUTs) on the cell surface. Mitochondria do not take up glucose; they take up pyruvate (the product of glycolysis in the cytoplasm) and fatty acids. Therefore, measuring glucose uptake on isolated mitochondria will not yield any meaningful data about their function.\n4.  **Analyze Option D:** The dye mentioned, 5,5',6,6'-Tetrachloro-1,1',3, 3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide (commonly known as JC-1), is used to measure mitochondrial membrane potential. A healthy mitochondrion maintains a high membrane potential, which is essential for ATP production. A drop in this potential is a classic sign of mitochondrial dysfunction. Flow cytometry allows for a quantitative analysis of this potential across a large population of cells. Therefore, this experiment is highly relevant.\n\nBased on this analysis, the experiment described in option C is incorrectly designed and will not provide useful information about the drug's effect on mitochondria.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\n# The user wants to identify the experimental option that is NOT suitable for studying a drug's effect on mitochondria.\n# Let's analyze each option based on its biological principle.\n\noptions = {\n    'A': {\n        'technique': \"Luciferase assay\",\n        'measures': \"ATP levels\",\n        'relevance': \"Mitochondria are the main source of cellular ATP.
