    "This problem describes the quantum mechanical phenomenon of Larmor precession. A spin's magnetic moment, when placed in a magnetic field, will precess around the direction of the field at a specific frequency, known as the Larmor frequency. We can solve this by calculating the time evolution of the quantum state and then finding the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Set up the quantum system:** Define the initial state of the spin-1/2 particle. Since it's aligned with a field in the +Z direction, its initial state `|ψ(0)>` is spin-up along Z, denoted as `|+z>`.\n2.  **Define the dynamics:** When the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction, the system evolves according to the new Hamiltonian, `H = -μ · B = -γB*S_y`, where `S_y` is the spin operator for the y-direction.\n3.  **Calculate the time evolution:** The state at a later time `t` is given by `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ)|ψ(0)>`. We will use Python with the SymPy library to carry out this matrix exponentiation.\n4.  **Find the expectation value:** We will calculate the average (or expectation) value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)>`.\n5.  **Identify the frequency:** The resulting expectation value will be an oscillating function of time, proportional to `cos(Ωt)`. The angular frequency `Ω` is the value we are looking for. We will extract this value and compare it to the given options.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve_spin_oscillation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the oscillation frequency of the z-component of a spin-1/2 particle's \n    magnetic moment using quantum mechanics and symbolic computation with SymPy.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the physical quantities and operators using SymPy.\n    # We can set hbar=1, as it will cancel out in the final frequency calculation,\n    # but we will keep it for rigor.\n    gamma, B, t, hbar = sp.symbols('gamma B t hbar', real=True, positive=True)\n    i = sp.I\n\n    # The spin operators in the S_z basis (where |+z> is [1,0]^T).\n    S_y = (hbar / 2) * sp.Matrix([[0, -i], [i, 0]])\n    S_z = (hbar / 2) * sp.Matrix([[1, 0], [0, -1]])\n\n    # Step 2: Define the initial state of the system, |+z>.\n    psi_initial = sp.Matrix([1, 0])\n\n    # Step 3: Define the Hamiltonian for t > 0, with the magnetic field along +Y.\n    H_y = -gamma * B * S_y\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the time evolution of the state vector using the evolution operator U(t) = exp(-i*H*t/hbar).\n    # We use the identity exp(i*a*PauliMatrix) = cos(a)*I + i*sin(a)*PauliMatrix\n    # The argument to the exponential is (-i*H_y*t/hbar) = (i*gamma*B*t/hbar)*S_y\n    # This simplifies to i*(gamma*B*t/2)*sigma_y.
