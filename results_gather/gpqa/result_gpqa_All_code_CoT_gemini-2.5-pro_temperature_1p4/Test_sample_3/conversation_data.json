    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this physics question using a step-by-step explanation within a Python script.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Introduce Maxwell's Equations:** The script will begin by briefly introducing the purpose of Maxwell's Equations in classical electromagnetism.\n2.  **State the Core Assumption:** It will highlight the standard assumption that magnetic monopoles (isolated North or South poles) do not exist.\n3.  **Introduce the Hypothetical Scenario:** The script will then consider the parallel universe where magnetic monopoles *do* exist.\n4.  **Analyze Each Equation's Fate:**\n    *   It will examine **Gauss's Law for Magnetism**, which in its standard form states that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero (∇⋅B = 0). The script will explain why the existence of a monopole directly contradicts and necessitates a change to this law.\n    *   It will examine **Faraday's Law of Induction**, which describes the circulation of the electric field (∇×E). It will explain that for a consistent, symmetric theory, a moving magnetic monopole (a \"magnetic current\") would have to create a circulating electric field, just as a moving electric charge creates a circulating magnetic field. This requires adding a new term to Faraday's Law.\n    *   It will briefly explain why the other two equations, dealing with electric charges and currents, are not affected.\n5.  **Conclude and Select the Answer:** Based on the analysis, the script will conclude which physical principles (and corresponding equations) are altered and print the correct choice from the provided options.\n\n```python\ndef solve_maxwell_monopole_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes how Maxwell's equations would change if magnetic monopoles existed\n    and determines the correct option among the choices.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the impact of magnetic monopoles on Maxwell's Equations:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Background on the standard model\n    print(\"In our universe, Maxwell's Equations are built on the observation that magnetic poles always come in pairs (a dipole).\")\n    print(\"An isolated magnetic charge, or 'monopole', has never been found.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Analyzing Equation 1: Gauss's Law for Magnetism ---\n    print(\"1.
