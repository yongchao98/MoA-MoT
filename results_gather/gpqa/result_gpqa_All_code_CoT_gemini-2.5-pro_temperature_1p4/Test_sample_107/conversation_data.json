    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Calculate the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy ($\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$)**: The paramagnetic coupling energy, also known as the Zeeman energy splitting, is given by the formula $E = m \\cdot \\mu_B \\cdot B$.\n    *   `m` is the orbital magnetic quantum number. The problem states it has \"small values\", so I will use `m=1` for the calculation, which is a representative small, non-zero integer.\n    *   `μ_B` is the Bohr magneton, a physical constant with a value of approximately $5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/T}$.\n    *   `B` is the magnetic field strength, given as 1 T.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Transition Energy ($\\Delta E$)**: The energy of a photon corresponding to a specific transition is related to its wavelength (`λ`) by the Planck-Einstein relation, $\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$.\n    *   `h` is the Planck constant.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   `λ` is the given wavelength, $0.4861 \\, \\mu m$.\n    *   I will calculate this energy and express it in electron-volts (eV) for a direct comparison with $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$. A convenient formula for this is $\\Delta E (\\text{eV}) = \\frac{1240}{\\lambda (\\text{nm})}$.\n\n3.  **Compare the Orders of Magnitude**: I will compare the numerical value of $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$ with that of $\\Delta E$ to determine which of the given relationships (A, B, C, or D) is correct.\n\n4.  **Construct the Python Code**: I will write a Python script that defines the necessary constants and given values, performs the calculations described above, prints the results of each calculation, and then determines and prints the final correct option.\n\n```python\nimport scipy.constants\n\ndef solve_magnetic_energy_comparison():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and compares the paramagnetic coupling energy with a specific\n    atomic transition energy.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Step 1: Define Constants and Given Values ---\n\n    # Bohr magneton in eV/T\n    mu_B_eV_per_T = scipy.constants.value('Bohr magneton in eV/T')\n\n    # Given magnetic field in Tesla\n    B = 1.0  # T\n\n    # Assume a small, non-zero integer for the magnetic quantum number m\n    m = 1\n\n    # Given wavelength in meters\n    lambda_m = 0.4861e-6  # meters\n\n    # The product of Planck's constant and the speed of light in eV*m\n    hc_eV_m = scipy.constants.h * scipy.constants.c / scipy.constants.e\n\n    # --- Step 2: Calculate Paramagnetic Coupling Energy <H> ---\n    # Formula: <H> = m * mu_B * B\n    H_coupling_eV = m * mu_B_eV_per_T * B\n\n    # --- Step 3: Calculate Transition Energy Delta E ---\n    # Formula: Delta_E = h * c / lambda\n    delta_E_eV = hc_eV_m / lambda_m\n\n    # --- Step 4: Compare and Print Results ---\n    print(\"This script compares the order of magnitude of two energy terms.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    \n    print(f\"1.
