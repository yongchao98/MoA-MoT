    "My plan is to solve this problem by following these steps:\n1.  **Calculate the moles of each salt.** The moles are calculated by dividing the mass of the substance by its molar mass. KH2PO4 provides the dihydrogen phosphate ion (H2PO4-), and Na2HPO4●2H2O provides the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO4^2-).\n2.  **Calculate the initial molar concentrations of H2PO4- and HPO4^2-.** The concentration is calculated by dividing the moles of each ion by the total volume of the solution in liters (200.00 cm3 = 0.200 L).\n3.  **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] in the buffer solution.** The solution is a buffer formed by the conjugate acid-base pair H2PO4- / HPO4^2-. The equilibrium governing this buffer is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid: H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2-, described by Ka2. I will use the Ka2 expression, Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4-], to find [H+].\n4.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion [PO4^3-] concentration.** The orthophosphate ion is formed from the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion: HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3-. This equilibrium is described by Ka3. I will use the Ka3 expression, Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-], and the previously calculated [H+] and [HPO4^2-] to solve for [PO4^3-]. The change in [HPO4^2-] due to this third dissociation is negligible because Ka3 is very small, so I will use its initial concentration in this final calculation.\n5.  **Compare the final calculated concentration with the given options to find the correct answer.**\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1 & 2: Define given values and calculate initial moles and concentrations\nvolume_L = 200.00 / 1000  # Convert cm3 to L\n\n# For KH2PO4 -> K+ + H2PO4-\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmoles_KH2PO4 = mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4\nconc_H2PO4_minus = moles_KH2PO4 / volume_L\n\n# For Na2HPO4.2H2O -> 2Na+ + HPO4^2- + 2H2O\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # g\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99  # g/mol\nmoles_Na2HPO4_2H2O = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\nconc_HPO4_2minus = moles_Na2HPO4_2H2O / volume_L\n\n# Dissociation constants for H3PO4\nKa2 = 6.2 * 10**-8\nKa3 = 1.8 * 10**-12\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+]\n# The relevant equilibrium is H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4^2-\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\nconc_H_plus = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4_minus / conc_HPO4_2minus)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-]\n# The relevant equilibrium is HPO4^2- <=> H+ + PO4^3-\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\n# We can use the initial concentration of HPO4^2- as it changes negligibly.\nconc_PO4_3minus = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4_2minus / conc_H_plus)\n\n# Step 5: Print the results and compare with options\nprint(f\"Initial concentration of H2PO4- = {conc_H2PO4_minus:.4f} M\")\nprint(f\"Initial concentration of HPO4^2- = {conc_HPO4_2minus:.4f} M\")\nprint(f\"Hydrogen ion concentration [H+] = {conc_H_plus:.2e} M\")\nprint(f\"Orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-] = {conc_PO4_3minus:.2e} M\")\n\n# Options\nA = 3.97e-7\nB = 2.81e-7\nC = 6.24e-7\nD = 5.48e-7\n\nprint(\"\\nComparing the result with the given options:\")\nprint(f\"A) 3.97x10^-7 M\")\nprint(f\"B) 2.81x10^-7 M\")\nprint(f\"C) 6.24x10^-7 M\")\nprint(f\"D) 5.48x10^-7 M\")\n\n# Determine the closest option\noptions = {'A': A, 'B': B, 'C': C, 'D': D}\nclosest_option = min(options.keys(), key=lambda k: abs(options[k] - conc_PO4_3minus))\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated value {conc_PO4_3minus:.2e} M is closest to option {closest_option}.\")\n\nfinal_answer = closest_option\n# The format below is for the final answer submission\n# <<<final_answer>>>\n<<<A>>>\n```"
