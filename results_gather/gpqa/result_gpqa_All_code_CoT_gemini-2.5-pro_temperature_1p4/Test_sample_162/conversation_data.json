    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is my plan to solve this chemistry problem:\n\n1.  **Stoichiometric Calculation**: First, I will calculate the number of moles of iron(III) hydroxide (`Fe(OH)3`) from its given mass (0.1 g). To do this, I'll need its molar mass. The chemical reaction for dissolution in acid is `Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ -> Fe^3+ + 3H2O`. This stoichiometry tells us that 3 moles of hydrogen ions (`H+`) from the strong acid are required to react with every 1 mole of `Fe(OH)3`. This gives the base amount of acid needed.\n\n2.  **Excess Acid for pH**: To keep the `Fe^3+` ions dissolved and prevent `Fe(OH)3` from precipitating again, the final solution must be acidic. This means there must be some excess `H+` ions remaining after the initial reaction. The concentration of these excess ions determines the final pH of the solution (`pH = -log10[H+]`).\n\n3.  **Total Acid Calculation**: The total amount of acid needed is the sum of the acid used for the reaction (step 1) and the excess acid required to maintain the final pH (step 2).\n\n4.  **Verification of Options**: The problem gives four possible answers, each with a pH value and a corresponding volume of acid. I will test each option. For each given pH, I will calculate the total volume of acid that would be required to achieve it. The correct option will be the one where my calculated volume matches the volume given in the option.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculations and find the correct option.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given Information ---\nmass_feoh3 = 0.1  # grams\ntotal_volume_L = 100 / 1000  # 100 cm³ = 0.1 L\nacid_concentration_M = 0.1  # Moles/L\n\n# --- Constants ---\nmolar_mass_Fe = 55.845  # g/mol\nmolar_mass_O = 15.999  # g/mol\nmolar_mass_H = 1.008   # g/mol\n\n# --- Options from the problem ---\noptions = {\n    'A': {'pH': 4.94, 'vol_cm3': 20.40},\n    'B': {'pH': 2.69, 'vol_cm3': 30.09},\n    'C': {'pH': 3.16, 'vol_cm3': 32.14},\n    'D': {'pH': 2.04, 'vol_cm3': 28.05},\n}\n\n# 1. Calculate moles of Fe(OH)3\nmolar_mass_feoh3 = molar_mass_Fe + 3 * (molar_mass_O + molar_mass_H)\nmoles_feoh3 = mass_feoh3 / molar_mass_feoh3\n\n# 2. Calculate moles of H+ needed for the reaction\n# Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ -> Fe^3+ + 3H2O\n# The mole ratio is 1:3\nmoles_h_reacted = 3 * moles_feoh3\n\nprint(\"Step 1: Moles of Fe(OH)3 to dissolve = {:.5f} mol\".format(moles_feoh3))\nprint(\"Step 2: Moles of H+ for stoichiometric reaction = {:.5f} mol\".format(moles_h_reacted))\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(\"Verifying the options:\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\ncorrect_option = None\n\n# 3. & 4.
