    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Metric and Area Element**: The area of a surface described by a metric $ds^2 = g_{xx}dx^2 + 2g_{xy}dxdy + g_{yy}dy^2$ is calculated by integrating the area element $dA = \\sqrt{\\det(g)} \\, dx \\, dy$, where $g$ is the metric tensor matrix $g = \\begin{pmatrix} g_{xx} & g_{xy} \\\\ g_{yx} & g_{yy} \\end{pmatrix}$.\n2.  **Determine the Metric Tensor**: From the given metric $ds^{2}=\\frac{32}{\\left(4-x^{2}-y^{2}\\right)}\\left(dx^{2}+dy^{2}\\right)$, we can identify the components of the metric tensor:\n    $g_{xx} = \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}$\n    $g_{yy} = \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}$\n    $g_{xy} = g_{yx} = 0$\n3.  **Calculate the Area Element**: The determinant of the metric tensor is $\\det(g) = g_{xx}g_{yy} - g_{xy}^2 = \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}\\right)^2$.\n    The square root is $\\sqrt{\\det(g)} = \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2}$ (since the denominator must be positive for the metric to be well-defined).\n    Thus, the area element is $dA = \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2} \\, dx \\, dy$.\n4.  **Set Up the Area Integral**: The problem asks for the area of the pseudosphere of radius $r=2$. The form of the metric's denominator, $4-x^2-y^2$, indicates that the domain of definition is the open disk $D$ where $x^2+y^2 < 4 = 2^2$. The area is the integral of $dA$ over this disk:\n    $Area = \\iint_{D} \\frac{32}{4-x^2-y^2} \\, dx \\, dy$\n5.  **Convert to Polar Coordinates**: To solve the integral, we switch to polar coordinates $(\\rho, \\theta)$, where $x = \\rho\\cos\\theta$, $y = \\rho\\sin\\theta$. This gives $x^2+y^2 = \\rho^2$ and the area differential $dx\\,dy = \\rho\\,d\\rho\\,d\\theta$. The domain $x^2+y^2 < 4$ becomes $0 \\le \\rho < 2$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2\\pi$. The integral transforms to:\n    $Area = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32}{4-\\rho^2} \\rho \\, d\\rho \\, d\\theta$\n6.  **Evaluate the Integral**: This is an improper integral because the integrand $\\frac{32\\rho}{4-\\rho^2}$ goes to infinity as $\\rho \\to 2$. We can evaluate it:\n    $Area = 2\\pi \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32\\rho}{4-\\rho^2} \\, d\\rho$\n    Using the substitution $u = 4-\\rho^2$, we get $du = -2\\rho\\,d\\rho$. The limits change from $\\rho=0 \\to u=4$ and $\\rho=2 \\to u=0$.\n    $Area = 2\\pi \\int_{4}^{0} \\frac{32}{u} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} du\\right) = 32\\pi \\int_{0}^{4} \\frac{1}{u} \\, du$\n    The integral $\\int_{0}^{4} \\frac{1}{u} \\, du = [\\ln|u|]_0^4 = \\ln(4) - \\lim_{a\\to 0^+}\\ln(a)$, which diverges to $+\\infty$.\n    Therefore, the area is infinite.\n\nWe can use Python with the `sympy` library to confirm this result.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Define the symbols for polar coordinates\nrho = sympy.Symbol('rho', real=True, positive=True)\ntheta = sympy.Symbol('theta')\n\n# The term for the area element in polar coordinates is sqrt(det(g)) * rho\n# sqrt(det(g)) = 32 / (4 - rho**2)\n# dA = (32 / (4 - rho**2)) * rho * d(rho) * d(theta)\nintegrand_rho = (32 / (4 - rho**2)) * rho\n\n# We will calculate the definite integral for the area.\n# First, integrate with respect to rho from 0 to 2.\n# This is an improper integral, and sympy can handle it.\nintegral_over_rho = sympy.integrate(integrand_rho, (rho, 0, 2))\n\n# Now, integrate the result with respect to theta from 0 to 2*pi.\n# The previous result is a constant (infinity), so we multiply by the interval length 2*pi.\n# Note: sympy.integrate(oo, (theta, 0, 2*pi)) would also result in infinity.\narea = integral_over_rho * sympy.integrate(1, (theta, 0, 2 * sympy.pi))\n\n# Print the result. Sympy represents infinity as 'oo'.\nprint(\"The calculated area is:\")\nprint(area)\nprint(\"\\nThis corresponds to infinity.\")\nprint(\"The correct option is B.\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>"
