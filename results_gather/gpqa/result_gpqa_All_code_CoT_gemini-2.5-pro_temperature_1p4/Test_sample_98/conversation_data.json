  "question": "You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR and 1H NMR.

    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** The goal is to identify a specific chemical compound from four choices using given spectroscopic data (FTIR and 1H NMR).\n\n2.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   **\"very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers (cm⁻¹)\"**: This is a classic signature for an O-H stretch in a hydrogen-bonded environment, specifically a carboxylic acid (R-COOH). The O-H stretch of an alcohol is also in this region but the O-H of a carboxylic acid is typically much broader.\n    *   **\"strong absorption peak is also observed at 1700 wavenumbers (cm⁻¹)\"**: This is the characteristic region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. For a carboxylic acid, this peak typically appears around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR**: The presence of both a very broad O-H and a strong C=O peak strongly indicates the compound is a carboxylic acid. I'll check the options: A, B, C, and D all contain a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). So, the FTIR data confirms the class of compound but doesn't distinguish between the choices. The deciding factor must be the 1H NMR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **\"none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens\"**: This tells us there are no hydrogens attached to C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated alkanoic acids, so this information is consistent with all choices and doesn't help differentiate.\n    *   **The Key Information: Splitting Patterns**. The problem states there are two specific, complex signals:\n        1.  **A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n        2.  **A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    *   **Understand Splitting (n+1 rule)**: A signal for a proton (or a group of equivalent protons) is split into (n+1) lines by 'n' equivalent neighboring protons.\n        *   Doublet (d): 1 neighbor (n=1)\n        *   Triplet (t): 2 neighbors (n=2)\n        *   Quartet (q): 3 neighbors (n=3)\n    *   **Deconstruct the Complex Patterns**: For a signal to be a \"multiplet of multiplets,\" the proton must be coupled to multiple *non-equivalent* groups of protons.\n        *   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**: A proton must have three sets of non-equivalent neighbors: one single proton (gives doublet), one group of 2 protons (gives triplet), and one group of 3 protons (gives quartet).\n        *   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**: A proton must have three sets of non-equivalent neighbors: one single proton (gives doublet), one group of 2 protons (gives triplet), and *another, different* group of 2 protons (gives the second triplet).\n\n4.  **Evaluate Each Candidate Molecule:** I will now systematically examine the structure of each option to see if any of its protons would produce these specific splitting patterns. I will focus on the methine (C-H) protons, as they are bonded to the most other carbons and are most likely to have complex splitting.\n\n    *   **A) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH**\n        *   Let's label the key protons: `CH3CH2-CH(c)(CH3)-CH(f)(CH3)-COOH`\n        *   Look at proton `H(c)`: It's bonded to `CH2` (2 neighbors -> t), `CH(f)` (1 neighbor -> d), and `CH3` (3 neighbors -> q). This gives a **dtq**. This matches one of the signals!\n        *   Look at proton `H(f)`: It's bonded to `CH(c)` (1 neighbor -> d) and `CH3` (3 neighbors -> q). This gives a doublet of quartets (dq). This is not a dtt.\n        *   *Conclusion for A*: Has a `dtq`, but not a `dtt`. So, it's incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH**\n        *   Let's label the key protons: `CH3-CH(c)(CH3)-CH(e)(CH3)-CH2-COOH`\n        *   Look at proton `H(e)`: It's bonded to `CH(c)` (1 neighbor -> d), `CH2` (2 neighbors -> t), and `CH3` (3 neighbors -> q). This gives a **dtq**. This also matches one of the signals.\n        *   Look at proton `H(c)`: It's bonded to `CH(e)` (1 neighbor -> d) and two different `CH3` groups (each 3 neighbors -> q). This gives a doublet of quartets of quartets (dqq). Not a dtt.\n        *   *Conclusion for B*: Has a `dtq`, but not a `dtt`. So, it's incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH** (Note: C2H5 is -CH2CH3)\n        *   Structure: `CH3CH2-CH(c)(CH2CH3)-CH(d)(CH2CH3)-COOH`\n        *   Look at proton `H(c)`: It's bonded to `CH(d)` (1 neighbor -> d), the `CH2` of the attached ethyl group (2 neighbors -> t), and the `CH2` of the main chain (2 neighbors -> t). This gives a **dtt**. This matches the other signal!\n        *   Look at proton `H(d)`: It's bonded to `CH(c)` (1 neighbor -> d) and the `CH2` of its attached ethyl group (2 neighbors -> t). This gives a doublet of triplets (dt). This is not a dtq.\n        *   *Conclusion for C*: Has a `dtt`, but not a `dtq`. So, it's incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH**\n        *   Structure: `CH3-CH(b)(CH2CH3)-CH(d)(CH2CH3)-CH2-COOH`\n        *   Look at proton `H(b)`: It's bonded to `CH(d)` (1 neighbor -> d), the attached `CH3` group (3 neighbors -> q), and the `CH2` of the attached ethyl group (2 neighbors -> t). This gives a **dtq**. This matches the first signal!\n        *   Look at proton `H(d)`: It's bonded to `CH(b)` (1 neighbor -> d), the `CH2` of the attached ethyl group (2 neighbors -> t), and the `CH2` of the main chain next to the COOH (2 neighbors -> t). This gives a **dtt**. This matches the second signal!\n        *   *Conclusion for D*: This molecule has a proton that produces a `dtq` signal AND a different proton that produces a `dtt` signal. This perfectly matches all the 1H NMR data.\n\n5.  **Final Synthesis and Code Generation:**\n    *   The FTIR data identified a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The 1H NMR data provided two unique splitting patterns (`dtq` and `dtt`).\n    *   By analyzing each structure, only structure D contains protons that would result in both of these specific splitting patterns.\n    *   The Python code will present this logic clearly and print the final choice.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef identify_compound():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies a compound based on FTIR and 1H NMR data by analyzing splitting patterns.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Options provided to the user\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH\",\n        \"B\": \"CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH\",\n        \"C\": \"CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH\",\n        \"D\": \"CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH\"\n    }\n\n    # Explanation of the reasoning process\n    analysis_steps = [\n        \"1.
