    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct molecular phenotype.\n\n**1. Understand the Wild-Type (WT) Protein:**\n*   It's a transcription factor subunit.\n*   Its function requires several steps:\n    1.  Activation via phosphorylation.\n    2.  Dimerization (pairing with another subunit).\n    3.  Nuclear entry.\n    4.  Activating gene transcription.\n*   All these steps must work correctly for the protein to be functional.\n\n**2. Understand Mutation X (for context):**\n*   It's a recessive, loss-of-function mutation in the transactivation domain.\n*   \"Recessive\" means that in a heterozygote (WT/X), the protein from the single WT allele is sufficient for a normal phenotype. The mutant X protein is non-functional but doesn't interfere with the WT protein.\n\n**3. Analyze Mutation Y (the focus of the question):**\n*   It's a dominant-negative mutation in the dimerization domain.\n*   **\"Dominant\"** means it causes a mutant phenotype even when a wild-type allele is present (in a heterozygote).\n*   **\"Negative\"** implies a loss of function.\n*   **\"Dominant-Negative\"** is a specific mechanism where the mutant protein product interferes with or \"poisons\" the function of the wild-type protein product.\n*   Since the mutation is in the **dimerization domain**, the interference most likely happens at the dimerization step. The mutant Y protein can still bind to a wild-type protein, forming a WT-Y heterodimer. However, this hybrid dimer is non-functional and cannot activate transcription.\n\n**4. Evaluate the consequences in a heterozygote (WT/Y):**\n*   The cell produces both WT and Y protein subunits.\n*   Three types of dimers can form:\n    1.  **WT-WT:** Functional.\n    2.  **Y-Y:** Non-functional.\n    3.  **WT-Y:** Non-functional (this is the key to the dominant-negative effect).\n*   By forming non-functional WT-Y dimers, the Y protein effectively removes WT proteins from the pool of functional units. This leads to an overall loss-of-function phenotype for the cell. The non-functional complexes (WT-Y and Y-Y) might also be recognized by cellular machinery and targeted for degradation.\n\n**5. Assess the Options:**\n\n*   **A) loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype:** Incorrect. The mutation causes a *dominant* (non-wild-type) phenotype. Also, dimerization likely still occurs, but it forms non-functional pairs.\n*   **B) protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype:** While the loss-of-function part is correct, aggregation is not the primary mechanism of a classic dominant-negative mutation. The key is interference, not just clumping.\n*   **C) protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele:** This is the most likely scenario. The mutant Y protein interferes with the WT protein, rendering the WT-Y complex non-functional. This results in a functional \"loss-of-function of the wild-type allele's product\". The cell may then degrade these faulty protein complexes. This option correctly captures the interference mechanism and its consequences.\n*   **D) change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype:** Incorrect. It is a dominant-*negative* mutation, which results in a loss-of-function, not a gain-of-function.\n\nBased on this reasoning, option C provides the best description of the molecular events.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef solve_biology_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the molecular biology problem and determines the most likely phenotype.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the problem and options\n    question = \"In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade.
