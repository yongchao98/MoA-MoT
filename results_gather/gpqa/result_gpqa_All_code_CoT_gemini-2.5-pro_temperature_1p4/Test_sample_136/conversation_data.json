    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of revolutions a proton makes to reach its final kinetic energy. Here is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Total Energy Gain:** The proton starts with negligible kinetic energy and reaches a final kinetic energy of T_final = 950 MeV. So, the total energy gained is 950 MeV.\n2.  **Energy Gain per Revolution:** In a synchrocyclotron, the particle is accelerated twice per revolution as it crosses the gap between the two \"Dee\" electrodes. The energy gained during each crossing depends on the instantaneous voltage at that moment. The voltage is given by `U(t) = U_0 * cos(phase)`. The phase at which the synchronous particle crosses the gap is called the synchronous phase, `Φ_s`. The problem provides an initial phase `Φ_0 = π/4`, which we will assume is this synchronous phase.\n3.  The energy gain for a single crossing is `ΔE_crossing = q * U_0 * cos(Φ_s)`, where `q` is the charge of the particle (for a proton, q = e, the elementary charge).\n4.  Since there are two accelerations per revolution, the total energy gain per revolution is `ΔE_rev = 2 * q * U_0 * cos(Φ_s)`.\n5.  **Number of Revolutions:** The total number of revolutions, `N`, is the total energy gained divided by the energy gained per revolution: `N = T_final / ΔE_rev`.\n6.  **Calculation:** We will use consistent units. It is convenient to express energy in electron-volts (eV). The final kinetic energy `T_final = 950 MeV = 950 * 10^6 eV`. The peak voltage `U_0 = 190 kV = 190 * 10^3 V`. The energy gain from this voltage for a particle with charge `e` is `e * U_0 = 190 * 10^3 eV`.\n\nThe formula becomes:\n`N = (950 * 10^6 eV) / (2 * (190 * 10^3 eV) * cos(π/4))`\n\nNow, let's implement this calculation in Python.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given Data ---\n# Final kinetic energy in MeV\nT_final_MeV = 950\n# Peak voltage in kV\nU0_kV = 190\n# Synchronous phase in radians\nphi0_rad = math.pi / 4\n\n# --- Conversion to base units (eV and V) ---\n# The charge of a proton is 'e'.
