    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Analysis Plan:**\n\n1.  **Define Optical Isomerism:** A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators of chirality are the presence of a chiral center (an atom bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality (due to restricted rotation, often seen in substituted biphenyls).\n2.  **Examine Compound 1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate):** This is a biphenyl compound. Biphenyls can be chiral if there are bulky groups at the ortho-positions (2, 2', 6, 6') that restrict rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. In this molecule, the nitro groups (-NO2) and the ester groups (-COOCH3) at all four ortho positions are bulky enough to prevent free rotation. This lack of rotation forces the rings into different planes, and the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism (this specific type is called atropisomerism).\n3.  **Examine Compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate):** The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Let's analyze the carbon at position 2. It is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom bonded to four different substituents is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are always chiral. Thus, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n4.  **Examine Compound 3 (benzophenone):** The structure is a central carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings (C6H5). The molecule has a plane of symmetry that contains the C=O group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Since the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it is achiral and cannot be optically active.\n5.  **Examine Compound 4 (dimethyl fumarate):** This is the trans-isomer of dimethyl butenedioate. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry. Any molecule that is planar or has a center of symmetry is achiral. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n6.  **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and exhibit optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral. Therefore, the correct option includes only 1 and 2.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_optical_isomerism():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes four organic compounds to determine if they exhibit optical isomerism.\n    Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Analyzing each compound for optical isomerism:\")\n\n    # Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\n    # This is a substituted biphenyl.
