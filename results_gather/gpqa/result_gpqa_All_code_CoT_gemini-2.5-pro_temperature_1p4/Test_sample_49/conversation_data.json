    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\nFirst, I will analyze the provided expression to identify the key term that relates to the number of loops in a Feynman diagram. In quantum field theory, calculations for loop diagrams in `D` spacetime dimensions typically result in a factor of `1/(4*pi)^(D/2)` for each loop. Since the problem specifies a four-dimensional spacetime, `D=4`, which means each loop contributes a factor of `1/(4*pi)^(4/2)` or `1/(4*pi)^2`.\n\nNext, I will examine the power of the `1/(4*pi)` term in the colleague's note. The expression given is `alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`. The relevant term is `1/(4pi)^6`.\n\nFinally, by dividing the total power of the `1/(4pi)` term (which is 6) by the power contributed by a single loop (which is 2), I can calculate the total number of loops in the diagram. I will then present this calculation and the final answer.\n\n```python\n# The overall power of the (1/(4pi)) term found in the expression.\ntotal_power_of_4pi = 6\n\n# In four-dimensional spacetime (D=4), each loop in a Feynman diagram\n# calculation typically contributes a factor of 1/(4*pi)^(D/2) after integration.\n# So, the power contributed per loop is D/2.\npower_per_loop = 4 / 2\n\n# To find the total number of loops, we divide the total power\n# of the (1/(4pi)) term by the power contributed by each loop.\nnumber_of_loops = total_power_of_4pi / power_per_loop\n\nprint(\"To determine the number of loops, we can analyze the 'loop factor' in the expression.\")\nprint(\"In a 4-dimensional spacetime, each loop contributes a factor of 1/(4*pi)^2.\")\nprint(f\"The expression contains a factor of 1/(4*pi)^{total_power_of_4pi}.\")\nprint(f\"The power from a single loop is {int(power_per_loop)}.\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, the number of loops is the total power divided by the power per loop:\")\nprint(f\"Number of Loops = {total_power_of_4pi} / {int(power_per_loop)} = {int(number_of_loops)}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nThe diagram contained 3 loops.
