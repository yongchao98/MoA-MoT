    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the System and States:** The system consists of two electrons in p orbitals, so their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are `l1 = 1` and `l2 = 1`. The system is in a specific coupled state given by `|l, m> = |2, -1>`, where `l=2` is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number and `m=-1` is the total magnetic quantum number (the z-component).\n\n2.  **Identify the Measurement:** A measurement of the individual z-components of angular momentum, `L_1z` and `L_2z`, is performed. The eigenvalues of these operators are `m1 * ħ` and `m2 * ħ`, respectively. We want to find the joint probability of getting the specific eigenvalues `-ħ` for `L_1z` and `-ħ` for `L_2z`.\n\n3.  **Relate Measurement to Quantum Numbers:**\n    *   An eigenvalue of `-ħ` for `L_1z` corresponds to the magnetic quantum number `m1 = -1`.\n    *   An eigenvalue of `-ħ` for `L_2z` corresponds to the magnetic quantum number `m2 = -1`.\n    *   Therefore, the problem asks for the probability of finding the system in the uncoupled state described by `|m1, m2> = |-1, -1>`.\n\n4.  **Apply the Conservation Rule:** The relationship between the coupled basis `|l, m>` and the uncoupled basis `|m1, m2>` is governed by Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. A fundamental selection rule for these coefficients is that they are non-zero only if the total magnetic quantum number is conserved, meaning `m = m1 + m2`.\n\n5.  **Check the Condition:**\n    *   From the initial state `|2, -1>`, we have `m = -1`.\n    *   From the target measurement outcome, we have `m1 = -1` and `m2 = -1`.\n    *   The sum is `m1 + m2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Probability:** Since `m` (-1) is not equal to `m1 + m2` (-2), the condition is not met. This means the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient that connects these two states is zero. The probability, which is the square of this coefficient, is therefore also zero.\n\nThe Python code below will formalize this check.\n\n```python\n# Define the quantum numbers of the initial coupled state |l, m>\n# l1 and l2 are 1 for p orbitals. l and m are given as 2 and -1.\nl1 = 1\nl2 = 1\nl = 2\nm = -1\n\n# Define the quantum numbers of the target measured state |m1, m2>\n# The eigenvalue of Lz is m*hbar. So, an eigenvalue of -hbar corresponds to m=-1.\nm1 = -1  # for an eigenvalue of -hbar for L_1z\nm2 = -1  # for an eigenvalue of -hbar for L_2z\n\n# A fundamental rule (conservation of the z-component of angular momentum)\n# for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is that they are zero unless m = m1 + m2.\n# The probability of measuring the state |m1, m2> is the square of the\n# corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n\n# Check if the conservation rule is satisfied\nif m == m1 + m2:\n    # If the rule is satisfied, we would need to calculate the specific\n    # Clebsch-Gordan coefficient <l1, m1; l2, m2 | l, m>.\n    # However, for this problem, the rule is not satisfied.\n    # The code for a full C-G calculation is complex and not needed here.\n    # Let's assume a non-zero probability for a placeholder.\n    probability = \"Non-zero, but requires C-G coefficient calculation.\"\nelse:\n    # If m is not equal to m1 + m2, the coefficient is zero, and the probability is zero.\n    probability = 0\n\n# Print the result and the choices\nprint(f\"The initial state has total magnetic quantum number m = {m}.\")\nprint(f\"The target measurement corresponds to m1 = {m1} and m2 = {m2}.\")\nprint(f\"The sum m1 + m2 = {m1 + m2}.\")\nprint(f\"Since m is not equal to m1 + m2 ({m} != {m1 + m2}), the probability of this measurement is 0.\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal Probability:\", probability)\n\n# Display the multiple-choice options\nprint(\"\\nChoices:\")\nprint(\"A) 1/2\")\nprint(\"B) 2/3\")\nprint(\"C) 0\")\nprint(\"D) 1\")\n```\n<<<C>>>"
