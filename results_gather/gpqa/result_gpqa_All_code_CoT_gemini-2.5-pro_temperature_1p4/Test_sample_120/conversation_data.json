    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactants**\n*   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is an epoxide fused to a substituted cyclohexane ring. The epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6. C1 is also substituted with a methyl group.\n*   **Reagent:** Me2CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent). This reagent acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion ('Me⁻').\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Regioselectivity of the Attack**\n*   The reaction is a nucleophilic opening of an epoxide. Organocuprates are soft nucleophiles and undergo SN2-type reactions.\n*   The key rule for this reaction is that the nucleophile attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n*   In the given epoxide, the two carbons of the ring are C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to C2, C6, Oxygen, and a methyl group).\n    *   C6 is a secondary carbon (bonded to C1, C5, Oxygen, and a hydrogen).\n*   Therefore, the methyl nucleophile from Me2CuLi will attack the less hindered carbon, which is **C6**. The C6-O bond will break, and the C1-O bond will cleave to form an alcohol at C1 after acidic workup.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Stereoselectivity of the Attack**\n*   The attack follows an **SN2 mechanism**, which means it proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon atom being attacked.\n*   The attack of the methyl group occurs at C6 from the side opposite the epoxide's oxygen atom.\n*   The initial configuration at C6 is given as **S**. Due to the SN2 inversion, the configuration at this carbon in the product will become **R**.\n*   The chiral centers at C3 and C4 are not involved in the reaction, so their configurations remain unchanged (**3R** and **4R**).\n*   The C1-O bond breaks, but no bonds attached directly to the C1 chiral center are broken. Thus, the configuration at C1 is retained as **R**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Structure and IUPAC Name of the Product**\n*   The reaction opens the epoxide ring, resulting in a cyclohexanol derivative.\n*   The substituents on the product ring are:\n    *   An -OH group and a -Me group at the original C1.\n    *   A new -Me group (from the cuprate) at the original C6.\n    *   The original -Me groups at C3 and C4.\n*   To name the product according to IUPAC rules, we must re-number the ring. The carbon with the -OH group is assigned as C1. To give the other methyl substituents the lowest possible locants, we number the ring clockwise.\n    *   New C1 = Old C1 (has -OH and -Me)\n    *   New C2 = Old C6 (has the new -Me)\n    *   New C3 = Old C5\n    *   New C4 = Old C4 (has -Me)\n    *   New C5 = Old C3 (has -Me)\n    *   New C6 = Old C2\n*   The methyl groups are at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. The product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**Step 5: Assign the Absolute Configurations to the Product**\n*   We map the configurations from our analysis onto the new numbering system:\n    *   **New C1** (from Old C1): Configuration is retained as **R**.\n    *   **New C2** (from Old C6): Configuration is inverted from S to **R**.\n    *   **New C4** (from Old C4): Configuration is retained as **R**.\n    *   **New C5** (from Old C3): Configuration is retained as **R**.\n*   The final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This corresponds to option B.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the stereochemical outcome of the reaction between\n    (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane and Me2CuLi.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
