    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Provided Information:** I will break down the information from the problem statement into key structural fragments and constraints.\n    *   **Core Structure:** \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" implies a benzene ring with two groups attached, which has a C6H4 core.\n    *   **Functional Group 1 (FTIR):** An ester group (-COO-) is present.\n    *   **Constraint 1 (NMR):** \"There are no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups.\" This is a crucial piece of information.\n    *   **Constraint 2 (NMR):** There are \"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups.\"\n    *   **Constraint 3 (NMR):** There are \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H.\" This means a -CH=CH- group exists.\n    *   **Constraint 4 (NMR splitting):** The vinyl protons show specific splitting: one is a doublet (d), and the other is a doublet of quartets (dq).\n\n2.  **Deduce the Substituents:** I will use the NMR constraints to determine the exact structure of the two substituents on the benzene ring.\n    *   The presence of an ester group (-COO-) combined with the \"no -CH2-\" rule strongly suggests a **methyl ester (-COOCH3)**. An ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) or any larger alkyl ester would contain -CH2- groups. This methyl ester fragment accounts for one of the two -CH3 signals.\n    *   Now for the second substituent. We have two vinyl protons (-CH=CH-) and the second -CH3 group. The splitting pattern is the key. A proton that is a \"doublet of quartets\" must be coupled to one adjacent proton (giving the doublet) and a group of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet). This perfectly describes the proton 'a' in the structure **-CHa=CHb-CH3**. Proton 'a' is split by proton 'b' (doublet) and the -CH3 group (quartet). Proton 'b' is split only by proton 'a', making it a simple doublet. This confirms the second substituent is a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3)**.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Molecule and Determine the Formula:** I will combine the core and the two substituents to find the complete molecular formula.\n    *   Core: C6H4\n    *   Substituent 1 (Methyl ester): -COOCH3, which adds C2H3O2\n    *   Substituent 2 (Propenyl group): -CH=CH-CH3, which adds C3H5\n    *   Total Carbons: 6 (ring) + 2 (ester) + 3 (propenyl) = 11\n    *   Total Hydrogens: 4 (ring) + 3 (ester) + 5 (propenyl) = 12\n    *   Total Oxygens: 2 (ester)\n    *   The resulting formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Match with Options and Final Verification:** I will compare the derived formula with the given choices.\n    *   A) C12H12O2\n    *   B) C11H12O2\n    *   C) C11H14O2\n    *   D) C12H14O2\n    *   The derived formula C11H12O2 matches option B perfectly. The logic is self-consistent and uses all pieces of the provided spectroscopic data.\n\nI will now generate the Python code to execute this logic and output the final answer.\n\n```python\n# Plan: Deduce the chemical formula by piecing together structural fragments\n# identified from the spectroscopic data.\n\n# 1. Start with the core structure.\n# A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring corresponds to a C6H4 fragment.\ncore_carbons = 6\ncore_hydrogens = 4\n\n# 2.

The NMR shows no -CH2- signals.\n# This combination indicates a methyl ester group (-COOCH3), as any larger\n# alkyl ester (like ethyl ester, -COOCH2CH3) would have a CH2 signal.\n# This substituent adds C2H3O2 and accounts for one of the two CH3 signals.\nsubstituent1_carbons = 2\nsubstituent1_hydrogens = 3\nsubstituent1_oxygens = 2\n\n# 3. Identify the second substituent.\n# The NMR shows two vinyl protons and a second -CH3 group.\n# The splitting pattern is key: one vinyl-H is a doublet, and the other is a\n# doublet of quartets.\n# A doublet of quartets means a proton is split by one other proton (doublet)\n# and a group of three protons (quartet). This perfectly describes the arrangement\n# in a propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH3.\n# This fragment adds C3H5 and accounts for the second CH3 signal.\nsubstituent2_carbons = 3\nsubstituent2_hydrogens = 5\nsubstituent2_oxygens = 0\n\n# 4.
