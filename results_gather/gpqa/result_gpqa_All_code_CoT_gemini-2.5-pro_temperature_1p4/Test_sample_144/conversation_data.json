    "To determine the number of stereoisomers for the compound `6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol`, we need to find the total number of stereogenic centers in the molecule. The total number of stereoisomers is then calculated using the formula 2^n, where 'n' is the number of stereogenic centers.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Draw the structure:** First, we'll interpret the IUPAC name to determine the chemical structure of the molecule.\n    *   `undeca`: An 11-carbon main chain.\n    *   `2-methyl`: A methyl group (CH₃) on carbon 2.\n    *   `3,7-dien`: Double bonds between carbons 3-4 and 7-8.\n    *   `5-ol`: A hydroxyl group (OH) on carbon 5.\n    *   `6-chloro`: A chlorine atom (Cl) on carbon 6.\n    *   `9-ethyl`: An ethyl group (CH₂CH₃) on carbon 9.\n    The resulting structure is:\n    `CH₃-CH(CH₃)-CH=CH-CH(OH)-CH(Cl)-CH=CH-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃`\n\n2.  **Identify chiral centers:** We will look for carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. These are the chiral centers.\n    *   **C5, C6, and C9** are each bonded to a hydrogen and three other unique, different groups, making them chiral centers.\n    *   **C2** is bonded to a hydrogen, the rest of the chain at C3, and two methyl groups (C1 and the 2-methyl substituent). Since two of the groups are identical (methyl), **C2 is not a chiral center**.\n    *   This gives us a total of **3 chiral centers**.\n\n3.  **Identify geometric isomers (E/Z):** We will check the double bonds to see if they can have E/Z (cis/trans) isomerism. This occurs when each carbon of the double bond is attached to two different groups.\n    *   **C3=C4 double bond:** C3 is bonded to a hydrogen and an isopropyl group. C4 is bonded to a hydrogen and the rest of the chain. E/Z isomerism is possible.\n    *   **C7=C8 double bond:** C7 is bonded to a hydrogen and the rest of the chain towards C6. C8 is bonded to a hydrogen and the rest of the chain towards C9. E/Z isomerism is possible.\n    *   This gives us **2 double bonds** that can exhibit geometric isomerism.\n\n4.  **Calculate the total stereoisomers:** The total number of stereogenic centers (n) is the sum of the chiral centers and the number of double bonds with E/Z isomerism.\n    *   n = 3 (chiral centers) + 2 (E/Z double bonds) = 5\n    *   The molecule is asymmetric, so we use the formula 2^n.\n    *   Total stereoisomers = 2⁵ = 32.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_stereoisomers_calculation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of stereoisomers for the compound\n    6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Identify the number of chiral centers (asymmetric carbons).\n    # A chiral center is a carbon atom attached to four different groups.\n    # In the given molecule, the chiral centers are C5, C6, and C9.\n    # C2 is not chiral because it is attached to two identical methyl groups.\n    num_chiral_centers = 3\n\n    # Step 2: Identify the number of double bonds that can exhibit E/Z isomerism.\n    # This occurs when each carbon of the double bond has two different substituents.\n    # Both the C3=C4 and C7=C8 double bonds meet this condition.\n    num_ez_double_bonds = 2\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the total number of stereogenic centers (n).\n    n = num_chiral_centers + num_ez_double_bonds\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the total number of stereoisomers using the formula 2^n.\n    # This formula is applicable as the molecule is asymmetric and has no meso forms.\n    total_stereoisomers = 2**n\n\n    print(\"To find the number of stereoisomers for 6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol:\")\n    print(f\"1.
