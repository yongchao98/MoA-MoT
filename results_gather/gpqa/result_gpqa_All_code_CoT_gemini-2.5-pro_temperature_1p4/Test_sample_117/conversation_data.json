    "This is a chemistry problem that can be solved by understanding the reactivity of the functional groups involved. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the major product:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material**: The reactant is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. The key functional group here is the \"enol\" (-C=C-OH), which consists of a double bond (alkene) directly attached to a hydroxyl group (alcohol).\n\n2.  **Keto-Enol Tautomerism**: Enols are generally unstable and exist in a rapid equilibrium with their more stable constitutional isomers, called \"keto\" forms. This process is known as keto-enol tautomerism. The equilibrium almost always heavily favors the keto form.\n    *   The enol, 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, will tautomerize to its keto form, which is 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.\n\n3.  **Identify the Reaction**: Since the enol quickly converts to the ketone, the actual reaction is between the major species in the flask, 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone, and bromine (Br₂).\n\n4.  **Alpha-Halogenation of Ketones**: The reaction of a ketone with a halogen like Br₂ results in the substitution of a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon) with a halogen atom. This is called α-halogenation.\n    *   In 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone, the α-carbons are at positions 2 and 5. Due to the molecule's symmetry, these positions are equivalent.\n    *   Bromination will occur at one of these positions, for example, at C-2.\n\n5.  **Determine the Final Product**: The substitution of a hydrogen at the α-position (e.g., C-2) with a bromine atom yields 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Options**:\n    *   A) and C) are dibromoalcohols, which would result from the direct addition of Br₂ across the enol's double bond. This is a minor pathway because the keto-enol tautomerism is much faster and more favorable.\n    *   B) 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone is the product of α-halogenation of the stable ketone tautomer. This is the expected major product.\n    *   D) 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone is incorrect because bromination occurs at the α-carbon (C2 or C5), not at C4.\n\nBased on this analysis, the code below will confirm the correct choice.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine\n    to determine the major product.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the reactants and options\n    reactant = \"4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol\"\n    reagent = \"Bromine (Br2)\"\n    options = {\n        'A': \"(1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol\",\n        'B': \"2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone\",\n        'C': \"(1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol\",\n        'D': \"4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone\"\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze the starting material.
