    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Provided Experimental Data:**\n    *   **¹H NMR:** The key observation is two distinct peaks for a single proton (the α-proton). They have similar chemical shifts and their combined integral is correct (1H), with each peak having roughly half of that integral. This indicates the presence of two different species in an approximately 1:1 ratio. Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, these two species must be isomers that are not rapidly interconverting on the NMR timescale (which is milliseconds to seconds).\n    *   **LC-MS:** This technique separates compounds based on their physical properties and then measures their mass. The observation of two separate peaks confirms there are two distinct, separable chemical species. The equal intensities confirm the ~1:1 ratio seen in the NMR. Crucially, both peaks have the *same mass spectrum*, which matches the expected molecule. This proves that the two species are isomers – they have the same chemical formula and mass but different structures. The separation at \"elevated temperature\" is also a clue, suggesting the isomers are stable enough to be separated chromatographically.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Multiple-Choice Options:**\n\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. Under standard (achiral) conditions, enantiomers have identical physical and chemical properties, including identical NMR spectra and co-elution (appearing as a single peak) in standard LC. To see two NMR or LC peaks, you would need a chiral environment (e.g., a chiral solvent, chiral shift reagent, or a chiral chromatography column). Since this is not specified, this option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor is a starting material or intermediate used in the synthesis. It would have a different chemical formula and therefore a different molecular mass. The LC-MS data clearly shows both peaks have the *same mass*, ruling out contamination by a precursor.\n\n    *   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This is a known side reaction that forms an N-acylurea byproduct. Like a precursor, this byproduct would have a different chemical formula and mass (it incorporates part of the coupling reagent). Again, the identical mass spectra of the two peaks rule this option out.\n\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. They have different physical properties and, importantly, different spectroscopic signatures. They will produce distinct peaks in both NMR and standard LC. This fits the data perfectly. In peptide chemistry, this situation commonly arises from two phenomena:\n        1.  **Epimerization:** Partial inversion of a chiral center (e.g., an L-amino acid converting to a D-amino acid) during the synthesis.\n        2.  **Rotamers (Atropisomers):** Slow rotation around a bond, most commonly the amide (peptide) bond, which has significant double-bond character. This creates stable *cis* and *trans* conformers. These conformers are diastereomeric and often exist in significant populations at room temperature, giving rise to two sets of NMR peaks and two peaks in an LC chromatogram. This is a classic explanation for the observations described.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The presence of two separable isomers with the same mass is the key takeaway. Only diastereomers fit this description among the given choices.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef analyze_peptide_data():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided NMR and LC-MS data for a synthetic peptide\n    to determine the most likely explanation for the observations.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Summarize the key experimental observations.\n    print(\"Analyzing the Experimental Observations:\")\n    obs1 = \"- 1H NMR: Two peaks for a single alpha-proton, with a combined integral of 1H (~1:1 ratio).
