    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The task is to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of a given vector field, `∫ (∇ ⋅ f) dV`, within a sphere of radius `R`.\n\n2.  **The Vector Field:** The field `f` is radial and its magnitude is `f(r) = 1/r^2`. In vector form, this is `f = (1/r^2) * r̂`, where `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n3.  **Choose the Right Tool (The Divergence Theorem):** Directly calculating the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` and then integrating it is complicated due to the singularity at the origin (r=0). A much more elegant approach is to use the Divergence Theorem. The theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field within a volume `V` is equal to the net flux of the field through the closed surface `S` that encloses the volume:\n    `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\n4.  **Apply the Theorem to Our Problem:**\n    *   The volume `V` is the sphere of radius `R`.\n    *   The enclosing surface `S` is the surface of this sphere.\n    *   The surface element vector `dS` points radially outward, so `dS = dS * r̂`.\n    *   The vector field is `f = (1/r^2) * r̂`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Surface Integral (Flux):**\n    *   The dot product `f ⋅ dS` becomes `((1/r^2) * r̂) ⋅ (dS * r̂)`. Since `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`, this simplifies to `(1/r^2) * dS`.\n    *   The integral becomes `∮_S (1/r^2) dS`.\n    *   On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, we can replace `r` with `R` and take the constant `1/R^2` out of the integral: `(1/R^2) * ∮_S dS`.\n    *   The remaining integral `∮_S dS` is simply the total surface area of the sphere, which is `4 * π * R^2`.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The result is `(1/R^2) * (4 * π * R^2)`.\n    *   The `R^2` terms cancel out, leaving a final answer of `4π`.\n\n7.  **Code Implementation:** The Python code will use the symbolic math library `sympy` to perform this calculation step-by-step, showing how the `R` terms cancel to arrive at the final constant value.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\nfrom sympy import pi\n\n# Step 1: Define the radius R as a positive symbolic variable.\nR = sp.symbols('R', positive=True)\n\n# Step 2: Define the magnitude of the vector field f on the surface of the sphere.\n# The field magnitude is 1/r^2, and on the surface, r = R.\nf_mag_surface = 1 / R**2\n\n# Step 3: Define the surface area of the sphere.\nsurface_area = 4 * pi * R**2\n\n# Step 4: According to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence\n# is equal to the flux through the enclosing surface. For this radial field,\n# the flux is the field's magnitude on the surface multiplied by the total surface area.\nvolume_integral = f_mag_surface * surface_area\n\n# Step 5: Simplify the expression to get the final answer.\n# sympy will cancel out the R**2 terms automatically.\nfinal_answer = sp.simplify(volume_integral)\n\n# Step 6: Print the result and the available choices to determine the correct one.\nprint(\"Applying the Divergence Theorem:\")\nprint(f\"The magnitude of the field on the surface (r=R) is: {f_mag_surface}\")\nprint(f\"The surface area of the sphere is: {surface_area}\")\nprint(f\"The volume integral of the divergence is (Field Magnitude * Surface Area): {volume_integral}\")\nprint(f\"The simplified final answer is: {final_answer}\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this result with the given choices:\")\nprint(\"A) 4/3 * pi * R\")\nprint(f\"B) {4 * pi}\")\nprint(\"C) 1\")\nprint(\"D) 0\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated answer matches choice B.\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>"
