    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Rest Wavelength:** The problem states that neutral hydrogen absorbs light at the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) wavelength, which is approximately 1216 Angstroms in the rest frame (λ_rest).\n2.  **Identify the Observable Wavelength Range:** Ground-based optical telescopes are limited by the Earth's atmosphere, which absorbs most ultraviolet (UV) light. The shortest wavelength that can effectively penetrate the atmosphere and be observed from the ground is around 3500 Angstroms. This will be our minimum observable wavelength (λ_obs_min).\n3.  **Apply the Redshift Formula:** The redshift (z) relates the rest wavelength to the observed wavelength by the formula: `λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + z)`.\n4.  **Calculate the Minimum Redshift:** To find the lower limit on the redshift, we need to calculate the `z` required to shift the 1216 Å line to at least 3500 Å. We can rearrange the formula to solve for `z`: `z = (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1`. By setting `λ_obs` to our minimum observable wavelength of 3500 Å, we can calculate the minimum required redshift.\n5.  **Compare with Options:** Finally, we will compare our calculated redshift with the given options to find the best estimate.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the rest-frame wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line.\nlambda_rest = 1216  # in Angstroms\n\n# Step 2: Define the minimum observable wavelength from a ground-based optical telescope.\n# This is due to the atmospheric cutoff in the UV range.\nlambda_observed_min = 3500  # in Angstroms\n\n# Step 3: Use the redshift formula to find the minimum redshift (z_min).\n# z = (lambda_observed / lambda_rest) - 1\nz_min = (lambda_observed_min / lambda_rest) - 1\n\n# Step 4: Print the reasoning and the result.\nprint(f\"The rest-frame wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line is {lambda_rest} Angstroms.\")\nprint(f\"The minimum wavelength observable by ground-based optical telescopes is approximately {lambda_observed_min} Angstroms due to the atmospheric cutoff.\")\nprint(f\"To find the minimum redshift, we calculate the redshift required to shift the {lambda_rest} Angstrom line to {lambda_observed_min} Angstroms.\")\nprint(f\"Calculation: z_min = ({lambda_observed_min} / {lambda_rest}) - 1\")\nprint(f\"The calculated lower limit on the redshift is: {z_min:.2f}\")\n\n# Step 5: Compare the result to the given options.\nprint(\"\\nGiven options:\")\nprint(\"A) 1.2\")\nprint(\"B) 1.9\")\nprint(\"C) 3\")\nprint(\"D) 2.4\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value of ~1.88 is closest to option B.\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal Answer Choice: B\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>"
