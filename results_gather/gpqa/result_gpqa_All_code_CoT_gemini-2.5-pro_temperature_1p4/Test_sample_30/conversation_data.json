    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the molecular symmetry group of the final product:\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 1:** Toluene is treated with a mixture of nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is the standard procedure for the nitration of an aromatic ring. The methyl group (-CH₃) on toluene is an ortho-, para-directing group. Due to less steric hindrance, the major product formed is the para-substituted one.\n    *   **Product 1:** p-nitrotoluene.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2:** Product 1 (p-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This combination of reagents is a strong oxidizing agent that converts a benzylic methyl group into a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   **Product 2:** p-nitrobenzoic acid.\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 3:** Product 2 (p-nitrobenzoic acid) is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This reaction is more complex.\n    *   First, the acidic p-nitrobenzoic acid reacts with the base (NaOH) in an acid-base neutralization to form sodium p-nitrobenzoate.\n    *   The remaining reagents, acetone and base (NaOH), can act as a reducing system. Specifically, the enolate of acetone can reduce the nitro group. A common outcome for the reduction of nitroarenes under basic conditions is reductive coupling.\n    *   Two molecules of p-nitrobenzoic acid are reduced and coupled to form an azo compound.\n    *   **Product 3:** (E)-4,4'-azodibenzoic acid. This molecule has two para-carboxyphenyl groups connected by a trans N=N double bond. Its structure is HOOC-C₆H₄-N=N-C₆H₄-COOH.\n\n4.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of Product 3:**\n    *   The final product is (E)-4,4'-azodibenzoic acid.\n    *   The most stable conformation of this molecule is planar to maximize π-conjugation.\n    *   Let's analyze its symmetry elements in this planar conformation:\n        *   **Inversion Center (i):** Yes, at the midpoint of the N=N double bond. Inverting any atom through this point lands on an identical atom.\n        *   **Proper Rotation Axis (Cn):** Yes, there is a C₂ axis passing through the inversion center, perpendicular to the plane of the molecule. A 180° rotation around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged.\n        *   **Mirror Plane (σ):** Yes, the plane of the molecule itself is a horizontal mirror plane (σh) because it is perpendicular to the C₂ axis.\n    *   A molecule that possesses a C₂ axis and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) belongs to the **C₂h** point group.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:** The molecular symmetry group of product 3 is C₂h, which corresponds to option A.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Analyze the reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n# Reaction 1: Nitration of toluene.\n# Toluene + HNO3/H2SO4 -> p-nitrotoluene (Product 1).
