    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance (a) from its star (T_eq ∝ 1/√a). This means the orbital distance is inversely proportional to the square of the equilibrium temperature (a ∝ 1/T_eq²).\n\n2.  **Relate Orbital Period and Orbital Distance:** According to Kepler's Third Law, the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its orbital distance (P² ∝ a³). This means the orbital period is proportional to the orbital distance to the power of 3/2 (P ∝ a^(3/2)).\n\n3.  **Combine Relationships:** By combining the two relationships above, we can find the relationship between the orbital period and the equilibrium temperature.\n    *   Since P ∝ a^(3/2) and a ∝ 1/T_eq², we can substitute the expression for 'a'.\n    *   P ∝ (1/T_eq²)^(3/2)\n    *   P ∝ 1/T_eq³\n    This shows that the orbital period is inversely proportional to the cube of the equilibrium temperature. Therefore, the ratio of the orbital period of Planet3 to Planet1 (P3/P1) is equal to the cube of the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet1 to Planet3, i.e., P3/P1 = (T_eq1/T_eq3)³.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Temperature Ratio:** We are given the ratios T_eq1/T_eq2 = 1.4 and T_eq2/T_eq3 = 2.3. We can find the required ratio T_eq1/T_eq3 by multiplying these two ratios:\n    *   T_eq1/T_eq3 = (T_eq1/T_eq2) * (T_eq2/T_eq3)\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Period Ratio:** Finally, we will cube the result from the previous step to find the ratio P3/P1. The information about the planets' masses and albedo is not needed because the albedo is the same for all planets and cancels out, and the planets' masses are negligible compared to the star's mass.\n\n```python\n# Given ratios of equilibrium temperatures\nT_eq1_over_T_eq2 = 1.4\nT_eq2_over_T_eq3 = 2.3\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet1 to Planet3.\n# T_eq1/T_eq3 = (T_eq1/T_eq2) * (T_eq2/T_eq3)\nT_eq1_over_T_eq3 = T_eq1_over_T_eq2 * T_eq2_over_T_eq3\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the ratio of the orbital period of Planet3 to Planet1.\n# The relationship is P3/P1 = (T_eq1/T_eq3)^3\nperiod_ratio_P3_over_P1 = T_eq1_over_T_eq3 ** 3\n\n# Print the final result and the given options\nprint(f\"The orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of: ~{period_ratio_P3_over_P1:.1f}\")\nprint(\"A) ~ 10.4\")\nprint(\"B) ~ 3.2\")\nprint(\"C) ~ 33.4\")\nprint(\"D) ~ 4.4\")\n```\n<<<C>>>"
