    "Here is a thinking process to solve the chemistry problem:\n\n### Step-by-step thinking process:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The main goal is to identify salts A and B to determine the total number of atoms in their chemical formulas.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Experimental Data:**\n    *   **Initial state:** An equimolar mixture of salt A and salt B. Total mass = 7.20 g. Let `n` be the moles of A and `n` be the moles of B. So, `n * M_A + n * M_B = 7.20`, where `M_A` and `M_B` are the molar masses.\n    *   **Heating:** The mixture is heated to 200°C, producing *only* a mixture of gases. This means no solid residue (like metal oxides) is left.\n    *   **Tube №1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a desiccant, it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase is the mass of water produced.\n        *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂):** This absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂). Its weight did not change.\n        *   Conclusion: No acidic gases were produced.\n    *   **Tube №3 (Hot Cu):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The mass increase is the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n        *   Reaction: `2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO`.\n        *   The mass increase is `mass(O)`. So, `mass(O₂)` that passed through is 0.80 g.\n    *   **Remaining Gas (C):** The gas that passed through all tubes has a volume of 2.24 L at STP. This gas is inert to all the reagents.\n        *   Volume of Gas C = 2.24 L (STP).\n\n3.  **Calculate the Moles of Each Gaseous Product:**\n    *   **Moles of H₂O:**\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 1 (H) * 2 + 16 (O) = 18 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = `mass / molar_mass` = `3.60 g / 18 g/mol` = 0.20 mol.\n    *   **Moles of O₂:**\n        *   The mass increase of tube #3 is due to oxygen. Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n        *   Molar mass of O₂ = 16 (O) * 2 = 32 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = `mass / molar_mass` = `0.80 g / 32 g/mol` = 0.025 mol.\n    *   **Moles of Gas C:**\n        *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = `volume / molar_volume` = `2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol` = 0.10 mol.\n\n4.  **Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Mixture:**\n    *   The gases produced are H₂O, O₂, and Gas C.\n    *   Since no acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂) were formed and the decomposition of salts often produces nitrogen, it's highly likely that **Gas C is Nitrogen (N₂)**.\n    *   Let's calculate the mass of each element from the products:\n        *   **Hydrogen (H):** All H is in H₂O. Moles of H = `2 * moles(H₂O)` = `2 * 0.20 mol` = 0.40 mol. Mass of H = `0.40 mol * 1 g/mol` = 0.40 g.\n        *   **Nitrogen (N):** All N is in N₂. Moles of N = `2 * moles(N₂)` = `2 * 0.10 mol` = 0.20 mol. Mass of N = `0.20 mol * 14 g/mol` = 2.80 g.\n        *   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in H₂O and O₂. Moles of O = `moles(H₂O) * 1 + moles(O₂) * 2` = `0.20 mol + 2 * 0.025 mol` = `0.20 + 0.05` = 0.25 mol. Mass of O = `0.25 mol * 16 g/mol` = 4.00 g.\n    *   **Total Mass Check:** Total mass of elements = `mass(H) + mass(N) + mass(O)` = `0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g` = 7.20 g.\n    *   This matches the initial mass perfectly. Therefore, salts A and B are composed only of Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen.\n\n5.  **Identify the Salts (A and B):**\n    *   We need two different oxygen-containing nitrogen-hydrogen salts (oxosalts of ammonia) that decompose into H₂O, N₂, and O₂ upon heating, with no residue. The most common examples are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n    *   **Hypothesis:** Let's assume Salt A = NH₄NO₂ and Salt B = NH₄NO₃.\n    *   **Decomposition Reactions:**\n        *   A: `NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n        *   B: `2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)` (This reaction happens at slightly higher temperatures but is consistent with producing N₂, O₂, and H₂O).\n    *   The mixture is equimolar. Let `n` be the moles of A and B.\n    *   From `n` moles of A (NH₄NO₂), we get: `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n    *   From `n` moles of B (NH₄NO₃), according to the stoichiometry `2:2:1:4`, we get: `n` moles of N₂, `n/2` moles of O₂, and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n    *   **Total moles of products:**\n        *   Total N₂ = `n (from A) + n (from B)` = `2n`\n        *   Total H₂O = `2n (from A) + 2n (from B)` = `4n`\n        *   Total O₂ = `0 (from A) + n/2 (from B)` = `n/2`\n    *   Now, we use our calculated moles of products to find `n`:\n        *   From O₂: `moles(O₂) = n/2 = 0.025 mol` → `n = 0.05 mol`.\n    *   **Verification:** If `n = 0.05 mol`, let's check the other products and the total mass.\n        *   Predicted moles(N₂) = `2n` = `2 * 0.05` = 0.10 mol. (Matches our calculation)\n        *   Predicted moles(H₂O) = `4n` = `4 * 0.05` = 0.20 mol. (Matches our calculation)\n        *   Molar mass of A (NH₄NO₂): 14 + 4*1 + 14 + 2*16 = 64 g/mol.\n        *   Molar mass of B (NH₄NO₃): 14 + 4*1 + 14 + 3*16 = 80 g/mol.\n        *   Predicted total mass = `n*M_A + n*M_B` = `0.05*64 + 0.05*80` = `3.20 + 4.00` = 7.20 g. (Matches the initial mass)\n    *   The hypothesis is correct. Salt A is NH₄NO₂ and Salt B is NH₄NO₃.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   The question asks for the *total number of all atoms* in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each.\n    *   Atoms in A (NH₄NO₂): 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 2 O = 8 atoms.\n    *   Atoms in B (NH₄NO₃): 1 N + 4 H + 1 N + 3 O = 9 atoms.\n    *   Total atoms = `8 (in A) + 9 (in B)` = 17.\n\n7.  **Match with Options:**\n    *   A) 13\n    *   B) 17\n    *   C) 19\n    *   D) 15\n    *   The answer is 17, which corresponds to option B.\n\nThis step-by-step process confirms the answer and provides the logic for the Python code.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Plan:\n# 1.
