    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the correct order:\n\n1.  **Identify the nature of the substituent on the benzene ring.** We need to classify each substituent as either an activating group or a deactivating group, and determine if it is ortho/para-directing or meta-directing.\n    *   **Activating, ortho/para-directing groups:** These donate electron density to the ring, making it more reactive towards electrophiles. They direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. Examples here are -CH3 and -C2H5.\n    *   **Deactivating, meta-directing groups:** These withdraw electron density from the ring, making it less reactive. They direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. Examples here are -NO2, -COOH, and -COOC2H5.\n    *   **Deactivating, ortho/para-directing groups:** Halogens are a special case. They are deactivating due to their strong inductive effect but are ortho/para-directing because their lone pairs can participate in resonance. -Cl is in this category.\n\n2.  **Group the substances based on their directing effect.**\n    *   **Group 1 (low para-yield):** Meta-directors will produce very little para-isomer. These are substances 2 (-COOC2H5), 4 (-NO2), and 6 (-COOH).\n    *   **Group 2 (high para-yield):** Ortho/para-directors will produce a significant amount of para-isomer. These are substances 1 (-CH3), 3 (-Cl), and 5 (-C2H5).\n    Any substance from Group 1 will have a lower para-isomer yield than any substance from Group 2.\n\n3.  **Rank the substances within each group.**\n    *   **Ranking Group 1 (meta-directors):** The yield of the para-isomer (a minor product) is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group directs more strongly to the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of ortho and para products.\n        *   The order of deactivating strength is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\n        *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: C6H5-NO2 < C6H5-COOH < C6H5-COOC2H5. This corresponds to the order: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n    *   **Ranking Group 2 (ortho/para-directors):** The yield of the para-isomer depends on the para-to-ortho product ratio (p/o). This ratio is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n        *   **C6H5-CH3 (1):** The methyl group has moderate steric hindrance, leading to a p/o ratio of about 2 for bromination (e.g., ~66% para).\n        *   **C6H5-C2H5 (5):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions favors the formation of the para-isomer more strongly. Thus, ethylbenzene will have a higher para yield than toluene.\n        *   **C6H5-Cl (3):** The chloro group, due to its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect, deactivates the ortho positions more significantly than the para position. This electronic effect leads to a very high preference for the para-isomer (p/o ratio can be ~8 or higher, with ~87% para yield).\n        *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: C6H5-CH3 < C6H5-C2H5 < C6H5-Cl. This corresponds to the order: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n4.  **Combine the rankings.**\n    Combining the two ranked groups gives the final order of increasing para-isomer yield: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n5.  **Match with the given options.**\n    The calculated order **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3** corresponds to option B.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this logic to select the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the chemical ordering problem based on electrophilic substitution rules.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define substance properties based on chemical principles.\n    # 'group': 'meta' or 'op' (ortho/para) directing\n    # 'rank_within_group': a score based on factors affecting para-yield\n    substances_data = {\n        # Meta-directors: ranked by deactivating strength (stronger deactivator = lower para yield)\n        # Deactivating strength: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n        4: {'name': 'C6H5-NO2', 'group': 'meta', 'rank_within_group': 1},\n        6: {'name': 'C6H5-COOH', 'group': 'meta', 'rank_within_group': 2},\n        2: {'name': 'C6H5-COOC2H5', 'group': 'meta', 'rank_within_group': 3},\n\n        # Ortho/para-directors: ranked by p/o ratio (steric/electronic effects)\n        # Para-yield: -Cl > -C2H5 > -CH3\n        1: {'name': 'C6H5-CH3', 'group': 'op', 'rank_within_group': 1},\n        5: {'name': 'C6H5-C2H5', 'group': 'op', 'rank_within_group': 2},\n        3: {'name': 'C6H5-Cl', 'group': 'op', 'rank_within_group': 3},\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Sort the substances.\n    # The primary sort key is the group ('meta' comes before 'op').\n    # The secondary sort key is the rank within the group.\n    # We assign a group score: 0 for 'meta', 1 for 'op'.\n    sorted_substance_numbers = sorted(\n        substances_data.keys(),\n        key=lambda k: (0 if substances_data[k]['group'] == 'meta' else 1, substances_data[k]['rank_within_group'])\n    )\n\n    # Step 3: Define the multiple-choice options provided.\n    options = {\n        \"A\": [3, 5, 1, 6, 2, 4],\n        \"B\": [4, 6, 2, 1, 5, 3],\n        \"C\": [4, 2, 6, 3, 1, 5],\n        \"D\": [6, 2, 4, 5, 1, 3],\n    }\n\n    # Step 4: Find the correct option by comparing the sorted list with the options.\n    correct_option = None\n    for option_letter, order_list in options.items():\n        if order_list == sorted_substance_numbers:\n            correct_option = option_letter\n            break\n\n    # Step 5: Print the results.\n    order_str = '<'.join(map(str, sorted_substance_numbers))\n    print(f\"The substances arranged in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer are:\")\n    print(order_str)\n    print(f\"This corresponds to option: {correct_option}\")\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Answer <<<>>>\")\n    print(f\"<<<{correct_option}>>>\")\n\n\nsolve_chemistry_order()\n```"
