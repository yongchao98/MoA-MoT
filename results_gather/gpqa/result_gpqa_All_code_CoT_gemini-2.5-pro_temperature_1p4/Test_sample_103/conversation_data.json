    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Establish the Physical Relationship:** First, we need to understand the connection between the observed wavelength shift (Δλ) and the orbital period (P) of the exoplanet.\n    *   The Doppler shift formula tells us that the observed wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the radial velocity of the star (K). So, `Δλ ∝ K`.\n    *   For a star-planet system in a circular orbit, the star's velocity amplitude (K) can be related to the planet's orbital period (P). Using Kepler's Third Law and the conservation of momentum, we find that `K ∝ P^(-1/3)` (assuming the masses of the stars and planets are the same in both systems, as stated in the problem).\n    *   Combining these proportionalities, we get `Δλ ∝ P^(-1/3)`.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We can express this relationship as a ratio for the two systems:\n    `(Δλ₂ / Δλ₁) = (P₂ / P₁)^(-1/3)`\n\n3.  **Solve for the Period Ratio:** Our goal is to find `P₂ / P₁`. We can rearrange the equation:\n    *   Raise both sides to the power of -3: `(Δλ₂ / Δλ₁)^(-3) = ( (P₂ / P₁)^(-1/3) )^(-3)`\n    *   This simplifies to: `(Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)³ = P₂ / P₁`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Result:** Now, we can substitute the given values into this final formula (`Δλ₁ = 5` mÅ and `Δλ₂ = 7` mÅ) to calculate the numerical answer and choose the correct option.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Given values for the periodic wavelength shifts\nshift_planet1 = 5  # in miliangstrom\nshift_planet2 = 7  # in miliangstrom\n\n# The relationship between the period ratio (P2/P1) and the shift ratio is:\n# P2 / P1 = (shift_planet1 / shift_planet2) ** 3\nperiod_ratio = (shift_planet1 / shift_planet2) ** 3\n\n# The options provided\noptions = {\n    'A': 1.40,\n    'B': 1.96,\n    'C': 0.85,\n    'D': 0.36\n}\n\n# Print the calculated result and the choices\nprint(f\"The calculated ratio of orbital periods (P2 / P1) is: {period_ratio:.2f}\")\nprint(\"The given options are:\")\nprint(f\"A) {options['A']:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"B) {options['B']:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"C) {options['C']:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"D) {options['D']:.2f}\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value is closest to option D.\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>"
