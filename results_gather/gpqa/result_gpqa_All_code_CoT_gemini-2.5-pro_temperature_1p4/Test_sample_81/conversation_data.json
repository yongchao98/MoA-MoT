    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the structure of the final product.\n\n1.  **Reaction 1: Cyclooctatetraene + Maleic anhydride → Product 1**\n    *   This is a [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloaddition. Cyclooctatetraene first undergoes a valence tautomerization to its bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene form, which contains a reactive 1,3-cyclohexadiene system.\n    *   Maleic anhydride, a potent dienophile, reacts with this diene.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic dienophiles like maleic anhydride are typically *endo*-selective due to favorable secondary orbital interactions. This means the anhydride ring in Product 1 is oriented *syn* (on the same side) relative to the other unsaturated bridge of the newly formed bicyclic system. The two carboxyl-derived positions will have a *cis* relationship.\n\n2.  **Reaction 2: Product 1 + Methanol/H₂SO₄ → Product 2**\n    *   This is an acid-catalyzed esterification. The anhydride ring is opened by two molecules of methanol to form a dimethyl ester.\n    *   This reaction does not affect the stereocenters of the molecule. Therefore, Product 2 retains the stereochemistry of Product 1. The two new methyl ester groups (-COOCH₃) are *cis* to each other.\n    *   Looking at the options, we can immediately evaluate this feature. The ester groups are on carbons 10 and 11.\n        *   Options A, C, and D describe the esters with `(10S, 11R)` stereochemistry. For adjacent centers, an (S,R) configuration indicates a *cis* relationship. This is consistent with the reaction.\n        *   Option B describes the esters as `(10R, 11R)`. A (R,R) configuration indicates a *trans* relationship. This is incorrect. So, **Option B is eliminated**.\n\n3.  **Reaction 3: Product 2 + Cyclopentadiene → Product 3**\n    *   This is a second Diels-Alder reaction. Cyclopentadiene acts as the diene. The dienophile is the remaining double bond in Product 2, which is located in the strained cyclobutene portion of the molecule.\n    *   The facial selectivity of this reaction is determined by sterics. The cyclopentadiene can approach the dienophile from two faces:\n        *   **Endo attack:** Approaching from the same face as the bulky bicyclo[2.2.2]octane-diester portion of Product 2. This pathway is highly sterically hindered. It would result in a *syn* fusion between the new norbornene system and the existing framework.\n        *   **Exo attack:** Approaching from the side opposite to the bulky part of the molecule. This pathway is sterically favored and leads to the major product. This results in an *anti* fusion of the two systems.\n    *   Therefore, the major isomer of Product 3 is the *anti* isomer.\n\n4.  **Identifying the *anti* Isomer from the Options**\n    *   We need to distinguish between the *syn* and *anti* isomers based on their IUPAC stereodescriptors. The key is the relative stereochemistry at the four carbons forming the central cyclobutane ring: `4a, 4b, 8a, 8b`.\n    *   A general rule for adjacent stereocenters in a ring is that like descriptors (e.g., R,R or S,S) correspond to a *trans* relationship, while unlike descriptors (R,S or S,R) correspond to a *cis* relationship.\n    *   Let's compare the main structural frameworks attached at carbons `4b` and `8b`.\n        *   In the *anti* isomer (from *exo* attack), these two large groups are *trans* to each other. This should correspond to like stereodescriptors (R,R or S,S) at C4b and C8b.\n        *   In the *syn* isomer (from *endo* attack), these groups are *cis*, corresponding to unlike stereodescriptors (R,S or S,R).\n    *   Let's examine the remaining options:\n        *   **Option A**: `(4bR, 8bS)`. The descriptors are unlike (R,S). This represents a *cis* relationship of the main groups, meaning this is the minor *syn* isomer.\n        *   **Option C**: `(4bR, 8bR)`. The descriptors are like (R,R). This represents a *trans* relationship, meaning this is the major *anti* isomer.\n        *   **Option D**: `(4bR, 8bS)` (in the full list of descriptors). The descriptors are unlike, so this is also the *syn* isomer (the enantiomer of A).\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    The major product formed is the *anti* isomer resulting from the sterically favored *exo* attack of cyclopentadiene. This corresponds to the stereochemistry described in Option C.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the multi-step reaction and determines the correct isomer.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Analyze the first Diels-Alder reaction (COT + maleic anhydride).\n    # This reaction is endo-selective, resulting in a cis-dicarboxylic acid precursor.\n    # The esterification in Step 2 preserves this cis stereochemistry.\n    # We check the stereochemistry of the ester groups at carbons 10 and 11 in the options.\n    # cis corresponds to (R,S) or (S,R). trans corresponds to (R,R) or (S,S).\n    option_A_esters = \"(10S, 11R)\"  # unlike -> cis\n    option_B_esters = \"(10R, 11R)\"  # like -> trans\n    option_C_esters = \"(10S, 11R)\"  # unlike -> cis\n    option_D_esters = \"(10S, 11R)\"  # unlike -> cis\n\n    print(\"Step 1 & 2 Analysis: The first reaction is an endo-selective Diels-Alder, followed by esterification.\")\n    print(\"This results in a cis-diester product.\")\n    print(f\"Option A has {option_A_esters} stereochemistry for the esters, which is cis. -> Possible\")\n    print(f\"Option B has {option_B_esters} stereochemistry for the esters, which is trans. -> Incorrect\")\n    print(f\"Option C has {option_C_esters} stereochemistry for the esters, which is cis. -> Possible\")\n    print(f\"Option D has {option_D_esters} stereochemistry for the esters, which is cis. -> Possible\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze the second Diels-Alder reaction (Product 2 + cyclopentadiene).\n    # This reaction's stereoselectivity is governed by sterics.\n    # The major product comes from 'exo' attack of cyclopentadiene, which is less sterically hindered.\n    # 'exo' attack leads to an 'anti' fusion of the two polycyclic systems.\n    # In an 'anti' isomer, the two large groups across the central cyclobutane ring are trans.\n    # A trans relationship between adjacent stereocenters corresponds to like descriptors (R,R or S,S).\n    # A cis relationship ('syn' isomer) corresponds to unlike descriptors (R,S or S,R).\n    # We check the fusion stereochemistry at carbons 4b and 8b.\n    option_A_fusion = \"(4bR, 8bS)\" # unlike -> cis -> syn isomer (minor product)\n    option_C_fusion = \"(4bR, 8bR)\" # like -> trans -> anti isomer (major product)\n    option_D_fusion = \"(4bR, 8bS)\" # unlike -> cis -> syn isomer (minor product)\n\n    print(\"Step 3 Analysis: The second Diels-Alder is governed by sterics, favoring exo attack.\")\n    print(\"This leads to the 'anti' isomer, where the two main frameworks are trans to each other.\")\n    print(\"A trans relationship on adjacent centers corresponds to like stereodescriptors (R,R or S,S).\")\n    print(f\"Option A has fusion stereochemistry {option_A_fusion}.
