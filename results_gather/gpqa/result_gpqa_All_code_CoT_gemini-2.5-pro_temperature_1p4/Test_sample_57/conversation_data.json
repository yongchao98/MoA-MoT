    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I will analyze the core concept of the question, which is \"regularization at high energies\" in physics. Regularization is a technique used to handle infinities (divergences) that appear in calculations, particularly in quantum field theories when considering very high energies or short distances (known as ultraviolet or UV divergences).\n2.  Next, I will evaluate each of the four given theories against this concept:\n    *   **Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)** and **Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)** are quantum field theories. They are the cornerstones of the Standard Model of particle physics. A key feature of these theories is that calculations for physical processes involve loop diagrams which lead to infinite results. These infinities are systematically handled using the procedures of regularization and renormalization. Therefore, they absolutely require regularization.\n    *   **Classical Electrodynamics** is not a quantum theory, but it has its own high-energy problem: the self-energy of a classical point charge is infinite. This indicates a breakdown of the theory at short distances and can be seen as a classical precursor to the divergence problems in QFT. While the term \"regularization\" is most formally used in QFT, this classical theory does have a high-energy pathology that needs to be resolved.\n    *   **Superstring Theory** is a candidate for a unified theory of everything. One of its most significant theoretical features is that it is believed to be \"UV-finite.\" This means that unlike point-particle theories (like QED and QCD), the interactions of strings are \"smeared out\" in a way that is conjectured to eliminate the high-energy divergences altogether. Consequently, it would not require regularization.\n3.  Based on this analysis, Superstring Theory is the unique choice that is proposed to be free from high-energy divergences.\n4.  Finally, I will write a Python script that encodes this information, analyzes the options, and prints the correct choice with an explanation.\n\n```python\ndef find_theory_without_regularization():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes physical theories to identify which one does not require high-energy regularization.\n    \"\"\"\n    theories = {\n        'A': {\n            'name': 'Superstring Theory',\n            'requires_regularization': False,\n            'reason': 'This theory is proposed as a UV-finite theory.
