    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the major products of the two reactions.\n\n### Reaction A: `(((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene + (1. BuLi, 2. H+)`\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   The starting material is `(((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene`, which is an allyl benzyl ether with the structure `Ph-CH₂-O-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂`.\n    *   The reagents are butyllithium (BuLi), a very strong base, followed by an acid workup (H⁺).\n    *   This set of reactants and conditions is characteristic of the **Wittig rearrangement**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Intermediate:**\n    *   BuLi will deprotonate the most acidic proton. The benzylic protons on `Ph-CH₂-` are the most acidic (pKa ≈ 35-40) due to resonance stabilization of the resulting carbanion by the phenyl ring.\n    *   The intermediate formed is `[Ph-CH⁻-O-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂] Li⁺`.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Rearrangement:**\n    *   The carbanion intermediate can undergo two types of sigmatropic rearrangements: a [2,3]-shift or a [1,2]-shift.\n    *   The **[2,3]-Wittig rearrangement** is a concerted pericyclic reaction and is generally favored kinetically, especially at low temperatures. It would lead to the product `3,3-dimethyl-2-phenylpent-4-en-2-ol`. However, this product is not listed in the options.\n    *   The **[1,2]-Wittig rearrangement** proceeds through a radical-pair mechanism and is less common but can occur. In this rearrangement, the entire allyl group migrates from the oxygen atom to the adjacent carbanion.\n        *   Intermediate: `Ph-CH⁻-O-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂`\n        *   Rearrangement: The `-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂` group moves from `O` to `C`.\n        *   Product (before workup): `Ph-CH(CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂)-O⁻`\n    *   **Protonation:** The final step is adding a proton (H⁺) to the alkoxide `O⁻`.\n        *   Product A: `Ph-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂`\n\n4.  **Name the Product:**\n    *   The structure is `HO-CH(Ph)-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂`.\n    *   The main chain is a pentene chain. Numbering from the end that gives the alcohol (the highest priority functional group) the lowest number:\n        `HO-CH(Ph)(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)=C(4)(CH₃)-CH₃(5)`\n    *   The IUPAC name is **`4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol`**. This matches the product A in options A and B.\n\n### Reaction B: `...hexamethyl...dimethylene...hexahydro... + Heat`\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:**\n    *   The reactant is a complex polycyclic hydrocarbon with `diene` character (indicated by `dimethylene`).\n    *   The condition is \"Heat\". The problem description explicitly mentions the **Cope rearrangement**, which is a thermal [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of a 1,5-diene.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Nature of the Rearrangement:**\n    *   A Cope rearrangement is an **isomerization**. This means the product has the exact same molecular formula as the starting material. It neither adds nor removes atoms.\n    *   Consequently, the degree of saturation of the product must be the same as that of the starting material.\n\n3.  **Compare Starting Material and Product Options:**\n    *   The name of the starting material includes the descriptor **`hexahydro`**, indicating the presence of six \"extra\" hydrogen atoms compared to a fully aromatic parent system.\n    *   The options for product B are:\n        *   A `tetrahydro` derivative: `...5,9,10,11-tetrahydro...` (in options A and C). This product is more unsaturated (has two fewer hydrogens) than the starting material. This would require a dehydrogenation/oxidation step, which is not a simple rearrangement.\n        *   A `hexahydro` derivative: `...5,9,9a,10,11,11a-hexahydro...` (in options B and D). This product has the same degree of saturation as the starting material.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction B:**\n    *   Since the Cope rearrangement is an isomerization, the product must be the **`hexahydro`** derivative.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\n*   Product A is `4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol`.\n*   Product B is the `hexahydro` isomer, `2,3,4,6,7,8-hexamethyl-5,9,9a,10,11,11a-hexahydro-1H-benzo[3,4]azuleno[1,8,7,6-cdef]fluorene`.\n\nMatching these two products with the given choices leads to option B.\n\n```python\ndef solve_rearrangement():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes two organic reactions and determines the major products.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Analysis for Reaction A\n    # The reaction is a Wittig rearrangement.
