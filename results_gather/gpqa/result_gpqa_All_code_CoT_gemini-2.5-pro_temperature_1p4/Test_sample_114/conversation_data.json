    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:** First, we'll calculate the total energy of the system before the collision. The energy of a particle is given by `E = γ * m * c^2`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `m` is the rest mass, and `c` is the speed of light. After the collision, this total energy is converted into two photons of equal energy. We can use this to find the energy of each individual photon.\n2.  **Apply Conservation of Momentum:** Next, we'll calculate the total initial momentum of the system. The momentum of a particle is `p = sqrt(E^2/c^2 - m^2*c^2)`. Since the electron and positron are moving in opposite directions, we will find the net momentum along the horizontal axis.\n3.  **Relate to Final State:** The total initial momentum must be equal to the total final momentum of the two photons. Since the initial momentum perpendicular to the axis of motion is zero, the final perpendicular momenta of the two photons must be equal and opposite. This means they are emitted at symmetric angles, `+θ` and `-θ`, with respect to the horizontal axis. The momentum of a photon is `p = E / c`.\n4.  **Solve for the Angle:** By equating the initial horizontal momentum with the sum of the horizontal components of the photons' momenta, we can derive an equation for `cos(θ)`. We can then solve for `θ`. The angle *between* the two photons will be `2θ`.\n\nLet's execute this plan using Python. We will work in units where the electron mass `m_e = 1` and the speed of light `c = 1`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Calculate total initial energy and the energy of each photon.\n# In natural units (m_e = 1, c = 1), Energy E = gamma.\ngamma_electron = 4\ngamma_positron = 2\n\n# Total initial energy is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron.\nE_initial_total = gamma_electron + gamma_positron\n\n# The two resulting photons have equal energy.\nE_photon = E_initial_total / 2\n\n# Step 2: Calculate total initial momentum.\n# Momentum p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2) = sqrt(gamma^2 - 1).\n# Electron moves left-to-right (+ direction).\np_electron = math.sqrt(gamma_electron**2 - 1)\n# Positron moves right-to-left (- direction).\np_positron = -math.sqrt(gamma_positron**2 - 1)\n\n# Total initial momentum.\np_initial_total = p_electron + p_positron\n\n# Step 3: Relate to the final state using momentum conservation.\n# For a photon, momentum p_photon = E_photon.\n# Let the angle of one photon with the horizontal axis be theta.\n# The total final momentum in the horizontal direction is 2 * p_photon * cos(theta).\n# p_initial_total = 2 * E_photon * cos(theta)\n\n# Step 4: Solve for the angle.\n# cos(theta) = p_initial_total / (2 * E_photon)\ncos_theta = p_initial_total / (2 * E_photon)\n\n# Calculate theta in radians.\ntheta_rad = math.acos(cos_theta)\n\n# The total angle between the two photons is 2 * theta.\n# Convert the final angle to degrees.\nangle_between_photons_deg = 2 * theta_rad * (180 / math.pi)\n\n# Print the results and the final choice\nprint(f\"Total initial energy (in units of m_e*c^2): {E_initial_total}\")\nprint(f\"Energy of each photon (in units of m_e*c^2): {E_photon}\")\nprint(f\"Total initial momentum (in units of m_e*c): {p_initial_total:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Cosine of the angle theta: {cos_theta:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Angle theta (degrees): {math.degrees(theta_rad):.2f}\")\nprint(f\"The angle between the directions of the photons is approximately: {round(angle_between_photons_deg)} degrees.\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\nprint(\"A) 138\")\nprint(\"B) 96\")\nprint(\"C) 74\")\nprint(\"D) 172\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value is closest to 138.\")\nprint(\"The final answer is A\")\n\n<<<A>>>\n```"
