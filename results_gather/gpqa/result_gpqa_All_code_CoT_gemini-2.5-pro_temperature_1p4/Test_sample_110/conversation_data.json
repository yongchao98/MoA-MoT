    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n**Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is a Michael addition. The reaction involves the conjugate addition of a nucleophile (an enolate) to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound.\n2.  **Identify the reactants:**\n    *   **Nucleophile precursor:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one is a ketone.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically hindered base. It will deprotonate the ketone at an α-carbon to form an enolate.\n    *   **Michael acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt) is an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n3.  **Determine the site of deprotonation:** The ketone has two α-carbons, C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is substituted with an ethyl and a methyl group, so it has no α-hydrogens.\n    *   C6 is substituted with a methyl group and has one α-hydrogen.\n    *   Therefore, the base must deprotonate at C6 to form the enolate.\n4.  **Determine the product structure (A):** The enolate formed at C6 attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexane ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate moiety. After protonation, the added group is -CH₂-CH₂-COOEt.\n5.  **Name the product (A):** The resulting molecule is named as a substituted propanoate. The cyclohexyl ring is the substituent. Numbering the ring for the substituent name starts at the point of attachment (the original C6).\n    *   C1 (attachment point, original C6) has a methyl group.\n    *   C2 (original C1) has the keto group (=O).\n    *   C3 (original C2) has an ethyl and a methyl group.\n    *   This gives the substituent name: (3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl).\n    *   Thus, the full product name is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n**Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with KOH**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is also a Michael addition. It involves the addition of a carbanion stabilized by a nitro group to an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n2.  **Identify the reactants:**\n    *   **Nucleophile precursor:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂). The protons on the carbon adjacent to the nitro group (the α-carbon) are acidic.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a strong base that will deprotonate the α-carbon.\n    *   **Michael acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN), also known as crotononitrile.\n3.  **Determine the product structure (B):** The carbanion formed at the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. A new carbon-carbon bond forms.\n    *   Nucleophile: CH₃-CH₂-CH⁻-NO₂\n    *   Attack: [CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)]⁻ attacks the β-carbon of CH₃-CH=CH-CN.\n    *   The resulting structure is CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN.\n4.  **Name the product (B):** The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the parent chain is a hexanenitrile.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   The chain is CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6).\n    *   There is a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   Thus, the full product name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Product A is ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate.\n*   Product B is 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the two chemical reactions and selects the correct option.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Analysis of Reaction 1\n    # Reactants: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with base t-BuOK.\n    # This is a Michael addition.\n    # The base t-BuOK deprotonates the ketone at the only available alpha-position, C6.\n    # The resulting enolate attacks the beta-carbon of ethyl acrylate.\n    product_A_name = \"ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\"\n\n    # Analysis of Reaction 2\n    # Reactants: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with base KOH.\n    # This is also a Michael addition.\n    # The base KOH deprotonates the acidic alpha-carbon of 1-nitropropane.\n    # The resulting carbanion attacks the beta-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n    # The structure formed is CH3-CH2-CH(NO2)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN.\n    # IUPAC name: 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile.\n    product_B_name = \"3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\"\n\n    options = {\n        'A': f\"A = {product_A_name}, B = {product_B_name}\",\n        'B': \"A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\",\n        'C': \"A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\",\n        'D': \"A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\"\n    }\n\n    # Compare the derived product names with the given options.\n    correct_option = 'A'\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step derivation:\")\n    print(\"1.
