    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Apply Conservation of Energy**: The core principle for solving this problem is the conservation of energy. The total energy of the system before the annihilation must equal the total energy after.\n2.  **Calculate Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$)**: The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible. We assume the proton is also at rest. Therefore, the total initial energy is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton. The rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.27 \\text{ MeV}$, and an antiproton has the same rest mass.\n    $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$.\n3.  **Calculate Final Energy ($E_{final}$)**: The annihilation produces four particles (two $A^+$ and two $A^-$), all with the same mass $m_A$. By symmetry, we can assume the energy is distributed equally among them. The total energy of a single relativistic particle is $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor and depends on the particle's velocity. The total final energy is thus $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n4.  **Equate and Solve for Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**: By setting $E_{initial} = E_{final}$, we get $2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$. We can solve this equation for $\\gamma$.\n5.  **Calculate Velocity ($v$)**: The Lorentz factor is defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$. Once we have the value for $\\gamma$, we can rearrange this formula to solve for the velocity $v$ as a fraction of the speed of light, $c$. The result, often denoted as $\\beta = v/c$, can be calculated using $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the velocity of particle A.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_annihilation_velocity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the velocity of particle A from the annihilation of a proton and an antiproton.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given values\n    m_p_c2 = 938.27  # Rest energy of a proton in MeV\n    m_A_c2 = 300.0   # Rest energy of particle A in MeV\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the total initial energy.\n    # We assume the initial proton and antiproton are effectively at rest.\n    E_initial = 2 * m_p_c2\n\n    # Step 2: By conservation of energy, the total final energy is equal to the initial energy.\n    E_final = E_initial\n\n    # Step 3: The final energy is distributed equally among the four 'A' particles.\n    # Calculate the total energy of a single particle A.\n    E_A = E_final / 4\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma) for particle A.\n    # The total energy of a particle is E = gamma * m * c^2.\n    gamma = E_A / m_A_c2\n\n    # Step 5: Calculate the velocity ratio beta (v/c) from the Lorentz factor.\n    # beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\n    if gamma < 1:\n        # This case is physically impossible as it would mean the rest mass\n        # of the products is greater than the initial energy.\n        print(\"Error: The process is not energetically possible with the given masses.\")\n        return\n\n    beta = math.sqrt(1 - 1 / gamma**2)\n    velocity = beta\n\n    # Print the result and the available choices\n    print(f\"The calculated velocity of particle A is {velocity:.3f}c.\")\n    print(\"\\nPlease select from the following options:\")\n    print(\"A) 0.77c\")\n    print(\"B) 0.91c\")\n    print(\"C) 0.96c\")\n    print(\"D) 0.86c\")\n\nsolve_annihilation_velocity()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
