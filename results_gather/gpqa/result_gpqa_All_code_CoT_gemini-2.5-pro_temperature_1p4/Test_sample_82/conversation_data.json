    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Calculate the new concentration of acetic acid** after it's diluted with water. The total volume becomes the sum of the initial acid volume and the added water volume.\n2.  **Calculate the pH at 25% titration.** At this point, the solution is a buffer. 25% of the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (`pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid])`) is perfect for this. I'll first calculate pKa from the given Ka.\n3.  **Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.** At this point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, and the solution only contains its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). This ion will hydrolyze in water, producing OH⁻ ions and making the solution basic. I will:\n    *   Determine the total volume of the solution.\n    *   Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion.\n    *   Find the base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate using the relation `Kw = Ka * Kb`.\n    *   Set up an equilibrium calculation to find the concentration of OH⁻.\n    *   Calculate pOH and then convert it to pH using `pH = 14 - pOH`.\n4.  **Compare the two calculated pH values** to the given options to find the correct answer.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given Information ---\nvol_acid_initial_cm3 = 20.00\nconc_acid_initial = 0.05  # M\nvol_water_added_cm3 = 20.00\nconc_NaOH = 0.1          # M\nKa_acetic_acid = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14 # Ion product of water at 25 °C\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution ---\n# Total volume after dilution\nvol_total_diluted_cm3 = vol_acid_initial_cm3 + vol_water_added_cm3\n# Using the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2\nconc_acid_diluted = (conc_acid_initial * vol_acid_initial_cm3) / vol_total_diluted_cm3\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate pH at 25% titration ---\n# The titration creates a buffer of acetic acid (HA) and acetate (A-).\n# We use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\npKa = -math.log10(Ka_acetic_acid)\n\n# At 25% titration, 25% of HA has become A-, and 75% remains as HA.\n# The ratio [A-]/[HA] is 25/75 or 1/3.\nratio_at_25_percent = 0.25 / 0.75\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(ratio_at_25_percent)\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculate pH at the equivalence point ---\n# At the equivalence point, all acetic acid is converted to acetate (CH3COO-).\n# First, find the moles of acetic acid we started with (after dilution).\nvol_total_diluted_L = vol_total_diluted_cm3 / 1000\nmoles_acid = conc_acid_diluted * vol_total_diluted_L\n\n# Find the volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point.\n# M_acid * V_acid = M_base * V_base => moles_acid = M_base * V_base\nvol_NaOH_added_L = moles_acid / conc_NaOH\n\n# The total volume at the equivalence point is the diluted acid volume plus the added NaOH volume.\nvol_final_at_equivalence_L = vol_total_diluted_L + vol_NaOH_added_L\n\n# The concentration of the acetate ion at the equivalence point.\n# The moles of acetate are equal to the initial moles of acid.\nconc_acetate_at_equivalence = moles_acid / vol_final_at_equivalence_L\n\n# Acetate hydrolyzes: CH3COO- + H2O <=> CH3COOH + OH-\n# We need Kb for acetate: Ka * Kb = Kw\nKb_acetate = Kw / Ka_acetic_acid\n\n# We can find [OH-] using the approximation Kb = [OH-]^2 / [acetate]\n# So, [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [acetate])\nconc_OH_at_equivalence = math.sqrt(Kb_acetate * conc_acetate_at_equivalence)\n\n# Now, calculate pOH and then pH.\npOH_at_equivalence = -math.log10(conc_OH_at_equivalence)\npH_at_equivalence = 14.00 - pOH_at_equivalence\n\n# --- Final Output ---\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_at_equivalence:.2f}\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing these values to the options:\")\nprint(\"A) 4.73; 7.00\")\nprint(\"B) 4.57; 6.92\")\nprint(\"C) 3.17; 6.73\")\nprint(\"D) 4.26; 8.52\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated values match option D.\")\n<<<D>>>\n```"
