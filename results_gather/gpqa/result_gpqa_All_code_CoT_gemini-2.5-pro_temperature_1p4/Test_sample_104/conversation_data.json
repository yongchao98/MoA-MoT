    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Star's Properties**: We are given the star's effective temperature (`T_eff`), the temperature difference of the spots (`T_diff`), and the filling factor of the spots on one hemisphere (`f`).\n2.  **Calculate Spot Temperature**: Determine the absolute temperature of the dark spots by subtracting the temperature difference from the star's effective temperature.\n3.  **Model Rotational Brightness Variation**: The star's brightness changes as it rotates.\n    *   **Maximum Brightness (`F_max`)**: This occurs when the completely unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The observed flux is proportional to `T_eff^4` (from the Stefan-Boltzmann law, F ∝ T⁴).\n    *   **Minimum Brightness (`F_min`)**: This happens when the hemisphere covered in spots faces the observer. This hemisphere's total flux is a weighted average of the flux from the hot photosphere and the cooler spots. The flux is proportional to `(1-f) * T_eff^4 + f * T_spot^4`.\n4.  **Calculate the Signal Amplitude**: The amplitude of the brightness variation is the relative difference between the maximum and minimum flux: `Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`. By substituting the proportionalities from the previous step, this simplifies to `Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4)`.\n5.  **Model the Exoplanet Transit Signal**: The drop in brightness caused by a transiting exoplanet is equal to the ratio of the planet's disk area to the star's disk area. This is given by the formula `Transit Depth = (R_planet / R_star)^2`.\n6.  **Equate and Solve**: To find the equivalent planet size, we set the amplitude from the spotted star equal to the transit depth of the hypothetical planet: `(R_planet / R_star)^2 = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4)`. We then solve for the relative radius, `R_planet / R_star`, by taking the square root.\n7.  **Compare to Options**: Finally, we will compare the calculated value with the given choices to find the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the star's and spots' properties.\nT_eff = 6000.0  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin.\nT_diff = 1000.0 # Temperature difference of the spots in Kelvin.\nf = 0.20        # Filling factor of spots on the active hemisphere.\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the temperature of the spots.\nT_spot = T_eff - T_diff\n\n# Step 3 & 4: Calculate the amplitude of the photometric signal due to rotational modulation.\n# The relative flux drop (amplitude) is given by f * (1 - (T_spot/T_eff)^4).\n# This represents the fractional brightness difference between the unspotted and spotted hemispheres.\namplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\n\n# Step 5: The amplitude of a signal produced by a transiting exoplanet\n# is approximately (R_planet / R_star)^2.\n# Step 6: Equate the two signals to find the equivalent planet's relative radius.\n# (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = amplitude\nRpl_Rstar = math.sqrt(amplitude)\n\n# Print the result and the provided options for comparison.\nprint(\"To produce the same amplitude signal, the radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the star's radius (Rpl/Rstar) should be:\")\nprint(f\"Calculated value: {Rpl_Rstar:.4f}\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this to the given choices:\")\nprint(\"A) ~0.11\")\nprint(\"B) ~0.07\")\nprint(\"C) ~0.39\")\nprint(\"D) ~0.32\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value is approximately 0.32.\")\n\n<<<D>>>\n```"
