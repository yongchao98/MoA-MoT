    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an O-H stretch, specifically from a carboxylic acid due to its significant broadness caused by hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is typical for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch.\n    *   A strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicates a C=C (alkene) double bond.\n    *   The combination of a broad O-H and a C=O peak strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks for vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond, which is consistent with the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic indicator of the [COOH]⁺ fragment. This provides strong evidence for a carboxylic acid.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Chemical Formulas:**\n    *   From the analysis, we know the compound must contain a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which has two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H10O) and B (C6H12O), as they only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We also know the compound contains a C=C double bond. Let's calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for the remaining options to see which one can accommodate both a carboxylic acid (which has one degree of unsaturation from the C=O bond) and an alkene (which has a second degree of unsaturation from the C=C bond). The formula for DoU is `(2C + 2 - H) / 2`.\n\n    *   **For C) C6H12O2:**\n        *   DoU = (2 * 6 + 2 - 12) / 2 = (14 - 12) / 2 = 1.\n        *   A DoU of 1 can only account for the C=O bond in the carboxylic acid. It cannot account for an additional C=C bond.\n\n    *   **For D) C6H10O2:**\n        *   DoU = (2 * 6 + 2 - 10) / 2 = (14 - 10) / 2 = 2.\n        *   A DoU of 2 perfectly matches the presence of one C=O bond (in the acid) and one C=C bond (the alkene).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** All spectral evidence points towards an unsaturated carboxylic acid with the formula C6H10O2.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_dou(C, H):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation for a formula C_x H_y O_z.\"\"\"\n    return (2 * C + 2 - H) / 2\n\ndef analyze_compound():\n    \"\"\"Analyzes the spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the Spectral Data\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"FTIR Analysis:\")\n    print(\"- Broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 -> O-H stretch (likely carboxylic acid)\")\n    print(\"- Strong peak at 1700 cm^-1 -> C=O stretch (carbonyl)\")\n    print(\"- Strong peak at 1650 cm^-1 -> C=C stretch (alkene)\")\n    print(\"Conclusion: The compound contains a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an alkene (C=C).\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n1H NMR Analysis:\")\n    print(\"- Peaks for vinyl-hydrogens confirm the C=C double bond.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nMass Spectrometry Analysis:\")\n    print(\"- Fragment at m/z = 45 is characteristic of the [COOH]+ fragment, confirming a carboxylic acid.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Evaluating the Options\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"Summary of requirements:\")\n    print(\"1.
