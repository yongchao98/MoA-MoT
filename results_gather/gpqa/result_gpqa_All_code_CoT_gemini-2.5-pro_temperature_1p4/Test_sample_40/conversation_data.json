    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference**: We have two frames of reference.\n    *   The **laboratory frame (S)**, where the observer is at rest.\n    *   The **glass frame (S')**, which is moving with velocity `v` relative to the laboratory frame. The glass is at rest in this frame.\n\n2.  **Determine the Speed of Light in the Glass Frame (S')**: The refractive index `n` of a medium is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium (`u'`). So, `n = c / u'`.\n    This means the speed of light as measured within the rest frame of the glass is `u' = c / n`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula**: We cannot simply add the velocities (`u' + v`) due to the principles of special relativity. We must use Einstein's velocity addition formula. For objects moving in the same direction, the formula is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n    where:\n    *   `u` is the speed of the light beam as seen by the observer in the laboratory frame (S).\n    *   `u'` is the speed of the light beam in the moving glass frame (S').\n    *   `v` is the speed of the glass frame (S') relative to the laboratory frame (S).\n    *   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\n4.  **Substitute the Known Values and Simplify**: We will substitute `u' = c / n` and the given value `c = 1` into the velocity addition formula and simplify the expression to find `u`.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to perform this symbolic derivation.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_light_speed_in_moving_medium():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the speed of light in a moving medium relative to a stationary observer\n    using the principles of special relativity.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the symbolic variables\n    v, n, c, u_prime = sympy.symbols('v n c u_prime')\n\n    # Step 2: Define the speed of light in the rest frame of the glass (S').\n    # u' = c / n\n    speed_in_glass_frame = c / n\n\n    # Step 3: Use the relativistic velocity addition formula.\n    # u = (u' + v) / (1 + u' * v / c^2)\n    # We substitute u' with c/n.\n    speed_in_lab_frame = (speed_in_glass_frame + v) / (1 + (speed_in_glass_frame * v) / c**2)\n\n    # Step 4: The problem states to take the speed of light in vacuum c = 1.\n    # Substitute c=1 into the expression.\n    final_expression_symbolic = speed_in_lab_frame.subs(c, 1)\n\n    # Step 5: Simplify the resulting algebraic expression.\n    simplified_expression = sympy.simplify(final_expression_symbolic)\n\n    # Step 6: Print the derived formula and identify the correct choice.\n    print(f\"The relativistic velocity addition formula is: u = (u' + v) / (1 + u' * v / c^2)\")\n    print(f\"The speed of light in the glass's rest frame is u' = c/n.\")\n    print(f\"Substituting u' and c=1, the formula for the observed speed u becomes: {simplified_expression}\")\n    \n    choices = {\n        'A': '(1+n*v)/(n+v)',\n        'B': '1',\n        'C': '(1-n*v)/(n+v)',\n        'D': '(1+n*v)/(n-v)'\n    }\n    \n    # Let's format our result to match one of the choices\n    # simplified_expression is (n*v + 1)/(n + v), which matches choice A's structure\n    final_choice = 'A'\n    \n    print(\"\\nComparing the result with the given options:\")\n    print(f\"A) {choices['A']}\")\n    print(f\"B) {choices['B']}\")\n    print(f\"C) {choices['C']}\")\n    print(f\"D) {choices['D']}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe simplified expression (1 + n*v)/(n + v) matches option {final_choice}.\")\n\nsolve_light_speed_in_moving_medium()\nprint(\"<<<A>>>\")\n```"
