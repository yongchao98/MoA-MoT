    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main objective is to calculate the entropy of a supermassive black hole given its angular size and distance.\n2.  **Gather Necessary Formulas:**\n    *   **Small-Angle Formula:** To find the physical radius of the black hole from its angular size, we use the formula `r_s = (θ_rad * d) / 2`, where `r_s` is the Schwarzschild radius, `θ_rad` is the angular size in radians, and `d` is the distance.\n    *   **Area of Event Horizon:** The event horizon is a sphere, so its area `A` is given by `A = 4 * π * r_s^2`.\n    *   **Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy:** The entropy `S` of the black hole is given by the formula `S = (k_B * A) / (4 * l_p^2)`, where `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant and `l_p` is the Planck length.\n3.  **Unit Conversion:** The given values are not in standard SI units. We need to convert:\n    *   Distance `d` from parsecs to meters.\n    *   Angular size `θ` from degrees to radians.\n4.  **Calculation:**\n    *   First, convert the given distance and angular size to SI units (meters and radians).\n    *   Use these values to calculate the Schwarzschild radius `r_s`.\n    *   Calculate the area of the event horizon `A`.\n    *   Finally, use the area and the physical constants (`k_B`, `l_p`) to compute the entropy `S`.\n5.  **Compare and Conclude:** Compare the calculated order of magnitude of the entropy with the given options to find the correct answer.\n\nI will now implement this plan in Python.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the given values and physical constants\nd_parsec = 10**10  # distance in parsecs\ntheta_deg = 10**-17 # angular size in degrees\n\n# Physical constants\nparsec_to_m = 3.086e16  # meters per parsec\nk_B = 1.38e-23        # Boltzmann constant in J/K\nl_p = 1.616e-35       # Planck length in m\npi = math.pi\n\n# Step 2: Convert units to SI\n# Convert distance from parsecs to meters\nd_m = d_parsec * parsec_to_m\n\n# Convert angular size from degrees to radians\ntheta_rad = theta_deg * (pi / 180)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the Schwarzschild radius (r_s)\n# The diameter of the event horizon is D = theta_rad * d_m\n# The radius is r_s = D / 2\nr_s = (theta_rad * d_m) / 2\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the area of the event horizon (A)\nA = 4 * pi * r_s**2\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy (S)\n# S = (k_B * A) / (4 * l_p^2)\nS = (k_B * A) / (4 * l_p**2)\n\n# Step 6: Print the result and the options\nprint(f\"The calculated entropy of the black hole is approximately: {S:.2e} J/K\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this to the options:\")\nprint(\"A) 10^65 J/K\")\nprint(\"B) 10^62 J/K\")\nprint(\"C) 10^66 J/K\")\nprint(\"D) 10^59 J/K\")\n\n# The calculated order of magnitude is 10^62.\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated order of magnitude matches option B.\")\n<<<B>>>\n```"
