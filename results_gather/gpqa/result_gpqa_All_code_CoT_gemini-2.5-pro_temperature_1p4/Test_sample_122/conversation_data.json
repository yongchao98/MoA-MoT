    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Identify Knowns:**\n    *   Relative velocity between the ejecta and the Galaxy, `v = 60,000` km/s.\n    *   Time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame (proper time), `t0 = 50` s.\n    *   The speed of light, `c = 300,000` km/s.\n\n2.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame. Let's call this distance `d`.\n\n3.  **Apply Physics Principles:**\n    *   The time measured in the Galaxy's frame (`t`) will be different from the time measured in the ejecta's frame (`t0`) due to time dilation. An observer in the Galaxy's frame will measure a longer time interval.\n    *   The formula for time dilation is: `t = t0 / sqrt(1 - (v^2 / c^2))`.\n    *   Once we find the time `t` in the Galaxy's frame, we can calculate the distance traveled in that same frame using the standard formula: `d = v * t`.\n\n4.  **Calculation Steps:**\n    *   First, we'll calculate the time `t` that has passed in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n    *   Then, we'll use this time `t` to calculate the distance `d`.\n    *   Combining the formulas: `d = v * (t0 / sqrt(1 - (v^2 / c^2)))`.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the known values from the problem\n# Velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy (km/s)\nv = 60000\n# Time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame (s)\nt0 = 50\n# Speed of light (km/s)\nc = 300000\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the time 't' in the Galaxy's reference frame using the time dilation formula.\n# The term (1 - (v**2 / c**2))**0.5 is the reciprocal of the Lorentz factor.\ntime_dilation_factor = math.sqrt(1 - (v**2 / c**2))\nt_galaxy = t0 / time_dilation_factor\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n# Distance = velocity * time (measured in the same frame)\ndistance_galaxy = v * t_galaxy\n\n# Print the options\nprint(\"The options are:\")\nprint(\"A) 3 060 000 km.\")\nprint(\"B) 2 880 000 km.\")\nprint(\"C) 3 000 000 km.\")\nprint(\"D) 2 940 000 km.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\n# Print the final calculated distance\nprint(f\"The calculated distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame is: {int(round(distance_galaxy))} km.\")\n# The result is approximately 3,061,862 km, which is closest to option A.\n```\n<<<A>>>"
