    "Here is my thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** The core of the task is to understand the stereochemical outcome of two reactions and then determine how the resulting mixture of molecules would be separated by two different types of High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. The \"(E)\" designation (from German *entgegen*, \"opposite\") means it's a *trans*-alkene. It's a symmetric molecule (propyl group on each side of the double bond).\n    *   **Reagents:**\n        1.  `mCPBA`: This is a peroxy acid that performs epoxidation (adds a single oxygen atom across the double bond to form a three-membered ring called an epoxide). Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen adds to the same face of the double bond. For a *trans*-alkene, this stereospecific reaction produces a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is achiral, attacking from either the top or bottom face results in a pair of enantiomers: (4R,5R)-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-epoxyoctane. The result is a racemic mixture of these two epoxides.\n        2.  `Aqueous Acid (H₃O⁺)`: This reagent catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The water molecule acts as a nucleophile. This ring-opening is an *anti*-addition, meaning the water molecule attacks from the side opposite to the epoxide's oxygen.\n    *   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 1:**\n        *   Let's trace one enantiomer of the epoxide, say (4R,5R)-epoxyoctane.\n        *   Acid-catalyzed opening involves an Sₙ2-like attack by water at one of the epoxide carbons. Because the molecule is symmetric, attack at C4 or C5 is equally likely.\n        *   Attack at C5 inverts the configuration at C5 (R becomes S), while C4 remains R. The product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   If we had started with the other epoxide enantiomer, (4S,5S), the attack would yield the same (4R,5S)-diol.\n        *   The resulting product, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a *meso* compound.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The product is a single *meso* compound.\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. The \"(Z)\" designation (from German *zusammen*, \"together\") means it's a *cis*-alkene. This is also a symmetric, achiral molecule.\n    *   **Reagents:** Same as Reaction 1.\n    *   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 2:**\n        *   The *syn*-addition of the epoxide to a *cis*-alkene results in a *cis*-epoxide. Because the starting alkene is achiral and has a plane of symmetry, the resulting epoxide is a single *meso* compound: (meso)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n        *   The subsequent *anti*-addition (ring-opening) of water to this *meso*-epoxide will produce a pair of enantiomers.\n        *   Attack at one carbon (e.g., C4) gives one enantiomer, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Attack at the other carbon (C5) gives the other enantiomer, (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Since attack at either carbon is equally probable, the result is a 1:1 mixture of these two enantiomers, which is a *racemic mixture*.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The product is a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric diols.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Final Product Mixture:**\n    *   The chemist combines the products. The mixture contains:\n        *   One *meso* diol (from Reaction 1).\n        *   A pair of enantiomeric diols, (R,R) and (S,S) (from Reaction 2).\n    *   In total, there are **three distinct stereoisomers** in the flask.\n\n5.  **Predict the HPLC Results:**\n    *   **Standard (Achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates molecules based on physical properties like polarity.\n        *   Enantiomers (like the (R,R) and (S,S) diols) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n        *   Diastereomers (like the *meso* diol compared to the enantiomeric pair) have different physical properties and will be separated.\n        *   Therefore, we will see **two peaks**: one for the *meso* compound and one for the co-eluting pair of enantiomers.\n    *   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n        *   It can separate diastereomers.\n        *   It can also separate enantiomers.\n        *   Therefore, all three unique stereoisomers will be resolved.\n        *   We will see **three peaks**: one for the *meso* compound, one for the (R,R) enantiomer, and one for the (S,S) enantiomer.\n\n6.  **Match with the Options:**\n    *   Standard HPLC: 2 peaks\n    *   Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks\n    *   This matches option **B**.\n\n7.  **Formulate the Python Code:** I will write a script that models this logic. It will define the products of each reaction, combine them, and then count the number of expected peaks for each HPLC type based on the rules of chromatography. The code will serve as a computational walkthrough of the chemical reasoning.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1. Define the products from each stereospecific reaction.\n#    - Reaction 1: (E)-alkene undergoes anti-dihydroxylation to form a meso compound.\n#    - Reaction 2: (Z)-alkene undergoes anti-dihydroxylation to form a racemic mixture (a pair of enantiomers).\n# 2. Combine the products into a single list representing the final mixture.\n# 3. Analyze the mixture with a standard (achiral) HPLC.\n#    - Achiral HPLC separates diastereomers but not enantiomers.\n#    - We will count the number of unique diastereomeric forms.
