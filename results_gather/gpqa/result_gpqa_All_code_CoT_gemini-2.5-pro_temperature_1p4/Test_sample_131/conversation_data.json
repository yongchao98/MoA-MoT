    "Here is a step-by-step thinking process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Analyze Individual Compounds:** Determine the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four candidate compounds based on their chemical structure and molecular symmetry. This includes predicting the number of signals, their integration ratios, and splitting patterns for both aromatic and aliphatic protons.\n2.  **Analyze the Mixture's Spectrum:** Carefully examine the provided NMR data for the 1:1 mixture. The key features are the number of signals and their integration ratios in both the aromatic and aliphatic regions.\n3.  **Evaluate Each Option:** For each pair of compounds listed in the options, combine their individual predicted spectra (assuming a 1:1 molar ratio) and compare the result to the observed spectrum of the mixture.\n4.  **Identify the Match:** The correct option will be the pair whose combined spectrum perfectly matches the given data, specifically two 1:1 aromatic singlets and three 2:1:1 aliphatic singlets.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom io import StringIO\n\n# A helper function to pretty-print the analysis steps\ndef analyze_and_conclude():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function performs a step-by-step analysis of the chemistry problem\n    and prints the reasoning to identify the correct compounds.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Predicted 1H NMR Spectra for Individual Compounds\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"We will analyze each compound based on its symmetry.\")\n    print(\"\\na) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):\")\n    print(\"   - Possesses high symmetry.
