    "Of course. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code.\n\n### My thinking process\n\n1.  **Analyze the Goal:** The main goal is to find the mass dimension of the coupling constant `κ` from the given interaction Lagrangian `L_int` and determine if the theory described by this interaction is renormalizable.\n\n2.  **Recall Fundamental Principles (Quantum Field Theory):**\n    *   **Action `S`:** The action `S = ∫d⁴x L` must be a dimensionless quantity in natural units (where `ħ = c = 1`).\n    *   **Mass Dimension of `d⁴x`:** Spacetime volume `d⁴x` has a mass dimension of `[d⁴x] = -4` (since `x` has dimension of length, and in natural units, length is `1/mass`).\n    *   **Mass Dimension of Lagrangian Density `L`:** For the action `S` to be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density `L` must have a mass dimension of `[L] = +4`. This applies to any term in the Lagrangian, including `L_int`.\n    *   **Renormalizability Criterion (Power Counting):** A theory is considered renormalizable by power counting if the mass dimension of its coupling constant `g` is non-negative (`[g] ≥ 0`). If the mass dimension is negative (`[g] < 0`), the theory is non-renormalizable.\n\n3.  **Determine Mass Dimensions of the Fields and Tensors:**\n    *   **Fermion Field `ψ`:** The kinetic term for a fermion is `L_kinetic_fermion =  i * bar(ψ) * ∂_μ * γ^μ * ψ`. We know `[L] = 4` and `[∂_μ] = 1`. Thus, `4 = [bar(ψ)] + [∂_μ] + [ψ]`. Since `[bar(ψ)] = [ψ]`, we have `4 = 2 * [ψ] + 1`, which gives `2 * [ψ] = 3`, so `[ψ] = 3/2`.\n    *   **Electromagnetic Field Strength Tensor `F^(μν)`:** The kinetic term is `L_kinetic_EM = -1/4 * F_(μν) * F^(μν)`. We know `[L] = 4`. Thus, `4 = 2 * [F^(μν)]`, which gives `[F^(μν)] = 2`.\n    *   **Sigma Tensor `σ_(μν)`:** It is defined as `σ_(μν) = (i/2) * [γ_μ, γ_ν]`. The gamma matrices `γ_μ` are dimensionless. Therefore, `σ_(μν)` is also dimensionless, so `[σ_(μν)] = 0`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Mass Dimension of `κ`:**\n    *   The interaction Lagrangian is `L_int = κ * bar(ψ) * σ_(μν) * ψ * F^(μν)`.\n    *   The mass dimension of this term must be 4: `[L_int] = 4`.\n    *   We can write the dimensional equation: `[L_int] = [κ] + [bar(ψ)] + [σ_(μν)] + [ψ] + [F^(μν)]`.\n    *   Substitute the known dimensions: `4 = [κ] + 3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2`.\n    *   Simplify: `4 = [κ] + 3 + 2`.\n    *   Solve for `[κ]`: `4 = [κ] + 5`, which means `[κ] = -1`.\n\n5.  **Assess Renormalizability:**\n    *   The mass dimension of the coupling `κ` is -1.\n    *   According to the power-counting criterion, since `[κ] < 0`, the theory is non-renormalizable.\n\n6.  **Formulate the Final Answer:**\n    *   The mass dimension of `κ` is -1.\n    *   The theory is not renormalizable.\n    *   This corresponds to option B.\n\n7.  **Construct the Python Code:**\n    *   Create variables for the known mass dimensions (`dim_L`, `dim_psi`, `dim_F`, `dim_sigma`).\n    *   Calculate `dim_kappa` based on the dimensional equation.\n    *   Use an `if/else` block to determine renormalizability based on the sign of `dim_kappa`.\n    *   Print all the steps and the final conclusion, leading to the selection of option B.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the known mass dimensions in natural units (ħ=c=1).\n# The action S = ∫d⁴x L must be dimensionless.
