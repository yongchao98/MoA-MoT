    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical law:** The total mass of an eclipsing binary star system is directly proportional to its orbital period and the cube of the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes of its two stars. The formula is `M_total ∝ P * (K_a + K_b)³`, where `M_total` is the total mass of the system, `P` is the orbital period, and `K_a` and `K_b` are the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars. The assumption here is that because the systems are eclipsing, their orbital inclination is approximately 90 degrees, which simplifies the full mass function formula.\n2.  **Define the variables:** I will assign the given values for period (`P`) and radial velocity amplitudes (`K`) to variables for both `system_1` and `system_2`.\n3.  **Calculate the proportional mass for each system:** I will calculate the value of `P * (K_a + K_b)³` for each system. This value isn't the actual mass, but it's proportional to it, which is all we need for a ratio.\n4.  **Compute the ratio:** I will divide the proportional mass of `system_1` by the proportional mass of `system_2`.\n5.  **Output the result:** The final calculated ratio will be printed. I will then match this numerical result to the closest option provided.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1.
