  "question": "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

    "To solve this problem, I will analyze the provided DNA sequence to determine why the GADD45G protein is not being expressed. The most common reasons for such a failure are issues with the start codon, a frameshift mutation, or a premature stop codon.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Define the standard DNA codon table, which translates three-nucleotide codons into their corresponding amino acids. This table will also include the stop codons.\n2.  Take the provided DNA sequence.\n3.  Systematically read the sequence in three-nucleotide chunks (codons), starting from the beginning.\n4.  Translate each codon into an amino acid.\n5.  I will check if any of the codons is a \"stop\" codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). If a stop codon is encountered before the end of the expected protein-coding sequence, it means translation will terminate prematurely.\n6.  Based on this analysis, I will determine the correct reason for the failed protein expression from the given options.\n\nHere is the Python code that performs the translation and identifies the issue:\n\n```python\ndef analyze_protein_expression():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a DNA sequence to find the cause of failed protein expression.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The DNA sequence of the plus strand for the construct\n    dna_sequence = \"ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA\"\n\n    # Standard DNA codon to amino acid mapping\n    codon_table = {\n        'ATA':'I', 'ATC':'I', 'ATT':'I', 'ATG':'M',\n        'ACA':'T', 'ACC':'T', 'ACG':'T', 'ACT':'T',\n        'AAC':'N', 'AAT':'N', 'AAA':'K', 'AAG':'K',\n        'AGC':'S', 'AGT':'S', 'TCA':'S', 'TCC':'S', 'TCG':'S', 'TCT':'S',\n        'AGA':'R', 'AGG':'R', 'CGA':'R', 'CGC':'R', 'CGG':'R', 'CGT':'R',\n        'CTA':'L', 'CTC':'L', 'CTG':'L', 'CTT':'L', 'TTA':'L', 'TTG':'L',\n        'CCA':'P', 'CCC':'P', 'CCG':'P', 'CCT':'P',\n        'CAC':'H', 'CAT':'H', 'CAA':'Q', 'CAG':'Q',\n        'GCA':'A', 'GCC':'A', 'GCG':'A', 'GCT':'A',\n        'GTA':'V', 'GTC':'V', 'GTG':'V', 'GTT':'V',\n        'GCA':'A', 'GCC':'A', 'GCG':'A', 'GCT':'A',\n        'GAC':'D', 'GAT':'D', 'GAA':'E', 'GAG':'E',\n        'GGA':'G', 'GGC':'G', 'GGG':'G', 'GGT':'G',\n        'TTC':'F', 'TTT':'F', 'TGC':'C', 'TGT':'C',\n        'TAC':'Y', 'TAT':'Y', 'TGG':'W',\n        'TAA':'_STOP_', 'TAG':'_STOP_', 'TGA':'_STOP_'\n    }\n\n    protein_sequence = \"\"\n    problem_found = False\n\n    print(\"Analyzing DNA sequence for translation...\")\n    print(f\"DNA Sequence: {dna_sequence}\\n\")\n\n    # Iterate through the sequence by codons (3 bases at a time)\n    for i in range(0, len(dna_sequence), 3):\n        # Ensure we don't read past the end of the sequence\n        if i + 3 > len(dna_sequence):\n            break\n        \n        codon = dna_sequence[i:i+3]\n        amino_acid = codon_table.get(codon, '?') # '?' for unknown codons\n\n        if amino_acid == '_STOP_':\n            print(f\"Analysis Result:\")\n            print(f\"A premature STOP codon ('{codon}') was found at nucleotide position {i+1}.\")\n            print(\"This causes translation to terminate early, preventing the formation of the full-length protein.\")\n            problem_found = True\n            break\n        else:\n            protein_sequence += amino_acid\n            \n    if problem_found:\n        print(f\"\\nTranslated peptide before termination: {protein_sequence}\")\n        print(\"\\nConclusion based on the options:\")\n        print(\"A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. -> Incorrect.
