    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction**\n*   **Dienophile:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated. The simplest example is maleic acid, which dehydrates to form maleic anhydride. The provided NMR data for the anhydride confirms this structure:\n    *   **¹H NMR:** Maleic anhydride is a symmetrical molecule (C₄H₂O₃). The two alkene protons are chemically equivalent, resulting in a single peak. The given shift of 7 ppm is characteristic of vinylic protons adjacent to electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n    *   **¹³C NMR:** There are two types of carbons: two equivalent alkene carbons and two equivalent carbonyl carbons. This results in two peaks. The shifts at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons) are consistent with this structure.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (C₉H₁₄).\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition between the diene and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n*   **Product Formula:** The formula of the product is the sum of the reactants: C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃ = C₁₃H₁₆O₃. This matches the formula given in the problem.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Products and their Stereochemistry**\nThe Diels-Alder reaction typically yields two major stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products.\n*   The **endo product** is usually the major product due to kinetic control arising from favorable secondary orbital interactions. In this isomer, the anhydride group is positioned *syn* (on the same side) to the longest bridge of the bicyclic system. In this specific case, it's *syn* to the C7-methylene bridge.\n*   The **exo product** is the minor product. Here, the anhydride group is *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C7-methylene bridge.\n\nThe problem states a NOESY cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor one. This means we are looking for a spatial proximity that exists in the *endo* isomer but not in the *exo* isomer.\n\n### **Step 3: Assign Proton NMR Signals**\nLet's assign the signals described in the options to the protons in the product structure (1,4,5,6-tetramethyl-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride).\n*   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride part of the molecule (let's call them **Hₐ**). They are adjacent to the bridgehead carbons and the carbonyl groups, which deshields them significantly.\n*   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the two equivalent methyl groups attached to the double bond (**vinylic methyls**). Vinylic methyl protons typically resonate in this region.\n*   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (**bridgehead methyls**). These alkyl protons are relatively shielded.\n*   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This signal belongs to one of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7-methylene bridge. In norbornene systems, the bridge proton that is *anti* to the double bond is typically found around this chemical shift.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze NOESY Correlations in Endo vs. Exo Isomers**\nNOESY spectroscopy shows correlations between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å), regardless of their bonding connectivity.\n*   **Major Product (*endo* isomer):** In this structure, the **Hₐ** protons are on the same face of the molecule as the C7-bridge. Specifically, they are very close to the *anti* proton of the C7 bridge (~1.5 ppm). Therefore, a strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between **Hₐ** and this bridge proton.\n*   **Minor Product (*exo* isomer):** In this structure, the **Hₐ** protons are on the opposite face of the molecule from the C7-bridge. They are now far away from the C7-bridge protons, so the corresponding NOESY cross-peak would be absent or very weak. Instead, the *exo* protons become close to the bridgehead methyl groups (~1.0 ppm).\n\n### **Step 5: Conclusion**\nThe cross-peak that is uniquely present in the major (*endo*) product connects the **Hₐ** protons with the *anti*-C7 bridge proton. Based on our signal assignments, this is a correlation between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**. This corresponds to option D.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_nmr_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the provided chemistry problem about a Diels-Alder reaction and NMR spectroscopy.\n\n    The steps are:\n    1. Identify reactants: Maleic anhydride and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene.\n    2. Identify reaction products: A major 'endo' and a minor 'exo' Diels-Alder adduct.\n    3. Analyze the key difference for NOESY NMR: The problem asks for a cross-peak present in the major (endo) but not the minor (exo) product. This points to a spatial proximity unique to the endo isomer.\n    4. Assign NMR signals to molecular protons:\n       - 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm -> Protons on the anhydride ring (H_a).\n       - 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm -> Vinylic methyl groups.\n       - 6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm -> Bridgehead methyl groups.\n       - 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm -> anti-proton on the C7 methylene bridge.\n    5. Determine the spatial proximity: In the endo isomer, the H_a protons are very close to the anti-C7-bridge proton. This interaction is absent in the exo isomer.\n    6. Match the interaction to the NMR signals: The cross-peak connects the signal for H_a (1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm) and the signal for the anti-C7-bridge proton (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm).\n    7.
