    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial and Final States:** The molecule starts in its fundamental (ground) state, which corresponds to the lowest vibrational and rotational quantum numbers, so `v=0` and `J=0`. The problem asks for the transition to the *next state with the lowest possible energy* via photon absorption. According to the selection rules for rovibrational transitions, `Δv = +1` and `ΔJ = ±1`. Starting from `J=0`, a transition to `J=-1` is impossible, so the only allowed transition is `ΔJ = +1`. Therefore, the final state is `v'=1` and `J'=1`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Energy of the Transition (ΔE):** The energy of a state in the rotation-vibration model is given by `E(v, J) = (v + 1/2)ħω + (ħ² / 2I) * J(J+1)`, where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant, `ω` is the angular frequency, and `I` is the moment of inertia. The energy of the absorbed photon is the difference between the final and initial state energies:\n    `ΔE = E(v=1, J=1) - E(v=0, J=0)`\n    `ΔE = [ (1 + 1/2)ħω + (ħ² / 2I) * 1(1+1) ] - [ (0 + 1/2)ħω + (ħ² / 2I) * 0(0+1) ]`\n    `ΔE = ħω + ħ² / I`\n\n3.  **Calculate Necessary Physical Quantities:**\n    *   **Reduced Mass (μ):** For a diatomic molecule XY, `μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)`. We will need to convert the masses from atomic mass units (amu) to kilograms (kg).\n    *   **Moment of Inertia (I):** For a diatomic molecule, `I = μ * R²`, where `R` is the bond length.\n\n4.  **Calculate Photon Momentum (p):** The energy of a photon is related to its momentum by `E = pc`, where `c` is the speed of light. Therefore, the momentum of the absorbed photon is `p = ΔE / c`.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation and Comparison:** We will implement these formulas in Python, calculate the value of `p`, and compare it to the given options to find the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Constants ---\n# Reduced Planck constant (J*s)\nh_bar = 1.05457e-34\n# Speed of light (m/s)\nc = 2.99792e8\n# Conversion from amu to kg\namu_to_kg = 1.66054e-27\n\n# --- Given values ---\n# Mass of atom X (amu)\nMx_amu = 20\n# Mass of atom Y (amu)\nMy_amu = 2\n# Molecular bond length (m)\nR_m = 2e-10  # 2 angstroms = 2 * 10^-10 m\n# Angular frequency of vibration (rad/s)\nw_rad_s = 4e14\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate Reduced Mass (mu) in kg ---\n# Convert masses to kg\nMx_kg = Mx_amu * amu_to_kg\nMy_kg = My_amu * amu_to_kg\n# Calculate reduced mass\nmu_kg = (Mx_kg * My_kg) / (Mx_kg + My_kg)\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate Moment of Inertia (I) ---\nI = mu_kg * (R_m**2)\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculate the energy of the transition (delta_E) ---\n# The transition is from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=1).\n# The energy of the absorbed photon is delta_E = h_bar*w + h_bar^2 / I\ndelta_E = (h_bar * w_rad_s) + (h_bar**2 / I)\n\n# --- Step 4: Calculate the photon's momentum (p) ---\n# p = E / c\np = delta_E / c\n\n# --- Step 5: Print the results and compare with options ---\nprint(f\"Calculated photon momentum: p = {p:.2e} N*s\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\nprint(f\"A) p = 1.1*10^(-27) N*s\")\nprint(f\"B) p = 1.9*10^(-28) N*s\")\nprint(f\"C) p = 1.4*10^(-28) N*s\")\nprint(f\"D) p = 2.3*10^(-27) N*s\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value is closest to option C.\")\n\n# The final answer based on the calculation.\nfinal_choice = \"C\"\nprint(f\"\\nFinal Answer: {final_choice}\")\n<<<C>>>\n```"
