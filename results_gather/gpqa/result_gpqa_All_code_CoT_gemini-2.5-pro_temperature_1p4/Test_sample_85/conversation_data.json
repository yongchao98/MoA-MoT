    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to solve this organic chemistry problem.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product and Starting Materials:**\n    *   The product in both reactions is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, which is a six-membered lactone (a cyclic ester). The only difference is the stereochemistry at the chiral center, C4, which holds the ethyl group. Reaction 1 gives the (R) enantiomer, and Reaction 2 gives the (S) enantiomer.\n    *   The proposed starting material is `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule has a five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid at one end (C1) and an isobutyl ester at the other (C5). It has a chiral center at C3, which holds the ethyl group.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 1 (Starting material A):**\n    *   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-product`\n    *   **Reagent:** LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent. It is selective. It will reduce esters, aldehydes, and ketones, but it **will not** reduce carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Mechanism:** In the starting material, LiBH4 will reduce the ester group (`-COO-isobutyl`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`), leaving the carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) untouched. This forms a hydroxy acid.\n    *   The subsequent acid workup (H+) causes the alcohol group to react with the carboxylic acid group in an intramolecular reaction called lactonization, forming the six-membered ring product.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** None of the reaction steps (reduction of the ester or lactonization) affect the chiral center at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained. To get the (R)-product, the starting material A must also be (R).\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 2 (Starting material B):**\n    *   **Reaction:** `B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-product`\n    *   **Reagent:** BH3 (Borane) is also a reducing agent, but with different selectivity. Borane is highly effective at reducing carboxylic acids but reduces esters very slowly. Therefore, it will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Mechanism:** In the starting material, BH3 will reduce the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`), leaving the ester group (`-COO-isobutyl`) untouched. This forms a hydroxy ester.\n    *   The subsequent acid workup (H+) causes the newly formed alcohol group to attack the ester group, displacing isobutanol in a process called intramolecular transesterification, which also results in the six-membered lactone product.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** Just like in the first reaction, these steps do not affect the chiral center at C3. The stereochemistry is retained. To get the (S)-product, the starting material B must also be (S).\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   Combining the two results: A must be the (R) enantiomer and B must be the (S) enantiomer.\n    *   This matches option C.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to identify the starting materials for two chemical reactions.\n# Let's analyze each reaction based on the selectivity of the reducing agent.\n\n# The proposed starting material has two reducible groups: a carboxylic acid and an ester.\n# The structure is HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-isobutyl.
