    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the core physics principle:** The problem is about distinguishing two energy levels, each with a finite lifetime. This is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, specifically the energy-time uncertainty relation: ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2. This principle implies that a state with a shorter lifetime (Δt) will have a larger inherent uncertainty, or \"width,\" in its energy (ΔE).\n\n2.  **State the condition for resolution:** To clearly resolve two energy levels, the difference in their energies must be greater than the natural energy width of the broader level. The level with the shorter lifetime will be the broader one.\n\n3.  **Set up the calculation:**\n    *   Define the reduced Planck constant (ħ) in units of eV·s.\n    *   Define the lifetimes for the two states (Δt1 and Δt2).\n    *   Calculate the energy width (ΔE) for each state using the approximate formula ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt.\n    *   Identify the larger of the two energy widths, as this determines the minimum required energy difference for the states to be resolved.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the options:** Compare the given energy difference options with the calculated minimum required difference to find the correct choice.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define constants and given values.\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nh_bar_eVs = 6.582119569e-16\n# Lifetimes of the two states in seconds\nlifetime1 = 1e-9\nlifetime2 = 1e-8\n# The options for energy difference in eV\noptions = {\n    'A': 1e-4,\n    'B': 1e-9,\n    'C': 1e-8,\n    'D': 1e-11\n}\n\n# Step 2: Explain the principle.\nprint(\"According to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, the energy width (uncertainty) of a state is inversely proportional to its lifetime.\")\nprint(\"The relation is approximately ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt.\")\nprint(\"To clearly resolve two energy levels, their energy difference must be greater than the energy width of the broader level.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the energy width for each state.\n# The state with the shorter lifetime will have the larger energy width.\nenergy_width1 = h_bar_eVs / lifetime1\nenergy_width2 = h_bar_eVs / lifetime2\n\nprint(f\"Lifetime of state 1 (Δt1): {lifetime1:.1e} s\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 1 (ΔE1): {energy_width1:.4e} eV\")\nprint(\"\")\nprint(f\"Lifetime of state 2 (Δt2): {lifetime2:.1e} s\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 2 (ΔE2): {energy_width2:.4e} eV\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n\n# Step 4: Determine the minimum energy difference for resolution.\n# The required energy difference must be larger than the broader width.\nrequired_energy_difference = max(energy_width1, energy_width2)\nprint(f\"The broader energy width is {required_energy_difference:.4e} eV (from the state with the shorter lifetime).\")\nprint(\"Therefore, the energy difference between the levels must be greater than this value to be resolvable.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 5: Evaluate the given options.\nprint(\"Evaluating the options:\")\nresult_choice = None\nfor choice, value in options.items():\n    if value > required_energy_difference:\n        print(f\"Option {choice}: {value:.1e} eV > {required_energy_difference:.4e} eV. This is a possible answer.\")\n        result_choice = choice\n        # Since only one option is typically correct, we can break after finding the first valid one.\n        # But for clarity, we will check all.\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {choice}: {value:.1e} eV <= {required_energy_difference:.4e} eV. This is not resolvable.\")\n\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(\"The only option with an energy difference large enough to resolve the two levels is:\")\nprint(result_choice)\nprint(f'<<<A>>>')\n```"
