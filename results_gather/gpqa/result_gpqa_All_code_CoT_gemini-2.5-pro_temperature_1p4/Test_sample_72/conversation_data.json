    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Calculate the relative speed (v_rel):**\n    *   The formula for the relativistic relative velocity of two objects moving in the same direction is `v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`.\n    *   Substitute the given values `v1 = 0.6c` and `v2 = 0.5c` into the formula.\n    *   Solve for `v_rel`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the total energy (E_total):**\n    *   The total energy of a single relativistic particle is given by `E = γ * m0 * c^2`, where `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2 / c^2)` is the Lorentz factor and `m0` is the rest mass.\n    *   The total energy of the system is the sum of the individual energies of the two astronauts: `E_total = E1 + E2`.\n    *   Calculate the Lorentz factor `γ1` for the first astronaut with `v1 = 0.6c`.\n    *   Calculate the energy `E1` for the first astronaut using `E1 = γ1 * (2m) * c^2`.\n    *   Calculate the Lorentz factor `γ2` for the second astronaut with `v2 = 0.5c`.\n    *   Calculate the energy `E2` for the second astronaut using `E2 = γ2 * (3m) * c^2`.\n    *   Add the two energies together: `E_total = E1 + E2`.\n\n3.  **Compare and select the correct option:**\n    *   Compare the calculated values of `v_rel` and `E_total` with the given options (A, B, C, D) to find the match.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the given values in terms of c and m\n# Astronaut 1\nm1_factor = 2  # mass = 2m\nv1_factor = 0.6 # velocity = 0.6c\n\n# Astronaut 2\nm2_factor = 3  # mass = 3m\nv2_factor = 0.5 # velocity = 0.5c\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate the relative speed ---\n# The formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - v1*v2 / c^2)\n# We can calculate the factor by which c is multiplied.\n# v_rel_factor = (v1_factor - v2_factor) / (1 - v1_factor * v2_factor)\nv_rel_numerator = v1_factor - v2_factor\nv_rel_denominator = 1 - (v1_factor * v2_factor)\nv_rel_factor = v_rel_numerator / v_rel_denominator\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate the total energy ---\n# The formula for total energy is E_total = E1 + E2\n# where E = gamma * m0 * c^2 and gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\n# Calculate energy for Astronaut 1\n# gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v1_factor^2)\ngamma1 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v1_factor**2)\n# E1_factor = gamma1 * m1_factor (in units of mc^2)\nE1_factor = gamma1 * m1_factor\n\n# Calculate energy for Astronaut 2\n# gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v2_factor^2)\ngamma2 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v2_factor**2)\n# E2_factor = gamma2 * m2_factor (in units of mc^2)\nE2_factor = gamma2 * m2_factor\n\n# Calculate total energy factor\nE_total_factor = E1_factor + E2_factor\n\n# --- Step 3: Print the results and determine the correct option ---\nprint(f\"Calculated relative speed: {v_rel_factor:.2f}c\")\nprint(f\"Calculated total energy: {E_total_factor:.2f}mc^2\")\n\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\nprint(f\"A) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\")\nprint(f\"B) v_rel = 0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\")\nprint(f\"C) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\")\nprint(f\"D) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\")\n\n# Determine the correct choice\n# We check which option matches our calculated values, rounded to two decimal places.\nv_rel_rounded = round(v_rel_factor, 2)\nE_total_rounded = round(E_total_factor, 2)\n\ncorrect_choice = \"\"\nif v_rel_rounded == 0.14 and E_total_rounded == 5.96:\n    correct_choice = \"D\"\nelif v_rel_rounded == 0.14 and E_total_rounded == 5.00:\n    correct_choice = \"C\"\nelif v_rel_rounded == 0.10 and E_total_rounded == 4.96:\n    correct_choice = \"B\"\nelif v_rel_rounded == 1.10 and E_total_rounded == 1.00:\n    correct_choice = \"A\"\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated values match option {correct_choice}.\")\nprint(f\"<<<{correct_choice}>>>\")\n```"
