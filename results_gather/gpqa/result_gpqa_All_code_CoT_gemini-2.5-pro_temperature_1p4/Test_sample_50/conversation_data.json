    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to present the answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical System and Method:** The problem asks for the potential energy of a system containing a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. This is a classic electrostatics problem that is best solved using the **method of images**.\n\n2.  **The Method of Images:** The core idea is to replace the complex induced charge distribution on the grounded sphere with a simple \"image charge\" `q'` located at a specific point `b` inside the sphere. This image charge, along with the original charge `q`, must create a potential of zero everywhere on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`), mimicking the effect of the grounded conductor.\n\n3.  **Find the Image Charge (q') and its Location (b):** For a point charge `q` at distance `d` from the center of a grounded sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its position `b` (from the center, on the same line as `q`) are given by the standard formulas:\n    *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   Image charge location: `b = R^2 / d`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy (U):** The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. An important concept here is that the interaction energy of a charge with a conductor is half the product of the charge and the potential created by the induced charges at its location.\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Induced Potential (V_induced):** The potential at the location of `q` due to the induced surface charge on the sphere (`V_induced`) is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that same location.\n    *   The distance between the original charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n    *   Substitute `b = R^2 / d`: Distance = `d - (R^2 / d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`.\n\n6.  **Putting it Together:** Now we can calculate `V_induced`:\n    *   `V_induced = k * q' / (distance)`\n    *   `V_induced = k * [-q * (R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n    *   The `d` in the denominator of `q'` and the `d` in the denominator of the distance expression cancel out.\n    *   `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n7.  **Final Energy Calculation:** Substitute `V_induced` back into the energy formula:\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    *   `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:** This final expression `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)` perfectly matches option D.\n\nHere is the Python code that formalizes this conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\n# The options for the potential energy of the system are provided.\noptions = collections.OrderedDict([\n    ('A', 'U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)'),\n    ('B', 'U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)'),\n    ('C', 'U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)'),\n    ('D', 'U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)')\n])\n\n# Print the options for clarity.\nprint(\"The given options are:\")\nfor choice, formula in options.items():\n    print(f\"{choice}) {formula}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 35)\n\n# The correct formula is derived using the method of images, as explained\n# in the step-by-step derivation. The result of this derivation is:\n# U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)\n\n# This formula matches option D.\ncorrect_option = 'D'\n\nprint(f\"The correct formula, derived from physics principles, is: {options[correct_option]}\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, the correct choice is {correct_option}.\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>"
