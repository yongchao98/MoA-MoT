    "This problem involves the decay of a stationary particle, so we must apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum in the context of special relativity.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   Decay: Pi(+) -> mu(+) + nu\n    *   Initial particle (Pi+) is stationary.\n    *   Rest mass of Pi(+) (m_pi) = 139.6 MeV/c².\n    *   Rest mass of mu(+) (m_mu) = 105.7 MeV/c².\n    *   The neutrino (nu) is assumed to be massless (m_nu = 0), which is a standard approximation in such problems.\n\n2.  **Apply Conservation Laws:**\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before decay (rest energy of Pi+) equals the sum of the total energies of the products after decay.\n        `E_pi = E_mu + E_nu`\n        Since Pi(+) is at rest, `E_pi = m_pi * c²`.\n        The total energy of a product particle is `E = KE + m*c²`.\n        So, `m_pi * c² = (KE_mu + m_mu * c²) + (KE_nu + m_nu * c²)`.\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial momentum is zero since the Pi(+) is stationary. The final products must have equal and opposite momenta.\n        `p_mu = p_nu = p` (in magnitude).\n\n3.  **Use the Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\n    *   The relation is `E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)²`.\n    *   For the massless neutrino, `E_nu² = (p_nu*c)²`, which simplifies to `E_nu = p*c`. Since the neutrino has zero rest mass, its total energy is its kinetic energy (`KE_nu = E_nu`).\n    *   We can substitute `p*c = E_nu` into the relation for the muon:\n        `E_mu² = E_nu² + (m_mu * c²)²`.\n\n4.  **Solve for the Energies:**\n    *   We have a system of two equations:\n        1.  `m_pi * c² = E_mu + E_nu`  => `E_mu = m_pi * c² - E_nu`\n        2.  `E_mu² = E_nu² + (m_mu * c²)²`\n    *   Substitute (1) into (2) to solve for `E_nu` (which is `KE_nu`):\n        `(m_pi*c² - E_nu)² = E_nu² + (m_mu*c²)²`\n        Expanding and simplifying this equation gives the formula for the neutrino's kinetic energy:\n        `KE_nu = [(m_pi*c²)² - (m_mu*c²)²] / [2 * m_pi*c²]`\n    *   Once `KE_nu` is found, the kinetic energy of the muon (`KE_mu`) can be found from the energy conservation equation: `KE_mu = m_pi*c² - m_mu*c² - KE_nu`.\n\nWe will now implement this calculation in Python. We can simplify the equations by setting c=1, as the mass-energy units (MeV) are consistent throughout.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the given rest masses in MeV.\nm_pi = 139.6  # Rest mass of Pi(+) in MeV\nm_mu = 105.7  # Rest mass of mu(+) in MeV\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_nu).\n# Formula derived from conservation of energy and momentum:\n# KE_nu = (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) / (2 * m_pi)\nke_nu = (m_pi**2 - m_mu**2) / (2 * m_pi)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_mu).\n# From conservation of energy: E_pi = E_mu + E_nu\n# m_pi = (KE_mu + m_mu) + KE_nu\n# Therefore, KE_mu = m_pi - m_mu - KE_nu\nke_mu = m_pi - m_mu - ke_nu\n\n# Step 4: Print the results and the available options to determine the answer.\nprint(f\"The kinetic energy of the product particles are:\")\n# The problem asks for the KE of the product particles, mu(+) and nu.\n# The options list two values. Let's assume the order is (KE_mu, KE_nu) based on common convention.\nprint(f\"Kinetic Energy of mu(+): {ke_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Kinetic Energy of nu: {ke_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n\nprint(\"\\nGiven Options:\")\nprint(\"A) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\")\nprint(\"B) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\")\nprint(\"C) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\")\nprint(\"D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\")\n\n# Step 5: Compare the results with the options\n# The calculated values are approximately 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, which match option D.\nprint(\"\\nThe correct option is D.\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>"
