    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Process**: The problem describes pair production from photon-photon annihilation: $\\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^{+} + e^{-}$. The high-energy gamma-ray is denoted by $\\gamma$, the Cosmic Microwave Background photon by $\\gamma_{CMB}$, and the electron-positron pair by $e^{+}e^{-}$.\n\n2.  **Apply Relativistic Kinematics**: To find the minimum (threshold) energy for this reaction to occur, we use the concept of the invariant mass squared, $s$. This quantity is the same in all inertial reference frames. We'll analyze the collision in two frames: the lab frame (where we measure the gamma-ray energy) and the center-of-mass (CM) frame.\n\n3.  **Calculate Invariant Mass in the Lab Frame**: The invariant mass squared is given by $s = (P_{\\gamma} + P_{CMB})^2$, where $P$ represents the four-momentum vectors. For two photons with energies $E_{\\gamma}$ and $E_{CMB}$ and a collision angle $\\theta$, this expands to $s = 2E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}(1 - \\cos\\theta)$. The threshold energy will be the lowest possible, which corresponds to the most efficient collision, a head-on collision ($\\theta = 180^\\circ$, so $\\cos\\theta = -1$). In this case, the formula simplifies to $s = 4E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}$.\n\n4.  **Calculate Invariant Mass in the CM Frame**: At the threshold of the reaction, the electron and positron are created with just enough energy to account for their rest masses, and they have zero kinetic energy in the CM frame. The total energy in the CM frame is therefore the sum of the rest mass energies of the electron and the positron, which is $E_{CM,total} = m_e c^2 + m_e c^2 = 2m_e c^2$. The invariant mass squared is $s = (E_{CM,total})^2 = (2m_e c^2)^2$.\n\n5.  **Equate and Solve for Threshold Energy**: By equating the expressions for the invariant mass squared from both frames, we get the condition for the threshold:\n    $4E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB} = (2m_e c^2)^2$\n    Solving for the threshold energy of the gamma-ray, $E_{\\gamma}$, gives:\n    $E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{(2m_e c^2)^2}{4E_{CMB}} = \\frac{4(m_e c^2)^2}{4E_{CMB}} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation**: We will use the following known values:\n    *   Rest mass energy of an electron, $m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n    *   Average energy of a CMB photon, $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.\n    *   Conversion factor: $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$.\n\nWe will implement this calculation in Python to find the numerical value for $E_{\\gamma}$ in GeV and compare it to the given options.\n\n```python\n# Import necessary libraries\nimport math\n\n# --- Step 1: Define the physical constants ---\n# Rest mass energy of an electron (m_e * c^2) in eV\nm_e_c2_eV = 0.511e6  # 0.511 MeV = 511,000 eV\n\n# Average energy of a Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon in eV\nE_CMB_eV = 1e-3  # 0.001 eV\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate the threshold energy for the gamma-ray in eV ---\n# The formula for the threshold energy E_gamma is (m_e*c^2)^2 / E_CMB\nE_gamma_eV = (m_e_c2_eV**2) / E_CMB_eV\n\n# --- Step 3: Convert the energy from eV to GeV ---\n# 1 GeV = 1e9 eV\nE_gamma_GeV = E_gamma_eV / 1e9\n\n# --- Step 4: Present the result and compare with options ---\nprint(f\"The threshold energy for the gamma-ray is calculated to be {E_gamma_GeV:.2e} GeV.\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this result with the given options:\")\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1.8e5,\n    \"B\": 3.9e5,\n    \"C\": 9.5e4,\n    \"D\": 2.6e5\n}\n\n# Print each option in the specified format\nfor key, value in options.items():\n    # Use string formatting to represent the number in the desired format, e.g., 2.6*1e5\n    exponent = int(math.floor(math.log10(abs(value))))\n    mantissa = value / 10**exponent\n    print(f\"{key}) {mantissa:.1f}*1e{exponent} GeV\")\n\n# Find the closest option\nclosest_option = min(options, key=lambda k: abs(options[k] - E_gamma_GeV))\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated value {E_gamma_GeV:.2e} GeV is closest to option {closest_option}.\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, the correct choice is {closest_option}.\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>"
