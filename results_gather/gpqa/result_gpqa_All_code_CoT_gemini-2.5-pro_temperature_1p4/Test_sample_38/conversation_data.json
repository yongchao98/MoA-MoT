    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics Principle**: The core concept is the normalization of a wave function in quantum mechanics. The total probability of finding a particle in the space where it can exist is always 1.\n2.  **Define the Probability Density**: The probability of finding a particle at a position x is given by the probability density function, P(x), which is the square of the magnitude of the wave function, |ψ(x)|². The wave function ψ(x) is a complex number, and its magnitude squared is calculated as ψ*(x)ψ(x), where ψ*(x) is the complex conjugate of ψ(x).\n3.  **Calculate the Probability Density**:\n    *   The given wave function is ψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i.\n    *   The complex conjugate is ψ*(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5*i.\n    *   The probability density P(x) = ψ*(x)ψ(x) = [( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5*i] * [( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i].\n    *   Using the algebraic identity (c + d)(c - d) = c² - d², we get:\n        P(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² - (0.5i)²\n        P(x) = a² / (1 + x) - 0.25 * i²\n    *   Since i² = -1, the expression simplifies to:\n        P(x) = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25.\n4.  **Apply the Normalization Condition**: The problem states the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3. Therefore, the integral of the probability density P(x) from 1 to 3 must equal 1.\n    *   ∫[from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n5.  **Solve the Integral**:\n    *   We integrate the function term by term:\n        ∫ (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = a² * ∫ (1 / (1 + x)) dx + ∫ 0.25 dx\n    *   The result of the integration is:\n        a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25x\n6.  **Evaluate the Definite Integral**: Now we evaluate this expression from x=1 to x=3:\n    *   [ a² * ln(1 + 3) + 0.25 * 3 ] - [ a² * ln(1 + 1) + 0.25 * 1 ] = 1\n    *   [ a² * ln(4) + 0.75 ] - [ a² * ln(2) + 0.25 ] = 1\n    *   a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.5 = 1\n    *   Using the logarithm property ln(b) - ln(c) = ln(b/c), this becomes:\n        a² * ln(4/2) + 0.5 = 1\n        a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n7.  **Solve for 'a'**:\n    *   a² * ln(2) = 0.5\n    *   a² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n    *   a = sqrt( 0.5 / ln(2) )\n8.  **Calculate the Numerical Value**: We will use Python to calculate the final numerical value of 'a' and compare it to the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 7 from the plan: We derived the formula for 'a'.\n# a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))\n# Now, we calculate this value.\n\n# The natural logarithm of 2\nln_2 = math.log(2)\n\n# Calculate a^2\na_squared = 0.5 / ln_2\n\n# Calculate a by taking the square root\na = math.sqrt(a_squared)\n\nprint(f\"The calculated numerical value of 'a' is: {a:.4f}\")\nprint(\"\\nThe given options are:\")\nprint(\"A) 0.35\")\nprint(\"B) 1.1\")\nprint(\"C) 0.6\")\nprint(\"D) 0.85\")\n\n# Find the closest option\noptions = {'A': 0.35, 'B': 1.1, 'C': 0.6, 'D': 0.85}\nclosest_option = min(options, key=lambda k: abs(options[k] - a))\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated value {a:.4f} is closest to option {closest_option}: {options[closest_option]}.\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, the correct choice is {closest_option}.\")\n```\n<<<D>>>"
