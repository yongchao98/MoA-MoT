    "Here is my thinking process for solving the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** I'll break the problem into two independent parts:\n    *   Part A: Find the fraction of maximum power radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. This involves understanding the angular distribution of radiation.\n    *   Part B: Find the dependence of the radiated power on the wavelength `λ`. This involves knowing how radiation power scales with frequency or wavelength.\n\n2.  **Part A: Angular Dependence:**\n    *   The source is an \"oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis)\". This is a classic physical model for an oscillating electric dipole. The charges are moving back and forth along the z-axis.\n    *   The formula for the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) by an oscillating electric dipole is proportional to `sin²(θ)`, where `θ` is the angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis).\n    *   So, `dP/dΩ = K * sin²(θ)`, where `K` is a constant that depends on other factors like frequency and the magnitude of the dipole moment.\n    *   The maximum radiated power, `A`, occurs when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n    *   Therefore, `A = K * sin²(90°) = K * 1 = K`.\n    *   Now, I need to find the power at `θ = 30°`. This will be `K * sin²(30°)`.\n    *   Since `A = K`, the power at 30° is `A * sin²(30°)`.\n    *   The fraction of `A` is simply `sin²(30°)`.\n    *   I know `sin(30°) = 0.5`.\n    *   So, the fraction is `(0.5)² = 0.25`, or `1/4`.\n    *   This narrows the choices down to B and C.\n\n3.  **Part B: Wavelength Dependence:**\n    *   The same formula for dipole radiation states that the power is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency `ω`. So, `dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴`.\n    *   The relationship between angular frequency `ω` and wavelength `λ` is `ω = 2πν` and `c = νλ`, where `ν` is the frequency and `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   From these, we can write `ω = 2πc/λ`. This shows that `ω` is inversely proportional to `λ` (`ω ∝ 1/λ`).\n    *   Substituting this into the power relationship: `Power ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`.\n    *   So, a possible form for the function `f` has a `λ⁻⁴` dependence.\n\n4.  **Combine and Conclude:**\n    *   From Part A, the fraction is `1/4`.\n    *   From Part B, the wavelength dependence is `λ⁻⁴`.\n    *   Combining these results gives `1/4, λ⁻⁴`, which matches option B.\n\n5.  **Code Implementation:**\n    *   The Python code will implement the calculations described above.\n    *   It will first calculate the power fraction using `math.sin` and `math.radians`.\n    *   It will then state the reasoning for the `λ⁻⁴` dependence based on physics principles.\n    *   Finally, it will print out the combined result and identify the correct option from the list.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Plan:\n# 1. Analyze the angular dependence of the radiated power. An oscillating spheroid acts as an oscillating electric dipole. The power radiated per unit solid angle (dP/dΩ) for such a dipole is proportional to sin²(θ), where θ is the angle from the axis of oscillation.\n# 2. The maximum power, A, occurs at the angle where sin²(θ) is maximum. This happens at θ = 90°, where sin²(90°) = 1.\n# 3. Calculate the fraction of this maximum power radiated at the given angle, θ = 30°. The fraction will be sin²(30°) / sin²(90°) = sin²(30°).\n# 4. Analyze the wavelength (λ) dependence of the radiated power. The formula for dipole radiation shows that the power is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency (ω⁴).\n# 5. Use the relationship between angular frequency and wavelength (ω = 2πc/λ) to find the power's dependence on λ. Power ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴.\n# 6.
