    "To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4, we must first identify the structure of product 4 by following the reaction sequence.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Step 1: Cyclohexanone to Product 1.** Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine (Br₂) in an alpha-halogenation reaction. One hydrogen on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an alpha-carbon) is replaced by a bromine atom. This yields **2-bromocyclohexanone**.\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 to Product 2.** 2-bromocyclohexanone is heated with a strong base, sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This condition promotes a Favorskii rearrangement. The base removes the other alpha-proton, forming an enolate which then undergoes an intramolecular cyclization to form a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate. This strained intermediate is then attacked by hydroxide, leading to ring-opening and the formation of a carboxylate salt. After workup, the product is a cyclopentane ring with a carboxylic acid group. So, Product 2 is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 to Product 3.** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine. This is a standard method to convert a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. Product 3 is **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 to Product 4.** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃). This is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent that selectively reduces acyl chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the alcohol. Therefore, Product 4 is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n5.  **Final Analysis:** Now we must count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (-CHO) and the C1 carbon it's attached to.\n    *   **Hydrogen 1:** The aldehyde proton (-C**H**O) is in a unique chemical environment.\n    *   **Hydrogen 2:** The proton on C1 (the carbon attached to the aldehyde) is also unique as it lies on the plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Hydrogens 3 & 4:** The carbons C2 and C5 are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, because C1 is a stereocenter, the two hydrogens on C2 are diastereotopic (chemically non-equivalent). The same applies to C5. The \"cis\" protons on C2 and C5 are equivalent to each other, and the \"trans\" protons on C2 and C5 are equivalent to each other. This gives two more distinct sets of hydrogens.\n    *   **Hydrogens 5 & 6:** Similarly, carbons C3 and C4 are equivalent. The two hydrogens on C3 are also diastereotopic. The \"cis\" protons on C3 and C4 are equivalent, and the \"trans\" protons on C3 and C4 are equivalent. This gives another two distinct sets of hydrogens.\n    *   **Total Count:** 1 (aldehyde-H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (C2/C5-H sets) + 2 (C3/C4-H sets) = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in a final product\n# of a multi-step organic synthesis.\n\n# Step 1: Determine the structure of the final product, Product 4.\n# Reaction 1: Cyclohexanone + Br2 -> Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone)\n# Reaction 2: Product 1 + NaOH, heat -> Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid via Favorskii rearrangement)\n# Reaction 3: Product 2 + SOCl2 -> Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride)\n# Reaction 4: Product 3 + LiAlH(O-t-Bu)3 -> Product 4 (cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)\nfinal_product = \"cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\"\n\n# Step 2: Analyze the structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde to count chemically distinct hydrogens.\n# The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C1-CHO bond.\n# We count the unique hydrogen environments (sets of hydrogens that are not interchangeable by symmetry).\n\n# H on the aldehyde group (-CHO): This is one unique environment.\naldehyde_h = 1\n\n# H on the carbon attached to the aldehyde group (C1): This H lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique.\nc1_h = 1\n\n# H's on the carbons adjacent to C1 (C2 and C5).\n# C2 and C5 are equivalent by symmetry.\n# The two H's on C2 are diastereotopic because C1 is a stereocenter.
