    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, we need to calculate the fraction of this species relative to all cobalt-containing species in the solution. This fraction, known as the distribution coefficient (α), depends on the concentration of the free ligand ([SCN-]) and the overall stability constants (β).\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Define the variables:** We are given the stability constants (β1, β2, β3, β4) and the ligand concentration `[SCN-]`.\n2.  **Calculate the relative contribution of each species:** The relative concentration of each complex `[Co(SCN)n]` is proportional to `βn * [SCN-]^n`. For the free `Co^2+` ion, the term is 1 (as β0 is defined as 1).\n3.  **Calculate the sum of all contributions:** We will sum the terms for all possible species: `Co^2+`, `[Co(SCN)]^+`, `[Co(SCN)2]`, `[Co(SCN)3]^-`, and `[Co(SCN)4]^2-`. This sum represents the denominator in the fraction calculation.\n4.  **Calculate the fraction of the target species:** The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex `[Co(SCN)2]` is its relative contribution (`β2 * [SCN-]^2`) divided by the total sum calculated in the previous step.\n5.  **Convert to percentage:** Multiply the fraction by 100 to get the final percentage.\n6.  **Compare with the given options** to select the correct answer.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\n# Given values\n# Stability constants\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n\n# Ligand concentration\nconc_SCN = 0.1  # in M\n\n# The relative contribution of each cobalt species can be expressed in terms of [SCN-].\n# The total sum of these contributions, S, is proportional to the total cobalt concentration.\n# S = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]+ + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3]- + [Co(SCN)4]2-\n# S is proportional to 1 + beta1*[SCN-] + beta2*[SCN-]^2 + beta3*[SCN-]^3 + beta4*[SCN-]^4\n\n# Calculate the term for each species relative to the free Co^2+ ion\nterm0 = 1  # For Co^2+ (beta0 is always 1)\nterm1 = beta1 * (conc_SCN ** 1)\nterm2 = beta2 * (conc_SCN ** 2)  # This is the species we are interested in\nterm3 = beta3 * (conc_SCN ** 3)\nterm4 = beta4 * (conc_SCN ** 4)\n\n# Calculate the sum of all terms\ntotal_sum = term0 + term1 + term2 + term3 + term4\n\n# The fraction (alpha) of the dithiocyanato complex is its term divided by the total sum\nfraction_CoSCN2 = term2 / total_sum\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage_CoSCN2 = fraction_CoSCN2 * 100\n\n# Print the result and the options\nprint(f\"The percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is: {percentage_CoSCN2:.1f}%\")\nprint(\"\\nOptions:\")\nprint(f\"A) 38.1%\")\nprint(f\"B) 25.6%\")\nprint(f\"C) 16.9%\")\nprint(f\"D) 42.3%\")\n\n# Determine the correct choice\nif abs(percentage_CoSCN2 - 38.1) < 0.1:\n    correct_choice = \"A\"\nelif abs(percentage_CoSCN2 - 25.6) < 0.1:\n    correct_choice = \"B\"\nelif abs(percentage_CoSCN2 - 16.9) < 0.1:\n    correct_choice = \"C\"\nelif abs(percentage_CoSCN2 - 42.3) < 0.1:\n    correct_choice = \"D\"\nelse:\n    correct_choice = \"Calculation does not match any option.\"\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated percentage matches option {correct_choice}.\")\n<<<C>>>\n```"
