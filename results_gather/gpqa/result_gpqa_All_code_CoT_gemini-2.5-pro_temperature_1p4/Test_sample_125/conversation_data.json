    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of HPLC peaks.\n\n**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction I:**\n    *   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone with one existing chiral center at carbon 5 (C5) in the (S) configuration.\n    *   **Reagents:** LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to an alcohol. The acidic workup protonates the intermediate.\n    *   **Product:** 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction does not affect the chiral center at C5. However, the reduction of the planar ketone at C3 creates a *new* chiral center. The hydride can attack from either face of the carbonyl group. This results in the formation of two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two products are diastereomers of each other.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two stereoisomeric products (a pair of diastereomers) are formed.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction II:**\n    *   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule.\n    *   **Reagents:** Excess NaBH4 (Sodium Borohydride) will reduce both ketone groups to alcohols. The acidic workup provides the protons.\n    *   **Product:** Pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4. Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers:\n        *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) forms are enantiomers (a racemic mixture will be formed).\n    *   The (2R, 4S) form has an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. It is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomeric products are formed: one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n3.  **Analyze Combined Products on HPLC:**\n    *   We have a total of 5 distinct stereoisomers in the final mixture:\n        *   From Reaction I (2 compounds): (3R, 5S)-alcohol, (3S, 5S)-alcohol.\n        *   From Reaction II (3 compounds): (2R, 4R)-diol, (2S, 4S)-diol, and the (2R, 4S)-meso-diol.\n\n4.  **Determine the Number of Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   Normal-phase HPLC separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It uses an achiral stationary phase.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties (in an achiral environment) and will *not* be separated; they elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Let's count the peaks:\n        *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different polarities and will produce **2 separate peaks**.\n        *   From Reaction II, the pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will co-elute as **1 peak**. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and has a different polarity, so it will produce its own, separate peak (**1 peak**). This gives 2 peaks from Reaction II's products.\n    *   **Total Normal-Phase Peaks:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This allows it to interact differently with enantiomers, enabling their separation. It can also separate diastereomers.\n    *   Therefore, a chiral column can resolve all stereoisomers that are not identical.\n    *   Let's count the peaks:\n        *   The 2 diastereomers from Reaction I are distinct and will be separated, giving **2 peaks**.\n        *   The 3 stereoisomers from Reaction II (the (2R, 4R) enantiomer, the (2S, 4S) enantiomer, and the meso compound) are all distinct from each other and will be resolved, giving **3 peaks**.\n    *   **Total Chiral HPLC Peaks:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 3 (from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion:** The analysis predicts 5 peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC, which matches option D.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_hplc_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes two chemical reactions and determines the number of peaks\n    observed in normal-phase and chiral HPLC experiments.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Step 1: Analyze Reaction I ---\n    # Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.\n    # The starting material has one chiral center (C5, S-config).\n    # LAH reduces the ketone at C3 to an alcohol, creating a new chiral center.\n    # The original chiral center at C5 is unaffected.\n    # This reaction produces two diastereomers: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    products_rxn1_count = 2\n    products_rxn1_desc = \"Two diastereomers\"\n\n    # --- Step 2: Analyze Reaction II ---\n    # Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup.\n    # The starting material is achiral.\n    # NaBH4 reduces both ketones (at C2 and C4) to alcohols, creating two new chiral centers.\n    # This produces three stereoisomers:\n    # 1.
