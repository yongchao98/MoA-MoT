    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics of Decay**: Radioactive decay is a memoryless process, meaning the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. This process follows an exponential decay law.\n\n2.  **Define the Survival Probability**: Let S(t) be the probability that the atom has *not* decayed (i.e., survived) after time t. The formula is S(t) = e^(-λt), where λ (lambda) is the decay constant. The probability of decay, P(t), is then P(t) = 1 - S(t).\n\n3.  **Calculate Survival Probability from Given Data**: We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    *   P(100) = 0.32\n    *   Therefore, the survival probability after 100 minutes is S(100) = 1 - P(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Question**: We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given it has already survived for 50 minutes. Because of the memoryless property, this is simply the probability that a new atom would decay within 150 minutes.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Probability**: We need to calculate P(150) = 1 - S(150).\n    *   We know S(100) = e^(-100λ) = 0.68.\n    *   We want to find S(150) = e^(-150λ).\n    *   We can rewrite S(150) in terms of S(100): S(150) = e^(-1.5 * 100λ) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5 = S(100)^1.5.\n    *   So, S(150) = 0.68 ^ 1.5.\n    *   The final probability of decay is P(150) = 1 - (0.68 ^ 1.5).\n\n6.  **Execute the Calculation**: Use Python to compute the final value and express it as a percentage to match the options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the given probability of decay and the time interval.\np_decay_100_min = 0.32\nt1 = 100\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the probability of survival for the first 100 minutes.\n# The probability of survival S(t) is 1 - P(t), where P(t) is the probability of decay.\np_survival_100_min = 1 - p_decay_100_min\n\n# Step 3: Define the new time interval for which we want to find the decay probability.\n# The problem asks for the probability of decay in the NEXT 150 minutes.\nt2 = 150\n\n# Step 4: Use the property of exponential decay to find the probability of survival for the new time interval.\n# S(t) = e^(-lambda*t)\n# S(100) = e^(-lambda*100) = p_survival_100_min\n# We want to find the probability of decay in 150 minutes, which is P(150) = 1 - S(150).\n# Due to the memoryless property of radioactive decay, the fact that the atom has already\n# survived 50 minutes does not affect its future decay probability.\n# We need to calculate S(150) = e^(-lambda*150) = (e^(-lambda*100))^(150/100) = S(100)^1.5\np_survival_150_min = p_survival_100_min ** 1.5\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the probability of decay in 150 minutes.\np_decay_150_min = 1 - p_survival_150_min\n\n# Step 6: Convert the result to a percentage and print the answer.\np_decay_150_min_percent = p_decay_150_min * 100\n\nprint(f\"The probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes is {p_decay_150_min_percent:.1f}%.\")\n\n# Print the given choices to compare\nprint(\"\\nChoices:\")\nprint(\"A) 44%\")\nprint(\"B) 48%\")\nprint(\"C) 52%\")\nprint(\"D) 40%\")\n\n# The calculated value is approximately 44.1%, which corresponds to choice A.\n\n```\n<<<A>>>"
