    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Aperture Geometry:** The problem describes an N-sided regular polygon where N is infinitely large. An N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a' (the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side) approaches a circle as N approaches infinity. The radius of this limiting circle is equal to its apothem, so we have a circular aperture of radius `r = a`.\n\n2.  **Recall Diffraction by a Circular Aperture:** The far-field diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a bright central disk (the Airy disk) surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings.\n\n3.  **Identify the Minima Positions:** The angular positions `(theta)` of the dark rings (intensity minima) are given by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function, `J1(x)`. The condition for a minimum is:\n    `sin(theta) = m * lambda / D`\n    where:\n    *   `lambda` is the wavelength of the light.\n    *   `D` is the diameter of the circular aperture. In our case, `D = 2 * r = 2 * a`.\n    *   `m` is a coefficient corresponding to the order of the minimum. The first few values for minima are approximately `m1 = 1.220`, `m2 = 2.233`, ...\n\n4.  **Apply the Small Angle Approximation:** The problem states that we can use the small angle approximation, `sin(theta) â‰ˆ theta`. The formula for the minima becomes:\n    `theta = m * lambda / D = m * lambda / (2 * a)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Angular Positions:**\n    *   The angular position of the first minimum (`theta_1`) is found using `m1 = 1.220`:\n        `theta_1 = 1.220 * lambda / (2 * a) = 0.610 * lambda / a`\n    *   The angular position of the second minimum (`theta_2`) is found using `m2 = 2.233`:\n        `theta_2 = 2.233 * lambda / (2 * a) = 1.1165 * lambda / a`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Angular Distance:** The angular distance between the first two minima is the difference between their positions:\n    `Delta_theta = theta_2 - theta_1`\n    `Delta_theta = (1.1165 * lambda / a) - (0.610 * lambda / a)`\n    `Delta_theta = (1.1165 - 0.610) * lambda / a`\n    `Delta_theta = 0.5065 * lambda / a`\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:** This result, `0.5065 * lambda / a`, is closest to option C. The following Python code will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem is about Fraunhofer diffraction by a circular aperture.\n# An N-sided polygon with N -> infinity and constant apothem 'a' becomes a circular aperture of radius r = a.\n# The diameter of the aperture is D = 2 * a.\n\n# The angular positions of the minima in the Airy pattern are given by sin(theta) = m * lambda / D,\n# where lambda is the wavelength and D is the diameter.\n# Using the small angle approximation (sin(theta) approx theta), we get theta = m * lambda / D.\n# The constants 'm' correspond to the zeros of the Bessel function J1(x).\n# For the first minimum, m1 = 1.21967...
