    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the Reagents:** I will first identify the reaction type based on the provided reagents (NaNO2, HCl, H2O). This mixture generates nitrous acid (HONO) in situ. I need to determine how nitrous acid reacts with the potential starting materials.\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:** The formation of a diketone from a single starting material using these reagents points towards the oxidation of a carbon atom adjacent (in the alpha position) to an existing carbonyl group. This reaction proceeds via α-nitrosation of a ketone, followed by tautomerization and hydrolysis.\n3.  **Analyze Reaction A:**\n    *   The product is 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione, an α-diketone.\n    *   Based on the reaction mechanism, the starting material 'A' must be a ketone where one of the carbonyl groups in the product was originally a methylene (CH2) group.\n    *   This means 'A' must be 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one. The reaction would oxidize the CH2 group at the C-2 position.\n4.  **Analyze Reaction B:**\n    *   The product is 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione, another α-diketone.\n    *   Similarly, starting material 'B' must be a ketone where the new carbonyl group was previously a methylene group.\n    *   This means 'B' is likely 5-methylhexan-2-one (oxidation at C-3) or 5-methylhexan-3-one (oxidation at C-2). Looking at the options, 5-methylhexan-2-one is provided.\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:** I will compare my deductions for 'A' and 'B' with the given choices to find the one that matches both.\n6.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script that programmatically follows these logical steps, explains the reasoning, and prints the final correct option.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes a chemical reaction to determine the correct starting materials.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze the reaction conditions.\n    # The reagents are NaNO2, HCl, and H2O.
