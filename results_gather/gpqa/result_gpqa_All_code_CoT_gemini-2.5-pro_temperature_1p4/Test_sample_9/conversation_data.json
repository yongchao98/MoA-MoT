    "To determine which exoplanet has the highest density, we need to analyze each case. The key principle is that for planets with the same rocky composition, a more massive planet will be denser due to greater gravitational self-compression.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1.  **Planet (a):** This is an Earth-twin, with the same mass and radius as Earth. Therefore, its density is the same as Earth's average density, which is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n2.  **Planet (b):** The density is explicitly given as approximately 5.5 g/cm³. This is slightly less than Earth's density.\n3.  **Planet (c):** This planet has the same composition as Earth but is 5 times more massive. Due to its greater mass, its own gravity will compress its material much more strongly than Earth's gravity does. This self-compression leads to a significantly higher density than Earth's.\n4.  **Planet (d):** This planet has the same composition as Earth but is only half as massive. With less mass, there is less gravitational self-compression. Therefore, its density will be lower than Earth's.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   Density (a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n*   Density (b) ≈ 5.50 g/cm³\n*   Density (d) < 5.51 g/cm³\n*   Density (c) > 5.51 g/cm³\n\nComparing these, Planet (c) will have the highest density.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the estimated densities to confirm this reasoning. It uses a known mass-radius relationship for rocky planets to model the effect of gravitational compression.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Plan ---\n# 1. Define Earth's average density as a baseline.\n# 2. Assign the density for planet (a), which is an Earth-twin.\n# 3. Assign the density for planet (b) as given in the problem.\n# 4. Model the densities of planets (c) and (d). For rocky planets with the same composition,\n#    density changes with mass due to gravitational compression. A common approximation for the\n#    relationship between radius (R) and mass (M) is R is proportional to M^k, where k is ~0.27.\n#    Since density (rho) is M/V and Volume (V) is proportional to R^3, it follows that\n#    rho is proportional to M / (M^k)^3 = M^(1-3k).\n# 5. Calculate the densities for (c) and (d) relative to Earth using this model.\n# 6. Compare all four densities and identify the highest one.\n\n# --- Calculations ---\n\n# Earth's average density in g/cm^3\nearth_density = 5.51\n\n# a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.\ndensity_a = earth_density\n\n# b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3.\ndensity_b = 5.5\n\n# c) & d) Model for rocky planets of the same composition\n# Mass-radius exponent for rocky planets\nk = 0.27\n# Density scales with mass as M^(1-3k)\ndensity_scaling_exponent = 1 - 3 * k\n\n# c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive.\nmass_ratio_c = 5.0\ndensity_c = earth_density * (mass_ratio_c ** density_scaling_exponent)\n\n# d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.\nmass_ratio_d = 0.5\ndensity_d = earth_density * (mass_ratio_d ** density_scaling_exponent)\n\n# --- Output Results ---\n\nprint(\"Estimated densities for each planet:\")\nprint(f\"a) Density: {density_a:.2f} g/cm^3\")\nprint(f\"b) Density: {density_b:.2f} g/cm^3\")\nprint(f\"c) Density: {density_c:.2f} g/cm^3 (This is higher than Earth's due to gravitational compression)\")\nprint(f\"d) Density: {density_d:.2f} g/cm^3 (This is lower than Earth's due to less compression)\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing the densities, planet (c) has the highest density.\")\nprint(\"The correct option is D, which corresponds to planet c.\")\n\n# Final answer choice\nfinal_choice = \"D\"\nprint(f\"The final answer is {final_choice}\")\n\n<<<D>>>\n```"
