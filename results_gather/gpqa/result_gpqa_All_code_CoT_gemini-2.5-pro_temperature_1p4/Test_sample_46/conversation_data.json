    "Here is my thinking process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2):**\n    *   First, I'll calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) to understand the number of rings and/or double/triple bonds.\n    *   The formula is: DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n    *   Plugging in the values: DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond (1 DBE), most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **Analyze the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two distinct, medium-to-strong intensity bands are a classic signature for a primary amine (-NH2) group, corresponding to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl region. Its position is characteristic of an ester (R-CO-O-R'). Amides are typically lower (1650-1690 cm⁻¹), and carboxylic acids would show a very broad O-H stretch from ~2500-3300 cm⁻¹, which is absent.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH2) and an ester (-COO-) group.\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents 3 protons, and its triplet (`t`) multiplicity means it is adjacent to a group with 2 protons (a CH2 group, based on the n+1 rule). This pattern (3H triplet) is indicative of a methyl (-CH3) group next to a methylene group.\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal represents 2 protons, and its quartet (`q`) multiplicity means it is adjacent to a group with 3 protons (a CH3 group). This signal, combined with the one at 1.20 ppm, confirms the presence of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The high chemical shift (4.5 ppm) for the CH2 protons indicates they are attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom, as in an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for 2 protons is very characteristic of exchangeable protons, such as those in an alcohol (-OH) or an amine (-NH2). Since the IR already confirmed a primary amine, this signal corresponds to the -NH2 protons.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). There are a total of 4 aromatic protons, meaning the benzene ring is di-substituted. The pattern of two doublets suggests a 1,4- or *para*-substitution. The downfield doublet (8.0 ppm) is ortho to a strong electron-withdrawing group (the ester), while the upfield doublet (7.0 ppm) is ortho to an electron-donating group (the amine).\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structure:**\n    *   We have a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   One substituent is a primary amine (-NH2).\n    *   The other substituent is an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   Putting these pieces together gives the structure for **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n5.  **Final Check against the options:**\n    *   A) **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all the data perfectly.\n    *   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Is an amide (wrong C=O IR stretch) and would have different NMR signals (e.g., a formyl proton).\n    *   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: The ester linkage is reversed. The CH2 of the propionate group would be next to the C=O and appear around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Is an amide (*meta*-substituted, not *para*), which contradicts the NMR aromatic pattern and IR C=O stretch.\n\nTherefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef analyze_compound():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided spectroscopic data to identify the compound C9H11NO2.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Data provided\n    molecular_formula = \"C9H11NO2\"\n    ir_data = \"medium to strong at 3420 cm-1, 3325 cm-1; strong at 1720 cm-1\"\n    nmr_data = {\n        '1.20 ppm': 't, 3H',\n        '4.0 ppm': 'bs, 2H',\n        '4.5 ppm': 'q, 2H',\n        '7.0 ppm': 'd, 2H',\n        '8.0 ppm': 'd, 2H'\n    }\n    options = {\n        'A': 'ethyl 4-aminobenzoate',\n        'B': 'N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide',\n        'C': '4-aminophenyl propionate',\n        'D': '3-ethoxybenzamide'\n    }\n\n    # Step-by-step analysis\n    analysis_steps = []\n\n    # 1.
