    "My plan is to solve this problem step-by-step to ensure accuracy.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material (Compound X):** I will interpret the provided IR and ¹H NMR spectral data to determine the structure of the initial compound.\n    *   **IR Spectrum:** The key peaks (broad O-H, C=O, aromatic C=C) will be used to identify the main functional groups.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The chemical shifts, integration, and splitting patterns will be used to piece together the exact arrangement of protons, confirming the functional groups and determining the structure of the alkyl substituent and its position on the aromatic ring.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:** I will identify the role of the reagents, red phosphorus and HI. This combination is a well-known, powerful reducing agent. I will determine its specific effect on the functional groups present in Compound X.\n\n3.  **Determine the Final Product:** By applying the transformation from Step 2 to the structure identified in Step 1, I will deduce the structure of the final product.\n\n4.  **Select the Correct Option:** I will compare the structure of the final product with the given multiple-choice options (A, B, C, D) to find the correct match.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Suppress any potential warnings for cleaner output, though none are expected here.\nif not sys.warnoptions:\n    import warnings\n    warnings.simplefilter(\"ignore\")\n\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function executes the step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem\n    and prints the reasoning and the final answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Identify the starting material (Compound X) from its spectral data.\")\n    print(\"-------------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"IR Spectrum Analysis:\")\n    print(\" - A very broad peak from 3400–2500 cm-1 is characteristic of an O-H stretch in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\")\n    print(\" - A strong peak at 1720 cm-1 is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\")\n    print(\" - Peaks at 1610 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1 indicate C=C stretching from an aromatic ring.\")\n    print(\"Conclusion from IR: Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\")\n    print(\"\\n1H NMR Spectrum Analysis:\")\n    print(\" - 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet far downfield confirms the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\")\n    print(\" - 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Two doublets in the aromatic region, each for 2 protons, strongly indicates a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\")\n    print(\" - The remaining signals define the second substituent on the ring:\")\n    print(\"   - A group of signals [2.9 (m, 1H), 1.7 (m, 2H), 1.4 (d, 3H), 0.9 (t, 3H)] must be pieced together.\")\n    print(\"   - 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A methyl group (-CH3) next to a methylene group (-CH2).\")\n    print(\"   - 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A methyl group (-CH3) next to a methine group (-CH).\")\n    print(\"   - These fragments combine to form a sec-butyl group: -CH(CH3)CH2CH3.\")\n    print(\"   - The methine proton (-CH) at 2.9 ppm is deshielded because it is directly attached to the aromatic ring (benzylic position).\")\n    print(\"\\nConclusion from all data: The starting material, Compound X, is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyze the reaction.\")\n    print(\"------------------------------\")\n    print(\"Reagents: Red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\")\n    print(\"This is a very strong reducing agent.
