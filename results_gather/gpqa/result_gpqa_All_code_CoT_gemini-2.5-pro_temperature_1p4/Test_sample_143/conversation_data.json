    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Key Physics Principles**: The mean decay distance of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is determined by its proper mean lifetime and the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n    *   The proper mean lifetime ($\\tau$) is related to the decay width ($\\Gamma$) by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: $\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   In the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is dilated to $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma\\tau$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma = E/mc^2$).\n    *   The mean decay distance in the lab frame is given by $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity.\n\n2.  **Formulate a Calculation Strategy**: A direct and efficient way to calculate the mean decay distance is to use the formula that combines these principles:\n    $L = \\left(\\frac{pc}{mc^2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}\\right)$\n    Here, $p$ is the relativistic momentum, and the term $\\hbar c$ is a convenient physical constant. We first need to calculate the momentum term, $pc$, using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$.\n\n3.  **Execute the Calculation**: I will write a Python script to perform these calculations.\n    *   The script will first define the given quantities ($E_{X}$, $m_{X}$, $\\Gamma_{X}$) and the constant $\\hbar c$. I will ensure all units are consistent (using MeV for energy).\n    *   It will then calculate $pc$ from the energy-momentum relation.\n    *   Next, it will use the formula above to compute the mean decay distance, which will initially be in femtometers (fm).\n    *   Finally, the script will convert this distance to meters ($1 \\text{ fm} = 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$) and print the result, allowing for a direct comparison with the provided options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_decay_distance():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X and compares it to the given options.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the known physical quantities and constants.\n    # We are given the total energy (E_X), rest mass (m_X), and decay width (Gamma_X).\n    # We will use the well-known physical constant hbar*c (reduced Planck constant times the speed of light).\n    # To ensure consistency, we will convert all energy units to Mega-electron Volts (MeV).\n\n    # Given values:\n    E_X_GeV = 8.0      # Total energy in GeV\n    m_X_GeV = 1.2      # Rest mass in GeV\n    Gamma_X_MeV = 320.0  # Decay width in MeV\n\n    # Physical Constants:\n    # h-bar * c in MeV*fm, where 1 fm = 10^-15 m\n    hbar_c_MeV_fm = 197.3269804\n\n    # --- Unit Conversion to MeV ---\n    E_X_MeV = E_X_GeV * 1000\n    m_X_c2_MeV = m_X_GeV * 1000\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the relativistic momentum (pc) of the particle.\n    # We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m*c^2)^2.\n    # Rearranging for pc: pc = sqrt(E^2 - (m*c^2)^2).\n    pc_squared = E_X_MeV**2 - m_X_c2_MeV**2\n    pc_MeV = math.sqrt(pc_squared)\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the mean decay distance (L).\n    # The formula for the mean decay distance in the lab frame is L = (pc / (m*c^2)) * (hbar*c / Gamma).\n    # This formula combines the Lorentz factor, velocity, and proper lifetime into a single, direct calculation.\n    # The result will be in femtometers (fm) based on the units of hbar*c.\n    mean_decay_distance_fm = (pc_MeV / m_X_c2_MeV) * (hbar_c_MeV_fm / Gamma_X_MeV)\n\n    # Step 4: Convert the result from femtometers (fm) to meters (m) for comparison with the options.\n    # 1 fm = 1e-15 m.\n    mean_decay_distance_m = mean_decay_distance_fm * 1e-15\n\n    # Step 5: Print the final calculated value and the multiple-choice options to identify the correct answer.\n    print(f\"The calculated mean decay distance is: {mean_decay_distance_m:.4e} m\")\n    print(\"\\nComparing this result with the given options:\")\n    print(f\"A) {4.0655e-15:.4e} m\")\n    print(f\"B) {5.0223e-15:.4e} m\")\n    print(f\"C) {5.0223e-16:.4e} m\")\n    print(f\"D) {4.0655e-16:.4e} m\")\n    print(\"\\nThe calculated value is closest to option A.\")\n\n# Execute the function\nsolve_decay_distance()\n\n```\n<<<A>>>"
