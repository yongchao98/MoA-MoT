    "To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we need to apply three key principles:\n1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):** The initial state is `1S0`, which has a total angular momentum `J_initial = 0`. The final state consists of a two-nucleon (NN) system and an emitted particle X. The total angular momentum of the final state is the vector sum of the final NN system's total angular momentum (`J_f`) and the orbital angular momentum of the particle X (`L_X`). For the total final angular momentum to be zero (to match the initial state), the magnitudes must be equal: `J_f = L_X`.\n2.  **Conservation of Parity (P):** The parity of the initial NN state (`1S0`) is `P_initial = (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1`. The parity of the final state is the product of the final NN system's parity (`P_f(NN) = (-1)^L_f`), the intrinsic parity of particle X (`P(X) = -1`), and the orbital parity of particle X (`P_orbital = (-1)^L_X`). Thus, `P_final = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^L_X`. For parity to be conserved (`P_initial = P_final`), we must have `+1 = -(-1)^(L_f + L_X)`, which simplifies to `(-1)^(L_f + L_X) = -1`. This means the sum `L_f + L_X` must be an **odd** integer.\n3.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** The problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Given that the final isospin `T(NN) = 0`, this becomes `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`, which means the sum `S_f + L_f` must be an **odd** integer.\n\nThe following Python code will analyze each of the four proposed transitions against these three rules to find the one that is not permitted.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nucleon_transition():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes four possible nucleon transitions based on conservation laws and Pauli statistics\n    to find the one that is not permitted.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define spectroscopic notation mapping to L quantum number\n    L_map = {'S': 0, 'P': 1, 'D': 2, 'F': 3}\n    l_x_map = {'s': 0, 'p': 1, 'd': 2, 'f': 3}\n\n    # Initial state: 1S0 -> J_i = 0, P_i = +1\n    \n    # Final state T(NN) = 0 is given.\n\n    transitions = [\n        {'label': 'A', 'final_nn': '7D1', 'emitted_x': 'p'},\n        {'label': 'B', 'final_nn': '3S1', 'emitted_x': 'p'},\n        {'label': 'C', 'final_nn': '3P0', 'emitted_x': 's'},\n        {'label': 'D', 'final_nn': '3D3', 'emitted_x': 'f'},\n    ]\n\n    not_permitted_option = None\n\n    print(\"Analyzing each transition:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    for trans in transitions:\n        label = trans['label']\n        final_nn_term = trans['final_nn']\n        emitted_x_wave = trans['emitted_x']\n\n        # Parse the term symbols to get quantum numbers\n        S_f = (int(final_nn_term[0]) - 1) / 2\n        L_f_char = final_nn_term[1]\n        J_f = int(final_nn_term[2])\n        L_f = L_map[L_f_char]\n        L_x = l_x_map[emitted_x_wave]\n        \n        print(f\"Option {label}: 1S0 -> {final_nn_term} + {emitted_x_wave}\")\n        print(f\"  Final NN state: S_f={int(S_f)}, L_f={L_f}, J_f={J_f}\")\n        print(f\"  Emitted particle X: L_X={L_x}\")\n        \n        # Rule 1: Conservation of Angular Momentum (J_f = L_x)\n        j_conserved = (J_f == L_x)\n        print(f\"  1.
