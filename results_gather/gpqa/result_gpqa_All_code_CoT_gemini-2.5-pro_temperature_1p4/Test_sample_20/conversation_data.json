    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the properties of the given compounds.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Tautomerism (Compound A)**\n\nTautomerism is a form of isomerism where isomers can interconvert by a chemical reaction, most commonly involving the migration of a proton and a shift in a double bond. The most frequent type is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl C=O group).\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone):** The structure is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds (they are sp2 hybridized). They do not have the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp3-hybridized carbon needed for typical keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has three ketone groups. The carbons between them (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are CH2 groups. These hydrogens are alpha-hydrogens. The molecule can undergo enolization at these positions. In fact, it tautomerizes readily to form the very stable aromatic compound phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). Thus, it shows tautomerism.\n\nConclusion for A: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Optical Isomerism (Compound B)**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is a chiral center â€“ a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl group. It is attached to four different groups:\n    1.  -H (hydrogen)\n    2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n    3.  -CH3 (methyl)\n    4.  -COOCH3 (methoxycarbonyl)\n    Since it is bonded to four different groups, this carbon is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This is the *trans* isomer with the structure CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. The molecule is planar around the C=C double bond. It has a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry. Any molecule with a plane or center of symmetry is achiral and cannot show optical isomerism.\n\nConclusion for B: The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the results**\n\n*   Compound A (no tautomerism): **benzoquinone**\n*   Compound B (optical isomerism): **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\nThis corresponds to choice C.\n\n```python\n# Analysis of the chemical properties to determine the correct option.\n\n# Part A: Tautomerism\n# Benzoquinone has no alpha-hydrogens on sp3 carbons, so it does not exhibit keto-enol tautomerism.\n# Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has alpha-hydrogens and readily tautomerizes to the stable aromatic enol, phloroglucinol.\n# Therefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone.\nA = \"benzoquinone\"\n\n# Part B: Optical Isomerism\n# Optical isomerism requires chirality (a non-superimposable mirror image).\n# Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center (the carbon attached to H, OH, CH3, and COOCH3), so it is chiral and shows optical isomerism.\n# Dimethyl fumarate is a trans-alkene with a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. It does not show optical isomerism.\n# Therefore, the compound that shows optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\nB = \"methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\"\n\n# The available choices\nchoices = {\n    \"A\": (\"cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione\", \"methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\"),\n    \"B\": (\"benzoquinone\", \"dimethyl fumarate\"),\n    \"C\": (\"benzoquinone\", \"methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\"),\n    \"D\": (\"cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione\", \"dimethyl fumarate\")\n}\n\n# Find the correct choice based on our analysis\ncorrect_choice = None\nfor choice, (compound_A, compound_B) in choices.items():\n    if compound_A == A and compound_B == B:\n        correct_choice = choice\n        break\n\nprint(f\"The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is: {A}\")\nprint(f\"The compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is: {B}\")\nprint(f\"This corresponds to option: {correct_choice}\")\n\n# Final Answer\nprint(\"<<<C>>>\")\n```"
