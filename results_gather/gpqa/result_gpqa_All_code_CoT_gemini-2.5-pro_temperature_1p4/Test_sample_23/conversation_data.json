    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**:\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon (composed of C and H).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. Let's determine its empirical formula.\n    *   14.28% is very close to 1/7 (since 100/7 â‰ˆ 14.2857).\n    *   Let the formula be CxHy. The mass fraction of H is `(y * AtomicMass(H)) / (x * AtomicMass(C) + y * AtomicMass(H))`.\n    *   Using approximate atomic masses (H=1, C=12), we have: `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`.\n    *   This gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   The formula is of the type CnH2n.\n    *   Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen, meaning it's a saturated compound. A saturated compound with the formula CnH2n must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   Z is also a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent matching this description is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. This will be our working assumption for Z.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**:\n    *   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids formed from mixture X.\n    *   One of the liquids in Y is Z itself (cyclohexane, C6H12). Let's call the other liquid D. So, Y = (cyclohexane + D).\n    *   Y (and therefore both its components) does not decolorize bromine water. This means D is unreactive towards bromine water under standard conditions.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. This means hydrogenation of D must also yield Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   What could D be? It must be a C6 compound (since it hydrogenates to C6H12). It's unreactive to Br2 water. The most plausible candidate is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene is aromatic and does not react with aqueous bromine, and its hydrogenation gives cyclohexane.\n    *   So, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Reaction**:\n    *   X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, so A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n    *   There are no conjugated multiple bonds in A or B.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This confirms that both A and B have a C6 carbon skeleton (a six-membered ring).\n    *   The reaction is a disproportionation (or hydrogen transfer) where X forms Y:\n        `A + B --(Pt, heat)--> cyclohexane + benzene`\n    *   Since A and B are C6 compounds, let their formulas be C6Hx and C6Hy.\n    *   By the principle of conservation of atoms, the number of hydrogen atoms must be equal on both sides of the reaction equation:\n        `Number of H in A + Number of H in B = Number of H in cyclohexane + Number of H in benzene`\n        `x + y = 12 + 6`\n        `x + y = 18`\n\n4.  **Final Calculation**:\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is precisely the value `x + y` we just calculated.\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms is 18. This corresponds to option B.\n\nNow, I will write a Python code snippet that formalizes this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the properties of the products in mixture Y.\n# Based on the problem description, substance Z is identified as cyclohexane,\n# and the other component of mixture Y is identified as benzene.\n# We define the number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each.\n\n# Number of hydrogen atoms in a molecule of cyclohexane (C6H12)\nh_atoms_cyclohexane = 12\n\n# Number of hydrogen atoms in a molecule of benzene (C6H6)\nh_atoms_benzene = 6\n\n# Step 2: Apply the principle of conservation of atoms.\n# The reaction is a disproportionation of mixture X (containing two liquids, A and B)\n# into an equimolar mixture Y (cyclohexane and benzene).\n# Reaction: A + B -> cyclohexane + benzene\n# The total number of hydrogen atoms must be conserved.\n# Therefore, the total hydrogen atoms in the reactants (A and B) must equal\n# the total hydrogen atoms in the products (cyclohexane and benzene).\n\ntotal_h_atoms_in_X = h_atoms_cyclohexane + h_atoms_benzene\n\n# Step 3: Print the final answer.\n# The problem asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\nprint(f\"The number of hydrogen atoms in cyclohexane is: {h_atoms_cyclohexane}\")\nprint(f\"The number of hydrogen atoms in benzene is: {h_atoms_benzene}\")\nprint(f\"By conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is the sum of the hydrogen atoms in the products.\")\nprint(f\"Total hydrogen atoms = {h_atoms_cyclohexane} + {h_atoms_benzene} = {total_h_atoms_in_X}\")\n\n# Step 4: Identify the correct option.\noptions = {'A': 22, 'B': 18, 'C': 16, 'D': 12}\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    if value == total_h_atoms_in_X:\n        correct_option = option\n        break\n\nprint(f\"The final answer is {total_h_atoms_in_X}, which corresponds to option {correct_option}.\")\nprint(f\"For reference, the choices are:\")\nprint(\"A) 22\")\nprint(\"B) 18\")\nprint(\"C) 16\")\nprint(\"D) 12\")\nprint(\"The calculated answer is 18.\")\n<<<B>>>\n```"
