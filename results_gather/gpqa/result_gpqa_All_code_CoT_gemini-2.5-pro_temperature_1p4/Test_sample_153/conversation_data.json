    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most common isotopes.\n    *   There is an M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with an intensity of 32%. The ratio of the M+ to M+2 peaks is approximately 100:32, which simplifies to about 3:1. This specific ratio is a classic indicator for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to its two isotopes, ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl).\n    *   Conclusion from MS: The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is caused by hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. This value falls squarely in the range for an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n    *   Conclusion from IR: The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (deshielded) is almost always a proton from a carboxylic acid. The integration (1H) confirms it's a single proton, and its singlet nature (s) indicates no adjacent protons to couple with. This strongly supports the IR data.\n    *   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):** Both signals are in the aromatic region of the spectrum.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H):** This represents two equivalent protons on a benzene ring. They are split into a doublet (d), meaning they have one neighboring proton.\n    *   **7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** This represents another set of two equivalent protons on the benzene ring, also split into a doublet.\n    *   The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is a hallmark of a *para* (1,4) substituted benzene ring. The two protons next to one substituent are equivalent, and the two protons next to the other substituent are also equivalent. Each set splits the other, creating two doublets.\n    *   Conclusion from NMR: The molecule has a carboxylic acid group and a *para*-substituted benzene ring.\n\n4.  **Synthesize and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   From the analysis, we are looking for a *para*-substituted chlorobenzoic acid.\n    *   Let's check the molecular formula and weight for chlorobenzoic acid (C₇H₅ClO₂): (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + 35.5 + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35.5 + 32 = 156.5 g/mol. This matches the MS data.\n    *   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Wrong functional groups (aldehyde and phenol, not a carboxylic acid). Does not match IR or NMR.\n    *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is *ortho*-substituted. It would produce a more complex NMR signal in the aromatic region with four distinct peaks, not two doublets.\n    *   **C) Phenyl chloroformate:** Wrong functional group (acyl chloride/ester hybrid). It lacks the carboxylic acid OH, so it would not have the broad IR peak or the 11.0 ppm NMR signal.\n    *   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This compound is a *para*-substituted chlorobenzoic acid. It perfectly matches all the data: it contains Cl (MS), has a carboxylic acid (IR, NMR), a molecular weight of 156 (MS), and shows the characteristic *para*-substitution pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR.\n\nTherefore, the only reasonable structure is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n```python\ndef identify_compound():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided spectral data to identify the correct chemical structure.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Provided Spectral Data\n    ms_mw = 156\n    ms_m_plus_2_ratio = \"approx 3:1 (indicates one Chlorine atom)\"\n    ir_broad_peak = \"3500-2700 cm^-1 (Carboxylic Acid O-H)\"\n    ir_sharp_peak = \"1720 cm^-1 (Carboxylic Acid C=O)\"\n    nmr_h1 = \"11.0 ppm (s, 1H, Carboxylic Acid H)\"\n    nmr_aromatic = \"Two doublets at 8.02 and 7.72 ppm (2H each, indicates para-substitution)\"\n\n    # Candidate Molecules\n    options = {\n        'A': {\n            'name': '3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde',\n            'mw': 156.57,\n            'functional_group': 'Aldehyde and Phenol',\n            'substitution': '1,2,3-trisubstituted',\n            'match': False,\n            'reason': 'Incorrect functional groups.
