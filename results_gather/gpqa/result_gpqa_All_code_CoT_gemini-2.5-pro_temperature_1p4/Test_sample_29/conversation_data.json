    "My plan to solve this problem involves these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the Wavelength:** The energy of the *emitted* light is given in electron-volts (eV). I will first calculate the corresponding wavelength of this light in nanometers (nm) using the formula `wavelength (nm) = 1240 / Energy (eV)`.\n2.  **Identify the Emitted Color:** Based on the calculated wavelength, I will determine the color of the light that the dye emits by comparing it to the standard visible light spectrum.\n3.  **Determine the Absorbed Color:** The color that a substance absorbs is the complementary color to the one it emits (or transmits). I will find the complementary color to the emitted color. For example, the complementary color to green is red.\n4.  **Select the Correct Option:** I will match the resulting absorbed color with the given choices to identify the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_dye_color():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the absorbed color of a dye based on its emitted light energy.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given energy of emitted light in eV\n    energy_emitted_eV = 2.3393\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the wavelength of the emitted light in nanometers (nm).\n    # The conversion formula is lambda (nm) = 1240 / E (eV).\n    wavelength_emitted_nm = 1240 / energy_emitted_eV\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the color of the emitted light based on its wavelength.\n    emitted_color = \"\"\n    if 380 <= wavelength_emitted_nm < 450:\n        emitted_color = \"Violet\"\n    elif 450 <= wavelength_emitted_nm < 495:\n        emitted_color = \"Blue\"\n    elif 495 <= wavelength_emitted_nm < 570:\n        emitted_color = \"Green\"\n    elif 570 <= wavelength_emitted_nm < 590:\n        emitted_color = \"Yellow\"\n    elif 590 <= wavelength_emitted_nm < 620:\n        emitted_color = \"Orange\"\n    elif 620 <= wavelength_emitted_nm <= 750:\n        emitted_color = \"Red\"\n\n    # Step 3: Find the absorbed color, which is the complementary color.\n    complementary_map = {\n        \"Green\": \"Red\",\n        \"Blue\": \"Orange\",\n        \"Violet\": \"Yellow\",\n        \"Red\": \"Green\",\n        \"Orange\": \"Blue\",\n        \"Yellow\": \"Violet\"\n    }\n    absorbed_color = complementary_map.get(emitted_color, \"Unknown\")\n\n    # Step 4: Match the absorbed color with the given options.\n    options = {\"A\": \"Violet\", \"B\": \"Blue\", \"C\": \"Yellow\", \"D\": \"Red\"}\n    final_answer_key = \"\"\n    for key, value in options.items():\n        if value == absorbed_color:\n            final_answer_key = key\n            break\n            \n    print(f\"Energy of emitted light: {energy_emitted_eV} eV\")\n    print(f\"Calculated wavelength of emitted light: {wavelength_emitted_nm:.2f} nm\")\n    print(f\"The color of the emitted light is Green.\")\n    print(f\"The absorbed color is complementary to the emitted color, which is Red.\")\n    print(f\"The correct option is: {final_answer_key}\")\n    # The final answer must be output in the specified format.\n    # We redirect the final answer format to stdout for it to be the last line.\n    sys.stdout.write(f\"<<<{final_answer_key}>>>\")\n\nsolve_dye_color()\n```"
