    "My thinking process to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Chemical Clues to Identify Substance X:**\n    *   **Substance X + Liquid Y → Gas W + Precipitate G:** This is a classic chemical reaction description.\n    *   **Gas W:** \"molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Let's test common small gas molecules. H₂ has 2 protons, 0 neutrons. N₂ has 14p, 14n. This is a possibility. D₂ (deuterium gas) has 2 protons (1 per D) and 2 neutrons (1 per D). This also fits perfectly.\n    *   **Heavier Isotope:** Substance X contains a heavier isotope. This makes the D₂ (Deuterium) hypothesis for Gas W very strong, as D is the heavier isotope of hydrogen.\n    *   **Precipitate G, when heated, releases B:** This suggests G is a hydrate or a hydroxide that decomposes upon heating to form an oxide and releases water (B).\n    *   **Melting Point of B:** B's melting point is \"very close to 277 K\". The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K. This is extremely close to 277 K. Therefore, **B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n    *   **Connecting the dots:** If heating G gives D₂O, then G must be a \"deuteroxide\" (like a hydroxide, but with deuterium). This means the reaction involves D₂O. This strongly implies **Liquid Y is D₂O**. The violent reaction between X and D₂O produces D₂ gas.\n    *   **Reagent in Organic Chemistry:** X and its \"very close analog\" are used as reagents. The reaction is violent with water, suggesting a powerful reducing agent. Common analogs are LiAlH₄ (lithium aluminum hydride) and NaBH₄ (sodium borohydride). LiAlH₄ reacts much more violently with water than NaBH₄.\n    *   **The Keto Acid Reaction:** The product of reacting a keto acid with X has 2 oxygen atoms. Let's take the simplest alpha-keto acid, pyruvic acid (CH₃COCOOH), which has 3 oxygens. A strong reducing agent like LiAlH₄ would reduce both the ketone and the carboxylic acid group, yielding CH₃CH(OH)CH₂OH (propane-1,2-diol), which has **2 oxygen atoms**. This fits perfectly. A milder agent like NaBH₄ would only reduce the ketone, giving CH₃CH(OH)COOH (lactic acid), which has 3 oxygens. This doesn't fit.\n    *   **Conclusion for Substance X:** The reagent must be from the LiAlH₄ family. Since it contains a heavy isotope and the reaction involves deuterium, **Substance X is LiAlD₄ (Lithium aluminum deuteride)**. The analog is LiAlH₄. The reaction is: LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)↑. Heating 2Al(OD)₃ (G) gives Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O (B). All clues align.\n\n2.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n    *   **Elements present:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Identify Lightest and Heaviest Elements:** We determine this by atomic number (Z).\n        *   Lightest: Hydrogen (Z=1).\n        *   Heaviest: Aluminum (Z=13).\n    *   **Calculate Cumulative Atomic Masses:** The instruction is to sum the masses of all instances of the lightest and heaviest elements in the molecule.\n        *   **Mass of Lightest Element (Hydrogen):** The molecule has four atoms of the isotope Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass of one deuterium atom is approximately 2 amu.\n            *   Total mass from lightest element = 4 atoms × 2 amu/atom = 8 amu.\n        *   **Mass of Heaviest Element (Aluminum):** The molecule has one atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass of the most common isotope of aluminum is 27 amu.\n            *   Total mass from heaviest element = 1 atom × 27 amu/atom = 27 amu.\n    *   **Final Sum:** Cumulative mass = (Total mass from lightest) + (Total mass from heaviest) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n3.  **Final Answer Selection:** The calculated value is 35, which corresponds to option B.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Identify Substance X based on chemical properties.\n# - The clues point to Substance X being Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD4).\n#   - It's a powerful reducing agent used in organic chemistry (like its analog LiAlH4).\n#   - It contains a heavier isotope (Deuterium, D).\n#   - It reacts with heavy water (Y=D2O) to produce Deuterium gas (W=D2), which has an equal number of protons (2) and neutrons (2).\n#   - The precipitate G is Al(OD)3, which upon heating releases heavy water B (D2O), whose melting point (~277 K) matches the description.\n#   - Its reaction with a keto acid can yield a product with 2 oxygens (e.g., reduction of pyruvic acid to propane-1,2-diol).\nsubstance_X_formula = \"LiAlD4\"\n\n# Step 2: Identify the elements and their atomic numbers in LiAlD4.\n# Elements are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Deuterium (D, an isotope of Hydrogen, Z=1).\nelements = {\n    \"Hydrogen (as Deuterium)\": {\"Z\": 1, \"count\": 4, \"mass\": 2}, # Deuterium (2H) has mass ~2\n    \"Lithium\":               {\"Z\": 3, \"count\": 1, \"mass\": 7},\n    \"Aluminum\":              {\"Z\": 13, \"count\": 1, \"mass\": 27}  # Common isotope 27Al\n}\n\n# Step 3: Find the lightest and heaviest elements based on atomic number (Z).\nlightest_element_Z = float('inf')\nheaviest_element_Z = float('-inf')\nlightest_element_name = \"\"\nheaviest_element_name = \"\"\n\nfor name, properties in elements.items():\n    if properties[\"Z\"] < lightest_element_Z:\n        lightest_element_Z = properties[\"Z\"]\n        lightest_element_name = name\n    if properties[\"Z\"] > heaviest_element_Z:\n        heaviest_element_Z = properties[\"Z\"]\n        heaviest_element_name = name\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the cumulative mass as per the problem description.\n# The instruction is to sum the total masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n\n# Mass of all atoms of the lightest element (Hydrogen as Deuterium).\ntotal_mass_of_lightest = elements[lightest_element_name][\"count\"] * elements[lightest_element_name][\"mass\"]\n\n# Mass of all atoms of the heaviest element (Aluminum).\ntotal_mass_of_heaviest = elements[heaviest_element_name][\"count\"] * elements[heaviest_element_name][\"mass\"]\n\n# Calculate the final cumulative mass.\nfinal_cumulative_mass = total_mass_of_lightest + total_mass_of_heaviest\n\n# Print the results and the final answer choice\nprint(f\"Substance X is identified as LiAlD4.\")\nprint(f\"The lightest element is {lightest_element_name} (Z={lightest_element_Z}).\")\nprint(f\"The heaviest element is {heaviest_element_name} (Z={heaviest_element_Z}).\")\nprint(f\"Total mass from all atoms of the lightest element ({elements[lightest_element_name]['count']} * {elements[lightest_element_name]['mass']}) = {total_mass_of_lightest}\")\nprint(f\"Total mass from all atoms of the heaviest element ({elements[heaviest_element_name]['count']} * {elements[heaviest_element_name]['mass']}) = {total_mass_of_heaviest}\")\nprint(f\"The cumulative atomic mass is {total_mass_of_lightest} + {total_mass_of_heaviest} = {final_cumulative_mass}\")\nprint(\"The available options are A) 29, B) 35, C) 31, D) 25.\")\nprint(f\"The calculated value {final_cumulative_mass} corresponds to option B.\")\nprint(\"<<<B>>>\")\n```"
