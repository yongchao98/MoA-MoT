    "My plan is to determine which stars can be observed by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs by checking two main criteria for each star:\n1.  **Visibility**: A star must be visible from both the Paranal Observatory in the Southern Hemisphere (Latitude approx. -24.6°) and the Keck Observatory in the Northern Hemisphere (Latitude approx. +19.8°). This means the star's declination (DEC) must be within a specific range that allows it to rise above the horizon at both locations. A star is visible from a location with latitude `lat` if its declination `dec` satisfies `dec > lat - 90°` and `dec < lat + 90°`. For a star to be visible from both, its declination must be between approximately -70.2° (Keck's southern limit) and +65.4° (Paranal's northern limit).\n2.  **Brightness**: The star's apparent V magnitude (`m_V`) must be brighter than the observational limit of both instruments. The limit for ESPRESSO is `m_V < 17` and for HIRES is `m_V < 16`. Therefore, to be seen by both, the star must satisfy the stricter condition, which is `m_V < 16`.\n\nFor each star, I will first check its declination for visibility. If it's visible from both sites, I will then calculate its apparent V magnitude (`m_V`) if it's not already provided. The formula to calculate apparent magnitude `m_V` from absolute magnitude `M_V` and distance `d` (in parsecs) is `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5`. If there is interstellar dust, we must also account for extinction `A_V`, making the formula `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + A_V`. The extinction is calculated as `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`.\n\nAfter applying these checks to all five stars, I will identify the combination that satisfies all conditions and select the corresponding option.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_star_observation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Observatory and Instrument Parameters ---\n    # Magnitude limits (star must be BRIGHTER than, i.e., have a smaller magnitude value than, the limit)\n    mag_limit_espresso = 17.0\n    mag_limit_hires = 16.0\n    \n    # Strictest magnitude limit for dual observation\n    effective_mag_limit = min(mag_limit_espresso, mag_limit_hires)\n\n    # Observatory latitudes for visibility calculation\n    paranal_lat_deg = -24.6  # Southern Hemisphere\n    keck_lat_deg = 19.8     # Northern Hemisphere\n\n    # A star is visible if its declination (dec) is greater than latitude - 90 degrees.\n    # To be seen from both, it must be visible from Keck's southern limit AND Paranal's northern limit.\n    # Keck's southern limit: dec > 19.8 - 90 = -70.2\n    # Paranal's northern limit: dec < -24.6 + 90 = 65.4\n    dec_limit_south = keck_lat_deg - 90.0\n    dec_limit_north = paranal_lat_deg + 90.0\n\n    # --- Star Data ---\n    # M_V = Absolute V Magnitude, m_V = Apparent V Magnitude, d_pc = distance in parsecs\n    # E_B_V = Color Excess.
