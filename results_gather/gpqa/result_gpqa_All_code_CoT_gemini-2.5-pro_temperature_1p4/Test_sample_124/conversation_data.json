    "My approach to solving this problem involves using the established formulas for the energy levels and their degeneracies for a three-dimensional isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator.\n\n1.  **Identify the System and State:** The system is a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator with potential `V(r) = 1/2 m ω^2 r^2`. We are interested in the third excited state.\n\n2.  **Recall the Energy Formula:** The energy eigenvalues `E_N` for this system are quantized and given by the formula:\n    `E_N = (N + 3/2)ħω`\n    where `N = n_x + n_y + n_z` is the principal quantum number (`N = 0, 1, 2, ...`). The ground state corresponds to `N=0`, the first excited state to `N=1`, the second to `N=2`, and thus the third excited state corresponds to `N=3`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy:** I will substitute `N=3` into the energy formula to find the energy of the third excited state.\n    `E_3 = (3 + 3/2)ħω = (9/2)ħω`\n\n4.  **Recall the Degeneracy Formula:** The degeneracy `g_N` of an energy level `N` is the number of different combinations of quantum numbers `(n_x, n_y, n_z)` that sum to `N`. The formula for this degeneracy is:\n    `g_N = (N + 1)(N + 2) / 2`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Degeneracy:** I will substitute `N=3` into the degeneracy formula.\n    `g_3 = (3 + 1)(3 + 2) / 2 = (4)(5) / 2 = 10`\n\n6.  **Compare and Conclude:** The calculated energy is `(9/2)ħω` and the degeneracy is 10. This matches option D. I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_quantum_oscillator_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the energy and degeneracy for the third excited state of a\n    3D isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The ground state corresponds to the principal quantum number N = 0.\n    # The first excited state is N = 1.\n    # The second excited state is N = 2.\n    # Therefore, the third excited state corresponds to N = 3.\n    N = 3\n\n    # The energy eigenvalues are given by E_N = (N + 3/2) * hbar * omega.\n    # We calculate the numerical coefficient for the energy.\n    energy_numerator = 2 * N + 3\n    energy_denominator = 2\n    \n    # The degeneracy (number of independent eigenfunctions) for a given energy\n    # level N is given by g_N = (N + 1) * (N + 2) / 2.\n    degeneracy = (N + 1) * (N + 2) // 2\n\n    # Print the analysis and results\n    print(\"Analysis of the 3D Isotropic Harmonic Oscillator:\")\n    print(f\"The state of interest is the third excited state, which corresponds to the principal quantum number N = {N}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    \n    # Energy Calculation\n    print(\"1.
