    "The problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key to solving this is understanding the concept of \"retarded time\". Because electromagnetic effects propagate at the finite speed of light `c`, the fields observed at a point `r` at time `t` are determined by the state of the charge (its position and velocity) at an earlier time `tr`, called the retarded time.\n\n### Step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Define Retarded Time (tr):** The retarded time `tr` is the time at which the electromagnetic signal must have been emitted from the charge's position `s(tr)` to reach the observation point `r` at the current time `t`. The relationship is given by:\n    `t - tr = |r - s(tr)| / c`\n\n2.  **Define Key Vectors:**\n    *   `s(tr)`: Position of the charge `q` at the retarded time `tr`.\n    *   `v = ds/dt |_(t=tr)`: Velocity of the charge `q` at the retarded time `tr`.\n    *   `d = r - s(tr)`: The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n    *   `d = |d|`: The magnitude of this vector, which is the distance the signal traveled. So, `d = c(t - tr)`.\n\n3.  **Retarded Potentials:** The general formulas for the potentials from time-varying charge and current distributions are:\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', tr) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', tr) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n\n4.  **Applying to a Point Charge:** For a point charge, the charge and current densities are `ρ(r', tr) = q * δ(r' - s(tr))` and `J(r', tr) = q * v(tr) * δ(r' - s(tr))`. Performing the integration over the delta functions is not straightforward because the retarded time `tr` itself depends on `r'`. The result of this integration (which accounts for the relativistic compression of the volume element) yields the Liénard-Wiechert potentials:\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d - (v ⋅ d) / c)]`\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q * v / (d - (v ⋅ d) / c)]`\n\n5.  **Simplifying the Expressions:** To match the format of the given options, we can manipulate the denominator:\n    `d - (v ⋅ d) / c = (1/c) * (cd - v ⋅ d)`\n    Substituting this back into the potential equations:\n    *   For the scalar potential `V`:\n        `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / ((1/c) * (cd - v ⋅ d))] = qc / (4πε₀ (cd - v ⋅ d))`\n    *   For the vector potential `A`:\n        `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q * v / ((1/c) * (cd - v ⋅ d))] = (μ₀qc * v) / (4π (cd - v ⋅ d))`\n\n6.  **Comparing with Options:**\n    *   A) `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc + d.v))`, `A(r,t) = μ₀qc v / (4π (dc + d.v))` - The sign in the denominator is `+`, which is incorrect.\n    *   B) `V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d.v))`, `A(r,t) = μ₀qc v / (4π (dc - d.v))` - This perfectly matches our derived expressions.\n    *   C) & D) These options use the static potential `V = q / (4πε₀ r)`, which is incorrect for a moving charge whose fields are observed at a distance. The potential depends on the retarded position and velocity.\n\nTherefore, option B is the correct one.\n\n```python\n# The Liénard-Wiechert potentials describe the classical electromagnetic effect of a moving electric point charge.\n# The scalar potential V and vector potential A at a field point r and time t are given by the state of the charge at the retarded time tr.\n\n# The formulas are:\n# V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / (d - (v ⋅ d) / c)]\n# A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q * v / (d - (v ⋅ d) / c)]\n# where:\n# q is the charge of the point charge.\n# v is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time tr.\n# d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to the observation point r.\n# d is the magnitude of the vector d.\n# c is the speed of light.\n# ε₀ is the permittivity of free space.\n# μ₀ is the permeability of free space.\n\n# We can rewrite the denominator to match the options:\n# Denominator = d - (v ⋅ d) / c = (cd - v ⋅ d) / c\n\n# Substituting this into the potential formulas:\n# V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / ((cd - v ⋅ d) / c)] = (qc) / (4πε₀ * (cd - v ⋅ d))\n# A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q * v / ((cd - v ⋅ d) / c)] = (μ₀ * q * c * v) / (4π * (cd - v ⋅ d))\n\n# Let's compare this with the given options.\n# Option A: Denominator is (dc + d.v), which is incorrect.\n# Option B: Denominator is (dc - d.v), which matches our derived expressions for both V and A.\n# Option C: Incorrect form for V, it's the static potential. Incorrect relation for A.\n# Option D: Incorrect form for V, it's the static potential.\n\n# Therefore, option B is the correct choice.\n\ncorrect_choice = 'B'\nprint(f\"The correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in option B.\")\nprint(f\"V(r,t) = qc / (4πε₀ (dc - d⋅v))\")\nprint(f\"A(r,t) = μ₀qc v / (4π (dc - d⋅v))\")\nprint(f\"The correct option is: {correct_choice}\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>"
