    "To determine the pH of the final solution, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the moles of each reactant:** We need to find the number of moles of the weak acid (CH3COOH), the strong acid (H+ from HCl), and the strong base (OH- from Ba(OH)2).\n2.  **Account for dissociation:** HCl is a strong acid and dissociates completely (HCl -> H+ + Cl-). Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and dissociates completely, yielding two moles of hydroxide ions for every one mole of Ba(OH)2 (Ba(OH)2 -> Ba^2+ + 2OH-).\n3.  **Perform neutralization reactions:** The strong acid (H+) will react with the strong base (OH-) first. Then, any remaining strong acid or strong base will react with the weak species (CH3COOH).\n4.  **Determine the final composition:** After all reactions are complete, we identify what major species are left in the solution (e.g., excess strong base, excess strong acid, or a buffer system).\n5.  **Calculate the final pH:**\n    *   If there is excess strong acid or strong base, the pH is calculated directly from its concentration.\n    *   If a buffer system (weak acid and its conjugate base) is formed, we would use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations to find the final pH.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1 & 2: Define initial conditions and calculate initial moles\n# Solution 1: CH3COOH (weak acid)\nvol_ch3cooh = 0.500  # L\nconc_ch3cooh = 0.1  # M\nmoles_ch3cooh = vol_ch3cooh * conc_ch3cooh\n\n# Solution 2: HCl (strong acid)\nvol_hcl = 0.400  # L\nconc_hcl = 0.2  # M\n# HCl -> H+ + Cl-, so moles_h_plus = moles_hcl\nmoles_h_plus = vol_hcl * conc_hcl\n\n# Solution 3: Ba(OH)2 (strong base)\nvol_baoh2 = 0.300  # L\nconc_baoh2 = 0.3  # M\n# Ba(OH)2 -> Ba^2+ + 2OH-, so moles_oh_minus = 2 * moles_baoh2\nmoles_oh_minus = 2 * (vol_baoh2 * conc_baoh2)\n\n# Calculate total volume\ntotal_volume = vol_ch3cooh + vol_hcl + vol_baoh2\n\n# Step 3: Perform neutralization reactions\n# First, react strong acid (H+) with strong base (OH-)\nif moles_h_plus > 0 and moles_oh_minus > 0:\n    if moles_h_plus >= moles_oh_minus:\n        moles_h_plus -= moles_oh_minus\n        moles_oh_minus = 0\n    else:\n        moles_oh_minus -= moles_h_plus\n        moles_h_plus = 0\n\n# Next, react any remaining strong species with the weak acid (CH3COOH)\n# In this case, we have excess OH- reacting with CH3COOH\n# Reaction: CH3COOH + OH- -> CH3COO- + H2O\nif moles_oh_minus > 0 and moles_ch3cooh > 0:\n    if moles_oh_minus >= moles_ch3cooh:\n        moles_oh_minus -= moles_ch3cooh\n        moles_ch3cooh = 0\n    else:\n        moles_ch3cooh -= moles_oh_minus\n        moles_oh_minus = 0\n\n# Step 4 & 5: Determine final composition and calculate pH\n# The solution has an excess of strong base (OH-)\nif moles_oh_minus > 0:\n    # Calculate the concentration of the excess OH-\n    final_conc_oh = moles_oh_minus / total_volume\n    # Calculate pOH\n    pOH = -math.log10(final_conc_oh)\n    # Calculate pH\n    final_pH = 14.0 - pOH\nelse:\n    # This block handles other scenarios, but for this problem, we have excess OH-\n    # For instance, if excess H+ remained:\n    final_conc_h = moles_h_plus / total_volume\n    final_pH = -math.log10(final_conc_h)\n    # Note: This simplified model doesn't account for buffer situations,\n    # but it's sufficient for this problem where a strong base remains in excess.\n\n# Print the results\nprint(f\"Initial moles of CH3COOH: {moles_ch3cooh:.4f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Initial moles of H+ (from HCl): {0.400 * 0.2:.4f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Initial moles of OH- (from Ba(OH)2): {2 * (0.300 * 0.3):.4f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Total volume: {total_volume:.3f} L\")\nprint(f\"Moles of OH- after reacting with H+: {0.18 - 0.08:.4f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Final moles of excess OH- after reacting with CH3COOH: {moles_oh_minus:.4f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Final concentration of OH-: {moles_oh_minus / total_volume:.4f} M\")\nprint(f\"Final pOH: {-math.log10(moles_oh_minus / total_volume):.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Final pH of the solution: {final_pH:.2f}\")\n\n# Compare with options and print the choice\noptions = {'A': 8.68, 'B': 12.62, 'C': 1.38, 'D': 8.92}\nchosen_option = None\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    if math.isclose(final_pH, value, rel_tol=1e-2):\n        chosen_option = option\n        break\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated pH is {final_pH:.2f}, which corresponds to option B.\")\nprint(\"A) 8.68\")\nprint(\"B) 12.62\")\nprint(\"C) 1.38\")\nprint(\"D) 8.92\")\nprint(f\"The correct option is {chosen_option}.\")\n```\n<<<B>>>"
