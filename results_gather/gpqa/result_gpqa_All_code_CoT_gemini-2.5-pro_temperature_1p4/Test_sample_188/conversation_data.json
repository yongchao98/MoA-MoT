    "My plan to solve this problem is to analyze each of the four options based on concepts from theoretical and condensed matter physics, specifically focusing on spontaneously broken symmetry and Goldstone's theorem.\n\n1.  **Analyze Phonons:** I'll evaluate if phonons are related to a broken symmetry. In a crystal, the underlying laws of physics are continuous (translationally invariant), but the ground state (the crystal lattice itself) is discrete. This breaking of continuous translational symmetry gives rise to a massless excitation, the phonon, which is a Goldstone boson.\n2.  **Analyze Magnons:** I'll check the case for magnons. In a ferromagnet, the underlying interactions are rotationally symmetric (all spin directions are equivalent). However, in the ground state, all spins align in one specific direction, spontaneously breaking the rotational symmetry. The resulting Goldstone bosons are the magnons.\n3.  **Analyze Pions:** I'll investigate pions in the context of particle physics. Pions are understood as the pseudo-Goldstone bosons associated with the spontaneous breaking of the approximate chiral symmetry of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).\n4.  **Analyze Skyrmions:** I will determine the nature of a skyrmion. Skyrmions are topological solitons. Their existence and stability are guaranteed by the non-trivial topology of the field configuration, not by the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry via Goldstone's theorem. They are distinct, localized, high-energy excitations, unlike Goldstone bosons which are massless (or low-mass) modes.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the skyrmion is the particle not directly associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry in the sense of being a Goldstone boson. The Python code will encapsulate this logic, explain each case, and print the final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef find_particle_not_from_ssb():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of particles to identify which one is not a result of a\n    spontaneously-broken symmetry (SSB) according to Goldstone's theorem.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # A dictionary to hold information about each particle and its relation to SSB.\n    particles_info = {\n        'A': {\n            \"name\": \"Phonon\",\n            \"is_goldstone_boson\": True,\n            \"explanation\": \"Associated with the spontaneous breaking of continuous translational symmetry in a crystal lattice.\"\n        },\n        'B': {\n            \"name\": \"Magnon\",\n            \"is_goldstone_boson\": True,\n            \"explanation\": \"Associated with the spontaneous breaking of continuous rotational (spin) symmetry in a ferromagnet.\"\n        },\n        'C': {\n            \"name\": \"Pion\",\n            \"is_goldstone_boson\": True,\n            \"explanation\": \"A pseudo-Goldstone boson associated with the spontaneous breaking of approximate chiral symmetry in particle physics.\"\n        },\n        'D': {\n            \"name\": \"Skyrmion\",\n            \"is_goldstone_boson\": False,\n            \"explanation\": \"A topological soliton.
