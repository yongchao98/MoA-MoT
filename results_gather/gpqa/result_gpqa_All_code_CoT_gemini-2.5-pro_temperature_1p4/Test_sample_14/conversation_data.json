    "Here is a breakdown of the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to compare the transit probabilities of two exoplanets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, and determine which one is a better candidate for observation.\n\n2.  **Recall the Transit Probability Formula:** The geometric probability of a planet transiting its star is primarily determined by the ratio of the star's radius (`R_star`) to the planet's semi-major axis (`a`).\n    *   `Probability ≈ R_star / a`\n\n3.  **Set up the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio of the probability of Planet_1 transiting (`Prob_1`) to the probability of Planet_2 transiting (`Prob_2`).\n    *   `Prob_1 = R_s1 / a_1`\n    *   `Prob_2 = R_s2 / a_2`\n    *   `Ratio = Prob_1 / Prob_2 = (R_s1 / a_1) / (R_s2 / a_2) = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (a_2 / a_1)`\n\n4.  **Use Kepler's Third Law:** The semi-major axis (`a`) is not directly given. However, it can be related to the orbital period (`P`) and the host star's mass (`M_s`) using Kepler's Third Law. The simplified form (assuming planet mass is negligible compared to the star's mass) is:\n    *   `P² ∝ a³ / M_s`\n    *   Rearranging for `a`: `a³ ∝ P² * M_s` or `a ∝ (P² * M_s)^(1/3)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (`a_2 / a_1`):**\n    *   `a_2 / a_1 = [ (P_2² * M_s2) / (P_1² * M_s1) ]^(1/3)`\n    *   This can be grouped as: `a_2 / a_1 = [ (P_2 / P_1)² * (M_s2 / M_s1) ]^(1/3)`\n\n6.  **Substitute the Given Values:**\n    *   The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: `P_1 = P_2 / 3`  => `P_2 / P_1 = 3`.\n    *   The mass of Star_1 is twice the mass of Star_2: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2` => `M_s2 / M_s1 = 1/2`.\n    *   Both stars have the same radii: `R_s1 = R_s2` => `R_s1 / R_s2 = 1`.\n\n7.  **Compute the Final Ratio:**\n    *   First, find `a_2 / a_1`: `a_2 / a_1 = [ (3)² * (1/2) ]^(1/3) = [ 9 * 0.5 ]^(1/3) = (4.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65`.\n    *   Then, find the probability ratio: `Ratio = Prob_1 / Prob_2 = (1) * (a_2 / a_1) ≈ 1.65`.\n\nThis means Planet_1 has approximately a 1.65 times higher probability of transiting than Planet_2. This corresponds to option B.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_transit_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the ratio of transit probabilities for two exoplanets\n    based on their orbital periods and host star properties.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Step 1: Define the given ratios from the problem statement ---\n    # The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2.\n    # P1 = P2 / 3  =>  P2 / P1 = 3\n    period_ratio_p2_over_p1 = 3.0\n\n    # The mass of the host star of Planet_1 is twice that of the host star of Planet_2.\n    # M_s1 = 2 * M_s2  => M_s2 / M_s1 = 1 / 2\n    star_mass_ratio_m2_over_m1 = 0.5\n\n    # Both host stars have the same radii.\n    # R_s1 = R_s2 => R_s1 / R_s2 = 1\n    star_radius_ratio_r1_over_r2 = 1.0\n\n    # --- Step 2: Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2 / a1) ---\n    # From Kepler's Third Law (P^2 ∝ a^3 / M_s), we derive that a ∝ (P^2 * M_s)^(1/3).\n    # Therefore, the ratio a2 / a1 can be expressed as:\n    # a2 / a1 = [ (P2/P1)^2 * (M_s2/M_s1) ]^(1/3)\n    a_ratio_a2_over_a1 = (period_ratio_p2_over_p1**2 * star_mass_ratio_m2_over_m1)**(1/3.0)\n\n    # --- Step 3: Calculate the ratio of transit probabilities (Prob1 / Prob2) ---\n    # The transit probability is Prob ∝ R_star / a.\n    # The ratio of probabilities is Prob1 / Prob2 = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (a2 / a1).\n    prob_ratio_p1_over_p2 = star_radius_ratio_r1_over_r2 * a_ratio_a2_over_a1\n\n    # --- Step 4: Determine the correct option and print the output ---\n    # The result shows that Planet_1 is preferred by a factor of ~1.65.\n    factor = round(prob_ratio_p1_over_p2, 2)\n    \n    print(f\"The probability for Planet_1 to transit is {factor} times the probability of Planet_2.\")\n    print(\"Based on this calculation, the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1.\")\n    print(\"The correct choice is B.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Choices ---\")\n    print(\"A) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit.\")\n    print(f\"B) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~{factor} times higher probability to transit.\")\n    print(\"C) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit.\")\n    print(\"D) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit.\")\n\nsolve_transit_probability()\n<<<B>>>\n```"
