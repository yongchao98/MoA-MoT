    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Understand the Chemistry:** The problem asks for the concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) from the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex ($CaY^{2-}$). The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    $CaY^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Use the Formation Constant (K_f):** The given formation constant is $K_{f} = \\frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$.\n\n3.  **Set up an Equilibrium Expression:**\n    Let 'x' be the equilibrium concentration of free $Ca^{2+}$. Due to the 1:1 stoichiometry of the dissociation, the equilibrium concentration of free EDTA ($Y^{4-}$) will also be 'x'.\n    The concentration of the undissociated Ca-EDTA complex will be its initial concentration minus the amount that dissociated: $[CaY^{2-}] = 0.02 - x$.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Equation:** Substitute these equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{(0.02 - x)}{x \\cdot x} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n5.  **Simplify the Equation:** Because the formation constant ($K_f$) is very large, the complex will dissociate very little. This means 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). Therefore, we can make the simplifying assumption that $(0.02 - x) \\approx 0.02$.\n    The equation becomes: $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n6.  **Solve for 'x':**\n    Rearrange the equation to solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    Then, take the square root to find x, which represents the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$.\n\n7.  **Write Python Code:** I will write a Python script to perform this calculation and compare the result to the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given values ---\n# Formation constant for Ca-EDTA\nK_f = 5e10\n# Initial stoichiometric concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex\nC_complex_initial = 0.02  # M\n\n# --- Calculation ---\n# The equilibrium expression is K_f = [CaY^2-] / ([Ca^2+] * [Y^4-])\n# Let x = [Ca^2+] = [Y^4-] at equilibrium.\n# Then [CaY^2-] = C_complex_initial - x\n# So, K_f = (C_complex_initial - x) / x^2\n# Since K_f is very large, x will be very small.\n# We can approximate (C_complex_initial - x) as C_complex_initial.\n# K_f ≈ C_complex_initial / x^2\n# Rearranging to solve for x:\n# x^2 ≈ C_complex_initial / K_f\n# x = sqrt(C_complex_initial / K_f)\n\nx_squared = C_complex_initial / K_f\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\n# The concentration of calcium ions is x\nca_ion_concentration = x\n\n# --- Output the results ---\nprint(\"This problem asks for the concentration of free calcium ions [Ca^2+] from a 0.02 M solution of Ca-EDTA complex.\")\nprint(f\"The formation constant K_f is {K_f:.1e}.\")\nprint(f\"The initial complex concentration is {C_complex_initial} M.\")\nprint(\"\\nThe equilibrium is: CaY^2- <=> Ca^2+ + Y^4-\")\nprint(\"We solve for x in the equation: K_f = (0.02 - x) / x^2\")\nprint(\"Approximation for large K_f: x = sqrt(0.02 / K_f)\")\nprint(f\"\\nCalculated [Ca^2+] concentration: {ca_ion_concentration:.2e} M\")\n\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\nprint(f\"A) 2.0x10^-2 M\")\nprint(f\"B) 1.0x10^-2 M\")\nprint(f\"C) 5.0x10^-3 M\")\nprint(f\"D) 6.3x10^-7 M\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value of approximately 6.32x10^-7 M matches option D.\")\n<<<D>>>\n```"
