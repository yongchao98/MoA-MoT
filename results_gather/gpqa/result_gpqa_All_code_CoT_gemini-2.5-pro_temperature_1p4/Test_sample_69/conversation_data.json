    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to solve this chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues:** I'll break down the problem into the four reactions and the properties of the compounds involved. The goal is to identify compound E and then determine its molecular symmetry.\n\n2.  **Reaction 3 - The Hydrolysis Key:** The reaction \"C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid\" is the most revealing clue. The reformation of A suggests A is an element. The formation of two different acids from the hydrolysis of C (which is made from A and B) is very specific. A well-known reaction that fits this perfectly is the hydrolysis of an iodine chloride:\n    *   `5 ICl₃ + 9 H₂O → I₂ + 15 HCl + 3 HIO₃`\n    *   Let's match this to the clue:\n        *   **A** = `I₂` (Iodine), which is a solid and is reformed.\n        *   **C** = `ICl₃` (Iodine trichloride), which exists as a dimer `I₂Cl₆`, an orange-red solid (fitting \"bright red product\").\n        *   **F** = `HCl` (Hydrochloric acid), a strong acid.\n        *   **G** = `HIO₃` (Iodic acid), a weak acid.\n    *   This single reaction identifies A, C, F, and G. It also tells us that gas **B** must be chlorine (`Cl₂`), since C (`ICl₃`) is formed from A (`I₂`) and B.\n\n3.  **Reaction 1 - Confirmation:** \"solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C\".\n    *   This translates to `I₂` (A) + `Cl₂` (B) → `ICl₃` (C).\n    *   The reaction is `I₂ + 3Cl₂ → 2ICl₃`. The \"8 equivalents\" in the problem statement is likely a distractor or a quirk of the puzzle, as the chemical identities are strongly supported by the other reactions.\n\n4.  **Reaction 4 - Identifying D and H:** \"D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\"\n    *   We know B is `Cl₂`. The reaction is D(gas) + `Cl₂`(gas) → H(solvent).\n    *   A common industrial reaction that fits this perfectly is the formation of sulfuryl chloride:\n        *   `SO₂ + Cl₂ → SO₂Cl₂`\n    *   This identifies:\n        *   **D** = `SO₂` (Sulfur dioxide), a gas.\n        *   **H** = `SO₂Cl₂` (Sulfuryl chloride), a liquid used as a specialty solvent.\n\n5.  **Reaction 2 - Identifying E:** \"C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.\"\n    *   Plugging in our identified compounds: `ICl₃` (C) + 2 `SO₂` (D) → E\n    *   `ICl₃` is a strong chlorinating agent. It can react with `SO₂` to form `SO₂Cl₂`.\n    *   The problem describes E as an \"extremely hazardous product\". `SO₂Cl₂` (sulfuryl chloride) fits this description, as it is corrosive and reacts violently with water.\n    *   It's plausible that E and H are the same substance (`SO₂Cl₂`), referred to differently based on its role in the puzzle (a reaction product vs. a solvent). The reaction consumes D to produce E.\n\n6.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E:**\n    *   We have identified **E** as **`SO₂Cl₂`** (sulfuryl chloride).\n    *   The `SO₂Cl₂` molecule has a central sulfur atom bonded to two oxygen atoms and two chlorine atoms in a distorted tetrahedral geometry.\n    *   Let's analyze its symmetry elements:\n        *   There is a twofold rotational axis (C₂) that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects both the O-S-O angle and the Cl-S-Cl angle.\n        *   There are two mutually perpendicular mirror planes (σᵥ) that contain the C₂ axis. One plane contains the Cl-S-Cl atoms, and the other contains the O-S-O atoms.\n    *   The presence of one C₂ axis and two vertical mirror planes defines the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\n7.  **Final Answer:** The molecular symmetry group of E (`SO₂Cl₂`) is C₂ᵥ, which corresponds to option D.\n\n```python\n# Based on the chemical deductions, the identities of the compounds are:\n# A = I₂ (Iodine)\n# B = Cl₂ (Chlorine)\n# C = ICl₃ (Iodine trichloride)\n# D = SO₂ (Sulfur dioxide)\n# H = SO₂Cl₂ (Sulfuryl chloride)\n# F = HCl (Hydrochloric acid)\n# G = HIO₃ (Iodic acid)\n# E is the product of the reaction: C + 2D -> E\n# ICl₃ + 2SO₂ -> E\n# The hazardous product E is SO₂Cl₂ (Sulfuryl chloride).\n\n# The task is to find the molecular symmetry group of E (SO₂Cl₂).\n# SO₂Cl₂ has a distorted tetrahedral structure, similar to dichloromethane (CH₂Cl₂).\n# It has a C₂ rotational axis and two perpendicular mirror planes containing that axis.\n# This set of symmetry elements corresponds to the C₂ᵥ point group.\n\n# The options are:\n# A) C2\n# B) D∞h\n# C) D4h\n# D) C2v\n\n# Our deduced symmetry is C2v.\n\nchoice = 'D'\nprint(f\"The identity of the extremely hazardous product E is SO2Cl2 (sulfuryl chloride).\")\nprint(f\"The molecular geometry of SO2Cl2 is a distorted tetrahedron.\")\nprint(f\"It possesses a C2 axis and two vertical mirror planes.\")\nprint(f\"This corresponds to the C2v point group.\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, the correct option is {choice}.\")\n```\n<<<D>>>"
