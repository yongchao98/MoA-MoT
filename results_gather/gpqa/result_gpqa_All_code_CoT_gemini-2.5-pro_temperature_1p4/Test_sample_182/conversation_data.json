    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the final product:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant:** The starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. We first need to determine its carbon skeleton.\n    *   `cyclohex`: A 6-carbon ring.\n    *   `carboxylic acid`: Adds 1 carbon (-COOH).\n    *   `formyl`: Adds 1 carbon (-CHO).\n    *   `vinyl`: Adds 2 carbons (-CH=CH2).\n    *   The total number of carbon atoms in the molecule is 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10.\n\n2.  **Understand the Reaction:** The reagent is red phosphorus with an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a powerful reducing agent known for the complete reduction of almost all oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds to their corresponding alkanes.\n    *   The `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The `formyl` group (-CHO) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The `vinyl` group's double bond (-CH=CH2) will be reduced to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n    *   The `cyclohexene` ring's double bond will be reduced to a single bond, resulting in a `cyclohexane` ring.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product:** The reaction will preserve the original carbon skeleton but will remove all oxygen atoms and saturate all multiple bonds. The product will be a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon with 10 carbon atoms (a substituted cyclohexane).\n\n4.  **Calculate the IHD of the Product:** The general molecular formula for a saturated monocyclic alkane (like a substituted cyclohexane) is CnH2n. Since our product has 10 carbon atoms (n=10), its molecular formula will be C10H20. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) can be calculated using the formula:\n    `IHD = C - H/2 + 1` (for a hydrocarbon).\n    The IHD of 1 corresponds to the single ring structure in the final product.\n\nThe Python code below will perform the calculation based on this logic.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for the product of a chemical reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Determine the number of carbon atoms in the reactant.\n    # Reactant: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\n    c_in_ring = 6\n    c_in_cooh = 1\n    c_in_cho = 1\n    c_in_vinyl = 2\n    total_carbons = c_in_ring + c_in_cooh + c_in_cho + c_in_vinyl\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the molecular formula of the product.\n    # The reaction with red P and excess HI is a complete reduction.\n    # It converts the reactant to its corresponding saturated monocyclic alkane.\n    # The general formula for a saturated monocyclic alkane is CnH2n.\n    product_carbons = total_carbons\n    product_hydrogens = 2 * product_carbons\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n    # IHD = C - H/2 + 1 (for a molecule with only C and H)\n    ihd_product = product_carbons - (product_hydrogens / 2) + 1\n    \n    # Step 4: Print the final answer.\n    # The options are A) 3, B) 0, C) 1, D) 5\n    print(f\"The number of carbon atoms in the reactant is {total_carbons}.\")\n    print(f\"The reaction with red P + HI reduces the compound to a saturated monocyclic alkane.\")\n    print(f\"The molecular formula of the saturated monocyclic product is C{product_carbons}H{product_hydrogens}.\")\n    print(f\"The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) is calculated as: C - H/2 + 1\")\n    print(f\"IHD = {product_carbons} - ({product_hydrogens}/2) + 1 = {int(ihd_product)}\")\n    print(\"This IHD of 1 corresponds to the single ring in the product molecule.\")\n    print(\"Comparing with the options:\")\n    print(\"A) 3\")\n    print(\"B) 0\")\n    print(\"C) 1\")\n    print(\"D) 5\")\n    print(\"The correct option is C.\")\n\nsolve_chemistry_problem()\n<<<C>>>\n```"
