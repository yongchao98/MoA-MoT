    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Process:** The problem describes a two-step (cascade) decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state |3,0,0⟩ to the final state |1,0,0⟩. This happens via an intermediate state. The options suggest the intermediate state is of the form |2,1,m'⟩.\n\n2.  **Recall Selection Rules:** For an electric dipole (E1) transition, the selection rules for the quantum numbers are:\n    *   Δl = ±1\n    *   Δm = 0, ±1\n\n3.  **Validate the Transition Steps:**\n    *   **Step 1:** |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩\n        *   Initial state (i): n=3, l=0, m=0.\n        *   Intermediate state (m'): n=2, l=1, m'={-1, 0, 1}.\n        *   Δl = 1 - 0 = +1. This is allowed.\n        *   Δm = m' - 0 = m'. For m' = -1, 0, 1, this is allowed.\n        *   So, transitions to |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩ are all possible.\n\n    *   **Step 2:** |2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n        *   Intermediate state (m'): n=2, l=1, m'={-1, 0, 1}.\n        *   Final state (f): n=1, l=0, m=0.\n        *   Δl = 0 - 1 = -1. This is allowed.\n        *   Δm = 0 - m'. For m' = -1, 0, 1, this is allowed.\n        *   So, all the proposed routes are valid according to selection rules.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability of Each Route:** The question asks for the probability of a specific route. In a cascade decay, this is the branching ratio for that specific path.\n    *   The total process is the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state. This state can only decay via single-photon emission to a state with l=1. The problem specifies the intermediate state has n=2, so we consider the decay |3s⟩ → |2p⟩.\n    *   The initial state |3,0,0⟩ (or 3s) is spherically symmetric (l=0). Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction of emission. Therefore, the decay will populate the three magnetic sublevels of the |2p⟩ state (|2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩) with equal probability.\n    *   The total probability of decaying from |3s⟩ to |2p⟩ is 1 (as it's the only path considered). This probability is split equally among the three possible intermediate `m'` states.\n    *   Probability (branching ratio) for |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ is 1/3.\n    *   Probability (branching ratio) for |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ is 1/3.\n    *   Probability (branching ratio) for |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ is 1/3.\n    *   Once the atom is in any of the |2,1,m'⟩ states, it decays to |1,0,0⟩. This is the only allowed decay path from the 2p state (Lyman-alpha transition), so the probability of this second step is 1.\n    *   The total probability for a specific route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n    *   Probability for route via m'=0: P = P(step 1) * P(step 2) = (1/3) * 1 = 1/3.\n    *   Similarly, the probability for the routes via m'=+1 and m'=-1 are also 1/3 each.\n\n5.  **Match with Options:** We need to find the option that matches our calculation.\n    *   A) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4. (Incorrect, should be 1/3)\n    *   B) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4. (Incorrect, should be 1/3)\n    *   C) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 2/3. (Incorrect)\n    *   D) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/3. (Correct)\n\n```python\n# The problem asks for the transition route and corresponding probability for the\n# H-atom decay from |3,0,0> to |1,0,0> via a two-dipole transition,\n# with the intermediate state being |2,1,m'>.\n\n# 1. The initial state is |n=3, l=0, m=0>, which is an s-state.\n# An s-state is spherically symmetric.\n\n# 2. The first step of the decay is |3,0,0> -> |2,1,m'>.\n# Because the initial state is spherically symmetric, there is no preferred\n# orientation for the decay. This means the decay populates each of the possible\n# magnetic sublevels (m' = -1, 0, +1) of the intermediate l=1 state with\n# equal probability.\n\n# 3. There are three possible intermediate states: |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>.\nnum_intermediate_states = 3\n\n# 4. The total probability of transitioning to one of these states is 1.\n# Since each is equally likely, the probability of transitioning to any specific\n# one of them is 1 divided by the number of states.\nprob_step1 = 1.0 / num_intermediate_states\n\n# 5. The second step of the decay is from the intermediate state |2,1,m'>\n# to the final state |1,0,0>. For the n=2 state, the only allowed single-photon\n# decay is to the n=1 ground state. Thus, the probability of this step is 1.\nprob_step2 = 1.0\n\n# 6. The total probability of a specific route (e.g., via the m'=0 intermediate state)\n# is the product of the probabilities of each step.\ntotal_prob = prob_step1 * prob_step2\n\n# 7.

This matches the calculation.\n\n# We will choose option D. The probability can be represented as a fraction.\nprobability_numerator = 1\nprobability_denominator = 3\ncorrect_choice = 'D'\n\nprint(f\"The correct option is {correct_choice}.\")\nprint(f\"The transition route is |3,0,0> -> |2,1,0> -> |1,0,0>.\")\nprint(f\"The corresponding probability is {probability_numerator}/{probability_denominator}, which is approximately {total_prob:.4f}.\")\nprint(f\"Comparing this with the options provided:\")\nprint(f\"A) |3,0,0> -> |2,1,1> -> |1,0,0> and 1/4\")\nprint(f\"B) |3,0,0> -> |2,1,-1> -> |1,0,0> and 1/4\")\nprint(f\"C) |3,0,0> -> |2,1,0> -> |1,0,0> and 2/3\")\nprint(f\"D) |3,0,0> -> |2,1,0> -> |1,0,0> and 1/3\")\nprint(f\"The analysis confirms that option D is the correct choice.\")\nprint(\"The final choice is D.\")\n```\n<<<D>>>"
