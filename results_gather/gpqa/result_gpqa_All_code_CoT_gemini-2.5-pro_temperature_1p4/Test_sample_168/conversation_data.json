    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Nature of the Energy Spectrum (Continuous vs. Discrete)**\n    *   In a particle decay, the conservation of energy and momentum dictates the energies of the final particles.\n    *   If a decay results in only two particles in the final state, their energies are uniquely determined, leading to a discrete energy spectrum (a sharp energy peak).\n    *   If a decay results in three or more particles in the final state, the available energy (the Q-value) can be distributed among them in a continuous range of possibilities. This results in a continuous energy spectrum for any of the outgoing particles.\n    *   The original decay is `2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V`. The final state contains multiple particles (at least 4 different product types if we group identical particles). This is why its spectrum is continuous.\n    *   The variant decay is `2A -> 2B + 2E + M`. The final state also contains multiple particles (`2B`, `2E`, `M`). Since there are more than two particles in the final state, the energy spectrum of the `2E` particles must remain **continuous**. This eliminates options A and C.\n\n2.  **Compare the Endpoint of the Spectrum**\n    *   The endpoint of the energy spectrum is the maximum possible energy that the `2E` particles can have. This maximum energy is directly related to the total energy released in the decay, called the Q-value.\n    *   The Q-value is the initial rest mass energy minus the final rest mass energy: `Q = (m_initial - m_final) * c^2`.\n    *   Let's compare the Q-values for the two decays. The initial mass (`2*m_A`) is the same for both. We only need to compare the final masses.\n        *   `m_final (original) = 2*m_B + 2*m_E + 2*m_V`\n        *   `m_final (variant) = 2*m_B + 2*m_E + m_M`\n    *   We are given that particle M is massless (`m_M = 0`). The particles V it replaces (likely neutrinos) have a small but non-zero rest mass (`m_V > 0`).\n    *   Therefore, `m_final (variant)` is less than `m_final (original)`.\n    *   Since the final mass is lower in the variant decay, more mass is converted into energy. This means the Q-value for the variant decay is larger than for the original decay.\n    *   A larger Q-value means a higher maximum energy is available for the final particles. Thus, the endpoint of the energy spectrum of the `2E` particles **increases**.\n\n3.  **Conclusion**\n    *   The spectrum remains **continuous**, and the endpoint **increases**. The shape of the spectrum will also be adjusted due to the different kinematics of the final state. This corresponds to option D.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Backup original stdout\noriginal_stdout = sys.stdout\n# Redirect stdout to a string buffer\nsys.stdout = captured_output = io.StringIO()\n\nprint(\"Step-by-step analysis:\")\nprint(\"1.
