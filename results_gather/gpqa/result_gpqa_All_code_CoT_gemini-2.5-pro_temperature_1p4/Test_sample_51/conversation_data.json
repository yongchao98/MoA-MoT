    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Principle**: The problem deals with the population of atomic energy levels in a stellar photosphere assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This means we can use the Boltzmann equation to describe the ratio of atoms in different energy states.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Boltzmann Equation**: The ratio of the number of atoms in an upper energy level (level 2) to a lower energy level (level 1) is given by:\n    `N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n    where:\n    *   `N₂`, `N₁` are the number of atoms in level 2 and 1.\n    *   `g₂`, `g₁` are the statistical weights of the levels.\n    *   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Set Up the Factor Calculation**: The question asks for the factor by which this ratio changes when comparing the no-spot case to the spot case. Let's define this factor as:\n    `Factor = (Ratio at T_nospots) / (Ratio at T_spots)`\n    `Factor = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots)) ]`\n    The statistical weights `(g₂/g₁)` cancel out. Using the properties of exponents (`exp(a)/exp(b) = exp(a-b)`), the formula simplifies to:\n    `Factor = exp( (ΔE / k) * (1 / T_spots - 1 / T_nospots) )`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE)**: The energy difference `ΔE` can be found from the wavelength `λ` of the transition using the formula `ΔE = h * c / λ`, where `h` is Planck's constant and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n5.  **Gather Constants and Variables**:\n    *   Temperature without spots, `T_nospots` = 6000 K\n    *   Temperature with spots, `T_spots` = 5500 K\n    *   Wavelength, `λ` = 1448 Å = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   Planck's constant, `h` ≈ 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   Boltzmann constant, `k` ≈ 1.381 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n    *   Speed of light, `c` ≈ 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s\n\n6.  **Execute the Calculation**: Substitute all the values into the simplified factor formula and compute the result using a Python script. Finally, compare the calculated factor with the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define physical constants in SI units.\nh = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck's constant in J·s\nc = 2.99792458e8   # Speed of light in m/s\nk = 1.380649e-23   # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n\n# Step 2: Define the given parameters from the problem.\nT_nospots = 6000.0  # Temperature without spots in Kelvin\nT_spots = 5500.0    # Temperature with spots in Kelvin\nlambda_A = 1448.0   # Transition wavelength in Angstroms\n\n# Step 3: Convert wavelength from Angstroms to meters.\nlambda_m = lambda_A * 1e-10\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the energy difference (ΔE) for the transition.\ndelta_E = (h * c) / lambda_m\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the factor using the simplified Boltzmann ratio formula.\n# Factor = exp( (ΔE / k) * (1 / T_spots - 1 / T_nospots) )\nexponent = (delta_E / k) * (1 / T_spots - 1 / T_nospots)\nfactor = math.exp(exponent)\n\n# Step 6: Print the result and compare with the options.\nprint(\"Calculating the factor by which the population ratio changes...\")\nprint(f\"The calculated factor is: {factor:.4f}\")\nprint(\"\\nProvided Options:\")\nprint(\"A) ~4.5\")\nprint(\"B) ~1.1\")\nprint(\"C) ~2.9\")\nprint(\"D) ~7.8\")\n\noptions = {'A': 4.5, 'B': 1.1, 'C': 2.9, 'D': 7.8}\n# Find the option with the minimum absolute difference from the calculated factor\nclosest_option_key = min(options, key=lambda key: abs(options[key] - factor))\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated value is closest to option {closest_option_key}.\")\n```\n<<<A>>>"
