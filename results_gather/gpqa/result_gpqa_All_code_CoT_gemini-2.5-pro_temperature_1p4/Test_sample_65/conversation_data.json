    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as an extension of the Standard Model (SM) by adding higher-dimensional operators. These operators must respect the fundamental symmetries of the underlying framework, which is a relativistic quantum field theory. Let's analyze each symmetry:\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry**: The Standard Model is a relativistic quantum field theory, meaning it is invariant under Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts). SMEFT is built upon this foundation, so all operators must be Lorentz scalars, constructed from fields that transform in well-defined ways under the Lorentz group. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.\n\n2.  **Poincaré symmetry**: This is a broader spacetime symmetry that includes Lorentz transformations and spacetime translations. As with Lorentz symmetry, it is a foundational principle of the Standard Model and any consistent relativistic quantum field theory. Consequently, all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincaré symmetry.\n\n3.  **CP symmetry**: This is the combination of Charge Conjugation (C) and Parity (P) transformations. While the strong and electromagnetic interactions of the Standard Model conserve CP, the weak interaction violates it. SMEFT is designed to parameterize all possible new physics effects, including new sources of CP violation. Therefore, SMEFT operators are *not* required to respect CP symmetry; in fact, some operators are specifically constructed to describe CP-violating interactions.\n\n4.  **CPT symmetry**: The CPT theorem states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the combined CPT transformation. Since SMEFT is constructed as such a theory, it must respect CPT symmetry.\n\nBased on this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4).\n\n```python\n# The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an effective field theory\n# that extends the Standard Model with higher-dimensional operators.\n# These operators are constructed under the assumption that the fundamental principles of\n# relativistic quantum field theory hold.
