    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Transit Condition:** For a planet to transit its star, its projected path across the star's face must overlap with the star's disk. The limiting case for this is a \"grazing transit,\" where the edge of the planet just touches the edge of the star at the point of closest approach. The impact parameter `b` is the projected distance between the center of the planet and the center of the star, measured in units of the star's radius. The maximum impact parameter (`b_max`) for a transit to occur is `b_max = (R_star + R_planet) / R_star = 1 + (R_planet / R_star)`.\n\n2.  **Relate Impact Parameter, Period, and Semi-Major Axis:**\n    *   The problem states that both planets share the same orbital plane, which means their orbital inclination (`i`) relative to our line of sight is identical.\n    *   The impact parameter is defined as `b = (a * cos(i)) / R_star`, where `a` is the semi-major axis of the orbit.\n    *   Since `cos(i)` and `R_star` are the same for both planets, we can say that `b` is directly proportional to `a`. This gives us the relation: `b2 / b1 = a2 / a1`.\n    *   Kepler's Third Law states that `P^2` is proportional to `a^3` (where `P` is the orbital period). Therefore, `a` is proportional to `P^(2/3)`. This gives us the relation: `a2 / a1 = (P2 / P1)^(2/3)`.\n\n3.  **Combine the Relations:** By combining the two relationships from the previous step, we get a direct link between the impact parameters and periods of the two planets:\n    `b2 / b1 = (P2 / P1)^(2/3)`\n\n4.  **Solve for the Maximum Period (P2_max):**\n    *   First, calculate the maximum allowable impact parameter for Planet 2 (`b2_max`) using the transit condition from Step 1. We will need to convert the planet and star radii to the same units. We'll use the standard astronomical ratio of the Sun's radius to the Earth's radius (`R_sun â‰ˆ 109.2 * R_earth`).\n    *   Rearrange the combined formula to solve for `P2_max`:\n        `P2_max = P1 * (b2_max / b1)^(3/2)`\n    *   Substitute all the known values to calculate the final answer.\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value will be compared against the given choices to find the closest one.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given Data ---\n# Planet 1\nP1 = 3.0  # days\nb1 = 0.2  # dimensionless impact parameter\n\n# Planet 2\nR_p2_in_Rearth = 2.5  # in Earth radii\n\n# Star\nR_s_in_Rsun = 1.5  # in Sun radii\n\n# --- Astronomical Constants ---\n# Ratio of Sun's radius to Earth's radius\nR_sun_to_R_earth_ratio = 109.2\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate the maximum impact parameter for Planet 2 (b2_max) ---\n# For a transit to occur, b must be <= 1 + (R_planet / R_star).\n# We need R_p2 and R_s in the same units.
