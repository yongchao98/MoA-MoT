    "To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, we must check two conditions for each star: its position in the sky (declination) and its brightness (apparent V magnitude).\n\n**1. Brightness Condition**\nA star can be observed by both instruments only if it is bright enough for the less sensitive of the two.\n*   ESPRESSO limiting magnitude: V < 17 mag\n*   HIRES limiting magnitude: V < 16 mag\n*   Condition for *both*: **V < 16.0 mag**\n\n**2. Position (Declination) Condition**\nA star must be visible from both the Paranal Observatory in the Southern Hemisphere and the Keck Observatory in the Northern Hemisphere. The prompt asks to disregard pointing limits like minimum elevation, so we assume the telescopes can observe right down to the horizon.\n*   Paranal Observatory is at a latitude of approximately -24.6°. It can observe stars with a declination north of -90° and south of (90° - 24.6°) = +65.4°.\n*   W. M. Keck Observatory is at a latitude of approximately +19.8°. It can observe stars with a declination south of +90° and north of -(90° - 19.8°) = -70.2°.\n*   For a star to be visible from both, its declination (DEC) must be in the overlapping range: **-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°**.\n\n**3. Star-by-Star Analysis**\n\nThe apparent magnitude (m) is calculated from the absolute magnitude (M), distance in parsecs (d), and total absorption in V-band (A_V) using the formula: **m = M + 5*log₁₀(d) - 5 + A_V**. The absorption A_V is calculated as 3.1 * E(B-V).\n\n*   **Star1:**\n    *   **Position:** DEC = -75°. This is south of the -70.2° limit for Keck. **Not observable.**\n\n*   **Star2:**\n    *   **Position:** DEC = 55°. This is within the observable range for both.\n    *   **Brightness:** Apparent V magnitude = 16.5 mag. This is fainter than the required V < 16.0 mag. **Not observable.**\n\n*   **Star3:**\n    *   **Position:** DEC = 48°. This is within the observable range for both.\n    *   **Brightness:** Apparent V magnitude = 15.5 mag. This is brighter than 16.0 mag. **Observable.**\n\n*   **Star4:**\n    *   **Position:** DEC = -48°. This is within the observable range for both.\n    *   **Brightness:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude.\n        *   A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag.\n        *   m_V = M_V + 5*log₁₀(d) - 5 + A_V = 15.5 + 5*log₁₀(10) - 5 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag.\n        *   This is fainter than 16.0 mag. **Not observable.**\n\n*   **Star5:**\n    *   **Position:** DEC = 60°. This is within the observable range for both.\n    *   **Brightness:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude.\n        *   m_V = M_V + 5*log₁₀(d) - 5 = 16.5 + 5*log₁₀(5) - 5 ≈ 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = 14.995 mag.\n        *   This is brighter than 16.0 mag. **Observable.**\n\nBased on this analysis, only Star 3 and Star 5 meet both the position and brightness criteria to be observed by both spectrographs.\n\n<<<B>>>"
