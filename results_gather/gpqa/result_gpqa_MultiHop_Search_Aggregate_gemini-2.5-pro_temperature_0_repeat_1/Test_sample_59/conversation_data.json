    "To determine the time elapsed for the astronaut, we need to use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\nFirst, we must establish the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The LMC is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, and its distance from Earth is approximately 163,000 light-years. Some estimates place it slightly closer, around 160,000 light-years. For our calculation, we will use a distance (L₀) of about 160,000 light-years, as it aligns well with the provided options.\n\nThe spacecraft travels at a constant speed (v) of 0.99999987 * c, where c is the speed of light.\n\n**1. Calculate the time of the journey from Earth's frame of reference (Δt):**\nThe time it would take as measured by an observer on Earth is the distance divided by the speed.\nΔt = L₀ / v = 160,000 light-years / (0.99999987 * c) ≈ 160,000.02 years.\n\n**2. Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\nThe Lorentz factor is a key component in time dilation calculations and is determined by the spacecraft's velocity.\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.99999987²)\nγ ≈ 1 / √(0.00000026)\nγ ≈ 1 / 0.0005099\nγ ≈ 1961.16\n\n**3. Calculate the time experienced by the astronaut (Δt₀):**\nTime dilation means that time for the moving astronaut passes slower than for the stationary observer on Earth. The formula is:\nΔt₀ = Δt / γ\nΔt₀ ≈ 160,000.02 years / 1961.16\nΔt₀ ≈ 81.58 years\n\nThis elapsed time of approximately 81.6 years is from the astronaut's perspective.\n\n**4. Determine the astronaut's age upon arrival:**\nThe astronaut was 22 years old at the start of the journey.\nAge upon arrival = 22 years + 81.58 years = 103.58 years.\n\nSince the average lifetime of the alien species is 150 years, the astronaut will survive the journey, arriving at an age of roughly 104 years.\n\nThe calculated travel time for the astronaut (≈81.6 years) is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
