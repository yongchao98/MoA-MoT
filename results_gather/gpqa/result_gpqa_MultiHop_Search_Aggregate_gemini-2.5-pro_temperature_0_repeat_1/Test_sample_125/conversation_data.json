    "### Analysis of the Reactions and Products\n\n**Reaction I:**\nThe starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, a chiral ketone. It is treated with lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. The reduction of the ketone at the C3 position creates a new stereocenter. Since there is a pre-existing stereocenter at C5, the hydride attack on the carbonyl group is not equally probable from both faces. This results in the formation of two diastereomers: (3S,5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R,5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n\n**Reaction II:**\nThe starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, an achiral diketone. It is treated with excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4), which reduces both ketone groups to alcohols. This reaction creates two new stereocenters at positions C2 and C4. The possible products are (2R,4R)-pentane-2,4-diol, (2S,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, and (2R,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. The (2R,4R) and (2S,4S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers. The (2R,4S) isomer is a meso compound, as it has an internal plane of symmetry and is achiral. Therefore, Reaction II produces a total of three stereoisomers.\n\n### Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe final mixture that is analyzed contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3S,5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R,5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R,4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso compound)\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC:**\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated.\n*   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n\nIn the product mixture:\n*   The two products from Reaction I, (3S,5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R,5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair, (2R,4R)- and (2S,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will co-elute as a **single peak**.\n*   The meso compound, (2R,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, is a diastereomer to the other two products of Reaction II and will be separated, giving a **second peak** from this reaction's products.\n*   The products from Reaction I (methoxyhexanols) are structurally distinct from the products of Reaction II (pentanediols) and will have different retention times.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks observed in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram will be 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC:**\nChiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with each stereoisomer, allowing for the separation of enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   The column will separate the two diastereomers from Reaction I.\n*   The column will separate the two enantiomers and the meso compound from Reaction II.\n\nSince there are five distinct stereoisomers in the mixture, and a chiral column can resolve all of them, the chemist will observe **5 peaks**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis leads to the following conclusion:\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
