    "The step-by-step synthesis is as follows:\n\n1.  **Benzene to Product 1 (Nitrobenzene):** Benzene is treated with a mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4). This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction known as nitration. The sulfuric acid protonates the nitric acid to form the nitronium ion (NO2+), which is a strong electrophile. The nitronium ion then reacts with benzene to form nitrobenzene.\n\n2.  **Product 1 to Product 2 (3-Bromonitrobenzene):** Nitrobenzene is treated with bromine (Br2) and iron powder (which acts as a catalyst to form FeBr3, a Lewis acid). The nitro group (-NO2) is a deactivating and meta-directing group for electrophilic aromatic substitution. This means the incoming bromine atom will be directed to the position meta to the nitro group, resulting in 3-bromonitrobenzene.\n\n3.  **Product 2 to Product 3 (3-Bromoaniline):** 3-Bromonitrobenzene is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H2). This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction that reduces the nitro group (-NO2) to an amino group (-NH2). The product is 3-bromoaniline.\n\n4.  **Product 3 to Product 4 (3-Bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate):** 3-Bromoaniline is treated with sodium nitrite (NaNO2) and tetrafluoroboric acid (HBF4). This is a diazotization reaction. The amino group is converted into a diazonium salt, forming 3-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate.\n\n5.  **Product 4 to Product 5 (3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl):** The diazonium salt is heated and then treated with anisole (methoxybenzene). This reaction is a Gomberg-Bachmann reaction, which involves the coupling of a diazonium salt with another aromatic compound to form a biaryl. The 3-bromobenzenediazonium salt forms a 3-bromophenyl radical. Anisole has a methoxy group (-OCH3), which is an activating, ortho-, para-directing group. The incoming 3-bromophenyl group will preferentially add to the para position of the anisole ring due to less steric hindrance. This results in the final product, 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl.\n\nTherefore, the final product matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
