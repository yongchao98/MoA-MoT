    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of a *trans*-alkene like (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA is a stereospecific *syn*-addition. This means the oxygen atom adds to both carbons of the double bond from the same face. Since the attack can occur from either the top or bottom face with equal probability, a racemic mixture of *trans*-epoxides is formed. These are the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers of 4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening.** The subsequent treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) opens the epoxide ring. This is an *anti*-addition, where the water molecule attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite the epoxide oxygen.\n    *   The attack on the (4R,5R)-epoxide results in the formation of (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The attack on the (4S,5S)-epoxide also results in the formation of (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    This product, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, is a *meso* compound because it has a plane of symmetry and is achiral, despite having two chiral centers. Therefore, Reaction 1 produces a single product: the meso-diol.\n\n### **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of a *cis*-alkene like (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA is also a stereospecific *syn*-addition. This results in the formation of a *cis*-epoxide. Because the starting alkene is symmetrical, the resulting epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane, is a *meso* compound.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening.** The acid-catalyzed ring opening of this meso-epoxide proceeds via *anti*-addition.\n    *   Attack of water at one carbon of the epoxide leads to the (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon leads to the (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    These two products are enantiomers. Since the attack on the symmetrical meso-epoxide is equally likely at either carbon, Reaction 2 produces a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n*   (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (the *meso* compound from Reaction 1)\n*   A racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\n### **Chromatographic Observation**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:** Standard HPLC columns separate compounds based on properties like polarity but cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n    *   Enantiomers, such as the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will therefore elute together as a single peak.\n    *   The *meso*-diol is a diastereomer of the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols. Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated by standard HPLC.\n    *   Consequently, the chemist will observe **two peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:** Chiral HPLC columns contain a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The chiral column will separate the (4R,5R)-diol from its enantiomer, the (4S,5S)-diol.\n    *   The meso-diol, being a diastereomer to the other two, will also be separated.\n    *   Therefore, the chemist will observe **three peaks**: one for the meso compound, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<A>>>"
