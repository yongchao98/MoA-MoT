    "### Part A: Tautomerism\n\n**Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione vs. Benzoquinone**\n\nTautomerism is a type of isomerism where isomers can interconvert by a chemical reaction. In keto-enol tautomerism, a molecule containing a carbonyl group (a ketone) is in equilibrium with its enol form (an alcohol adjacent to a double bond). A key requirement for this to occur is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has three ketone groups. The carbon atoms between these groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are alpha-carbons, and they each have hydrogen atoms. These alpha-hydrogens allow the compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), is particularly stable because it is an aromatic compound. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily shows tautomerism.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (specifically p-benzoquinone):** This molecule has a six-membered ring with two ketone groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent to the ketone groups are part of these double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. Without alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\n**Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate vs. Dimethyl fumarate**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. The most common feature leading to chirality is a chiral center, typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (at position 2) is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  a hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  a methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  an ester group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule has the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the arrangement around the central carbon-carbon double bond is trans. The molecule does not contain any carbon atom bonded to four different groups, so it has no chiral center. The molecule possesses a center of symmetry and is therefore achiral, meaning it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B) that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
