    "The problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) for a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. They are the complete, relativistically correct solutions to Maxwell's equations for a point charge in arbitrary motion.\n\nThe potentials are evaluated at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ and time $t$, but they depend on the properties of the charge at an earlier \"retarded\" time, $t_r$. This is the time at which the electromagnetic field must have been generated by the charge to reach the observer at the later time $t$.\n\nThe derivation of these potentials involves integrating the retarded potentials for a continuous charge and current distribution, specialized to the case of a point charge. A key part of the derivation involves a factor that accounts for the change in the effective volume of the charge distribution due to its motion relative to the observer.\n\nThe standard expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n\nThe scalar potential V is given by:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nAnd the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ is given by:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nHere, all the quantities in the brackets on the right-hand side are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$. The vector $\\vec{d}$ is the vector from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$, and $\\vec{v}$ is the charge's velocity at $t_r$.\n\nTo match the format of the given options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator inside the brackets by $c$:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nFor the vector potential, we can use the relationship $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$. Applying this to the expression for V:\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\left( \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\dfrac{q c \\vec{v}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o c^2 (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nUsing the relation $c^2 = \\frac{1}{\\mu_o \\epsilon_o}$, we get $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_o c^2} = \\mu_o$. Substituting this in:\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions for $V(\\vec{r},t)$ and $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t)$ match exactly with option A.\n\n*   Option B has the wrong sign in the denominator, which would correspond to an \"advanced\" potential that violates causality.\n*   Option C uses the static Coulomb potential for V, which is incorrect as it does not account for the motion of the charge and the retardation effect in the denominator.\n*   Option D also uses the incorrect static potential and has an incorrect form for the vector potential.\n\nTherefore, option A provides the correct formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<A>>>"
