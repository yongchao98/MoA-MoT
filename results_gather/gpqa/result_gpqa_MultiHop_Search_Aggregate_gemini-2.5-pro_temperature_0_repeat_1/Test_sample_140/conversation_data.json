    "The reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the possible reaction pathways and products:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe strong base, the amide anion (NH2-), abstracts a proton from a position ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such positions:\n*   **Position 6:** This position has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position 2:** This position has a deuterium atom (D), an isotope of hydrogen.\n\nDue to the kinetic isotope effect, the C-H bond is weaker and broken more easily than the C-D bond. However, both abstractions are possible, leading to two different benzyne intermediates:\n\n1.  **Abstraction of H from C6:** The amide ion removes the proton from position 6. The subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from position 1 results in the formation of **3-deuterobenzyne**. The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium remains at position 3 relative to the new triple bond.\n2.  **Abstraction of D from C2:** The amide ion removes the deuteron from position 2. The subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from position 1 forms a non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate. The triple bond is between C1 and C2.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the triple bond in each benzyne intermediate. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Attack on 3-deuterobenzyne:**\n    *   If the amide ion attacks C1, the final product after protonation is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   If the amide ion attacks C6, the final product after protonation is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Attack on benzyne:**\n    *   The attack of the amide ion on either carbon of the non-deuterated benzyne intermediate, followed by protonation, yields only one product: **aniline**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the outcomes from both pathways, three distinct organic products are possible:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuterioaniline\n3.  3-deuterioaniline\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
