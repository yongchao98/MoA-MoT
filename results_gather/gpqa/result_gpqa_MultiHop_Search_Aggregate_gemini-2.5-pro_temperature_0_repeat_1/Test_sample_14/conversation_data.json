    "The initial analysis appears to be correct. The search results confirm the fundamental principles used.\n\n1.  **Transit Probability:** The geometric probability of a transit for a planet in a circular orbit is indeed approximated by the ratio of the stellar radius (R_s) to the planet's semi-major axis (a). Several sources confirm this simple relationship, p ≈ R_s / a, especially when the planet's radius is negligible compared to the star's.\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** The relationship between orbital period (P), semi-major axis (a), and stellar mass (M_s) is described by Kepler's Third Law. The law states that P² is proportional to a³ / M_s. This can be rearranged to show that the semi-major axis 'a' is proportional to (P² * M_s)^(1/3).\n\nThe calculation steps were as follows:\n\n*   The ratio of the transit probabilities is p1 / p2 = (R_s1 / a1) / (R_s2 / a2).\n*   Using the relationships from Kepler's Third Law, this becomes: p1 / p2 = (R_s1 / R_s2) * [(P2² * M_s2) / (P1² * M_s1)]^(1/3).\n*   Substituting the given values:\n    *   R_s1 = R_s2 (Stellar radii are the same)\n    *   P1 = P2 / 3 (Period of Planet_1 is one-third of Planet_2)\n    *   M_s1 = 2 * M_s2 (Mass of Star 1 is twice that of Star 2)\n*   The ratio simplifies to: p1 / p2 = 1 * [ (P2 / (P2/3))² * (M_s2 / (2 * M_s2)) ]^(1/3)\n*   p1 / p2 = [ 3² * (1/2) ]^(1/3)\n*   p1 / p2 = [ 9 * 0.5 ]^(1/3)\n*   p1 / p2 = 4.5^(1/3)\n*   Calculating the cube root of 4.5 gives approximately 1.65.\n\nTherefore, Planet_1 has a transit probability that is about 1.65 times higher than Planet_2. This means the researchers should prefer to observe Planet_1.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\nFinal check of the logic and calculation. Everything seems correct and consistent with the physics principles confirmed by the search.\n\nFinal Answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
