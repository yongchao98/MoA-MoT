    "The interaction described is the creation of an electron-positron pair from the collision of a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) and a photon from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). For this process, $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$, to occur, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame of the two photons must be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the electron and positron combined.\n\nThe threshold energy for this reaction can be calculated using the following formula, which arises from the principles of special relativity. For a head-on collision, the condition is:\n\n$E_{\\gamma} E_{CMB} \\ge (m_e c^2)^2$\n\nWhere:\n*   $E_{\\gamma}$ is the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray.\n*   $E_{CMB}$ is the energy of the CMB photon, given as $10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.\n*   $m_e c^2$ is the rest mass energy of an electron.\n\nThe rest mass energy of an electron ($m_e c^2$) is approximately 0.511 MeV. We need to convert this to eV:\n$m_e c^2 = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n\nNow, we can rearrange the formula to solve for the threshold energy of the gamma-ray, $E_{\\gamma}$:\n\n$E_{\\gamma} \\ge \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n$E_{\\gamma} \\ge \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n\n$E_{\\gamma} \\ge \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n\n$E_{\\gamma} \\ge 0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}$\n\n$E_{\\gamma} \\ge 2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}$\n\nThe question provides the answers in giga-electron-volts (GeV). To convert our result to GeV, we use the conversion $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$:\n\n$E_{\\gamma} \\ge \\frac{2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}}$\n\n$E_{\\gamma} \\ge 2.61121 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis result, approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV, corresponds to option D. Therefore, gamma-rays with energies at or above this threshold will have their lifetimes in the universe significantly limited by pair production with CMB photons.\n\n<<<D>>>"
