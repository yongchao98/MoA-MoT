    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the rest-mass energies of the fragments:**\n\n*   The initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus is M*c² = 300 GeV.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. Therefore, the sum of their rest-mass energies is:\n    m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * Mc² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.\n*   We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other: m₁ = 2m₂. This also means their rest-mass energies are in the same ratio: m₁c² = 2(m₂c²).\n*   Substituting this into the sum: 2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV, which gives 3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV.\n*   Solving for the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n    *   m₂c² = 99 GeV (the less massive fragment)\n    *   m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV (the more massive fragment)\n\n**2. Calculate the total kinetic energy released:**\n\n*   By the principle of conservation of energy, the initial energy (rest-mass energy of the nucleus) must equal the final energy (sum of the rest-mass energies and kinetic energies of the fragments).\n*   E_initial = E_final\n*   Mc² = (m₁c² + T₁) + (m₂c² + T₂)\n*   300 GeV = 297 GeV + T₁ + T₂\n*   The total kinetic energy released is Q = T₁ + T₂ = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV.\n\n**3. Calculate the correct (relativistic) kinetic energy T₁:**\n\n*   Due to the conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the two fragments must fly apart with equal and opposite momenta: |p₁| = |p₂| = p.\n*   The relativistic energy-momentum relation is E² = (pc)² + (mc²)², which can be rearranged to (pc)² = E² - (mc²)². Since E = T + mc², this becomes (pc)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)² = T² + 2T(mc²).\n*   Applying this to both fragments:\n    *   (pc)² = T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₁² + 2T₁(198)\n    *   (pc)² = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(99)\n*   Setting the expressions for (pc)² equal: T₁² + 396T₁ = T₂² + 198T₂.\n*   Substitute T₂ = 3 - T₁:\n    T₁² + 396T₁ = (3 - T₁)² + 198(3 - T₁)\n    T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)\n    396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁\n    600T₁ = 603\n    T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV.\n\n**4. Calculate the kinetic energy T₁ using the classical approximation:**\n\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = p² / (2m).\n*   From the conservation of momentum (p₁ = p₂), we have:\n    T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2.\n*   So, T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical.\n*   The total kinetic energy is T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV.\n*   Substituting T₂_classical: T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV, which gives 3T₁_classical = 3 GeV.\n*   T₁_classical = 1 GeV.\n\n**5. Find the difference:**\n\n*   The difference is ΔT₁ = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical).\n*   ΔT₁ = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV.\n*   Converting to MeV: 0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV.\n\nThe difference between the correct T₁ value and the T₁ value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>"
