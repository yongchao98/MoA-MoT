    "To solve this problem, we need to follow a two-step process. First, we determine the final pH required to keep the iron(III) hydroxide dissolved. Second, we calculate the total amount of acid needed, which includes the acid that reacts with the Fe(OH)3 and the excess acid required to maintain that final pH.\n\n**1. Determine the final pH of the solution**\n\n*   **Reaction for dissolution:** The dissolution of iron(III) hydroxide in acid is represented by the net ionic equation:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n*   **Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃:** The molar mass is approximately 106.87 g/mol.\n\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:** We calculate the moles from the given mass:\n    Moles = 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol = 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n\n*   **Concentration of Fe³⁺:** This amount is dissolved in a total volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L), so the final concentration of iron(III) ions is:\n    [Fe³⁺] = 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol / 0.1 L = 9.357 x 10⁻³ M\n\n*   **Solubility Product (Ksp):** To ensure the Fe(OH)₃ remains dissolved, the ion product must be less than or equal to the Ksp. The equilibrium is:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n    Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³\n    The value of Ksp for Fe(OH)₃ at 25°C varies between sources, but a common value is approximately 2.8 x 10⁻³⁹.\n\n*   **Calculate required [OH⁻] and pH:** We can now calculate the maximum hydroxide concentration that can be present in the solution without causing precipitation.\n    [OH⁻]³ = Ksp / [Fe³⁺] = (2.8 x 10⁻³⁹) / (9.357 x 10⁻³) = 2.993 x 10⁻³⁷ M³\n    [OH⁻] = (2.993 x 10⁻³⁷)^(1/3) ≈ 6.689 x 10⁻¹³ M\n\n    Now, we find the pOH and then the pH (at 25°C, pH + pOH = 14):\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(6.689 x 10⁻¹³) ≈ 12.17\n    pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 12.17 = 1.83\n\n**2. Calculate the volume of acid needed**\n\nThe total amount of strong acid added serves two purposes: neutralizing the hydroxide ions from Fe(OH)₃ and providing the excess H⁺ ions to maintain the final pH.\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ for neutralization:** From the stoichiometry of the reaction, 3 moles of H⁺ are needed for every mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n    Moles H⁺ (reacted) = 3 * (9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol) = 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ to maintain pH:** This is the amount of H⁺ present in the final 100 cm³ solution at the calculated pH.\n    [H⁺] (excess) = 10⁻ᵖᴴ = 10⁻¹·⁸³ ≈ 1.479 x 10⁻² M\n    Moles H⁺ (excess) = [H⁺] * Volume = (1.479 x 10⁻² mol/L) * (0.1 L) = 1.479 x 10⁻³ mol\n\n*   **Total moles of H⁺:**\n    Total Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (reacted) + Moles H⁺ (excess)\n    Total Moles H⁺ = (2.807 x 10⁻³ mol) + (1.479 x 10⁻³ mol) = 4.286 x 10⁻³ mol\n\n*   **Volume of 0.1 M acid:** Finally, we calculate the volume of the 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required.\n    Volume = Total Moles H⁺ / Concentration = (4.286 x 10⁻³ mol) / (0.1 mol/L) = 0.04286 L\n\n*   **Convert volume to cm³:**\n    Volume = 0.04286 L * 1000 cm³/L = 42.86 cm³\n\nReviewing the options provided, none of them match our calculated result (pH 1.83; 42.86 cm³). Let's re-evaluate using a different Ksp value, as this can vary significantly. Some sources cite Ksp as high as 4 x 10⁻³⁸.\n\n**Recalculation with Ksp = 4 x 10⁻³⁸**\n\n*   **[OH⁻] and pH:**\n    [OH⁻]³ = (4 x 10⁻³⁸) / (9.357 x 10⁻³) = 4.275 x 10⁻³⁶ M³\n    [OH⁻] = (4.275 x 10⁻³⁶)^(1/3) ≈ 1.623 x 10⁻¹² M\n    pOH = -log(1.623 x 10⁻¹²) ≈ 11.79\n    pH = 14 - 11.79 = 2.21\n\n*   **Volume of acid:**\n    [H⁺] (excess) = 10⁻²·²¹ ≈ 6.166 x 10⁻³ M\n    Moles H⁺ (excess) = (6.166 x 10⁻³ M) * (0.1 L) = 6.166 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n    Total Moles H⁺ = (2.807 x 10⁻³ mol) + (6.166 x 10⁻⁴ mol) = 3.424 x 10⁻³ mol\n    Volume = (3.424 x 10⁻³ mol) / (0.1 M) = 0.03424 L = 34.24 cm³\n\nThis result (pH 2.21; 34.24 cm³) is closer to option B and A in terms of volume, but the pH is still different. Let's work backwards from the pH given in option B (pH = 2.04).\n\n**Working backwards from Option B (pH = 2.04)**\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ (excess):**\n    [H⁺] = 10⁻²·⁰⁴ ≈ 9.120 x 10⁻³ M\n    Moles H⁺ (excess) = (9.120 x 10⁻³ M) * (0.1 L) = 9.120 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n\n*   **Total moles of H⁺:**\n    Total Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (reacted) + Moles H⁺ (excess)\n    Total Moles H⁺ = (2.807 x 10⁻³ mol) + (9.120 x 10⁻⁴ mol) = 3.719 x 10⁻³ mol\n\n*   **Volume of acid:**\n    Volume = (3.719 x 10⁻³ mol) / (0.1 M) = 0.03719 L = 37.19 cm³\n\nThis volume (37.19 cm³) does not match the volume in option B (28.05 cm³). There seems to be a discrepancy, which might stem from the Ksp value used to generate the problem's options.\n\nLet's re-examine the stoichiometric part. The moles of H+ needed to react is fixed at 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol. The volume for this part alone is:\nVolume (reacted) = (2.807 x 10⁻³ mol) / (0.1 M) = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³.\n\nThis value is extremely close to the volume in option B (28.05 cm³). If we assume this is the intended volume for the reaction part, the remaining volume of acid must provide the excess H+ to maintain the pH. However, the problem states the *total volume* of the final solution is 100 cm³, and the volume of acid is what we need to find. The calculation must account for the total acid added.\n\nLet's assume the values in option B are correct and see if they are consistent.\nIf pH = 2.04 and Volume = 28.05 cm³:\nTotal moles H⁺ added = 0.1 M * 0.02805 L = 2.805 x 10⁻³ mol.\nThis amount is almost exactly what is needed for the stoichiometric reaction (2.807 x 10⁻³ mol). This would leave virtually no excess H⁺ in the solution. If there is no excess H⁺, the pH would be determined by the hydrolysis of Fe³⁺, which would be significantly higher than 2.04.\n\nThere is a fundamental inconsistency in the provided options based on standard chemical principles. However, if forced to choose the \"best\" fit, the calculation for the acid volume required for the stoichiometric reaction (28.07 cm³) points directly to option B. The associated pH of 2.04 is a plausible acidity needed to keep the iron dissolved, even if the calculations don't align perfectly due to varying Ksp values and potential problem setup flaws. The volume match is too precise to be a coincidence.\n\n<<<B>>>"
