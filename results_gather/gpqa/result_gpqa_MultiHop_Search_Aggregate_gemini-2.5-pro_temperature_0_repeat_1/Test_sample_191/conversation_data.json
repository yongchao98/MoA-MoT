    "When a positive charge, +q, is placed inside the cavity of an uncharged spherical conductor, it induces an equal and opposite charge, -q, on the inner surface of the cavity. To maintain the overall neutrality of the conductor, a charge of +q is induced on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\nA key principle of electrostatics is that the electric field inside the material of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is zero. This leads to the phenomenon of electrostatic shielding. The conductor effectively isolates the region outside it from the charges inside the cavity. The electric field at any point outside the conductor is determined solely by the charge distribution on its outer surface.\n\nDue to the spherical symmetry of the outer conductor, the induced charge +q on its outer surface will distribute itself uniformly, regardless of the position of the charge +q within the cavity. This uniform distribution occurs because the charges on the outer surface arrange themselves to be in equilibrium, independent of the shielded inner charges.\n\nAccording to Gauss's Law, the electric field at a point outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere. In this case, the total charge on the outer surface is +q, and it is distributed uniformly. Therefore, for any point P at a distance L from the center of the spherical conductor (where L > R), the electric field is equivalent to that of a point charge +q located at the conductor's center.\n\nThe magnitude of the electric field E at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe other parameters provided, such as the cavity's radius (r), the displacement of the cavity's center (s), the distance from the cavity to point P (l), and the angle Î¸, are irrelevant for calculating the electric field outside the conductor due to the electrostatic shielding effect.\n\nComparing this result with the given options, the correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
