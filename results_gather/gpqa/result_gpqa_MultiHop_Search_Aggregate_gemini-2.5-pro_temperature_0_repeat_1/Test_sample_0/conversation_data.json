    "To clearly distinguish between two quantum energy levels, their energy difference must be greater than the energy uncertainty, or \"width,\" of each level. This energy uncertainty is fundamentally linked to the lifetime of the state by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\nThe principle can be expressed as ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2, where ΔE is the energy uncertainty, Δt is the lifetime of the state, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s). A shorter lifetime results in a larger energy uncertainty, which is often referred to as the natural linewidth of a spectral line.\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy uncertainty for each state:\n\n*   **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime (Δt₁) = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty (ΔE₁) ≈ ħ / Δt₁\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime (Δt₂) = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty (ΔE₂) ≈ ħ / Δt₂\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nFor the two energy levels to be clearly resolved, their energy separation must be larger than the broader of the two linewidths. The state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has the larger energy uncertainty (ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV). Therefore, the energy difference between the two levels must be significantly greater than this value.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n*   A) 10⁻⁹ eV is much smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   B) 10⁻⁸ eV is smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   C) 10⁻⁴ eV is significantly larger than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV is much smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nThe only option that provides a large enough energy difference to clearly distinguish the two levels is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n<<<C>>>"
