    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], among all cobalt-containing species, we must first calculate its mole fraction (α₂) and then convert it to a percentage.\n\nThe formation of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes can be described by the following equilibria and their overall stability constants (β):\n*   Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺; β₁ = 9\n*   Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]; β₂ = 40\n*   Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻; β₃ = 63\n*   Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻; β₄ = 16\n\nThe mole fraction of a specific complex, in this case [Co(SCN)₂], is the ratio of its concentration to the total concentration of all cobalt species. The formula for the mole fraction of the second complex (α₂) is:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nGiven the thiocyanate concentration [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M, we can calculate the terms in the equation:\n*   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n*   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nNow, we substitute these values back into the mole fraction formula. The numerator is the term for the second complex, and the denominator is the sum of all terms.\n\n*   Numerator = 0.4\n*   Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply the mole fraction by 100:\n\nPercentage of [Co(SCN)₂] = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
