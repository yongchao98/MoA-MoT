    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the forbidden transition:\n\n### 1. Define the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a **1S0** state. Let's extract its quantum numbers:\n*   The term symbol is (2S+1)L(J).\n*   **Total Spin (S_i):** 2S_i + 1 = 1  =>  S_i = 0.\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum (L_i):** The letter 'S' corresponds to L_i = 0.\n*   **Total Angular Momentum (J_i):** The subscript is 0, so J_i = 0.\n*   **Parity (P_i):** The parity of a two-nucleon system is given by P = (-1)^L. Therefore, P_i = (-1)^0 = +1.\n\n### 2. Define the Emitted Particle and Final State\n\n*   **Particle X:** It has an intrinsic parity of P_X = -1. Its orbital angular momentum is denoted by a lowercase letter (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3).\n*   **Final NN State:** This state has an isospin T(NN) = 0. Its quantum numbers are S(NN), L(NN), and J(NN). Its parity is P(NN) = (-1)^L(NN).\n\n### 3. Apply Conservation Laws and Constraints\n\nFor a transition to be permitted, it must satisfy three conditions: conservation of angular momentum, conservation of parity, and the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\n**a) Conservation of Angular Momentum:**\nThe total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the vector sum of the angular momenta of the final products.\n**J_initial** = **J_final(NN)** + **l_X**\nSince J_initial = 0, this requires that the magnitudes of the final angular momenta are equal:\n**J(NN) = l_X**\n\n**b) Conservation of Parity:**\nThe total parity of the initial state must equal the product of the parities of the final state particles and their relative orbital motion.\nP_initial = P_final(NN) * P_X * P_relative_motion\nP_relative_motion is the parity of the wavefunction describing the motion of X relative to the final NN system, which is (-1)^l_X.\n+1 = (-1)^L(NN) * (-1) * (-1)^l_X\n+1 = (-1)^(L(NN) + l_X + 1)\nFor this equation to hold, the exponent must be an even number. This means:\n**L(NN) + l_X must be odd.**\n\n**c) Pauli Exclusion Principle:**\nThe problem states that for the final NN state, T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2).\nGiven that T(NN) = 0 for the final state:\n0 = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)\nThis implies that S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 must be an even number, which means:\n**S(NN) + L(NN) must be odd.**\n\n### 4. Evaluate Each Proposed Transition\n\nWe will now check each option against these three conditions. A transition is not permitted if it violates any one of them.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (7D1): S(NN)=3, L(NN)=2, J(NN)=1.\n*   Particle X (p-wave): l_X=1.\n*   **Condition 1 (Ang. Mom.):** Is J(NN) = l_X? Yes, 1 = 1. (✓)\n*   **Condition 2 (Parity):** Is L(NN) + l_X odd? Yes, 2 + 1 = 3. (✓)\n*   **Condition 3 (Pauli):** Is S(NN) + L(NN) odd? Yes, 3 + 2 = 5. (✓)\n*   This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (3P0): S(NN)=1, L(NN)=1, J(NN)=0.\n*   Particle X (s-wave): l_X=0.\n*   **Condition 1 (Ang. Mom.):** Is J(NN) = l_X? Yes, 0 = 0. (✓)\n*   **Condition 2 (Parity):** Is L(NN) + l_X odd? Yes, 1 + 0 = 1. (✓)\n*   **Condition 3 (Pauli):** Is S(NN) + L(NN) odd? No, 1 + 1 = 2 (even). (✗)\n*   This transition is **not permitted** because it violates the Pauli principle.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (3S1): S(NN)=1, L(NN)=0, J(NN)=1.\n*   Particle X (p-wave): l_X=1.\n*   **Condition 1 (Ang. Mom.):** Is J(NN) = l_X? Yes, 1 = 1. (✓)\n*   **Condition 2 (Parity):** Is L(NN) + l_X odd? Yes, 0 + 1 = 1. (✓)\n*   **Condition 3 (Pauli):** Is S(NN) + L(NN) odd? Yes, 1 + 0 = 1. (✓)\n*   This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (3D3): S(NN)=1, L(NN)=2, J(NN)=3.\n*   Particle X (f-wave): l_X=3.\n*   **Condition 1 (Ang. Mom.):** Is J(NN) = l_X? Yes, 3 = 3. (✓)\n*   **Condition 2 (Parity):** Is L(NN) + l_X odd? Yes, 2 + 3 = 5. (✓)\n*   **Condition 3 (Pauli):** Is S(NN) + L(NN) odd? Yes, 1 + 2 = 3. (✓)\n*   This transition is **permitted**.\n\nThe only transition that fails to meet all the required conditions is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
