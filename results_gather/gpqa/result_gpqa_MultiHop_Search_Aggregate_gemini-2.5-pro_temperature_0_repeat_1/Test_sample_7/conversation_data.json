  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n\nA) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nB) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1\nC) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nD) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the experimental results:\n\n1.  **Analyze the single mutants:**\n    *   The wild-type control has 100% resistance.\n    *   `g1` mutant (75% resistance): The loss of gene G1 causes a 25% reduction in resistance. This means G1 contributes to the resistance phenotype.\n    *   `g2` mutant (0% resistance): The loss of gene G2 completely abolishes resistance. This indicates that G2 is an essential gene for this trait.\n    *   `g3` mutant (50% resistance): The loss of gene G3 causes a 50% reduction in resistance, indicating it plays a more significant role than G1 but is not as critical as G2.\n\n2.  **Analyze the double mutants to understand gene interactions (Epistasis):**\n    *   Epistasis is a phenomenon where the effect of one gene masks the effect of another gene at a different locus. To test for epistasis, we compare the phenotype of the double mutant with the phenotypes of the single mutants.\n    *   `g1g2` (0% resistance): The phenotype of this double mutant is identical to the `g2` single mutant's phenotype (0% resistance). This means the effect of the `g2` mutation is masking the effect of the `g1` mutation. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G1**. This suggests G2 acts upstream of G1 in the genetic pathway.\n    *   `g2g3` (0% resistance): Similarly, the phenotype of the `g2g3` double mutant is identical to the `g2` single mutant's phenotype. This means **G2 is also epistatic to G3**, placing it upstream of G3 as well.\n    *   `g1g3` (10% resistance): The phenotype of this double mutant is different from both the `g1` (75%) and `g3` (50%) single mutants. It is a novel, more severe phenotype. This is not epistasis. It suggests that G1 and G3 likely function in parallel pathways or have an additive/synergistic effect on resistance.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the conclusions in the options:**\n    *   **Transcription Factor:** Since G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, and its knockout has the most severe phenotype, it is the most logical candidate for the upstream transcription factor that regulates the expression of G1 and G3.\n    *   **Gene Redundancy:** G1 and G3 are not redundant. In gene redundancy, single knockouts have little to no effect because the other gene compensates. Here, both `g1` and `g3` single mutants have significant and distinct phenotypes.\n    *   **Pleiotropy:** This is when one gene affects multiple traits. The experiment only measures a single trait (anthracnose resistance), so no conclusion can be drawn about pleiotropy.\n    *   **Epistasis between G1 and G3:** As shown above, neither G1 is epistatic to G3 nor is G3 epistatic to G1.\n\n4.  **Assess the given choices:**\n    *   A) Incorrect. G1 and G3 are not redundant, and G1 is not epistatic to G3.\n    *   B) This option states that G1 is a transcription factor (unlikely, G2 is the better candidate), G2 and G3 show pleiotropy (cannot be determined), and **G2 is epistatic towards G1 (Correct)**. This option contains a key conclusion that is directly and correctly supported by the data.\n    *   C) Incorrect. G1 is not epistatic towards G3.\n    *   D) Incorrect. G3 is not epistatic towards G1.\n\nAlthough option B incorrectly identifies G1 as the transcription factor, it is the only option that correctly identifies a valid epistatic relationship shown by the experimental data (`G2 is epistatic towards G1`). The other options make claims about gene redundancy or epistasis between G1 and G3 that are demonstrably false. Therefore, option B is the best choice among the given alternatives.\n\n<<<B>>>"
