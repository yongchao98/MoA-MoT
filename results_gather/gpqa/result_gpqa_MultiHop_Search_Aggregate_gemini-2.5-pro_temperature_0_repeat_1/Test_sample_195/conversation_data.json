    "To determine the maximum speed of the relativistic harmonic oscillator, we can use the principle of conservation of energy. The total energy of the system, which is the sum of the particle's relativistic energy and the spring's potential energy, remains constant throughout the oscillation.\n\n1.  **Energy at maximum displacement (x = A):**\n    At the maximum amplitude $A$, the mass is momentarily at rest, so its velocity $v = 0$.\n    *   The potential energy stored in the spring is at its maximum: $PE_{max} = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    *   The relativistic energy of the mass is just its rest energy, since $v=0$ and the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}} = 1$. So, the particle's energy is $E_{rest} = mc^2$.\n    *   The total energy of the system is the sum of these two:\n        $E_{total} = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n2.  **Energy at the equilibrium position (x = 0):**\n    At the equilibrium position, the potential energy of the spring is zero ($PE = 0$). The mass is moving at its maximum speed, $v = v_{max}$.\n    *   The relativistic energy of the mass is $E = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$, where $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   The total energy of the system at this point is:\n        $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Energy:**\n    By equating the total energy at these two points, we get:\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n4.  **Solve for v_max:**\n    First, we solve for $\\gamma_{max}$ by dividing by $mc^2$:\n    $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\gamma_{max}$\n\n    Now, substitute the expression for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n    To solve for $v_{max}$, we square both sides:\n    $\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}$\n\n    Next, we rearrange the equation to isolate the term with $v_{max}$:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    Finally, we solve for $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
