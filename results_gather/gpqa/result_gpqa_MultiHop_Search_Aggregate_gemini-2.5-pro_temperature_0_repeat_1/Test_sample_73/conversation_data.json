    "The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the \"memoryless\" property of radioactive decay. This principle states that the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. The fact that the atom has survived for 50 minutes does not change its intrinsic decay characteristics.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Determine the decay constant (λ):** The decay constant is a measure of the decay probability per unit of time. We can calculate it from the initial information provided. The probability of decay, P(decay), within a time *t* is given by the formula:\n\n    P(decay) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\n    We are given that the probability of decay is 32% (or 0.32) in 100 minutes. We can plug these values into the formula:\n\n    0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)\n\n    By rearranging the equation to solve for λ, we get:\n\n    e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n    -100λ = ln(0.68)\n    λ = -ln(0.68) / 100\n\n2.  **Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes:** Because of the memoryless property, the 50 minutes that have already passed are irrelevant to the future decay probability. Therefore, we simply need to calculate the probability of the atom decaying in any 150-minute period.\n\n    We use the same formula with the new time interval (t = 150 minutes) and the decay constant (λ) we just found:\n\n    P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\n3.  **Substitute and solve:** Now, we substitute the expression for λ into the equation:\n\n    P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^([-ln(0.68) / 100] * 150)\n    P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^[1.5 * ln(0.68)]\n    P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^[ln(0.68^1.5)]\n    P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - 0.68^1.5\n\n    Calculating the final value:\n\n    0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.5607\n    P(decay in 150 min) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393\n\nThis probability of approximately 0.4393, or 43.93%, is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>"
