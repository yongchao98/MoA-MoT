    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of 32% is highly characteristic of the presence of a single chlorine atom. The natural abundance of chlorine isotopes is approximately 75% ³⁵Cl and 25% ³⁷Cl, which gives a predicted M+ to M+2 peak ratio of about 3:1. The observed 100% to 32% ratio is a strong confirmation of one chlorine atom in the molecule.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This very broad absorption is a classic hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. Its position is consistent with a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\nCombining these two observations strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A singlet appearing this far downfield is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). Its integration for one proton (1H) confirms this assignment.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region of the spectrum. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is indicative of a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The symmetry of a *para* substituted ring results in two sets of chemically equivalent protons, which split each other into doublets.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** While the molecular weight is correct, the ¹H NMR spectrum for this compound would be much more complex, showing four distinct signals in the aromatic region, not two simple doublets.\n*   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule has a molecular weight of 156.57 g/mol. It contains a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom in a *para* arrangement on a benzene ring. This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data: the correct molecular weight with a chlorine atom (MS), the carboxylic acid functional group (IR), and the *para*-substituted aromatic proton pattern along with the carboxylic acid proton (¹H NMR).\n*   **C) Phenyl chloroformate:** This compound has the correct molecular weight but lacks a carboxylic acid. Therefore, it would not show the broad O-H peak in the IR spectrum or the acidic proton at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This molecule has the correct molecular weight but is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would lack the carboxylic acid proton at 11.0 ppm and instead would show an aldehyde proton signal around 9-10 ppm.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combined spectral data unequivocally supports the structure of **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
