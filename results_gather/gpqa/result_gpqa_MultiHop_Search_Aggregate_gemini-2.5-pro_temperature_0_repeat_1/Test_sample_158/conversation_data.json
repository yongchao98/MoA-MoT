    "The observed spectral characteristics of the quasar provide the key to determining its redshift. The significant drop in flux at wavelengths shorter than the peak of 790 nm is a distinctive feature known as the Lyman-alpha forest. This phenomenon occurs because light at these shorter wavelengths is absorbed by neutral hydrogen clouds located between the quasar and Earth. The peak at 790 nm corresponds to the redshifted Lyman-alpha emission line of hydrogen, which has a rest wavelength of 121.6 nm (or 1216 Å).\n\nTo find the redshift (z), we can use the following formula:\n\nz = (λ_observed / λ_rest) - 1\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nz = (790 nm / 121.6 nm) - 1 ≈ 6.497 - 1 ≈ 5.5\n\nWith the redshift established, the comoving distance can be calculated using the parameters of the Lambda-CDM model provided. The comoving distance is the distance between two objects that remains constant over time, factoring out the expansion of the universe. For a flat universe, as specified, the comoving distance is calculated by an integral that depends on the Hubble constant (H₀), the matter density parameter (Ω_m), the dark energy density parameter (Ω_Λ), and the redshift (z).\n\nGiven the parameters:\n*   H₀ = 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹\n*   Ω_m = 0.3\n*   Ω_Λ = 0.7\n*   z ≈ 5.5\n\nUsing a cosmological calculator with these inputs, the comoving radial distance is determined to be approximately 8000 Mpc, which is equivalent to 8 Gpc.\n\nTherefore, the comoving distance of the quasar from Earth can be assumed to be approximately 8 Gpc.\n\n<<<C>>>"
