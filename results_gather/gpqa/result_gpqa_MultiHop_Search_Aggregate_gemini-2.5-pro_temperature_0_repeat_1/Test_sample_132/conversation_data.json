    "To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻), we can follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Calculate Initial Molar Concentrations\n\nFirst, calculate the number of moles for each component:\n*   **KH₂PO₄:**\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass\n    *   Moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol of H₂PO₄⁻\n*   **Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O:**\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass\n    *   Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol of HPO₄²⁻\n\nNext, calculate the molar concentration of each ion in the 200.00 cm³ (0.200 L) solution:\n*   **[H₂PO₄⁻]:**\n    *   Concentration = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n*   **[HPO₄²⁻]:**\n    *   Concentration = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n### 2. Determine the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]\n\nThe solution is a buffer system composed of the conjugate acid-base pair H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻. The relevant equilibrium is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid, which has a dissociation constant Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸.\n\nThe equilibrium reaction is:\nH₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n\nWe can rearrange the equilibrium constant expression to solve for [H⁺]:\nKa₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n[H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n\nNow, substitute the calculated concentrations:\n[H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H⁺] ≈ 8.11x10⁻⁸ M\n\n### 3. Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]\n\nThe orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed from the third dissociation of phosphoric acid, which has a dissociation constant Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹².\n\nThe equilibrium reaction is:\nHPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n\nThe equilibrium constant expression is:\nKa₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, [PO₄³⁻]:\n[PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n\nUsing the concentrations we've already determined:\n[PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11x10⁻⁸ M)\n[PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.235x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis value is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
