    "Here is a step-by-step identification of compound E:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Compound A**\n\n*   **Hint (b)** indicates that compound A has a strong IR absorption peak around 1750 cm⁻¹. This frequency is characteristic of a carbonyl group in a five-membered ring (a cyclopentanone), which has more ring strain than a six-membered ring ketone. A typical cyclohexanone absorbs at a lower frequency, around 1715-1720 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Hint (a)** describes a Wittig reaction, where an aldehyde or ketone reacts with a phosphorus ylide to form an alkene. The reaction effectively replaces the C=O bond with a C=C bond.\n*   By \"reversing\" the Wittig reaction on the product, 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane, we can deduce the structure of compound A. The C=C double bond in the product is between the cyclopentane ring (at position 4) and the propan-2-ylidene group. This means the original carbonyl group (C=O) in compound A was at the C4 position of a 1,2-dimethylcyclopentane structure.\n*   Therefore, **Compound A is 3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction of A to B**\n\n*   Compound A (3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-one) reacts with hydrogen cyanide (HCN). This is a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group.\n*   The cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen is protonated, forming a cyanohydrin.\n*   **Compound B is 1-hydroxy-3,4-dimethylcyclopentane-1-carbonitrile.**\n\n**Step 3: Reaction of B to C**\n\n*   Compound B is reduced with hydrogen gas (H₂) in the presence of a palladium (Pd) catalyst. This catalytic hydrogenation reduces the nitrile group (-C≡N) to a primary amine (-CH₂NH₂).\n*   **Compound C is (1-aminomethyl-3,4-dimethylcyclopentyl)methanol.**\n\n**Step 4: Reaction of C to D**\n\n*   Compound C, a primary amine, reacts with nitrous acid (HNO₂). This process is called diazotization and converts the primary amine into an unstable diazonium salt.\n*   **Compound D is the [(1-hydroxy-3,4-dimethylcyclopentyl)methyl]diazonium ion.**\n\n**Step 5: Reaction of D to E**\n\n*   Compound D is unstable and eliminates a molecule of nitrogen gas (N₂), an inert gas. This is followed by a rearrangement known as the Tiffeneau-Demjanov rearrangement.\n*   This reaction is a well-known method for one-carbon ring expansion of cycloalkanols. The five-membered cyclopentane ring expands to a six-membered cyclohexane ring.\n*   The reaction proceeds via the formation of a primary carbocation after the loss of N₂, followed by a 1,2-alkyl shift which expands the ring. The positive charge is transferred to the carbon that was originally part of the ring and bore the hydroxyl group. A final deprotonation of the hydroxyl group forms the ketone.\n*   The starting material was 3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-one. The ring expansion incorporates the aminomethyl carbon into the ring, resulting in a cyclohexanone. The methyl groups, originally at positions 3 and 4 of the cyclopentanone, will now be at positions 3 and 4 of the resulting cyclohexanone.\n*   Therefore, **Compound E is 3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.**\n\n**Final Verification:**\n\n*   The IR spectrum of compound E is given to have a strong peak around 1715 cm⁻¹. This value is characteristic for a six-membered ring ketone (cyclohexanone), which confirms our structure.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis, the correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
