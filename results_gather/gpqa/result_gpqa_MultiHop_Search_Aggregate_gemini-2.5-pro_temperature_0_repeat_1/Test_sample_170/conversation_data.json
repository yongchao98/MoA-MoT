    "To arrange the given substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer during electrophilic bromination, we need to analyze the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring.\n\nThe substances are:\n1)  **ะก6H5-CH3** (Toluene)\n2)  **C6H5-COOC2H5** (Ethyl benzoate)\n3)  **C6H5-Cl** (Chlorobenzene)\n4)  **C6H5-NO2** (Nitrobenzene)\n5)  **C6H5-C2H5** (Ethylbenzene)\n6)  **C6H5-COOH** (Benzoic acid)\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents as either *ortho, para-directing* or *meta-directing*.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (bromine) to the positions ortho and para to themselves. Generally, the para product is favored due to less steric hindrance.\n    *   -CH3 (Toluene)\n    *   -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   -Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They produce very low yields of ortho and para isomers.\n    *   -NO2 (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)\n    *   -COOH (Benzoic acid)\n\n**Analysis of Meta-Directors (Lowest Para-Yield):**\nThese deactivating groups withdraw electron density from the ring, making ortho and para positions particularly electron-poor and thus unfavorable for electrophilic attack. The yield of the para-isomer will be extremely low. The order of their deactivating strength generally correlates with the yield of the meta product (and inversely with the minor para product).\n*   **4) C6H5-NO2:** The nitro group is one of the strongest deactivating groups. Bromination of nitrobenzene yields almost exclusively the meta-isomer, with only trace amounts of the para-isomer (around 0.3%).\n*   **6) C6H5-COOH:** The carboxylic acid group is also strongly deactivating and meta-directing. Its deactivating effect is strong, but typically considered slightly less than the nitro group.\n*   **2) C6H5-COOC2H5:** The ester group is deactivating and meta-directing, similar in strength to the carboxylic acid group but generally considered slightly weaker.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for these three is: **Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**.\n\n**Analysis of Ortho, Para-Directors (Highest Para-Yield):**\nThese groups will produce significant amounts of the para-isomer. The ratio of para to ortho product depends on a balance of electronic and steric factors.\n*   **1) C6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** The methyl group is an activating, ortho, para-director. In bromination, it yields a substantial amount of the para-isomer, typically around 66.8%.\n*   **5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group is also an activating, ortho, para-director. Being bulkier than the methyl group, it causes more steric hindrance at the ortho positions. This increased hindrance generally leads to a higher proportion of the para-isomer compared to toluene.\n*   **3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** Halogens are deactivating but ortho, para-directing. The chloro group strongly favors the para position due to a combination of its inductive and resonance effects. For halogenation reactions, chlorobenzene gives a very high yield of the para-isomer, often around 87-89%.\n\nThus, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for these three is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n\n**Final Order:**\nCombining the two groups, we get the complete sequence from the lowest to the highest weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n\n**4 (Nitrobenzene) < 6 (Benzoic acid) < 2 (Ethyl benzoate) < 1 (Toluene) < 5 (Ethylbenzene) < 3 (Chlorobenzene)**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
