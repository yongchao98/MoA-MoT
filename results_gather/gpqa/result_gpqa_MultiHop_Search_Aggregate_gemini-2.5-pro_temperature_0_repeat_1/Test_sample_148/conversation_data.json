    "The observations provided are classic indicators of a specific type of isomerism common in peptide chemistry. Let's break down the evidence:\n\n*   **¹H NMR Data**: The presence of two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton, which together integrate to one proton, indicates that this proton exists in two different chemical environments. Since these two species are in a roughly 1:1 ratio and spin-spin coupling has been ruled out, it points to the presence of two isomers that are interconverting slowly on the NMR timescale.\n*   **LC-MS Data**: The liquid chromatography (LC) separates two distinct compounds, confirming the presence of two different species. The mass spectrometry (MS) shows that both species have the identical mass, which is consistent with the expected molecule. This confirms they are isomers, not an impurity like a precursor.\n*   **Nature of Isomers**:\n    *   **Enantiomers** (mirror images) cannot be separated by standard (achiral) LC or distinguished by standard NMR. This rules out option D.\n    *   **Diastereomers** (stereoisomers that are not mirror images) have different physical properties and can be separated by standard LC and distinguished by NMR. This fits the observations.\n\nThe most likely source of diastereomers in a synthesized peptide that explains these specific findings is **atropisomerism**, specifically the *cis-trans* isomerization around an amide bond.\n\n*   While most amide bonds in a peptide strongly prefer the *trans* conformation, the energy difference between the *cis* and *trans* forms of an X-Proline bond is small. This often leads to a significant population of both isomers at equilibrium.\n*   These *cis* and *trans* isomers are a type of diastereomer called atropisomers—isomers that can be isolated due to hindered rotation around a single bond.\n*   The slow interconversion between these two forms on the NMR timescale results in a doubling of peaks for the residues near the affected amide bond, particularly the alpha-protons. The two isomers are also separable by HPLC.\n\nTherefore, the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereomers, most likely arising from *cis-trans* isomerism of an amide bond.\n\n<<<C>>>"
