    "When solving higher-dimensional heat equations with higher-order finite difference approximations and parallel splitting, the matrix exponential function that arises is approximated by a rational or fractional function. The key to converting the sequential algorithm into a parallel one lies in the decomposition of this fractional approximation.\n\nSpecifically, the use of a **linear partial fraction** expansion of the fractional approximation is the critical step. This decomposition breaks down the complex rational function into a sum of simpler fractions. Each of these simpler fractions can then be solved as an independent linear system. Because these systems are independent, they can be solved simultaneously on different processors. This process of breaking down a large, sequential problem into multiple, independent subproblems is the fundamental principle behind parallel computing in this context.\n\nOther aspects mentioned are relevant to the overall numerical method but are not the primary enabler of parallelism:\n*   **Complex roots of the fractional approximation:** The nature of the roots (real or complex) is a characteristic of the chosen approximation but not the mechanism for parallelization itself.\n*   **Stability analysis:** This is essential to ensure the numerical method is reliable and that errors do not escalate, but it does not create the parallel structure.\n*   **Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions:** This describes a specific type of problem being solved, not the method of parallelization.\n\nTherefore, the ability to express the fractional approximation as a linear partial fraction is the key factor that facilitates the parallel algorithm.\n\n<<<B>>>"
