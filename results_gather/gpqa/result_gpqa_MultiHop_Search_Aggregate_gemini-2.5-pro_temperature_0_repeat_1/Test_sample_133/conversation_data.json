    "Here is a step-by-step calculation of the enthalpy of neutralization for the given chemical reaction.\n\n### 1. Understand the Reactions\n\nWhen the solutions of hydrochloric acid (HCl), sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄), and barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)₂) are mixed, two main reactions occur:\n*   **Neutralization:** Hydrogen ions (H⁺) from the acids react with hydroxide ions (OH⁻) from the base to form water.\n    H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq) → H₂O(l)\n*   **Precipitation:** Barium ions (Ba²⁺) from the base react with sulfate ions (SO₄²⁻) from the sulfuric acid to form a solid precipitate of barium sulfate.\n    Ba²⁺(aq) + SO₄²⁻(aq) → BaSO₄(s)\n\n### 2. Calculate the Moles of Reactants\n\nFirst, we determine the number of moles of the reactive ions from each solution.\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ ions:**\n    *   From 500 mL (0.5 L) of 0.2 M HCl:\n        0.5 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol H⁺\n    *   From 300 mL (0.3 L) of 0.3 M H₂SO₄ (which provides 2 H⁺ ions per molecule):\n        0.3 L × 0.3 mol/L × 2 = 0.18 mol H⁺\n    *   **Total moles of H⁺ = 0.1 mol + 0.18 mol = 0.28 mol**\n\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ ions:**\n    *   From 200 mL (0.2 L) of 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ (which provides 2 OH⁻ ions per molecule):\n        0.2 L × 0.5 mol/L × 2 = 0.20 mol OH⁻\n    *   **Total moles of OH⁻ = 0.20 mol**\n\n*   **Moles of Ba²⁺ and SO₄²⁻ ions for precipitation:**\n    *   From 200 mL (0.2 L) of 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂:\n        0.2 L × 0.5 mol/L = 0.10 mol Ba²⁺\n    *   From 300 mL (0.3 L) of 0.3 M H₂SO₄:\n        0.3 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol SO₄²⁻\n\n### 3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Neutralization\n\nThe enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when one mole of water is formed from the reaction of a strong acid and a strong base. This value is approximately -57.1 kJ/mol or -13.7 kcal/mol.\n\n*   **Limiting reactant for neutralization:** We compare the moles of H⁺ (0.28 mol) and OH⁻ (0.20 mol). The OH⁻ ions are the limiting reactant.\n*   **Moles of water formed:** 0.20 moles of water will be formed.\n*   **Heat released from neutralization (ΔH_neut):**\n    ΔH_neut = 0.20 mol × (-13.7 kcal/mol) = -2.74 kcal\n\n### 4. Evaluate the Options\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of neutralization is -2.74 kcal. Comparing this to the given options:\n\n*   A) -16.0 kJ\n*   B) -3.80 kcal\n*   C) -2.72 kcal\n*   D) -11.42 kcal\n\nThe value -2.74 kcal is extremely close to option C, -2.72 kcal. The minor difference can be attributed to slight variations in the standard enthalpy value used. The question specifically asks for the \"enthalpy of neutralization,\" which suggests focusing on the heat produced from the formation of water. While a precipitation reaction also occurs and releases heat, it is a separate thermodynamic process. Based on the provided options, it is clear that only the heat from the neutralization reaction is being considered.\n\n<<<C>>>"
