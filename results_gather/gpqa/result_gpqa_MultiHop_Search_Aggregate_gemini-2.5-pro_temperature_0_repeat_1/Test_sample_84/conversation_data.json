    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2.\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it absorbs from its host star. The formula is:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    Where:\n    *   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   R_star is the star's radius.\n    *   A is the planet's albedo (the fraction of light it reflects).\n    *   a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n2.  **Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\n    We need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₂))]\n\n    The problem states that both planets orbit the same star (so T_star and R_star are the same) and have the same albedo (A₁ = A₂). Therefore, most terms cancel out, leaving:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)\n\n3.  **Relating Doppler Shift to Orbital Parameters**\n    The radial velocity (RV) method measures the star's velocity wobble caused by the orbiting planet. The maximum velocity is the RV amplitude, K. This is related to the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ) by:\n    K = c * (Δλ / λ₀)\n    where c is the speed of light and λ₀ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\n    The ratio of the RV amplitudes for the two planets is:\n    K₁ / K₂ = (c * Δλ₁ / λ₀) / (c * Δλ₂ / λ₀) = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n    Given Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å and Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å:\n    K₁ / K₂ = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4\n\n4.  **Connecting RV Amplitude to Semi-Major Axis**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV amplitude (K) induced on the star is given by:\n    K ≈ (M_p / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G / a)\n    (This assumes the planet's mass M_p is much smaller than the star's mass M_star, and the orbital inclination is ~90°, which is a reasonable assumption since the planets were also detected via the transit method).\n\n    We can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis (a):\n    K² ≈ (M_p² / M_star) * (G / a)\n    a ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n5.  **Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**\n    Now we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁:\n    a₂ / a₁ = [(G * M_p₂²) / (M_star * K₂²)] / [(G * M_p₁²) / (M_star * K₁²)]\n\n    The terms for the gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) cancel out:\n    a₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p₁²)\n    a₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n    We are given M_p₁ = 7 M_earth and M_p₂ = 5 M_earth. So, M_p₂ / M_p₁ = 5/7.\n    Substituting the known ratios:\n    a₂ / a₁ = (5/7)² * (3/4)² = (25/49) * (9/16) = 225 / 784\n\n6.  **Final Calculation**\n    Finally, we substitute the value of a₂ / a₁ back into the temperature ratio equation:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁) = sqrt(225 / 784)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThe ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>"
