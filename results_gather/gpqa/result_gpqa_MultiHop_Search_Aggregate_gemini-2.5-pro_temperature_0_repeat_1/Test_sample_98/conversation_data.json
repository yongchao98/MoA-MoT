    "The initial analysis of the molecular structures to determine the expected 1H NMR splitting patterns is the core of solving this problem. The search results confirm the fundamental principles of NMR spectroscopy, such as the n+1 rule and how complex splitting patterns arise when a proton is coupled to multiple, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons.\n\n*   **FTIR Data:** A broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ (O-H stretch) and a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ (C=O stretch) are definitive indicators of a carboxylic acid functional group. All four possible compounds contain a carboxylic acid, so this data confirms the functional group type but does not differentiate between the isomers.\n*   **1H NMR Data:** The key to identifying the correct structure lies in the complex splitting patterns described.\n    *   A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** means a single proton is coupled to three different neighboring groups of protons: a group with one proton (giving the doublet), a group with two protons (giving the triplet), and a group with three protons (giving the quartet).\n    *   A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)** means a single proton is coupled to three different neighboring groups of protons: a group with one proton (giving the doublet), a group with two protons (giving a triplet), and a second, non-equivalent group with two protons (giving another triplet).\n\nLet's analyze the proton environments in each candidate molecule to see which one would produce both of these specific signals.\n\n**Analysis of Candidate Structures:**\n\n*   **A) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-Dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at position C3 is adjacent to the C4 proton (1H), the C2 methylene group (2H), and the C3 methyl group (3H). This would result in a **dtq** signal.\n    *   No other proton in this molecule has the correct number of neighbors to produce a dtt signal.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-Dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at position C3 is adjacent to the C2 proton (1H), the C4 methylene group (2H), and the C3 methyl group (3H). This would create a **dtq** signal.\n    *   No other proton in this molecule would produce a dtt signal.\n\n*   **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-Diethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at position C3 is adjacent to the C2 proton (1H), the C4 methylene group (2H), and the methylene group of the C3-ethyl substituent (2H). This would result in a **dtt** signal.\n    *   No proton in this molecule has the correct neighbors (1H, 2H, and 3H) to produce a dtq signal.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-Diethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   **Proton at C3:** This proton is adjacent to the C4 proton (1H), the C2 methylene group (2H), and the methylene group of the C3-ethyl substituent (2H). This combination of neighbors (1H, 2H, 2H) will split the signal into a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *   **Proton at C4:** This proton is adjacent to the C3 proton (1H), the methylene group of the C4-ethyl substituent (2H), and the C5 terminal methyl group (3H). This combination of neighbors (1H, 2H, 3H) will split the signal into a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOnly structure D, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, has protons in two different positions that match the described complex splitting patterns of both a doublet of triplets of triplets and a doublet of triplets of quartets.\n\n<<<D>>>"
