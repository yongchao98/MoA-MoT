    "The final product is identified by following a three-step reaction sequence starting from a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO.\n\n**Step 1: Identification of the Starting Material**\n\nThe molecular formula is C8H9NO, and the provided 1H-NMR data is used to determine its structure.\n*   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   A triplet at 9.72 ppm (1H) is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO) coupled to a neighboring methylene (-CH2-) group.\n    *   A doublet at 3.66 ppm (2H) corresponds to the methylene group adjacent to the aldehyde, confirming the -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   Two doublets in the aromatic region at 6.98 ppm (2H) and 6.51 ppm (2H) are indicative of a para-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   A broad singlet at 6.27 ppm (2H) suggests a primary amine (-NH2) group attached to the ring.\n\n*   **Structure Determination:** Assembling these fragments leads to the structure of 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde. The degree of unsaturation for C8H9NO is 5, which is consistent with a benzene ring (4 degrees) and a carbonyl group (1 degree).\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n1.  **NaNO2 + HCl:** These reagents are used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The amino group (-NH2) on 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde is converted into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-), forming 4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n2.  **H2O, Heat:** The diazonium salt is then treated with water and heated. This results in the substitution of the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group, yielding 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n3.  **aq. KOH, Heat:** The product from the previous step, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, is treated with a strong base (aqueous KOH) and heat. These are the conditions for an aldol condensation reaction.\n\n**Step 3: Prediction of the Final Product**\n\nThe aldol condensation of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde proceeds as follows:\n*   An enolate is formed by the removal of an acidic α-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n*   This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule.\n*   This initially forms an aldol addition product, 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal.\n*   With the application of heat, this intermediate undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a more stable, conjugated system. The final product is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\nThe structure of this final condensation product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal. This compound is a known Maillard reaction product and has been studied for its biological properties.\n\nBased on this three-step analysis, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<A>>>"
