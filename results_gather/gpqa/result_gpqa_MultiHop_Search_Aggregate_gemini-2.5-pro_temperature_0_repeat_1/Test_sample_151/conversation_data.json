    "When yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* is treated with a mating pheromone, it undergoes a process called shmoo formation. This process involves arresting the cell cycle in the G1 phase, undergoing polarized growth, and preparing for cell fusion with a mating partner. This response is driven by significant changes in gene expression, which requires the activity of various protein complexes on the chromatin. The question asks which of the listed protein complexes would be least abundant in the *active chromatin* recovered from these shmooing cells.\n\n*   **A) Nucleosome histone complex:** Nucleosomes, composed of histone proteins, are the fundamental building blocks of all chromatin, both active (euchromatin) and inactive (heterochromatin). Therefore, they will be abundantly present.\n*   **B) Pre-initiation complex (PIC):** Shmoo formation requires the transcription of a specific set of genes involved in mating. The pre-initiation complex, which includes RNA polymerase and general transcription factors, assembles at gene promoters to start transcription. As many genes are active, PICs will be a prominent feature of the active chromatin.\n*   **D) Enhancer protein complex:** Enhancers are DNA regions that bind proteins (transcription factors) to increase the transcription of specific genes. The coordinated gene expression program for mating and shmoo formation is heavily reliant on such regulatory elements and their associated protein complexes.\n\n*   **C) Pre-replication complex (pre-RC):** The pre-replication complex, which includes proteins like ORC and the MCM helicase, assembles on DNA replication origins during the G1 phase. This \"licenses\" the origins for replication in the subsequent S phase. However, a key part of the mating response is cell cycle arrest in G1; the cell does not proceed into S phase and does not replicate its DNA. While pre-RCs are assembled in G1, the process they are preparing for (DNA replication) is actively inhibited. Compared to the other complexes, which are directly involved in the ongoing transcriptional activity that defines the shmoo state, the pre-replication complex is associated with a halted process. Therefore, it would be the least represented complex in the proteome specifically associated with *active* chromatin functions during shmoo formation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
