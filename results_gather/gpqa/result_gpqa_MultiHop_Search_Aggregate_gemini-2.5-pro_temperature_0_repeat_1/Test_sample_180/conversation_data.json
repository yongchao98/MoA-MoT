    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the approximate ratio of neutrino fluxes.\n\n### 1. Identify the Relevant Neutrino Sources\n\nThe Sun produces neutrinos through several reactions in the proton-proton (pp) chain and the CNO cycle. The key reactions for this problem are:\n*   **pp-II Branch:** This branch produces mono-energetic neutrinos from the electron capture of Beryllium-7 (`7Be`). The vast majority (about 90%) of these neutrinos have an energy of **862 keV**.\n*   **pp-III Branch:** This branch produces neutrinos from the beta decay of Boron-8 (`8B`). These neutrinos have a continuous energy spectrum that extends up to about 15 MeV. This is the branch that hypothetically stops.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Energy Bands\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of fluxes in two specific energy bands:\n*   **Band 1:** 700-800 keV\n*   **Band 2:** 800-900 keV\n\n### 3. Determine Neutrino Contributions to Each Band\n\nLet's determine which reactions contribute to the flux in each band *before* any changes occur:\n*   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):** The primary contributor to this band is the continuous spectrum of `8B` neutrinos from the pp-III branch. The `7Be` neutrinos do not contribute as their energy is outside this range.\n*   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):** This band has two main contributors. First, the continuous spectrum of `8B` neutrinos. Second, and most importantly, the extremely strong, discrete energy line of `7Be` neutrinos at 862 keV, which falls directly within this band.\n\n### 4. Apply the Hypothetical Scenario\n\nThe problem states that the **pp-III branch suddenly stops**. This means the production of `8B` neutrinos ceases entirely. The pp-II branch, however, continues as normal.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the fluxes in each band under this new condition:\n*   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):** The main source, `8B` neutrinos, has been eliminated. While there are other minor background sources like CNO cycle neutrinos, their flux is extremely low compared to the primary sources. Therefore, the flux in this band becomes approximately **zero**.\n*   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):** The contribution from `8B` neutrinos is eliminated. However, the dominant contribution from the `7Be` neutrino line at 862 keV remains unchanged. This means the flux in Band 2 is still **large and non-zero**.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Final Ratio\n\nThe ratio is calculated as Flux (Band 1) / Flux (Band 2).\n*   Flux (Band 1) ≈ 0\n*   Flux (Band 2) ≈ Flux from `7Be` neutrinos (a large, positive value)\n\nTherefore, the ratio is approximately zero divided by a large number, which results in a value very close to zero.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOf the choices provided, 0.01 is the smallest non-zero value and the best approximation for a ratio that is nearly, but not absolutely, zero (due to negligible background from other reactions).\n\nA) 1.\nB) 10.\nC) 0.1 (10⁻¹).\nD) 0.01 (10⁻²).\n\nThe correct choice is the one that represents a very small number.\n\n<<<D>>>"
