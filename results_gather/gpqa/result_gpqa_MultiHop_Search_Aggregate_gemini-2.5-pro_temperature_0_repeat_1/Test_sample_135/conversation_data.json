    "The problem asks to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the vector field **f**(r) = (1/r²) **r̂** inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.\n\nThe Divergence Theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume V is equal to the surface integral of the field over the closed surface S that encloses the volume.\n∫∫∫ (∇ ⋅ **f**) dV = ∮∮ (**f** ⋅ d**S**)\n\nThe vector field is given by **f**(r) = (1/r²) **r̂**, where **r̂** is the unit vector in the radial direction. A direct calculation of the divergence ∇ ⋅ **f** gives zero for all r ≠ 0. However, the field has a singularity at the origin (r=0), which means the divergence is undefined at that point. This singularity acts as a source, and its contribution must be included.\n\nTo correctly evaluate the integral, we use the Divergence Theorem. This theorem relates the volume integral to the flux of the vector field through the surface of the sphere.\n\nThe surface element d**S** on a sphere of radius R is given in spherical coordinates by d**S** = R² sin(θ) dθ dφ **r̂**.\n\nThe vector field **f** on the surface of the sphere (where r=R) is **f**(R) = (1/R²) **r̂**.\n\nNow, we compute the dot product **f** ⋅ d**S**:\n**f** ⋅ d**S** = [(1/R²) **r̂**] ⋅ [R² sin(θ) dθ dφ **r̂**]\n**f** ⋅ d**S** = (1/R²) * R² * sin(θ) dθ dφ * (**r̂** ⋅ **r̂**)\nSince **r̂** is a unit vector, **r̂** ⋅ **r̂** = 1.\n**f** ⋅ d**S** = sin(θ) dθ dφ\n\nNext, we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for the polar angle θ are from 0 to π, and for the azimuthal angle φ are from 0 to 2π.\n\n∮∮ (**f** ⋅ d**S**) = ∫ (from φ=0 to 2π) ∫ (from θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ dφ\n\nFirst, we integrate with respect to θ:\n∫ (from 0 to π) sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)] (from 0 to π) = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 2\n\nThen, we integrate the result with respect to φ:\n∫ (from 0 to 2π) 2 dφ = [2φ] (from 0 to 2π) = 2(2π) - 0 = 4π\n\nThus, the volume integral of the divergence of the field is 4π. This result is a consequence of the singularity at the origin; if the volume did not enclose the origin, the integral would be zero.\n\n<<<A>>>"
