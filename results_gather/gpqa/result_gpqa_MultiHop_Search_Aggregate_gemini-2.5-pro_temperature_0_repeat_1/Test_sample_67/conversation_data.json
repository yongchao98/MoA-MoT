    "When a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment **μ** = γ**S** is in a magnetic field **B**, its spin precesses around the direction of the magnetic field. This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The frequency of this precession, called the Larmor frequency, is given by ω = γB, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and B is the magnitude of the magnetic field.\n\nInitially, the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the spin is in an eigenstate of the z-component of the spin operator, S<sub>z</sub>.\n\nWhen the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the spin of the particle begins to precess around the new field direction. The Hamiltonian of the system, which describes its energy, changes to H = -**μ** · **B** = -γB S<sub>y</sub>.\n\nThe expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, <μ<sub>z</sub>>, will then oscillate as the spin precesses in the X-Z plane around the Y-axis. The frequency of this oscillation is the Larmor frequency.\n\nThe time evolution of the expectation value of any spin component perpendicular to the magnetic field will oscillate with the Larmor frequency. In this case, the z-component of the spin is perpendicular to the new magnetic field, which is in the Y direction.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle's moment is equal to the Larmor frequency, which is γB.\n\n<<<C>>>"
