    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the relationship between the number of stars per unit range of parallax and the parallax itself, under the assumption of a uniform distribution of stars in the sky.\n\n1.  **Relationship between Parallax and Distance:** The stellar parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (d) to the star. This can be expressed as:\n    d ∝ 1/plx\n\n2.  **Uniform Star Distribution:** The assumption of a uniform distribution of stars means that the number of stars per unit volume is constant throughout space. Let's call this constant stellar density ρ.\n\n3.  **Number of Stars in a Volume:** To find the number of stars at a certain distance, we can consider a thin spherical shell of radius 'd' and a small thickness 'Δd'. The volume of this shell (ΔV) is approximately the surface area of the sphere multiplied by its thickness:\n    ΔV ≈ 4πd² * Δd\n\n4.  **Number of Stars in a Distance Range:** The number of stars (ΔN) within this thin shell is the stellar density multiplied by the volume of the shell:\n    ΔN ≈ ρ * 4πd² * Δd\n\n5.  **Expressing the Relationship in Terms of Parallax:** Our goal is to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (ΔN/Δplx) depends on the parallax (plx). To do this, we need to substitute 'd' and 'Δd' with expressions involving 'plx'.\n\n    *   From the parallax-distance relation, we have d = k/plx, where k is a constant of proportionality. Therefore, d² = k²/plx².\n    *   To find the relationship between the small intervals Δd and Δplx, we can differentiate the distance equation with respect to parallax:\n        d(d)/d(plx) = -k/plx²\n        For small changes, we can approximate this as Δd/Δplx ≈ -k/plx². Since we are interested in the number of stars, we consider the magnitude of this change: |Δd| ≈ (k/plx²) * |Δplx|.\n\n6.  **Substituting into the Number of Stars Equation:** Now we substitute the expressions for d² and Δd back into our equation for ΔN:\n    ΔN ≈ ρ * 4π * (k²/plx²) * (k/plx² * Δplx)\n    ΔN ≈ (4πρk³) / plx⁴ * Δplx\n\n7.  **Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:** To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we divide by Δplx:\n    ΔN/Δplx ≈ (4πρk³) / plx⁴\n\n    Since ρ and k are constants, we can see that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to 1/plx⁴.\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx as ~ 1/plx⁴.\n\n<<<A>>>"
