    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine how the number of stars changes with distance:\n\n1.  **Relationship between Parallax and Distance:** The parallax (plx) of a star is inversely proportional to its distance (r). This relationship is given by the formula:\n    r = 1/plx\n    This also means that:\n    plx = 1/r.\n\n2.  **Number of Stars and Parallax:** The problem states that the number of stars (N) in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as 1/plx⁵. This can be interpreted as the number of stars per unit interval of parallax, which can be written as:\n    dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵\n\n3.  **Relating the Differentials:** To find how the number of stars changes with distance (dN/dr), we first need to find the relationship between the differential of parallax (d(plx)) and the differential of distance (dr). We can do this by differentiating the expression plx = 1/r with respect to r:\n    d(plx)/dr = -1/r²\n    The negative sign indicates that as the distance increases, the parallax decreases. For our purpose of looking at the change in the number of stars, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can write:\n    d(plx) ∝ (1/r²) dr\n\n4.  **Finding the Change in Number of Stars with Distance:** We want to find how the number of stars changes per unit range of distance, which is dN/dr. We can use the chain rule to relate dN/dr to dN/d(plx):\n    dN/dr = [dN/d(plx)] * [d(plx)/dr]\n\n    Now, we substitute the known proportionalities:\n    dN/dr ∝ (1/plx⁵) * (1/r²)\n\n5.  **Expressing in Terms of Distance (r):** To get the final relationship, we substitute plx = 1/r into the expression:\n    dN/dr ∝ (1 / (1/r)⁵) * (1/r²)\n    dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²)\n    dN/dr ∝ r³\n\nTherefore, the number of stars in that region of the sky changes with distance (per unit range of distance, r) as r³.\n\n<<<D>>>"
