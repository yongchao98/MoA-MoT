    "To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph on a single 8m VLT telescope, we must first establish the detection criteria and then evaluate each star against them.\n\nA star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 can be achieved in a one-hour exposure. According to performance data for ESPRESSO, in its 1-UT (single telescope) mode, it can achieve an S/N of 10 in one hour (three combined 20-minute exposures) for a star with an apparent visual magnitude (m_V) of 17.1. Therefore, any star with an apparent magnitude of 17.1 or brighter (i.e., a smaller magnitude number) will be detectable, provided it is visible from the Paranal Observatory.\n\nThe Paranal Observatory is located at a latitude of approximately -24.6 degrees. This means stars with very high northern declinations are not visible from the site.\n\nHere is the analysis for each star:\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** Canopus is the second brightest star in the night sky, with an apparent magnitude of approximately -0.74.\n*   **Observability:** It has a declination of about -52 degrees. This southern declination makes it easily observable from Paranal.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since its magnitude of -0.74 is much brighter than the 17.1 limit, **Canopus is detectable.**\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** Polaris, the North Star, has an apparent magnitude that fluctuates around 1.98.\n*   **Observability:** Its declination is very close to +90 degrees (specifically +89° 15′ 50.8″). From the southern latitude of Paranal (-24.6°), Polaris is never above the horizon and is therefore impossible to observe.\n*   **Conclusion:** As it is not visible from the observatory, **Polaris is not detectable.**\n\n**c) Star with RA = 0 deg, DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 10 pc distance**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** The apparent magnitude (m_V) can be calculated from the absolute magnitude (M_V) and distance (d) in parsecs using the formula: m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d/10).\n    *   m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(10/10) = 15 + 5 * 0 = 15.0.\n*   **Observability:** A declination of 0 degrees places it on the celestial equator, making it perfectly observable from Paranal.\n*   **Conclusion:** With an apparent magnitude of 15.0, it is brighter than the 17.1 limit. **This star is detectable.**\n\n**d) Star with RA = 0 deg, DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 200 pc distance**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):**\n    *   m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(200/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(20) ≈ 15 + 6.5 = 21.5.\n*   **Observability:** It is observable from Paranal.\n*   **Conclusion:** With an apparent magnitude of 21.5, it is much fainter than the 17.1 limit. **This star is not detectable.**\n\n**e) Star with RA = 0 deg, DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 5 pc distance**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):**\n    *   m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(5/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(0.5) ≈ 15 - 1.5 = 13.5.\n*   **Observability:** It is observable from Paranal.\n*   **Conclusion:** With an apparent magnitude of 13.5, it is brighter than the 17.1 limit. **This star is detectable.**\n\n**f) Star with RA = 0 deg, DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 50 pc distance**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):**\n    *   m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(50/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(5) ≈ 15 + 3.5 = 18.5.\n*   **Observability:** It is observable from Paranal.\n*   **Conclusion:** With an apparent magnitude of 18.5, it is fainter than the 17.1 limit. **This star is not detectable.**\n\nIn summary, the following three stars would be detectable:\n1.  Canopus\n2.  Star (c) at 10 pc\n3.  Star (e) at 5 pc\n\nTherefore, a total of 3 stars from the list are detectable.\n\n<<<D>>>"
