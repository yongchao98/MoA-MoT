    "Here is a breakdown of each compound's potential for optical isomerism:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Biphenyls can exhibit a type of stereoisomerism called atropisomerism when rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is restricted. For this to occur, there must be bulky substituents in the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). In this case, the nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl dicarboxylate (-COOCH3) groups are large enough to hinder free rotation. Because the substitution pattern on the rings is asymmetrical, the molecule is chiral and cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. Therefore, it will show optical isomerism. A related compound, 6,6'-dinitro-2,2'-diphenic acid, is a classic example of an optically active biphenyl.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This compound, also known as methyl lactate, has a central carbon atom (the second carbon) bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are always chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exists as two enantiomers: methyl (R)-2-hydroxypropanoate and methyl (S)-2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The chemical formula for benzophenone is (C6H5)2CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two identical phenyl groups. It does not have a chiral center. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbonyl group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Although the phenyl rings are twisted out of the plane of the carbonyl group, the molecule as a whole is achiral in its ground state and does not exhibit optical isomerism in solution.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The molecule is planar and has a center of inversion, which is a type of symmetry element that precludes chirality. Therefore, it is achiral and does not show optical isomerism. It is a geometric isomer (a type of diastereomer) of dimethyl maleate, but it is not optically active itself.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>"
