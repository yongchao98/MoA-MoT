    "The provided spectroscopic data allows for a detailed structural analysis to identify the unknown compound with the molecular formula C9H11NO2.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:\n\n*   **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula is C9H11NO2. The degree of unsaturation is calculated as 5. This suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group.\n\n*   **IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The medium to strong intensity bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) group, and its frequency is typical for an ester that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons signifies a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is consistent with the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂) group. The broadness is due to quadrupolar relaxation and exchange.\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons is characteristic of a methylene group (-CH₂-) coupled to a methyl group. Its downfield chemical shift at 4.5 ppm indicates it is attached to an electronegative oxygen atom, forming part of an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 7.0 ppm are adjacent to the electron-donating amino group, while the protons at 8.0 ppm are adjacent to the electron-withdrawing ethyl ester group.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe combined data points to a structure containing a primary amine, an ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring. This corresponds to **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**, which is also known as benzocaine.\n\nLet's verify this against the options:\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, which does not match the NMR splitting pattern or the IR frequency for the carbonyl group.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure perfectly aligns with all the provided IR and NMR data. The molecular formula C9H11NO2 is also correct for this compound.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. This is a secondary amide and would show only a single N-H stretch in the IR spectrum.\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. In this structure, the methylene group of the ethyl fragment would be adjacent to the carbonyl, not the ester oxygen, resulting in a chemical shift around 2.3-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n\nTherefore, the compound is identified as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
