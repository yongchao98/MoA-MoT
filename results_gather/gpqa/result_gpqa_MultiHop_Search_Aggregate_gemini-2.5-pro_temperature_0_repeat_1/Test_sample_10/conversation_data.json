    "The correct answer is B. Here is an analysis of each statement:\n\n*   **A) Correct.** Studies have shown that the SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a protein can induce apoptosis by activating caspase-8, a key initiator of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. This activation occurs without a corresponding change in the expression levels of Bcl-2, a crucial regulator of the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway. While the activation of caspase-8 can subsequently trigger the intrinsic pathway through Bid cleavage, the initial event mediated by ORF3a points to the extrinsic pathway as the primary mechanism.\n\n*   **B) Incorrect.** The nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex is a heterodimer that functions as a 3'-5' exoribonuclease, playing a critical role in proofreading during viral RNA replication to ensure high fidelity. This enzymatic activity involves the degradation or hydrolysis of RNA, including double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), to remove mismatched nucleotides or to evade host immune responses. The statement that the complex *prevents* the breakdown of dsRNA is a direct contradiction of its known function, which is to *degrade* or *process* dsRNA.\n\n*   **C) Correct.** Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, utilize a -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) mechanism to synthesize the large polyprotein pp1ab from the ORF1a and ORF1b reading frames. This process involves the ribosome slipping back by one nucleotide at a specific \"slippery sequence,\" a mechanism that is stimulated by a complex downstream RNA structure, typically a pseudoknot. The frameshifting signal of SARS-CoV-2 is structurally very similar to that of SARS-CoV.\n\n*   **D) Correct.** The efficiency of ribosomal frameshifting has been correlated with the structural and conformational plasticity of the RNA pseudoknot. The ability of the pseudoknot to adopt multiple conformations is thought to influence its interaction with the ribosome and regulate the rate of frameshifting. Studies have revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting element can exist in multiple distinct conformations.\n\n<<<B>>>"
