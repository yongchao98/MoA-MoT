    "The step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence is as follows:\n\n1.  **Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 → A**: Propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) reacts with 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst (BF₃) to form a cyclic dithioacetal, specifically 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane (A). This reaction protects the aldehyde functional group.\n\n2.  **A + BuLi → B**: 2-Ethyl-1,3-dithiane (A) is treated with butyllithium (BuLi), a strong base. The BuLi removes the acidic proton from the carbon atom situated between the two sulfur atoms (C2), creating a lithiated dithiane carbanion (B).\n\n3.  **B + Bromoethane → C**: The carbanion (B) acts as a nucleophile and attacks bromoethane in an Sₙ2 reaction. This adds a second ethyl group to the C2 position, resulting in 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiane (C).\n\n4.  **C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**: The dithiane protecting group is removed from compound C using mercury(II) chloride (HgCl₂) in the presence of water and acid. This process, known as deprotection or dethioacetalization, regenerates the carbonyl group. The resulting product (D) is 3-pentanone (diethyl ketone, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O).\n\n5.  **D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**: This is a Wittig reaction. First, a Wittig reagent is prepared from 3-bromopentane and triphenylphosphine (PPh₃), followed by deprotonation with BuLi to form the ylide, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃. This ylide then reacts with the ketone from the previous step, 3-pentanone (D). The reaction replaces the carbonyl oxygen with the C=P group of the ylide, forming a new carbon-carbon double bond. The final product (E) is 3,4-diethyl-3-hexene, which has the structure (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂.\n\nTo determine the number of ¹³C-NMR signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the final product, 3,4-diethyl-3-hexene.\n\nThe structure of 3,4-diethyl-3-hexene is:\n```\n      CH₂CH₃\n      |\nCH₃CH₂-C=C-CH₂CH₃\n      |\n      CH₂CH₃\n```\nThis molecule is highly symmetrical. Due to this symmetry, several carbon atoms are chemically equivalent and will produce a single signal in the ¹³C-NMR spectrum:\n*   **Alkene carbons (C=C):** The two carbons forming the central double bond are in identical chemical environments and are therefore equivalent. This will produce one signal.\n*   **Methylene carbons (-CH₂-):** All four methylene groups are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry. They are all bonded to an equivalent alkene carbon and a terminal methyl group. This will result in one signal.\n*   **Methyl carbons (-CH₃):** All four methyl groups are also in equivalent positions at the end of the ethyl chains. This will produce one signal.\n\nTherefore, the ¹³C-NMR spectrum of 3,4-diethyl-3-hexene will show a total of 3 signals.\n\n<<<C>>>"
