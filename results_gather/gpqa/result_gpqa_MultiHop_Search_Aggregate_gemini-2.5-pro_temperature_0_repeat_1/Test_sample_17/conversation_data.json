    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Notation\n\nThe notation `[X/Y]` represents the logarithmic abundance ratio of two elements, X and Y, in a star relative to the Sun. It is defined as:\n\n`[X/Y] = log10( (nX/nY)_star ) - log10( (nX/nY)_sun )`\n\nwhere `nX` and `nY` are the number densities (or number of atoms) of elements X and Y.\n\nThe goal is to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. In the context of stellar composition, this refers to the ratio of their silicon abundances relative to hydrogen, which can be written as `(nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2`.\n\n### 2. Useful Identities\n\nFrom the definition of the bracket notation, we can derive two useful identities:\n*   `[A/H] = [A/B] + [B/H]`\n*   `[A/B] = [A/H] - [B/H]`\n\n### 3. Calculate the Silicon Abundance for Star_1\n\nWe are given the following for Star_1:\n*   `[Fe/H]_1 = 0` dex\n*   `[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3` dex\n\nWe want to find the silicon abundance relative to hydrogen, `[Si/H]_1`. Using the first identity:\n\n`[Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1`\n`[Si/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Silicon Abundance for Star_2\n\nWe are given the following for Star_2:\n*   `[Mg/H]_2 = 0` dex\n*   `[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3` dex\n\nWe want to find `[Si/H]_2`. Using the second identity `[A/B] = [A/H] - [B/H]`, we can write:\n\n`[Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2`\n\nNow, we rearrange the formula to solve for `[Si/H]_2`:\n\n`[Si/H]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Mg/Si]_2`\n`[Si/H]_2 = 0 - 0.3 = -0.3`\n\n### 5. Calculate the Ratio of Silicon Abundances\n\nWe need to find the ratio `(nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2`. Let's call this ratio `R`.\n\nFrom the definition of `[Si/H]`, we have:\n`[Si/H]_1 = log10( (nSi/nH)_1 ) - log10( (nSi/nH)_sun ) = 0.3`\n`[Si/H]_2 = log10( (nSi/nH)_2 ) - log10( (nSi/nH)_sun ) = -0.3`\n\nLet's express the abundances of the stars in terms of the solar abundance:\n`log10( (nSi/nH)_1 ) = 0.3 + log10( (nSi/nH)_sun )`\n`log10( (nSi/nH)_2 ) = -0.3 + log10( (nSi/nH)_sun )`\n\nNow, let's look at the logarithm of the ratio `R`:\n`log10(R) = log10( (nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2 )`\n`log10(R) = log10( (nSi/nH)_1 ) - log10( (nSi/nH)_2 )`\n\nSubstitute the expressions from above:\n`log10(R) = (0.3 + log10( (nSi/nH)_sun )) - (-0.3 + log10( (nSi/nH)_sun ))`\n`log10(R) = 0.3 - (-0.3)`\n`log10(R) = 0.6`\n\nTo find the ratio `R`, we take the antilogarithm:\n`R = 10^0.6`\n`R â‰ˆ 3.98`\n\nThis value is approximately 3.9. The information about the stellar masses and the specific solar abundances of Mg and Fe are not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
