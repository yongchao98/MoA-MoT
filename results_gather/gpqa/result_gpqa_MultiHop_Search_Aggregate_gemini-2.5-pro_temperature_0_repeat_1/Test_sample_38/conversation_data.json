    "To find the numerical value of \"a\", we must use the normalization condition from quantum mechanics. This principle states that the total probability of finding the particle in all possible locations must be equal to 1. The probability is given by the square of the magnitude of the wave function, |Ψ(x)|². Since the particle is confined to the region between x=1 and x=3, the integral of the probability density over this interval must be 1.\n\nThe wave function is given as:\nΨ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the probability density function, |Ψ(x)|²**\n\nThe probability density is the product of the wave function and its complex conjugate (Ψ*).\n\nThe complex conjugate, Ψ*(x), is found by changing the sign of the imaginary part:\nΨ*(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5*i\n\nNow, we multiply Ψ(x) and Ψ*(x):\n|Ψ(x)|² = Ψ*(x) * Ψ(x)\n|Ψ(x)|² = [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5*i ] * [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i ]\n|Ψ(x)|² = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) )² - (0.5i)²\n|Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) - 0.25 * i²\nSince i² = -1:\n|Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n**Step 2: Set up and solve the normalization integral**\n\nThe normalization condition requires that the integral of the probability density over the allowed region equals 1:\n∫[from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\nWe can solve this integral by separating it into two parts:\n∫[from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x)) dx + ∫[from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx = 1\n\nSolving the first part:\na² * ∫[from 1 to 3] (1 / (1 + x)) dx = a² * [ln|1+x|] (from 1 to 3)\n= a² * (ln(4) - ln(2))\n= a² * ln(4/2)\n= a² * ln(2)\n\nSolving the second part:\n∫[from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx = [0.25x] (from 1 to 3)\n= 0.25 * 3 - 0.25 * 1\n= 0.75 - 0.25\n= 0.5\n\n**Step 3: Solve for \"a\"**\n\nNow, substitute the results back into the equation:\na² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n\nSubtract 0.5 from both sides:\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\n\nIsolate a²:\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nUsing the value of ln(2) ≈ 0.693:\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.693\na² ≈ 0.7215\n\nNow, take the square root to find \"a\":\na ≈ √0.7215\na ≈ 0.849\n\nThis value is closest to 0.85.\n\n<<<D>>>"
