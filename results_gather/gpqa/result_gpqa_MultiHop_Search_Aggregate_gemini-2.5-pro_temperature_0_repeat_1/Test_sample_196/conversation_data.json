    "### Analysis of Compound X\n\nFirst, the structure of the starting material, Compound X, is determined from the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The broad absorption in the 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ range is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are indicative of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (broad singlet, 1H):** This signal is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   **8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (doublet, 2H):** This pattern strongly suggests a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm is from the protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the signal at 7.2 ppm is from the protons adjacent to an alkyl group.\n    *   **Alkyl Region (2.9 ppm to 0.9 ppm):**\n        *   **2.9 ppm (multiplet, 1H):** Likely the proton attached directly to the benzene ring (a benzylic proton).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (doublet, 3H):** A methyl group coupled to a single proton.\n        *   **1.7 ppm (multiplet, 2H):** A methylene (-CH₂-) group.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (triplet, 3H):** A methyl group coupled to a methylene group.\n    *   Assembling the alkyl fragment: The signals are consistent with a *sec*-butyl group [-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃] attached to the benzene ring. The proton at 2.9 ppm is the CH, coupled to the methyl doublet at 1.4 ppm and the methylene multiplet at 1.7 ppm. The methylene group at 1.7 ppm is, in turn, coupled to the methyl triplet at 0.9 ppm.\n\nCombining these findings, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (D).\n\n### Reaction and Final Product\n\nThe problem states that Compound X, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, reacts with red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination of reagents is a powerful reducing agent. Specifically, it is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n\nThe reaction is as follows:\nThe carboxylic acid group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is reduced to a methyl group, while the *sec*-butyl group on the aromatic ring remains unchanged.\n\n*   **Starting Material (Compound X):** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the -COOH group to a -CH₃ group.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n\nThis final product matches option (C).\n\n<<<C>>>"
