    "All operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) must respect Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry. However, CP symmetry does not need to be respected by all operators, as SMEFT provides a framework for exploring new sources of CP violation beyond the Standard Model.\n\n*   **Lorentz and Poincaré Symmetry:** The SMEFT is constructed as an effective field theory that preserves the fundamental spacetime symmetries of the Standard Model. The SMEFT Lagrangian is composed of higher-dimensional local operators built from the Standard Model fields in a way that obeys gauge and Poincaré symmetries. Poincaré symmetry is the group of isometries of Minkowski spacetime, which includes Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) and spacetime translations. Therefore, both Lorentz and Poincaré symmetries are fundamental requirements for all operators in the SMEFT.\n\n*   **CPT Symmetry:** The CPT theorem, a fundamental result in quantum field theory, states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the combined transformation of charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T). Since SMEFT is formulated as a Lorentz-invariant effective field theory, it is expected to conserve CPT symmetry. A violation of CPT would imply a violation of Lorentz symmetry.\n\n*   **CP Symmetry:** In contrast, CP symmetry is not a mandatory symmetry for all operators in the SMEFT. The framework allows for and is used to study potential new sources of CP violation that are not present in the Standard Model. There is an active area of research focused on classifying SMEFT operators based on their CP properties, distinguishing between those that are CP-conserving and those that are CP-violating.\n\nTherefore, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\n<<<D>>>"
