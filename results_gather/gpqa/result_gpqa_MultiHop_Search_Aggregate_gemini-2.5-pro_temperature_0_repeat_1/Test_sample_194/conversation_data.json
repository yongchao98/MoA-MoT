    "To determine the maximum orbital period of the second planet that will still exhibit transit and occultation events, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the Transit Condition:** A planet transits its star when its projected distance from the center of the star is less than the star's radius. This is defined by the impact parameter, `b`, which is the projected distance normalized by the star's radius. For a transit to occur, the impact parameter must be `b ≤ 1`. An occultation, or secondary eclipse, will occur if a transit happens in a circular orbit. Therefore, the transit condition is the limiting factor.\n\n2.  **Use Planet 1's Data:** We are given that the first planet has a transit impact parameter `b1 = 0.2`. The formula for the impact parameter is `b = (a * cos(i)) / R_s`, where `a` is the semi-major axis, `i` is the orbital inclination, and `R_s` is the stellar radius. Since both planets are in the same orbital plane, their inclination `i` is the same.\n    *   For Planet 1: `0.2 = (a1 * cos(i)) / R_s`\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for the common `cos(i)` term: `cos(i) = (0.2 * R_s) / a1`\n\n3.  **Apply the Transit Condition to Planet 2:** For the second planet to transit, its impact parameter `b2` must be less than or equal to 1.\n    *   For Planet 2: `b2 = (a2 * cos(i)) / R_s ≤ 1`\n\n4.  **Combine the Equations:** Now, we substitute the expression for `cos(i)` from Planet 1 into the inequality for Planet 2.\n    *   `(a2 / R_s) * [(0.2 * R_s) / a1] ≤ 1`\n    *   The stellar radius `R_s` cancels out, simplifying the expression to: `0.2 * (a2 / a1) ≤ 1`\n    *   This gives us the maximum ratio of their semi-major axes: `a2 / a1 ≤ 5`\n\n5.  **Relate Orbital Periods and Semi-Major Axes:** Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (`a`). For two planets orbiting the same star, this can be written as: `(P2 / P1)² = (a2 / a1)³`.\n    *   We can express the ratio of the semi-major axes in terms of their periods: `a2 / a1 = (P2 / P1)^(2/3)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Maximum Period for Planet 2:** Substitute the relationship from Kepler's Law into our inequality from step 4.\n    *   `(P2 / P1)^(2/3) ≤ 5`\n    *   To solve for `P2`, we first raise both sides to the power of 3/2: `P2 / P1 ≤ 5^(3/2)`\n    *   `P2 ≤ P1 * 5^(1.5)`\n    *   Given that Planet 1 has an orbital period `P1 = 3` days, and `5^(1.5)` is approximately 11.18:\n    *   `P2 ≤ 3 * 11.18`\n    *   `P2 ≤ 33.54` days\n\nThe maximum orbital period for the second planet is approximately 33.5 days. The radii of the planets are not necessary for this calculation, as the impact parameter is normalized to the stellar radius.\n\n<<<D>>>"
