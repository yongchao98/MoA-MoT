    "In a universe where magnetic monopoles—isolated north or south poles—exist, two of Maxwell's equations would be fundamentally different.\n\nCurrently, one of Maxwell's equations, Gauss's law for magnetism, is expressed as ∇ ⋅ B = 0. This equation signifies that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero, which is the mathematical statement that magnetic monopoles do not exist; magnetic field lines always form closed loops and do not originate from or terminate at a single point. If a magnetic monopole were to exist, it would act as a source or sink for the magnetic field, similar to how an electric charge is a source or sink for the electric field. Consequently, Gauss's law for magnetism would have to be modified to include a term for the magnetic charge density (ρm), changing the equation to something like ∇ ⋅ B = μ₀ρm.\n\nFurthermore, the existence of magnetic charges implies they can move, creating a magnetic current (Jm). This would alter Faraday's law of induction, which describes the circulation, or curl, of the electric field (∇ × E). In its standard form, the equation is ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t, indicating that a changing magnetic field creates a circulating electric field. With magnetic currents, a new term would be added to account for the fact that a moving magnetic charge also produces a circulating electric field. The modified equation would look similar to ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀Jm.\n\nTherefore, the two equations that would change are the one related to the divergence of the magnetic field (Gauss's law for magnetism) and the one related to the circulation (curl) of the electric field (Faraday's law of induction).\n\n<<<B>>>"
