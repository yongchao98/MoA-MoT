    "To calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable P will yield 0 at time t, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Normalize the state vector.**\n2.  **Find the eigenvector of the operator P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0.**\n3.  **Calculate the probability as the squared magnitude of the projection of the normalized state vector onto the normalized eigenvector.**\n\n**Step 1: Normalize the state vector**\n\nThe given state of the system at time t is the column matrix (vector) `|ψ⟩`:\n```\n|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]\n```\nFirst, we calculate the squared norm of this vector:\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\n\nThe normalization constant is `1/√6`. The normalized state vector, `|ψ_norm⟩`, is:\n```\n|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]\n```\n\n**Step 2: Find the eigenvector for the eigenvalue 0**\n\nThe observable is represented by the matrix `P`:\n```\nP = [[0,   1/√2,   0],\n     [1/√2,  0,  1/√2],\n     [0,   1/√2,   0]]\n```\nWe need to find the eigenvector `|v₀⟩` that corresponds to the eigenvalue `λ = 0`. This is done by solving the equation `P|v₀⟩ = 0|v₀⟩`, which simplifies to `P|v₀⟩ = 0`.\n\nLet `|v₀⟩ = [x, y, z]`. The matrix equation is:\n```\n[[0,   1/√2,   0],\n [1/√2,  0,  1/√2],\n [0,   1/√2,   0]] * [x, y, z] = [0, 0, 0]\n```\nThis gives us a system of linear equations:\n1.  `(1/√2) * y = 0`  => `y = 0`\n2.  `(1/√2) * x + (1/√2) * z = 0` => `x + z = 0` => `x = -z`\n3.  `(1/√2) * y = 0` => `y = 0`\n\nThe eigenvector is of the form `[k, 0, -k]` for any non-zero constant `k`. We can choose `k=1` for simplicity, so a non-normalized eigenvector is `[1, 0, -1]`.\n\nNow, we normalize this eigenvector:\nSquared norm = `1² + 0² + (-1)² = 2`\nThe normalized eigenvector, `|v₀_norm⟩`, is:\n```\n|v₀_norm⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]\n```\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the probability**\n\nThe probability of measuring the eigenvalue 0, `Prob(0)`, is the squared absolute value of the inner product of the normalized eigenvector and the normalized state vector:\n`Prob(0) = |⟨v₀_norm|ψ_norm⟩|²`\n\nFirst, calculate the inner product (dot product for real vectors):\n`⟨v₀_norm|ψ_norm⟩ = [(1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]] ⋅ [(1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]]`\n`= (1/√2) * (1/√6) * ([1, 0, -1] ⋅ [-1, 2, 1])`\n`= (1/√12) * (1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1)`\n`= (1/√12) * (-1 + 0 - 1)`\n`= (1/√12) * (-2)`\n`= -2 / √12 = -2 / (2√3) = -1/√3`\n\nFinally, square the magnitude of this result to get the probability:\n`Prob(0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3`\n\nThe probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 is 1/3.\n\n<<<A>>>"
