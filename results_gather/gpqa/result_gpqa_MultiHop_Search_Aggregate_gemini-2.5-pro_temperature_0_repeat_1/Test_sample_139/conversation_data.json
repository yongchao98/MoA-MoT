    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to identify Substance X and solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Gas W**: The gas W is released during a violent reaction and its molecules contain an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's examine some simple gas molecules:\n    *   Deuterium gas (D₂ or ²H₂): Each atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This is a perfect match.\n    *   Helium-4 (⁴He): Has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. While it fits the description, it's a noble gas and an unlikely product of a violent chemical reaction.\n    *   Nitrogen gas (N₂): The most common isotope ¹⁴N has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. An N₂ molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. This is also a possibility.\n    *   Oxygen gas (O₂): The most common isotope ¹⁶O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. An O₂ molecule has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. This is another possibility.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction**: Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W and forming a precipitate G. The fact that X contains a \"heavier isotope\" and the strong possibility that W is D₂ strongly suggests that the isotope in X is Deuterium (D).\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X and its Analog**: The problem states that X and its \"very close analog\" are used as reagents in organic chemistry. This points towards common laboratory reagents. If X contains deuterium, its analog would contain normal hydrogen (protium). The clue about the reaction with a keto acid producing a product with two oxygen atoms is key. This indicates a strong reducing agent capable of reducing both a ketone and a carboxylic acid group to alcohols.\n    *   Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a powerful reducing agent that fits this description perfectly. Its deuterated analog is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n    *   Let's test LiAlD₄ as Substance X.\n\n4.  **Verify the Clues with LiAlD₄**:\n    *   **Heavier Isotope**: LiAlD₄ contains deuterium (D), a heavier isotope of hydrogen. This fits.\n    *   **Violent Reaction**: LiAlD₄ is known to react violently with water and other protic substances. If we assume liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O), the reaction is: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂. This reaction is violent and produces deuterium gas (W). This fits.\n    *   **Precipitate G**: The reaction produces aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, which is the deuterated equivalent of aluminum hydroxide, a known precipitate. This fits.\n    *   **Substance B**: When precipitate G, Al(OD)₃, is heated, it decomposes: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. So, substance B is heavy water (D₂O). This fits.\n    *   **Melting Point of B**: The melting point of B (D₂O) is given as very close to 277 K. The actual melting point of heavy water is 3.82 °C, which is 276.97 K. This is indeed very close to 277 K. This fits perfectly.\n    *   **Reaction with Keto Acid**: LiAlH₄ (and thus LiAlD₄) is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce both the ketone and carboxylic acid functional groups of a keto acid into a diol. A diol contains two oxygen atoms. This fits.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on Identity**: All clues point consistently to Substance X being Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n\n6.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses**: The final step is to calculate the sum of the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in LiAlD₄.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Lightest Element**: The lightest element is hydrogen (atomic number 1). The molecule contains 4 atoms of its isotope, Deuterium (²H). The mass of one deuterium atom is approximately 2 amu.\n        *   Cumulative mass of the lightest element = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   **Heaviest Element**: The heaviest element is Aluminum (atomic number 13). The molecule contains 1 atom of Aluminum (²⁷Al). The mass of one aluminum atom is approximately 27 amu.\n        *   Cumulative mass of the heaviest element = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n    *   **Total Sum**: The question asks for the cumulative sum of these two masses.\n        *   Total = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe calculated value is 35.\n\n<<<B>>>"
