    "To determine the correct reagents, let's analyze each reaction separately.\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\nThis reaction is a classic example of cyanohydrin formation. A ketone (butan-2-one) reacts with a cyanide source (NaCN) to form a cyanohydrin. The mechanism involves the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) on the carbonyl carbon. The resulting alkoxide intermediate is then protonated to yield the final hydroxyl group.\n\nFor this reaction to proceed effectively, a source of protons is needed. While NaCN provides the nucleophile, an acid is required to protonate the intermediate. Often, HCN is generated *in situ* by adding an acid to the cyanide salt solution. The reaction is typically fastest at a slightly acidic pH of 4-5. The reagent `A` must therefore be an acid source. Looking at the options, `H3O+` represents acidic conditions, making it a suitable choice for reagent A.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\nThis reaction shows the conversion of a nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation is known as nitrile hydrolysis. Nitrile hydrolysis can be performed under either acidic or basic conditions, typically by heating the nitrile with an aqueous solution of a strong acid or a strong base.\n\nThe options for reagent `B` are HCl and CH3COOH.\n*   **HCl (Hydrochloric acid)** is a strong acid and is commonly used to catalyze the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. The process involves heating the nitrile under reflux with the dilute acid.\n*   **CH3COOH (Acetic acid)** is a weak acid and would be much less effective for this hydrolysis compared to a strong mineral acid like HCl.\n\nTherefore, `B` is most suitably HCl.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Reagent **A** is an acid, represented by **H3O+**.\n*   Reagent **B** is a strong acid for nitrile hydrolysis, which is **HCl**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
