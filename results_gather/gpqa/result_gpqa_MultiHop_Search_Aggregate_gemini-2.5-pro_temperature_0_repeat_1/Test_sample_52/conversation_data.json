    "The initial analysis of the spectroscopic data strongly points towards the molecular formula C11H12O2. Let's break down the reasoning based on the provided information and confirm it with the search results.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:\n\n1.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents, having a base formula of C6H4. The 1H NMR shows two signals for these aromatic protons, which often suggests a para-substitution pattern, leading to two sets of chemically equivalent protons.\n\n2.  **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a -COO- functional group, which contains one carbon and two oxygen atoms.\n\n3.  **1H NMR Spectrum Breakdown:**\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** Confirms the 4 protons on the di-substituted ring.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (doublet) and the three methyl protons (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl proton is split only by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet. This fragment has the formula C3H5.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** One methyl signal corresponds to the propenyl group mentioned above. The second methyl signal must be part of the ester group. This could be a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH3). In either case, this adds a CH3 group.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a critical constraint. It rules out structures containing ethyl esters (-COOCH2CH3) or propyl groups (-CH2CH2CH3), which would show signals for -CH2- protons.\n\n### Assembling the Molecular Formula:\n\nLet's sum the atoms from the identified fragments:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from the C6H4 ring) + 3 (from the C3H5 propenyl group) + 1 (from the -COO- ester core) + 1 (from the second CH3 group) = **11 carbons**.\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from the C6H4 ring) + 5 (from the C3H5 propenyl group) + 3 (from the second CH3 group) = **12 hydrogens**.\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the -COO- ester group) = **2 oxygens**.\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n### Comparing with Options:\n\n*   **A) C12H12O2:** Incorrect carbon count.\n*   **B) C11H12O2:** Matches the derived formula. Examples of isomers with this formula include ethyl cinnamate and cinnamyl acetate. However, ethyl cinnamate has a -CH2- group and cinnamyl acetate has a -CH2- group, both of which are ruled out by the NMR data. The correct structures would be isomers like *p*-propenyl methyl benzoate or *p*-propenylphenyl acetate.\n*   **C) C12H14O2:** Incorrect carbon and hydrogen count.\n*   **D) C11H14O2:** Incorrect hydrogen count. A compound like 3-phenylpropyl acetate has this formula but contains -CH2- groups and lacks vinyl protons.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the spectroscopic data, the only possible chemical formula among the choices is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
