    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the mean decay distance of the X meson. The mean decay distance (or decay length) is the average distance a particle travels in the lab frame before it decays.\n\n### Formula\nThe mean decay distance, L, is given by the formula:\nL = γ * β * c * τ\n\nWhere:\n*   **γ** is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **β** is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light, c.\n*   **c** is the speed of light.\n*   **τ** is the proper lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame.\n\nA more direct formula combines these terms:\nL = (p / m) * (ħc / Γ)\n\nWhere:\n*   **p** is the momentum of the particle.\n*   **m** is the mass of the particle.\n*   **ħc** is the reduced Planck constant multiplied by the speed of light.\n*   **Γ** is the decay width of the particle.\n\n### Given Values\n*   Production energy, E_X = 8 GeV\n*   Mass, m_X = 1.2 GeV/c²\n*   Decay width, Γ_X = 320 MeV = 0.320 GeV\n\n### Constants\n*   Reduced Planck constant times the speed of light, ħc ≈ 197.3 MeV·fm (or 0.1973 GeV·fm). 1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n1.  **Calculate the particle's momentum (p).**\n    The relativistic energy-momentum relation is E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². We can solve for pc:\n    (pc)² = E² - (mc²)²\n    pc = sqrt(E² - (mc²)²)\n    pc = sqrt((8 GeV)² - (1.2 GeV)²)\n    pc = sqrt(64 - 1.44) GeV\n    pc = sqrt(62.56) GeV\n    p ≈ 7.9095 GeV/c\n\n2.  **Calculate the ratio p/m.**\n    This term is equivalent to γβ.\n    p / m = (7.9095 GeV/c) / (1.2 GeV/c²)\n    p / m ≈ 6.5912\n\n3.  **Calculate the proper decay length (cτ).**\n    The proper lifetime τ is related to the decay width Γ by τ = ħ/Γ. Therefore, the proper decay length is cτ = ħc/Γ.\n    cτ = (197.3 MeV·fm) / (320 MeV)\n    cτ ≈ 0.6166 fm\n\n4.  **Calculate the mean decay distance (L).**\n    Now, we multiply the results from steps 2 and 3.\n    L = (p / m) * (cτ)\n    L ≈ 6.5912 * 0.6166 fm\n    L ≈ 4.0645 fm\n\n5.  **Convert to meters.**\n    Since 1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m:\n    L ≈ 4.0645 × 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\n### Conclusion\nThe calculated value is approximately 4.0645 × 10⁻¹⁵ m. This is extremely close to option D. The minor difference is likely due to the precision of the constants used in the problem's creation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **4.0655 * 10⁻¹⁵ m**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
