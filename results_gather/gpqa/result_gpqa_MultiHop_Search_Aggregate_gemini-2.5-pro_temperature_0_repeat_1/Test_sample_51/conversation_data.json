    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical Principle:** The problem describes the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy levels within a stellar photosphere, which is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The relationship governing the population of these energy levels is the Boltzmann equation.\n\n2.  **The Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms in a higher energy level (level 2, N₂) to a lower energy level (level 1, N₁) is given by:\n    N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T)]\n    Where:\n    *   N₁ and N₂ are the number of atoms in energy level 1 and 2.\n    *   g₁ and g₂ are the statistical weights of the levels (which are constants for these levels).\n    *   E₂ - E₁ (or ΔE) is the energy difference between the two levels.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Define the Ratio:** The problem states that \"the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2) ... decreases when the star has spots.\" Spots cause the temperature to decrease. Let's test which ratio, N₂/N₁ or N₁/N₂, fits this description.\n    *   Let's consider the ratio R = N₂/N₁. As the temperature T decreases, the term -ΔE/(kT) becomes more negative, and therefore the exponential term `exp[-ΔE/(kT)]` decreases. This matches the problem's description.\n    *   So, the ratio in question is R = N₂/N₁.\n\n4.  **Set up the Factor:** The question asks for the factor by which this ratio changes \"when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots.\" This is the ratio of the ratio at the no-spot temperature to the ratio at the spot temperature.\n    *   T_nospots = 6000 K\n    *   T_spots = 5500 K\n    *   Factor = R_nospots / R_spots\n\n    Factor = { (g₂/g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)] } / { (g₂/g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_spots)] }\n\n    The statistical weight term (g₂/g₁) cancels out:\n    Factor = exp[-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)] / exp[-ΔE / (k * T_spots)]\n    Factor = exp[ (-ΔE/k) * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots) ]\n    Factor = exp[ (ΔE/k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]\n\n5.  **Calculate the Energy Term (ΔE/k):** The energy difference ΔE can be calculated from the wavelength (λ) of the transition using the formula ΔE = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light.\n    *   h ≈ 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   λ = 1448 Å = 1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n\n    ΔE/k = (h * c) / (λ * k)\n    ΔE/k = (6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s * 3 x 10⁸ m/s) / (1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m * 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K)\n    ΔE/k ≈ (1.9878 x 10⁻²⁵) / (1.998 x 10⁻³²) K\n    ΔE/k ≈ 99489 K\n\n6.  **Calculate the Temperature Term:**\n    *   1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots = 1/5500 K - 1/6000 K\n    *   1/5500 - 1/6000 = (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) = 500 / 33,000,000 = 1 / 66,000 K⁻¹\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Factor:** Now, substitute the values back into the factor equation:\n    *   Factor = exp[ 99489 * (1 / 66000) ]\n    *   Factor = exp(1.5074)\n    *   Factor ≈ 4.515\n\nThis value is approximately 4.5.\n\nThe information regarding the star's radius, mass, and the percentage of its surface covered by spots is additional context but not required for the calculation, as the effective temperatures for both scenarios are provided.\n\n<<<A>>>"
