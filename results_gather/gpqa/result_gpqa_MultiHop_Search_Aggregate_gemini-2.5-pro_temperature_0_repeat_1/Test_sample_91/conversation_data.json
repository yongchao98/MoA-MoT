    "To calculate the enthalpy of formation of (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2, we can use the provided bond energies and enthalpy of atomization values. The calculation involves determining the energy required to break the bonds of the reactant elements in their standard state and the energy released when forming the bonds of the product molecule.\n\nHere is a step-by-step calculation:\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure\n\nFirst, we need to determine the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms and the types of bonds in the molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n*   **Counting Carbon Atoms:**\n    *   (CH3)2C: 3 carbons\n    *   CH: 1 carbon\n    *   CH2: 1 carbon\n    *   CH(CH3): 2 carbons\n    *   CH2: 1 carbon\n    *   CH: 1 carbon\n    *   C(CH3)2: 3 carbons\n    *   **Total Carbons = 12**\n\n*   **Counting Hydrogen Atoms:**\n    *   (CH3)2: 6 hydrogens\n    *   CH: 1 hydrogen\n    *   CH2: 2 hydrogens\n    *   CH(CH3): 4 hydrogens\n    *   CH2: 2 hydrogens\n    *   CH: 1 hydrogen\n    *   C(CH3)2: 6 hydrogens\n    *   **Total Hydrogens = 22**\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n### Step 2: Count the Covalent Bonds\n\nNext, we count the number of each type of bond in the molecule.\n*   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n*   **C=C double bonds:** The structure clearly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds (`C=C`). So, there are **2** C=C bonds.\n*   **C-C single bonds:** For a non-cyclic molecule, the total number of bonds in the carbon skeleton is the number of carbon atoms minus one, which is 12 - 1 = 11. Since 2 of these are double bonds, the remaining bonds must be single bonds. Therefore, the number of C-C single bonds is 11 - 2 = **9**.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Compound\n\nThis is the enthalpy of atomization for the compound, which is the energy required to break all of its bonds.\n*   Energy from C-H bonds: 22 mol * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   Energy from C-C bonds: 9 mol * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   Energy from C=C bonds: 2 mol * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n*   **Total Bond Energy** = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Elements\n\nThis is the energy required to convert the elements in their standard states (12 moles of solid carbon and 11 moles of H2 gas) into gaseous atoms.\n*   Atomization of Carbon: 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   Atomization of Hydrogen (breaking H-H bonds): 11 mol * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n*   **Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Elements** = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ/mol**\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to atomize the elements and the energy released when forming the compound from its gaseous atoms (which is the total bond energy).\n*   ΔH_f = (Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Elements) - (Total Bond Energy of Compound)\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n### Step 6: Convert to kJ/g\n\nThe options include units of kJ/g, so we need to convert our result.\n*   Molar Mass of C12H22 = (12 * 12.0 g/mol) + (22 * 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**\n*   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.44 kJ/g**\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
