    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to identify substance A4 and its molecular weight range.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y**\n\nThe problem states that substance A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YF_n. The atomic mass of Y (Ar(Y)) can be related to the number of fluorine atoms (n) by the formula:\n\nAr(Y) = [ (100 / ɷF) - 1 ] * n * Ar(F)\nAr(Y) = [ (100 / 31.96) - 1 ] * n * 18.998 ≈ 40.45 * n\n\nWe must find an integer 'n' that corresponds to a plausible element Y, known to form multiple, reactive fluorides.\n\n*   If n=3, Ar(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to Antimony (Sb, 121.76 g/mol). The theoretical fluorine percentage in SbF3 is 31.89%.\n*   If n=5, Ar(Y) ≈ 202.2 g/mol.\n*   If n=6, Ar(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is close to Plutonium (Pu, ~244 g/mol) and Uranium (U, 238 g/mol).\n\nLet's evaluate the candidates based on the other clues.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate Candidates based on Chemical Properties**\n\nThe problem provides several key chemical properties:\n*   **A1 is a bright-red substance.**\n*   **A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.**\n*   **A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine.** This implies A1 is a higher fluoride than A2 (A1 → A2 + F2).\n\nLet's test the most promising candidate elements:\n\n*   **Antimony (Sb):** If Y is Sb, then A2 would be SbF3. A1 would need to be a higher fluoride, like SbF5. However, SbF5 is a colorless liquid, not a bright-red solid. This contradicts the description of A1.\n\n*   **Plutonium (Pu) / Uranium (U):** If Y is Pu, A2 could be PuF6 (%F ≈ 31.84%). PuF6 is a reddish-brown solid and a powerful oxidizing agent that reacts with xenon. This fits well. A1 would be a higher, unstable fluoride (e.g., PuF8), which is plausible for an actinide. However, if we calculate the molecular weights of known plutonium fluorides (PuF3, PuF4, PuF6), none of them fall into the provided answer ranges. The same issue arises for Uranium.\n\n*   **Platinum (Pt):** Let's test platinum fluorides.\n    *   The mass percentage of fluorine in **PtF5** is 32.75%. This is reasonably close to the given 31.96%. Let's assume **A2 is PtF5**.\n    *   **A1** must be a higher fluoride that is bright-red and decomposes into A2 (PtF5). **Platinum hexafluoride (PtF6)** is a dark-red volatile solid. This is an excellent match for the color.\n    *   **A1 (PtF6) oxidizes xenon.** This is the famous Bartlett reaction, which proved that noble gases can form compounds. This clue fits perfectly.\n    *   **A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine.** The reaction 2PtF6 → 2PtF5 + F2 is known. This confirms that A1 can be PtF6 and A2 can be PtF5.\n\nThe evidence strongly suggests that **Y is Platinum (Pt)**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify A4 and A5**\n\nNow we use the final clue: \"By adding Y (Platinum) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n\nThis describes a comproportionation reaction where platinum metal reduces a platinum fluoride (A4) to a lower oxidation state fluoride (A5). For a 1:1 molar ratio of reactants (Pt and PtF_n), the reaction is:\n\nPt(0) + Pt(n+)F_n → 2 Pt(n/2+)F_{n/2}\n\nThis means that A4 must be a platinum fluoride with an even number of fluorine atoms (n must be even), and A5 will be the fluoride with half that number of fluorine atoms. The known binary fluorides of platinum include PtF2, PtF4, and PtF6.\n\nWe need to find which potential A4 compound has a molecular weight that fits one of the answer choices.\n*   If A4 = PtF6, MW ≈ 309.1 g/mol. This is not in any range.\n*   If A4 = PtF4, MW ≈ 271.1 g/mol. This is not in any range.\n*   If A4 = PtF2, MW ≈ 233.1 g/mol. This value falls squarely in the range **220-240**.\n\nThis identifies A4 as PtF2. The corresponding reaction would be Pt + PtF2 → 2PtF, making A5 = PtF. The final clue, that A5 decomposes in water, is plausible for an unstable species like PtF.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nBased on the systematic evaluation of the clues:\n*   Element Y is **Platinum (Pt)**.\n*   Substance A1 is **PtF6**.\n*   Substance A2 is **PtF5**.\n*   Substance A4 is **PtF2**.\n*   The molecular weight of A4 (PtF2) is approximately 233.1 g/mol.\n\nThis molecular weight falls within the range of 220-240.\n\n<<<D>>>"
