    "The search results confirm the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude, K, for a planet in a circular orbit (eccentricity e=0).\n\nFrom result, for a circular orbit (e=0) and m_p << m_S:\nm_p * sin(i) ≈ (P / 2πG)^(1/3) * K * m_S^(2/3)\n\nRearranging for K:\nK ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i) / m_S^(2/3))\n\nThis confirms my initial formula. The semi-amplitude K is proportional to the maximum Doppler shift observed.\n\nThe key relationship derived from this formula is:\nK ∝ P^(-1/3) assuming all other parameters (m_p, m_S, sin(i)) are constant.\n\nFrom this, we can write the relationship for the period P:\nP ∝ K^(-3)\n\nNow, let's apply this to the two planetary systems. We are asked for the ratio P₂ / P₁.\n\nP₂ / P₁ = (K₂ / K₁)^(-3) = (K₁ / K₂)^3\n\nWe are given the periodic wavelength shifts, which are directly proportional to the radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K).\n- Shift for planet #1 is up to 5 milliangstroms, so K₁ ∝ 5.\n- Shift for planet #2 is 7 milliangstroms, so K₂ ∝ 7.\n\nTherefore, the ratio K₁ / K₂ is 5 / 7.\n\nNow, we can calculate the ratio of the orbital periods:\nP₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³\nP₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343\nP₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.36443\n\nThis calculation relies on the implicit assumption that the inclination angles (i) are the same for both systems, as the problem provides no information to the contrary and this is the only way to reach a determined answer among the choices. Given that the masses of the stars are identical and the masses of the planets are similar, this is a reasonable assumption for this type of problem.\n\nThe result ~0.36 matches option A.\n\nFinal check of the steps:\n1.  Identify the relationship between the observable (wavelength shift) and the physical quantity (radial velocity semi-amplitude, K). They are directly proportional. Δλ ∝ K.\n2.  Identify the relationship between K and the orbital period P from the standard radial velocity formula. For circular orbits, K ∝ P^(-1/3), assuming other parameters are constant.\n3.  The problem states the stellar masses are identical (M₁ = M₂) and planetary masses are similar (m_p1 ≈ m_p2). The inclination angle (i) is the only other variable. Assuming i₁ ≈ i₂ is necessary to solve the problem.\n4.  Set up the ratio: P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3.\n5.  Substitute the values proportional to K: P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)^3.\n6.  Calculate the final value: 125 / 343 ≈ 0.36.\n\nThe logic holds.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n(5/7)^3 = 0.36443148688...\nThis is approximately 0.36.\n\nThe question asks \"How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\". This is the ratio P₂ / P₁. Since the ratio is less than 1, the orbital period of planet #2 is shorter than that of planet #1.\n\nThe value is ~0.36. This corresponds to option A.\n\nFinal answer is A.\n\nTo be extremely thorough, let's write out the full ratio without any simplifications first:\nP₂ / P₁ = [ (2πG * (m_p2*sin(i₂))³ / (K₂³ * M_star2²)) ] / [ (2πG * (m_p1*sin(i₁))³ / (K₁³ * M_star1²)) ]\nP₂ / P₁ = (m_p2/m_p1)³ * (sin(i₂)/sin(i₁))³ * (M_star1/M_star2)² * (K₁/K₂)^3\n\nGiven information:\n- M_star1 = M_star2 -> (M_star1/M_star2)² = 1\n- m_p1 ≈ m_p2 -> (m_p2/m_p1)³ ≈ 1\n- K₁/K₂ = 5/7\n\nThis leaves:\nP₂ / P₁ ≈ (sin(i₂)/sin(i₁))³ * (5/7)³\n\nWithout assuming sin(i₂) = sin(i₁), the problem is unsolvable. The structure of the question and the answer choices strongly imply this assumption should be made. For example, if i₂ was 90 degrees (sin(i₂)=1) and i₁ was 30 degrees (sin(i₁)=0.5), the factor would be (1/0.5)³ = 8. This would drastically change the answer. However, in the absence of this information, assuming the systems are comparable (i.e., sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂)) is the standard approach.\n\nTherefore, the calculation stands.\nP₂ / P₁ ≈ (5/7)³ ≈ 0.36.\n\nThe answer is A.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) ~ 0.36 -> (5/7)^3\nB) ~ 1.40 -> 7/5\nC) ~ 0.85 -> ?\nD) ~ 1.96 -> (7/5)^2\n\nOption B is simply the ratio of the velocity amplitudes K₂/K₁.\nOption D is the square of the ratio of the velocity amplitudes.\nOption A is the cube of the inverse ratio of the velocity amplitudes. This matches the derived formula P ∝ K⁻³.\n\nThe physics is sound. The interpretation of the problem seems correct.\n\nFinal answer is A.\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Understand the RV Method and Doppler Shift:** The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the light from their host star. As the star \"wobbles\" due to the planet's gravitational pull, its light is alternately blueshifted (when moving towards us) and redshifted (when moving away). The amount of wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r). The maximum shift corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity, denoted as K.\n    *   v_r ∝ Δλ\n    *   Therefore, K ∝ Δλ_max\n\n2.  **Relate Given Information to K:** We are given the maximum periodic wavelength shifts for the two systems.\n    *   For planet #1, Δλ₁ = 5 milliangstroms. So, K₁ ∝ 5.\n    *   For planet #2, Δλ₂ = 7 milliangstroms. So, K₂ ∝ 7.\n    *   This gives us the ratio of the semi-amplitudes: K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7.\n\n3.  **Use the Radial Velocity Formula:** The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is:\n    K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i) / M_star^(2/3))\n    Where:\n    *   P is the orbital period.\n    *   m_p is the planet's mass.\n    *   M_star is the star's mass.\n    *   i is the orbital inclination.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n4.  **Isolate the Orbital Period (P):** We need to find the relationship between the period (P) and the semi-amplitude (K). Let's rearrange the formula to solve for P.\n    *   K³ = (2πG / P) * (m_p * sin(i))³ / (M_star)²\n    *   P = (2πG * (m_p * sin(i))³ / (K³ * M_star²))\n\n5.  **Analyze the Relationship:** From the rearranged formula, we can see the proportionality between P and K, assuming other factors are constant.\n    *   P ∝ 1 / K³ or P ∝ K⁻³\n\n6.  **Set up the Ratio of Periods:** We need to find how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio P₂ / P₁.\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = (K₂ / K₁)⁻³ = (K₁ / K₂)³\n\n7.  **Consider the Assumptions:** The problem states that the stellar masses are identical (M_star1 = M_star2) and the planetary masses are similar (m_p1 ≈ m_p2). For the relationship P ∝ K⁻³ to hold, we must also assume that the orbital inclinations are similar (sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂)). This is a standard implicit assumption in such problems when no other information is given, and the existence of a matching answer choice confirms this approach.\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:** Substitute the ratio of the semi-amplitudes into the equation.\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343\n    *   P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\nThe result ~0.36 indicates that the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
