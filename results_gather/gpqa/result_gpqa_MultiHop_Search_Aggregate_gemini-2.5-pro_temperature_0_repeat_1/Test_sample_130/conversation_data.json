    "### Breakdown of the Chemical Puzzle\n\n1.  **The Dienophile:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to its anhydride. The anhydride's ¹H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and its ¹³C NMR shows two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon). This high degree of symmetry points unequivocally to **maleic anhydride**. The two alkene protons are chemically equivalent, as are the two alkene carbons and the two carbonyl carbons.\n\n2.  **The Diene:** The problem explicitly names the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with methyl groups on all four carbons of the conjugated diene system and a CH₂ group at the 5th position.\n\n3.  **The Reaction:** The reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition. This reaction is known to produce a bicyclic product. When a cyclic diene like cyclopentadiene reacts, two stereoisomeric products can form: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n\n4.  **The Products (Major and Minor):** The reaction yields a major and a minor product, which are the *endo* and *exo* isomers. According to the \"endo rule\" for kinetically controlled Diels-Alder reactions, the major product is the *endo* isomer. This is due to a stabilizing secondary orbital interaction in the transition state. The minor product is the *exo* isomer, which is often more thermodynamically stable but forms more slowly.\n\n    *   **Structure:** The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene core.\n        *   The CH₂ group from the diene becomes the C7 methylene bridge.\n        *   The four methyl groups are located at the bridgehead positions (C1, C4) and on the double bond (C5, C6).\n        *   The maleic anhydride part forms a fused ring at positions C2 and C3. The two protons from the anhydride are now attached to C2 and C3.\n\n    *   ***Endo* Isomer (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented on the same side (*syn*) as the C5-C6 double bond. In this arrangement, the two protons on the anhydride portion (Hₐ) point away from the double bond and towards the C7 methylene bridge.\n    *   ***Exo* Isomer (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is oriented on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C5-C6 double bond. Here, the Hₐ protons point towards the C5-C6 double bond.\n\n5.  **NMR Analysis and the NOESY Cross-Peak:**\n    *   **NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy)** shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å). The question states a cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor one. This allows us to distinguish the isomers.\n    *   **Proton Signal Assignments (based on typical chemical shifts):**\n        *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons (Hₐ) on the anhydride part of the molecule.\n        *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups on the C5-C6 double bond (vinylic methyls).\n        *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** These are the six equivalent protons of the two methyl groups at the bridgehead positions (C1, C4).\n        *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This signal corresponds to one of the two protons on the C7 methylene bridge. Specifically, it is the *syn* proton (Hₛᵧₙ), which is shielded by the π-electron cloud of the nearby C5-C6 double bond, causing it to appear at a higher field (lower ppm) than its partner. It appears as a doublet due to coupling with the other C7 proton.\n\n    *   **Identifying the Crucial NOE:**\n        *   In the **major (*endo*) product**, the anhydride protons (Hₐ, ~3.5 ppm) are spatially close to the *syn*-proton of the C7 bridge (Hₛᵧₙ, ~1.5 ppm). Therefore, a NOESY cross-peak between these two signals is expected.\n        *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, the anhydride protons (Hₐ, ~3.5 ppm) are far from the C7 bridge protons but are close to the vinylic methyl groups (~1.7 ppm). A cross-peak would be expected between the signals at ~3.5 ppm and ~1.7 ppm for this isomer.\n\nSince the unique cross-peak is observed in the **major product**, it must be the one connecting the anhydride protons and the *syn*-methylene bridge proton. This corresponds to the resonances at approximately 3.5 ppm (a 2H singlet) and 1.5 ppm (a 1H doublet).\n\nMatching this with the given options:\n\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm: Incorrect. These protons are far apart.\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: Incorrect. This cross-peak would be characteristic of the *minor* product.\n*   **C) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** **Correct.** This describes the interaction between the *syn*-C7 proton and the anhydride protons in the major *endo* adduct.\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm: Incorrect. These methyl groups are on opposite sides of the ring system and are not close enough for a significant NOE.\n\n<<<C>>>"
