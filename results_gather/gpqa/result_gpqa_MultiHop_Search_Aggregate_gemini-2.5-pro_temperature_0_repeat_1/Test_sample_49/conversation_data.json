    "The number of loops in the Feynman diagram can be determined from the mathematical expression provided.\n\nIn quantum field theory, calculations for processes involving loops of virtual particles require integrating over all possible momenta that can flow through the loop. For a diagram with `L` loops in a four-dimensional spacetime, the calculation of the amplitude involves `L` separate momentum integrals. After performing these integrations, a characteristic factor of `(1/(4pi)^2)^L`, which simplifies to `1/(4pi)^(2L)`, appears in the final expression.\n\nThe note found on the desk contains the term `1/(4pi)^6`. By comparing this to the general form `1/(4pi)^(2L)`, we can determine the number of loops, `L`.\n\nSetting the exponents equal gives the equation:\n`2L = 6`\n\nSolving for `L` yields:\n`L = 3`\n\nThe other factors in the expression, such as the coupling constants (`alpha^3` and `g^2`) and the ratio of energy scales `(Q/M)^2`, are related to the specific details of the interaction, like the number of vertices and the masses of the particles involved. However, the power of the `1/(4pi)` factor is a direct consequence of the number of loop integrations performed.\n\nTherefore, the Feynman diagram contained 3 loops.\n\n<<<A>>>"
