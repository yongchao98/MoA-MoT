    "The step-by-step synthesis of the final product and the subsequent analysis of its 1H NMR spectrum are as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\nAcetic acid is treated with bromine in the presence of pyridine and acetic anhydride. This reaction is an alpha-halogenation, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The alpha-carbon of acetic acid is brominated.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\nProduct 1 (bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid. This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid is converted into an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\nProduct 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide. The cyanide ion acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\nProduct 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (a strong base) and 1,5-dibromopentane. This is a tandem dialkylation reaction.\n1.  Sodium hydride removes an acidic proton from the carbon between the cyano and ester groups, creating a carbanion.\n2.  This carbanion attacks one of the brominated carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an intermolecular Sₙ2 reaction.\n3.  Since excess sodium hydride is used, the remaining acidic proton on the alpha-carbon is also removed, forming a new carbanion.\n4.  This second carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the carbon at the other end of the pentyl chain and displacing the second bromine atom. This cyclization forms a six-membered ring because the reacting chain consists of the alpha-carbon and the five carbons from the pentane derivative.\n*   **Final Product 4:** 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Final Product 4**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the chemical equivalence of the protons in 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\nThe molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the quaternary carbon (C1), the cyano group, the ester group, and the C4 carbon of the cyclohexane ring. This symmetry affects the number of signals.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-COOCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (**-CH₃**) are equivalent to each other. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (**-CH₂-**) are equivalent to each other. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:** Due to the plane of symmetry, the protons on C2 are equivalent to those on C6, and the protons on C3 are equivalent to those on C5. In the chair conformation, the axial and equatorial protons on the same carbon are not equivalent (they are diastereotopic).\n    *   **C2 and C6 Protons:** The two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) are equivalent to each other. The two equatorial protons (one on C2, one on C6) are also equivalent to each other. The axial and equatorial protons are distinct. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **C3 and C5 Protons:** Similarly, the two axial protons are equivalent, and the two equatorial protons are equivalent. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   **C4 Protons:** The axial and equatorial protons on C4 are diastereotopic and thus not equivalent. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nAdding them all up: 1 (ethyl CH₃) + 1 (ethyl CH₂) + 2 (C2/C6 protons) + 2 (C3/C5 protons) + 2 (C4 protons) = **8 distinct signals**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
