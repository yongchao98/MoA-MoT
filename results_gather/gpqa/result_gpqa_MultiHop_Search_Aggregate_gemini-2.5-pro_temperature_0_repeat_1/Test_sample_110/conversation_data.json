    "### Analysis of the Reactions\n\n**Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\nThis reaction is a classic Michael addition. The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is strong and sterically hindered. It will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate, which then acts as a nucleophile.\n\n1.  **Enolate Formation:** The starting ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two alpha-carbons (the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group), C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is substituted with an ethyl and a methyl group, so it has no acidic protons to be removed.\n    *   C6 is substituted with a methyl group and has one acidic proton.\n    *   Therefore, the base will exclusively remove the proton from C6, forming the enolate at the C1-C6 position.\n\n2.  **Michael Addition:** The formed enolate will act as a nucleophile and attack the ethyl acrylate, which is an α,β-unsaturated ester and serves as the Michael acceptor. The attack occurs at the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n3.  **Product Structure (A):** A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. The resulting structure is `2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl-6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)cyclohexan-1-one`. To name this product according to the options provided, the ring is treated as a substituent on the propanoate chain. The numbering of the cyclohexyl ring is adjusted to give the lowest possible numbers to the substituents. If we number the ring starting from the carbon where the propanoate chain is attached as C1, the carbonyl group is at C2. The methyl group that was at C6 is now at C1. The ethyl and methyl groups that were at C2 are now at C3. This corresponds to the name: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n**Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O)**\n\nThis is also a Michael addition reaction.\n\n1.  **Nucleophile Formation:** The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), will deprotonate the carbon alpha to the electron-withdrawing nitro group in 1-nitropropane (`CH3-CH2-CH2-NO2`). This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate).\n\n2.  **Michael Addition:** The nitronate anion acts as a nucleophile and attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH3-CH=CH-CN`). The β-carbon is the carbon atom bearing the methyl group.\n\n3.  **Product Structure (B):** A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. The resulting structure is `CH3-CH2-CH(NO2)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN`. To name this compound, we follow IUPAC nomenclature for nitriles, where the carbon of the cyano group is C1. This gives a six-carbon chain (hexanenitrile). The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4. The correct name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
