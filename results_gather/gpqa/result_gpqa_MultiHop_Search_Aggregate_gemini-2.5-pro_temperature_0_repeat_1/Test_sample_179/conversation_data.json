    "To determine the minimum energy of the system, we must consider the electrostatic potential energy from all pairs of charges. The total energy is the sum of two components: the potential energy of the 12 charges on the sphere and the potential energy of interaction between the central charge and the 12 charges on the sphere.\n\n**1. Interaction Energy between the Central Charge and the Spherical Charges**\n\nThe potential energy (U) between two point charges, q1 and q2, separated by a distance r is given by Coulomb's law: U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant (approximately 8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m²/C²).\n\nIn this system, the central charge (q_c = 2e) interacts with each of the 12 charges (q_s = 2e) on the sphere. The distance between the central charge and each of the charges on the sphere is the radius, R = 2 m.\n\nThe potential energy between the central charge and one charge on the sphere is:\nU_interaction_single = k * (2e * 2e) / R = 4 * k * e² / R\n\nSince there are 12 such charges on the sphere, the total interaction energy with the central charge is:\nU_interaction_total = 12 * (4 * k * e² / R) = 48 * k * e² / R\n\nThis energy is constant as long as the charges are on the sphere, regardless of their specific positions.\n\n**2. Potential Energy of the 12 Charges on the Sphere**\n\nTo achieve the minimum energy for the entire system, the 12 charges on the surface of the sphere must arrange themselves to minimize their mutual potential energy. This is a well-known problem in physics called the Thomson problem. For 12 charges, the configuration of minimum energy is at the vertices of a regular icosahedron.\n\nThe total potential energy of this icosahedral arrangement (U_sphere) is the sum of the potential energies of all possible pairs of charges. There are C(12, 2) = 66 pairs. The distances between the vertices of an icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius R fall into three categories. The energy is typically expressed as:\nU_sphere = E_12 * (k * q_s²) / R\nWhere E_12 is a dimensionless constant for the 12-charge Thomson problem. A known high-precision calculation gives the total energy for 12 electrons on a unit sphere. The sum of the inverse distances for an icosahedral arrangement is approximately 49.1644 relative to the radius.\n\nSo, U_sphere ≈ (k * (2e)²) / R * 49.1644 = (4 * k * e² / R) * 49.1644\n\n**3. Total Minimum Energy of the System**\n\nThe total minimum energy of the system is the sum of the interaction energy with the central charge and the energy of the 12 charges on the sphere.\n\nU_total = U_interaction_total + U_sphere\nU_total = (48 * k * e² / R) + (4 * k * e² / R) * 49.1644\nU_total = (4 * k * e² / R) * (12 + 49.1644)\nU_total = (4 * k * e² / R) * 61.1644\n\nNow, we substitute the known values:\n*   k ≈ 8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m²/C²\n*   e (elementary charge) ≈ 1.602176634 × 10^-19 C\n*   R = 2 m\n\nFirst, let's calculate the term (4 * k * e² / R):\n4 * (8.98755 × 10^9) * (1.602176634 × 10^-19)² / 2\n≈ 4.61425 × 10^-28 J\n\nNow, multiply by the dimensionless factor:\nU_total ≈ (4.61425 × 10^-28 J) * 61.1644\nU_total ≈ 2.8221 × 10^-26 J\n\nRounding to three decimal places, we get 2.822 x 10^-26 J. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
