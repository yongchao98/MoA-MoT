    "To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we must first identify the starting material and the product formed after the reaction.\n\n**1. Starting Material and its Molecular Formula**\n\nThe starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's determine its molecular formula:\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene ring**: A six-membered carbon ring with one double bond.\n*   **Substituents**:\n    *   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 1.\n    *   A formyl group (-CHO) at position 2.\n    *   A vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) at position 5.\n\nCounting the atoms:\n*   **Carbon (C)**: 6 in the ring + 1 in the -COOH group + 1 in the -CHO group + 2 in the vinyl group = 10 carbons.\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**: 7 on the ring structure + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 3 in the vinyl group = 12 hydrogens.\n*   **Oxygen (O)**: 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = 3 oxygens.\n\nThe molecular formula of the starting material is **C₁₀H₁₂O₃**.\n\n**2. Reaction and Product**\n\nThe reagent used is red phosphorus with an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a powerful reducing agent. It reduces various functional groups to their corresponding alkanes:\n*   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Aldehydes (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Alkenes (C=C) are reduced to alkanes (C-C).\n\nApplying this to the starting material:\n*   The cyclohex-3-ene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The carboxylic acid at position 1 becomes a methyl group.\n*   The formyl group at position 2 becomes a methyl group.\n*   The vinyl group at position 5 becomes an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n\nThe final product is **4-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane**.\n\n**3. Molecular Formula of the Product**\n\nNow, let's determine the molecular formula for 4-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane:\n*   **Carbon (C)**: 6 in the cyclohexane ring + 2 from the two methyl groups + 2 from the ethyl group = 10 carbons.\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**: A saturated cyclohexane ring has the formula CₙH₂ₙ, which for C₁₀ would be C₁₀H₂₀.\n\nThe molecular formula of the product is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n**4. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula for calculating IHD is:\n\nIHD = C - (H/2) + (N/2) + 1\n\nWhere C is the number of carbon atoms, H is the number of hydrogen atoms, and N is the number of nitrogen atoms. Oxygen and halogen atoms do not affect the basic calculation.\n\nFor the product with the formula C₁₀H₂₀:\n*   C = 10\n*   H = 20\n\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\nAn IHD of 1 corresponds to the presence of one ring (the cyclohexane ring) in the final product.\n\n<<<B>>>"
