    "An analysis of the provided spectroscopic data allows for the unambiguous identification of the reaction product.\n\n### Product Structure Determination\n\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The signals at δ 7.71 (2H, d) and δ 7.08 (2H, d) are characteristic of a para-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   The singlet at δ 2.31 (3H) corresponds to a methyl group attached to this aromatic ring, forming a *p*-tolyl group.\n    *   The singlet at δ 2.28 (3H) indicates a second methyl group that is not adjacent to any protons.\n    *   The two doublets at δ 7.68 (1H) and δ 6.75 (1H) are indicative of two protons on a trans-substituted double bond (-CH=CH-). The downfield shift suggests conjugation.\n*   **¹³C NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The signal at δ 197.7 is characteristic of a ketone carbonyl carbon.\n    *   The signals at δ 21.3 and δ 28.4 correspond to the two methyl carbons.\n    *   The remaining signals in the δ 126-145 range are consistent with the carbons of a *p*-tolyl group and a conjugated double bond.\n\nAssembling these fragments leads to the structure **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**. The molecular formula of this product is C₁₁H₁₂O, which is identical to that of the starting material, Compound X. This indicates that the reaction is an isomerization.\n\n### Identification of Compound X\n\nThe reaction is an isomerization of Compound X to 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one. Therefore, Compound X must also have the molecular formula C₁₁H₁₂O and contain a *p*-tolyl group. Let's examine the given options:\n\n*   **A) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** Contains a phenyl group (C₆H₅-), not a *p*-tolyl group.\n*   **B) 2-styrylepoxide:** This name is ambiguous, and the most common interpretation (C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂) has a formula of C₁₀H₁₀O.\n*   **C) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** This compound has a 4-methylstyryl group, which includes the required *p*-tolyl skeleton. Its molecular formula is C₁₁H₁₂O.\n*   **D) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** Contains a phenyl group, not a *p*-tolyl group.\n\nBased on the structural requirement, only **2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane** can be Compound X.\n\n### Reaction Plausibility\n\nThe reaction involves the isomerization of a terminal vinyl-substituted epoxide to a methyl ketone under basic (DABCO) and thermal conditions. This specific transformation is a known chemical reaction. A 2019 study published in *The Journal of Organic Chemistry* describes the DABCO-mediated Meinwald rearrangement of 2-aryl, alkenyl, and alkynyl terminal epoxides into their corresponding methyl ketones. The conditions reported in the literature (DABCO, 130 °C, 24 hours) are nearly identical to those given in the problem (DABCO, 403 K = 130 °C, 1 day).\n\nThe reaction is as follows:\n2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane → 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one\n\nTherefore, the logical deduction from the spectral data is confirmed by the known reactivity of these compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>"
