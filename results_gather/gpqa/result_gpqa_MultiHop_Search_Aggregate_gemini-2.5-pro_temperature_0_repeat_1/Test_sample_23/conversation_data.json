    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\nThe problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. A hydrocarbon consists only of carbon (C) and hydrogen (H).\n\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as (mass of H) / (total mass of hydrocarbon).\n*   Using the approximate atomic masses (H ≈ 1 g/mol, C ≈ 12 g/mol), for a general formula CnHm, the mass fraction of H is `m / (12n + m)`.\n*   Setting this equal to 14.28% (or 0.1428): `m / (12n + m) = 0.1428`.\n*   This can be simplified to `m / (12n + m) ≈ 1/7`, which gives `7m ≈ 12n + m`, or `6m ≈ 12n`, which simplifies to `m ≈ 2n`.\n*   This suggests the empirical formula is CH2, and the molecular formula is of the type CnH2n.\n*   Saturated hydrocarbons are either alkanes (CnH2n+2) or cycloalkanes (CnH2n). Since the formula is CnH2n, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem also states that Z is widely used as a solvent and is the sole product of the hydrogenation of all other compounds. The most common cycloalkane solvent that fits this description is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n*   Let's verify the mass fraction for cyclohexane (C6H12): Mass % of H = (12 * 1.008) / (6 * 12.011 + 12 * 1.008) ≈ 14.37%, which is very close to 14.28%. Thus, we can confidently identify Z as cyclohexane.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Mixture Y and the Disproportionation Reaction**\n\n*   Mixture X, when heated with platinum, undergoes disproportionation to form an equimolar mixture Y.\n*   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic. Benzene, for instance, does not react with bromine water without a specific catalyst.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only Z (cyclohexane).\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is a component of Y.\n\nLet's denote the components of Y as Z and another liquid, D. So, Y = (Z + D).\nHydrogenation of Y gives only Z. This means:\n1.  Hydrogenation of Z gives Z (as it's already saturated).\n2.  Hydrogenation of D must also give Z.\n\nSince D is in mixture Y, it doesn't decolorize bromine water. If D were a saturated isomer of cyclohexane (like methylcyclopentane), its hydrogenation would not change it, and the final product would be a mix of cyclohexane and methylcyclopentane, contradicting that only Z is formed. The most plausible identity for D is a compound that can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions. **Benzene (C6H6)** fits this perfectly. Benzene is a liquid, does not decolorize bromine water, and its hydrogenation under severe conditions yields cyclohexane.\n\nTherefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture X**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n*   Both A and B decolorize bromine water, so they are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n*   Hydrogenation of both A and B gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means both A and B have a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n*   The molecules in X do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   The reaction is a disproportionation: `A + B → Cyclohexane + Benzene`.\n\nLet's write the formulas for A and B as C6Hx and C6Hy. From the conservation of atoms in the reaction:\n`C6Hx + C6Hy → C6H12 + C6H6`\nThe number of hydrogen atoms must balance: `x + y = 12 + 6 = 18`.\n\nWe need to find two non-conjugated, unsaturated C6-ring molecules (isomers of C6Hn) whose hydrogen counts sum to 18.\n*   Possible molecules are based on the cyclohexane skeleton:\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**: Has one double bond. It is not conjugated.\n    *   **Cyclohexadienes (C6H8)**: Have two double bonds. The isomers are 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated).\n\nThe problem explicitly states there are no conjugated bonds in mixture X, so we must choose 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n\nLet's set A = Cyclohexene (C6H10) and B = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n*   Number of hydrogens in A (x) = 10.\n*   Number of hydrogens in B (y) = 8.\n*   The sum is `x + y = 10 + 8 = 18`. This matches our requirement.\n\nThis reaction represents a hydrogen transfer: the 1,4-cyclohexadiene is oxidized to benzene by losing two hydrogens, and the cyclohexene is reduced to cyclohexane by gaining those two hydrogens. This is a known type of disproportionation reaction.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n*   Liquid 1: Cyclohexene (C6H10) has **10** hydrogen atoms.\n*   Liquid 2: 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) has **8** hydrogen atoms.\n\nTotal number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
