    "The reaction in question involves the nucleophilic ring-opening of a substituted epoxide by an organocuprate, specifically lithium dimethylcuprate (Me₂CuLi). The fundamental principles governing this type of reaction are crucial for determining the correct product.\n\n### Analysis of the Reaction\n\n1.  **Reactants**:\n    *   **Epoxide**: The substrate is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a bicyclic structure where an epoxide ring is fused to a cyclohexane ring. The epoxide involves carbons C1 and C6. C1 is substituted with a methyl group, while C6 is not.\n    *   **Nucleophile**: The reagent is Me₂CuLi, a Gilman reagent. Organocuprates are known as soft nucleophiles. The nucleophilic species in this reagent is the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n\n2.  **Regioselectivity**:\n    *   The problem statement and established chemical principles dictate that organocuprates attack saturated epoxides at the less sterically hindered carbon atom.\n    *   In the given epoxide, the two carbons of the epoxide ring are C1 and C6. C1 bears a methyl group, making it more sterically hindered than C6, which is only attached to two other carbons of the ring and a hydrogen atom.\n    *   Therefore, the nucleophilic attack by the methyl group from Me₂CuLi will occur at the **C6** position.\n\n3.  **Stereochemistry**:\n    *   The ring-opening of epoxides by nucleophiles like organocuprates proceeds via an Sₙ2-type mechanism.\n    *   A key feature of the Sₙ2 reaction is the backside attack of the nucleophile, which results in an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon center being attacked.\n    *   The initial configuration at the site of attack, C6, is given as (S). The nucleophilic attack by the methyl group will invert this center to an (R) configuration.\n    *   The configuration of the other chiral centers not directly involved in the bond-breaking and forming process at the site of attack are retained. The C1-O bond breaks, but the stereocenter at C1 is not attacked, so its configuration (R) is retained. The configurations at C3 (R) and C4 (R) are also unaffected.\n\n### Determining the Product Structure\n\n*   **Attack at C6**: The methyl group adds to C6.\n*   **Ring Opening**: The C6-O bond of the epoxide breaks, and the C1-O bond also cleaves, which, after an aqueous workup, yields a hydroxyl (-OH) group at C1.\n*   **Renumbering the Product**: According to IUPAC nomenclature for the resulting cyclohexanol, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as C1. To give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants, the ring is numbered counter-clockwise. This places the original C6 (now with a new methyl group) at the C2 position, the original C4 at the C4 position, and the original C3 at the C5 position.\n*   **Final Name**: The product is a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\n### Determining the Product's Stereochemistry\n\n*   **C1 (original C1)**: Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n*   **C2 (original C6)**: Configuration inverts from (S) to **(R)**.\n*   **C4 (original C4)**: Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n*   **C5 (original C3)**: Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n\nCombining these results, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
