    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the original decay and its energy spectrum.\n\nThe initial decay is **2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V**. This is a multi-body decay, as there are more than two particles in the final state (specifically, six particles if we consider each one individually, or four groups of particles). In any decay with three or more final-state particles, the total energy released (the Q-value) is shared among them. This sharing can happen in a continuous range of proportions, as long as total energy and momentum are conserved. Consequently, the kinetic energy of any one of the product particles, or a subset of them like the two E particles, is not fixed but distributed over a continuous range. This is why the energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is described as continuous, with an endpoint Q.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the variant decay.\n\nThe variant decay is **2A -> 2B + 2E + M**. In this case, the two V particles are replaced by a single exotic, massless particle M. The final state now consists of five particles (or three groups: 2B, 2E, and M). Since this is still a multi-body decay (more than two final particles), the energy will continue to be shared among the products in a continuous distribution. Therefore, the energy spectrum of the E particles will remain continuous. This eliminates options A and D, which state the spectrum becomes discrete. A discrete energy spectrum is characteristic of a two-body decay, where conservation laws fix the energies of the outgoing particles.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the endpoints of the energy spectra.\n\nThe endpoint of the energy spectrum represents the maximum possible energy that the E particles can have. This maximum is determined by the total energy released in the decay, known as the Q-value. The Q-value is calculated from the difference in mass between the initial and final states:\n\n**Q = (Mass of Reactants) - (Mass of Products)**\n\nLet's denote the mass of a particle X as m(X).\n\n*   **Q-value of the original decay (Q_original):**\n    Q_original = m(2A) - [m(2B) + m(2E) + m(2V)]\n\n*   **Q-value of the variant decay (Q_variant):**\n    Q_variant = m(2A) - [m(2B) + m(2E) + m(M)]\n\nThe problem states that M is a *massless* particle, so m(M) = 0. The particles V are analogous to neutrinos in double-beta decay, which have a small but non-zero mass. Therefore, the total mass of the two V particles, m(2V), is greater than zero.\n\nComparing the two Q-values, we see that the total mass of the products is smaller in the variant decay because m(2V) > m(M).\n\nSince Q_variant has a smaller mass term being subtracted from the initial mass, the total energy released will be greater.\n\n**Q_variant > Q_original**\n\nA larger Q-value means that there is more total energy available to be distributed among the final particles. This directly translates to a higher maximum possible energy for the E particles. Therefore, the endpoint of the energy spectrum for the E particles increases.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles remains continuous because the decay still results in multiple bodies. The endpoint of this continuous spectrum increases because replacing two particles with mass (2V) with a single massless particle (M) increases the total energy (Q-value) released in the decay.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
