    "To solve this problem, we first need to understand the energy levels of a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well and then apply the Pauli exclusion principle for multiple spin-1/2 particles.\n\n### Single-Particle Energy Levels\n\nThe energy levels for a single particle of mass 'm' in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length 'L' are given by the equation:\n\nE_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)\n\nwhere 'n' is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n\nThe problem defines a base energy unit E = π²ħ² / 2mL². Therefore, the energy of the n-th level is simply:\n\nE_n = n²E\n\n### System of Four Spin-1/2 Particles\n\nThe particles are identical spin-1/2 particles, which makes them fermions. According to the Pauli exclusion principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. For this system, a quantum state is defined by the energy level 'n' and the spin projection (spin up or spin down). This means each energy level 'n' can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n### Ground State Energy\n\nTo find the ground state energy, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles.\n\n*   **n = 1 level:** We can place two particles in this level (one spin up, one spin down). The energy contributed by these particles is 2 × E₁ = 2 × (1²E) = 2E.\n*   **n = 2 level:** We place the remaining two particles in the next lowest level (one spin up, one spin down). The energy contributed by these particles is 2 × E₂ = 2 × (2²E) = 2 × 4E = 8E.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\nE_ground = 2E + 8E = **10E**.\n\n### First Excited State Energy\n\nTo obtain the first excited state, we promote one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n*   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is n=2, and the lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n*   We move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   The new configuration is:\n    *   **n = 1 level:** 2 particles → Energy = 2 × (1²E) = 2E\n    *   **n = 2 level:** 1 particle → Energy = 1 × (2²E) = 4E\n    *   **n = 3 level:** 1 particle → Energy = 1 × (3²E) = 9E\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\nE_first = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**.\n\n### Second Excited State Energy\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest possible energy above the first excited state. We need to consider the possible excitations from the ground state.\n\n1.  **Exciting a particle from n=1 to n=3:**\n    *   Configuration: 1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 × 1²E) + (2 × 2²E) + (1 × 3²E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n\n2.  **Exciting a second particle from n=2 to n=3:**\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 0 particles in n=2, 2 particles in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (2 × 1²E) + (2 × 3²E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n\n3.  **Exciting one particle from n=2 to n=4:**\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=4.\n    *   Energy = (2 × 1²E) + (1 × 2²E) + (1 × 4²E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n\nComparing the energies of these possible excited states (18E, 20E, 22E), the lowest energy after the first excited state (15E) is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the second excited state energy is **18E**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe energies for the three states are:\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
