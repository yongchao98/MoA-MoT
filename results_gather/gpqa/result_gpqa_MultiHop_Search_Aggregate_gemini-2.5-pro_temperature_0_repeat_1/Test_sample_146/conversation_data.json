    "Here is the step-by-step derivation to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Principle of Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe process describes a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) annihilating to produce four new particles ($2A^{+}$ and $2A^{-}$). The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies we can treat the initial system as being at rest in the center-of-mass frame. In this frame, the total initial energy is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n\nThe rest energy of a proton is approximately 938 MeV. An antiproton has the same rest mass.\n\n*   **Initial Energy ($E_i$)**:\n    $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2$\n    $E_i = 938 \\text{ MeV} + 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nAfter annihilation, this total energy is converted into the total energy of the four resulting A particles. The final energy ($E_f$) is the sum of the relativistic energies of the four A particles. Since they all have the same mass and are produced from a system at rest, they will share the energy equally.\n\n*   **Final Energy ($E_f$)**:\n    The energy of a single particle A is given by the relativistic energy formula: $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n    Since there are four particles, the total final energy is:\n    $E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\nThe problem gives the rest energy of particle A as $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n*   **Applying Conservation of Energy ($E_i = E_f$)**:\n    $1876 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\text{ MeV})$\n    $1876 = 1200 \\gamma$\n\n**2. Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\n\nNow, we can solve for $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1876}{1200} \\approx 1.5633$\n\n**3. Calculate the Velocity (v)**\n\nThe Lorentz factor is related to velocity by the equation:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n\nWe need to rearrange this to solve for $v$:\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n$1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nNow, substitute the calculated value of $\\gamma$:\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.444}}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 0.409}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{0.591}$\n$v/c \\approx 0.7688$\n\nSo, the velocity of particle A is approximately $v \\approx 0.77c$.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.91c\nB) 0.77c\nC) 0.86c\nD) 0.96c\n\nThe calculated velocity matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
