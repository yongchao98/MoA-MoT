    "To find the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx, we first need to define the quantum state and the operators in matrix form.\n\nThe spin-up state |↑⟩ is represented by the vector, and the spin-down state |↓⟩ is represented by.\n\nThe given linear superposition is:\n|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩\nIn vector form, this is:\n|ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2]\n\nThe Pauli matrices σz and σx are given by:\nσz = [, [0, -1]]\nσx = [,]\n\nThe operator in question is O = 10σz + 5σx.\n\nThe expectation value of an operator O for a state |ψ⟩ is calculated as ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩. Because expectation is a linear operator, we can calculate the expectation values for σz and σx separately and then combine them.\n⟨O⟩ = ⟨10σz + 5σx⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ + 5⟨σx⟩\n\nFirst, let's calculate the expectation value of σz:\n⟨σz⟩ = ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩\nWe calculate σz|ψ⟩:\nσz|ψ⟩ = [, [0, -1]] * [0.5, √3/2] = [0.5, -√3/2]\nThen, we calculate ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩:\n⟨σz⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [0.5, -√3/2] = (0.5 * 0.5) + (√3/2 * -√3/2) = 0.25 - 3/4 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5\n\nNext, let's calculate the expectation value of σx:\n⟨σx⟩ = ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩\nWe calculate σx|ψ⟩:\nσx|ψ⟩ = [,] * [0.5, √3/2] = [√3/2, 0.5]\nThen, we calculate ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩:\n⟨σx⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [√3/2, 0.5] = (0.5 * √3/2) + (√3/2 * 0.5) = √3/4 + √3/4 = 2√3/4 = √3/2\n\nNow, we can find the total expectation value:\n⟨O⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ + 5⟨σx⟩ = 10(-0.5) + 5(√3/2) = -5 + 2.5√3\n\nUsing the approximation √3 ≈ 1.732:\n⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 2.5 * 1.732 = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is -0.7.\n\n<<<B>>>"
