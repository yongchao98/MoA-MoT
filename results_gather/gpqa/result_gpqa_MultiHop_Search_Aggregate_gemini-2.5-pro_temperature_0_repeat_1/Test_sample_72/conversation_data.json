    "### Calculation of Relative Speed and Total Energy in a Relativistic System\n\nTo determine the correct option, we must calculate the relative speed of the two astronauts and the total energy of the system, taking into account the principles of special relativity.\n\n#### Relative Speed (v_rel)\n\nIn classical physics, one would simply subtract the velocities. However, at relativistic speeds, the formula for the relative velocity (v_rel) between two objects moving in the same direction with velocities v1 and v2 is given by the Lorentz velocity transformation:\n\n**v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c²)**\n\nGiven:\n*   Velocity of the first astronaut (v1) = 0.6c\n*   Velocity of the second astronaut (v2) = 0.5c\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\nv_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\nv_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3c² / c²)\nv_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)\nv_rel = 0.1c / 0.7\n**v_rel ≈ 0.1428c**\n\nThis result rounds to **0.14c**.\n\n#### Total Energy (E)\n\nThe total energy of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is given by the equation E = γmc², where γ (the Lorentz factor) is 1 / √(1 - v²/c²). The total energy of the system is the sum of the individual energies of the two astronauts.\n\n**Energy of the first astronaut (E1):**\n*   Mass (m1) = 2m\n*   Velocity (v1) = 0.6c\n*   Lorentz factor (γ1) = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.36) = 1 / √0.64 = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\n*   E1 = γ1 * m1 * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = **2.5mc²**\n\n**Energy of the second astronaut (E2):**\n*   Mass (m2) = 3m\n*   Velocity (v2) = 0.5c\n*   Lorentz factor (γ2) = 1 / √(1 - (0.5c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.25) = 1 / √0.75 ≈ 1.1547\n*   E2 = γ2 * m2 * c² ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c² ≈ **3.464mc²**\n\n**Total System Energy (E_total):**\n*   E_total = E1 + E2\n*   E_total = 2.5mc² + 3.464mc²\n*   **E_total ≈ 5.964mc²**\n\nThis result rounds to **5.96mc²**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately **0.14c**, and the total energy of the system is approximately **5.96mc²**. These values correspond to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
