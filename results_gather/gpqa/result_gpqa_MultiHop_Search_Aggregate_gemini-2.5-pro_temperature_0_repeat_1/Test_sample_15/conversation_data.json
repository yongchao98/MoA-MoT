    "A compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral and not present as a racemic (50:50) mixture of enantiomers. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This often occurs when a carbon atom is bonded to four different groups, creating a chiral center.\n\nHere is an analysis of each compound:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** This molecule has a double bond and no chiral centers. The molecule is planar with respect to the double bond, giving it a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is achiral and not optically active.\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The name itself specifies a single, distinct stereoisomer using (R) and (S) notation. This indicates the presence of chiral centers and that we are considering a single enantiomer. A specific enantiomer is by definition chiral and optically active.\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the (2R, 3S) configuration results in a plane of symmetry within the molecule, making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral despite having chiral centers and are therefore optically inactive.\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule also has two chiral centers. Unlike its (2R, 3S) diastereomer, the (2R, 3R) configuration does not have a plane of symmetry. It is a chiral molecule, and since a specific enantiomer is named, it is optically active.\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The name indicates the (R) configuration at the first carbon, which is a chiral center. The four groups attached to this carbon are -H, -OH, and two different carbon paths within the ring. As a specific enantiomer, it is chiral and optically active.\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** In this molecule, the three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (cis). This arrangement creates multiple planes of symmetry, making the molecule achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** This ketone does not possess any chiral centers. The carbon in the butyl chain bonded to two methyl groups is not chiral, and no carbons in the cyclopentyl ring are chiral centers. The molecule is achiral and not optically active.\n\nBased on the analysis, the following three compounds will exhibit optical activity:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nTherefore, 3 of the compounds listed will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<C>>>"
