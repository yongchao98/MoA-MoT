    "This problem requires the application of the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation. Here is a step-by-step solution:\n\n**1. Identify the given information:**\n*   **Relative velocity (v):** The ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s relative to the Galaxy.\n*   **Proper time (Δt₀):** The time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame is 50 seconds.\n*   **Speed of light (c):** The speed of light in a vacuum is a constant, approximately 299,792.458 km/s. For calculation, we can use the common approximation of 300,000 km/s.\n\n**2. Determine the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (Δt).**\n\nAccording to the theory of special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame will measure a longer time interval for an event that occurs in a moving frame. This phenomenon is known as time dilation. The formula for time dilation is:\n\nΔt = γ * Δt₀\n\nWhere:\n*   **Δt** is the time measured in the stationary reference frame (the Galaxy).\n*   **Δt₀** is the proper time measured in the moving reference frame (the ejecta).\n*   **γ (gamma)** is the Lorentz factor.\n\n**3. Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n\nThe Lorentz factor is calculated using the formula:\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the ratio v/c:\n*   v = 60,000 km/s\n*   c ≈ 300,000 km/s\n*   v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2\n\nNow, substitute this value into the Lorentz factor formula:\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²)\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04)\n*   γ = 1 / √0.96\n*   γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798\n*   γ ≈ 1.02062\n\n**4. Calculate the dilated time (Δt).**\n\nNow, use the time dilation formula with the calculated Lorentz factor:\n*   Δt = γ * Δt₀\n*   Δt ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s\n*   Δt ≈ 51.031 s\n\nThis means that while 50 seconds have passed for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy's reference frame would measure approximately 51.031 seconds.\n\n**5. Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame.**\n\nFinally, calculate the distance the ejecta travels from the perspective of the Galaxy using the formula: distance = velocity × time.\n*   Distance = v * Δt\n*   Distance ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s\n*   Distance ≈ 3,061,860 km\n\nThis value is closest to 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<B>>>"
