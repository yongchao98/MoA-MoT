    "The chemical transformation described is a multi-step synthesis. Let's break it down to identify the final product and determine the number of its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants**: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene and 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene with sodium iodide (NaI).\n*   **Reaction**: The reaction of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene with NaI generates a highly reactive diene, 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene.\n*   The 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene has two double bonds and can act as a dienophile. The problem states that two equivalents of the diene precursor are used, which suggests that a Diels-Alder reaction occurs at both double bonds of the norbornadiene derivative. However, the subsequent steps, particularly the final heating step, strongly imply a different, more common synthetic strategy.\n*   A well-established synthetic sequence involves using a norbornadiene derivative as a \"masked\" acetylene. This involves a Diels-Alder reaction followed by a retro-Diels-Alder reaction. This pathway is the most plausible for forming a stable, well-defined final product. This interpretation assumes that only one equivalent of the diene reacts with the norbornadiene. The mention of \"2 equivalents\" might be to ensure the reaction proceeds to completion or could be a misdirection.\n*   Assuming the more standard pathway, product **1** is the mono-Diels-Alder adduct between 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene and 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction**: Product **1** is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid.\n*   **Transformation**: The tert-butoxy group is a protecting group for an alcohol. Aqueous acid removes this group, converting the 7-tert-butoxy group into a 7-hydroxy group (-OH). Product **2** is the alcohol corresponding to adduct **1**.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction**: Product **2** is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO.\n*   **Transformation**: This set of reagents is used for the Parikh-Doering oxidation, a mild method to oxidize a secondary alcohol to a ketone. The 7-hydroxy group is oxidized to a ketone (C=O) at the 7-position. Product **3** is now a derivative of bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-en-7-one.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reaction**: Product **3** is heated to 150Â°C.\n*   **Transformation**: Bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-en-7-one derivatives are known to undergo a retro-Diels-Alder reaction upon heating. This reaction is the reverse of the cycloaddition that forms the norbornene skeleton. The molecule fragments into two new molecules.\n*   The bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-en-7-one part of molecule **3** breaks down into cyclopentadienone (a reactive molecule) and an alkene. This alkene is the final product, **4**.\n*   The overall process effectively transfers one of the double bonds from the original norbornadiene (which can be considered an acetylene equivalent) to the diene that reacted in Step 1.\n*   Therefore, product **4** is the result of a formal Diels-Alder reaction between 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene and acetylene.\n\n**Structure and Symmetry of Product 4**\nThe reaction between 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene and acetylene can form two possible isomers depending on which diene system reacts. However, both plausible products possess a high degree of symmetry. Let's analyze the more likely product, **2,3-dimethylidenebicyclo[2.2.2]octa-5,7-diene**.\n\nThis molecule has C2v symmetry. We can count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms (which corresponds to the number of signals in an NMR spectrum):\n1.  **Bridgehead Protons**: There are two protons at the bridgehead positions (C1 and C4). Due to the molecule's symmetry, these two protons are chemically equivalent. (1 signal)\n2.  **Vinyl Protons**: There are four protons on the double bonds within the bicyclic ring system (C5, C6, C7, C8). The symmetry makes all four of these protons equivalent. (1 signal)\n3.  **Methylidene Protons**: There are four protons on the exocyclic double bonds (=CH2). The two protons on each methylidene group are not equivalent to each other (they are diastereotopic). However, due to the overall symmetry of the molecule, the two \"inner\" protons are equivalent to each other, and the two \"outer\" protons are equivalent to each other. This results in two distinct signals for the methylidene protons. (2 signals)\n\nIn total, there are 1 + 1 + 2 = **4** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe other possible isomer, 7,8-dimethylidenebicyclo[2.2.2]octa-2,5-diene, also possesses C2v symmetry and a similar analysis also leads to 4 distinct hydrogen signals.\n\nThus, the final product 4 has 4 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<B>>>"
