    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial and final states:**\n    *   The initial state of the two-electron system is given in the coupled basis as $|\\psi_{initial}> = |l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$. In this state, the total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$, and the quantum number for its z-component is $m=-1$.\n    *   A measurement of the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed. We want to find the probability of getting the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ for *both* measurements.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_z$ is $m_l\\hbar$. Therefore, an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ corresponds to a magnetic quantum number $m_l = -1$.\n    *   The final state we are interested in corresponds to electron 1 having $m_{l1} = -1$ and electron 2 having $m_{l2} = -1$. In the uncoupled basis, this state is written as $|\\psi_{final}> = |l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n\n2.  **Apply the principles of quantum measurement:**\n    *   The probability of measuring the system to be in the state $|\\psi_{final}>$ when it was initially in $|\\psi_{initial}>$ is given by the square of the magnitude of their inner product (the projection of the initial state onto the final state):\n        $P = |<\\psi_{final}|\\psi_{initial}>|^2 = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2$\n\n3.  **Use the properties of angular momentum addition:**\n    *   The transformation between the coupled basis $|l, m>$ and the uncoupled basis $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}>$ is defined by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n    *   A fundamental selection rule for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is that they are non-zero only if the total magnetic quantum number of the coupled state ($m$) is equal to the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers of the uncoupled state ($m_{l1} + m_{l2}$).\n    *   In our case, for the initial state, $m = -1$.\n    *   For the final state, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers is $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   Since $m \\neq m_{l1} + m_{l2}$ (because $-1 \\neq -2$), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>$ is zero.\n\n4.  **Calculate the probability:**\n    *   Since the inner product is zero, the probability is:\n        $P = |0|^2 = 0$\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIt is impossible for a system in a state with a total z-component of angular momentum of $-1\\hbar$ to be measured in a state where the components add up to $-2\\hbar$. The probability of such an event is zero.\n\n<<<D>>>"
