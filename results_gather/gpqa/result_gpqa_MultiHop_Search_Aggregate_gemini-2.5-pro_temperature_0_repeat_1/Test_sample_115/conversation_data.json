    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify compound D:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Compound A**\n\n*   The proton NMR spectrum of Compound A shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (6H) and a quartet at 1.3 ppm (4H).\n*   The signal for 6 protons split into a triplet indicates two equivalent methyl groups (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n*   The signal for 4 protons split into a quartet indicates two equivalent methylene groups (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   This splitting pattern (triplet and quartet) and integration ratio (6H:4H or 3:2) are characteristic of two equivalent ethyl groups (CH3-CH2-).\n*   The simplest alkane that fits this description is n-butane (CH3CH2CH2CH3), where the two methyl groups are equivalent and the two methylene groups are equivalent. Thus, Compound A is n-butane.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Compound B**\n\n*   Compound A (n-butane) undergoes monobromination to form Compound B.\n*   The bromination of n-butane can yield two possible products: 1-bromobutane and 2-bromobutane.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Compound C**\n\n*   Compound B reacts with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH). This is a dehydrohalogenation reaction, which is an elimination (E2) reaction that forms an alkene.\n*   The problem states that the product, Compound C, has two geometrical isomers.\n    *   If B were 1-bromobutane, elimination would yield only but-1-ene, which does not have geometrical isomers.\n    *   If B is 2-bromobutane, elimination yields but-1-ene and but-2-ene. But-2-ene exists as two geometrical isomers: *cis*-but-2-ene and *trans*-but-2-ene.\n*   Therefore, Compound B must be 2-bromobutane, and Compound C is but-2-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Identify Compound D**\n\n*   The *cis*-isomer of C (*cis*-but-2-ene) acts as a dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction.\n*   The diene is (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol.\n*   The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene and the dienophile to form a six-membered ring, which is Compound D.\n\n**Stereochemistry of the Diels-Alder Reaction**\n\nThe stereochemistry of the product is determined by the stereochemistry of the reactants and the reaction pathway (endo vs. exo).\n\n1.  **Reactants:**\n    *   **Diene:** (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol. In a Diels-Alder reaction, the \"outward\" pointing substituents on an (E,E) diene end up *cis* to each other in the product. Here, the outward groups are the -OH at C1 and the -CH3 at C4.\n    *   **Dienophile:** *cis*-but-2-ene. The stereochemistry of the dienophile is retained, so the two methyl groups will be *cis* to each other in the product.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Options:**\n    *   The product is named 4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol. The options provided are B) (1S,4R,5S,6S)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol and C) (1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol.\n    *   Let's analyze the relative stereochemistry implied by the R/S descriptors in the options. Both options B and C have a (4R) configuration. For the C1-OH group to be (1S), it must be *trans* to the C4-methyl group (which has the R configuration).\n    *   This contradicts the expected outcome for an (E,E) diene, which should give *cis* substituents at these positions. This suggests there may be a typo in the problem statement and the diene was intended to be **(1E, 3Z)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol**, which would yield *trans* substituents at C1 and C4.\n\n3.  **Re-evaluation assuming (1E, 3Z) Diene:**\n    *   **Diene:** (1E, 3Z)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol. This gives *trans* C1(-OH) and C4(-CH3) substituents.\n    *   **Dienophile:** *cis*-but-2-ene. This gives *cis* C5(-CH3) and C6(-CH3) substituents.\n    *   **Pathway (Endo vs. Exo):** The endo pathway is usually kinetically favored. However, in this case, the endo transition state would involve significant steric clash between the methyl groups of the dienophile and the inward-pointing methyl group of the (E,Z) diene. Therefore, the reaction is likely to proceed via the more sterically favorable **exo pathway**.\n    *   In the exo product, the dienophile's substituents (the methyl groups at C5 and C6) are *cis* to the outward substituent at C1 of the diene (the -OH group).\n\n4.  **Determining the Final Structure:**\n    *   From the (E,Z) diene rule: The -OH at C1 is *trans* to the -CH3 at C4.\n    *   From the *cis*-dienophile rule: The -CH3 at C5 is *cis* to the -CH3 at C6.\n    *   From the exo-pathway rule: The {C5-Me, C6-Me} pair is *cis* to the C1-OH group.\n    *   Combining these facts: Let the C1-OH be \"up\". Then the C5-Me and C6-Me are also \"up\". Since C1-OH is \"up\", the C4-Me must be \"down\".\n    *   The resulting relative stereochemistry is: C1-OH (up), C4-Me (down), C5-Me (up), C6-Me (up).\n    *   Assigning the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priorities to this structure yields the configuration **(1S, 4R, 5S, 6R)**.\n\nThis configuration matches option C.\n\nTherefore, Compound D is (1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol.\n\n<<<C>>>"
