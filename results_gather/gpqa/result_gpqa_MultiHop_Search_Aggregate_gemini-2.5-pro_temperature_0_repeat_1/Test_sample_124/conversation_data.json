    "The problem describes a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential.\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for such a system are given by the formula:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$\n\nHere, $n$ is the principal quantum number, which can be any non-negative integer ($n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$). The quantum number $n$ is the sum of the quantum numbers for each of the three Cartesian coordinates: $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$.\n\nThe energy levels are:\n*   **Ground state (lowest energy):** For $n=0$, the energy is $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{3}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n*   **First excited state:** For $n=1$, the energy is $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{5}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n*   **Second excited state:** For $n=2$, the energy is $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{7}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n*   **Third excited state:** For $n=3$, the energy is $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\omega = \\frac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega$.\n\nThe number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given energy level $E_n$ is called the degeneracy, $g_n$. For the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the degeneracy is given by the formula:\n$g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n\nFor the third excited state, we have $n=3$. Plugging this into the degeneracy formula:\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\nThus, the energy of the third excited state is $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega$, and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to this energy. This means the energy level is 10-fold degenerate.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3\nB) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10\nC) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10\nD) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
