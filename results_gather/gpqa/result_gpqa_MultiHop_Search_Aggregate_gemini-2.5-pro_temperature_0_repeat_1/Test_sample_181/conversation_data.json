    "The Mott-Gurney equation is valid under a specific set of assumptions. Analyzing the provided options based on the principles of semiconductor device physics reveals the correct conditions.\n\nThe derivation of the Mott-Gurney law assumes the following:\n*   **Single-Carrier Device**: The current is dominated by only one type of charge carrier, either electrons or holes.\n*   **Trap-Free**: The semiconductor is considered to be free of traps or energetic disorder that could capture the charge carriers. The presence of traps leads to different current-voltage characteristics.\n*   **Ohmic Contacts (No Injection Barrier)**: The contacts between the electrodes and the semiconductor are assumed to be Ohmic, meaning they provide an unlimited supply of charge carriers and present no energy barrier to their injection into the device. This ensures the current is limited by the buildup of charge (space charge) within the device, not by the injection process. A Schottky contact, which has an energy barrier, would violate this condition.\n*   **Drift Current Dominance**: The model assumes that the current is driven solely by the drift of charge carriers under the influence of the applied electric field. The contribution from diffusion current, which arises from carrier concentration gradients, is considered negligible.\n\nLet's evaluate the given statements:\n*   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.** This statement accurately combines the key assumptions: a single type of carrier, no traps, no barrier to injection (which is the definition of an ideal Ohmic contact in this context), and a drift-dominated current (negligible diffusion).\n*   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.** This is incorrect because the Mott-Gurney law specifically describes a drift-dominated current.\n*   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.** This is incorrect because a Schottky contact implies an injection barrier, violating the assumption of Ohmic contacts.\n*   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.** This is incorrect because the model is derived for single-carrier transport.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that correctly describes the conditions for the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
