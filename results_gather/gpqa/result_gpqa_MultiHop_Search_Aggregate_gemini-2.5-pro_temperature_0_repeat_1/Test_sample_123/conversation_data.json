    "The search results confirm the fundamental principles I used.\n\n1.  **Exponential Decay Law**: The number of undecayed particles follows N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t/τ_lab), where τ_lab is the mean lifetime in the laboratory frame. This is a standard model for particle decay.\n2.  **Time Dilation**: The lifetime of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is dilated in the laboratory frame. The lab-frame lifetime (τ_lab) is related to the proper lifetime (τ_proper) by the Lorentz factor γ, such that τ_lab = γ * τ_proper. This effect is well-documented and experimentally verified, for example, with muons traveling through the atmosphere.\n\nMy derivation combined these two principles.\n\nLet's re-state the relationship I derived:\nγ₂ = γ₁ * ln(1/P₁) / ln(1/P₂)\n\nWhere:\n- γ₁ = 20 (initial Lorentz factor)\n- P₁ = 1/3 (initial survival probability)\n- P₂ = 2/3 (target survival probability)\n- γ₂ = target Lorentz factor\n\nγ₂ = 20 * ln(1 / (1/3)) / ln(1 / (2/3))\nγ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)\n\nThe calculation was:\nγ₂ ≈ 20 * 1.0986 / (ln(3) - ln(2))\nγ₂ ≈ 20 * 1.0986 / (1.0986 - 0.6931)\nγ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055\nγ₂ ≈ 54.19\n\nThe calculation is robust and based on well-established physics principles confirmed by the search results. The closest answer is 54.\n\nThe steps are logical and the calculation is correct. I am confident in the result.\n\nFinal check of the question and options.\n- Initial state: γ=20, 1/3 reach the detector.\n- Target state: γ=?, 2/3 reach the detector.\n- Detector radius R = 30m.\n- Options: A) 68, B) 40, C) 54, D) 28.\n\nMy calculated value of ~54.2 is extremely close to option C.\n\nThe survival probability P is given by P = exp(-t_flight / t_lab).\nThe time of flight t_flight is R/v. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, v ≈ c, so t_flight ≈ R/c.\nThe lifetime in the lab frame t_lab is γτ, where τ is the proper lifetime.\nSo, P = exp(-(R/c) / (γτ)).\n\nTaking the natural logarithm:\nln(P) = -(R/c) / (γτ)\n-ln(P) * γ = (R/c) / τ\n\nSince R, c, and τ are constants for this particle and setup, the product -ln(P) * γ must be constant.\n-ln(P₁) * γ₁ = -ln(P₂) * γ₂\n-ln(1/3) * 20 = -ln(2/3) * γ₂\nln(3) * 20 = ln(3/2) * γ₂\nγ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)\nγ₂ ≈ 54.19\n\nThe logic holds up perfectly. The answer is C.The problem requires finding the new Lorentz factor (γ₂) that allows two-thirds of particles to reach a detector, given that at a Lorentz factor (γ₁) of ~20, only one-third reach it. This involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation, and the law of radioactive decay.\n\n### 1. Understanding Particle Decay and Time Dilation\nUnstable particles decay over time, following an exponential decay law. The number of particles N remaining at time t from an initial sample N₀ is given by:\nN(t) = N₀ * e^(-t / τ_lab)\n\nHere, τ_lab is the mean lifetime of the particles as measured in the laboratory frame.\n\nAccording to Einstein's theory of special relativity, time is relative. For a particle moving at a relativistic speed, its internal clock runs slower as observed from a stationary frame (the lab). This phenomenon is called time dilation. The lifetime of the particle in the lab frame (τ_lab) is related to its lifetime in its own rest frame (the proper lifetime, τ_proper) by the Lorentz factor, γ:\nτ_lab = γ * τ_proper\n\nThe Lorentz factor is defined as γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²), where v is the particle's velocity and c is the speed of light.\n\n### 2. Setting up the Equations\nThe fraction of particles that reach the detector is the survival probability, P = N(t) / N₀. The time t it takes for the particles to travel from the center to the detector wall (radius R = 30 m) is t = R / v. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity v is approximately the speed of light c.\nSo, t ≈ R / c.\n\nThe survival probability can be written as:\nP = e^(-(R/c) / (γ * τ_proper))\n\n### 3. Using the Given Information\nWe are given two scenarios:\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n*   Lorentz factor, γ₁ = 20\n*   Fraction of particles reaching the detector, P₁ = 1/3\n\nSubstituting these into our equation:\n1/3 = e^(-(R/c) / (20 * τ_proper))\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\nln(1/3) = -(R/c) / (20 * τ_proper)\n-ln(3) = -(R/c) / (20 * τ_proper)\n20 * ln(3) = (R/c) / τ_proper\n\nThe term (R/c) / τ_proper is a constant that depends on the detector size and the type of particle.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n*   Fraction of particles reaching the detector, P₂ = 2/3\n*   We need to find the new Lorentz factor, γ₂.\n\nThe equation for this scenario is:\n2/3 = e^(-(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ_proper))\n\nTaking the natural logarithm:\nln(2/3) = -(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ_proper)\n-ln(3/2) = -(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ_proper)\nγ₂ * ln(3/2) = (R/c) / τ_proper\n\n### 4. Solving for the New Lorentz Factor\nNow we have two expressions for the constant (R/c) / τ_proper. We can set them equal to each other:\nγ₂ * ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3)\n\nNow, we solve for γ₂:\nγ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)\n\nUsing the approximate values for the natural logarithms (ln(3) ≈ 1.0986 and ln(2) ≈ 0.6931):\nln(3/2) = ln(3) - ln(2) ≈ 1.0986 - 0.6931 = 0.4055\n\nγ₂ ≈ 20 * 1.0986 / 0.4055\nγ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055\nγ₂ ≈ 54.19\n\nThis value is very close to 54.\n\n<<<C>>>"
