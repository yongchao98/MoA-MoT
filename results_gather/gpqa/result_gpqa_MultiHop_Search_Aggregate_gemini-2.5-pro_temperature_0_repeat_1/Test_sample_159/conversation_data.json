    "An N-sided polygon with apothems of the same length is a regular polygon. As the number of sides, N, of a regular polygon approaches infinity, the shape of the polygon approaches a circle. The apothem 'a' becomes the radius of this circle.\n\nTherefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius 'a'. The diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern, which consists of a bright central disk surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings.\n\nThe angular positions of the dark rings (intensity minima) are given by the formula:\n\nsin(θ) ≈ θ = c * (λ / D)\n\nwhere:\n*   θ is the angular position of the minimum.\n*   λ is the wavelength of the light.\n*   D is the diameter of the aperture.\n*   c is a numerical factor corresponding to the minima.\n\nIn this problem, the radius of the aperture is 'a', so the diameter D = 2a. The formula becomes:\n\nθ = c * (λ / 2a)\n\nThe values of the constant 'c' for the first and second minima are derived from the zeros of the first-order Bessel function and are approximately 1.22 and 2.23, respectively.\n\n**Angular position of the first minimum (θ₁):**\nUsing c₁ ≈ 1.22, the angular position of the first minimum is:\nθ₁ ≈ 1.22 * (λ / 2a) = 0.610 * (λ / a)\n\n**Angular position of the second minimum (θ₂):**\nUsing c₂ ≈ 2.23, the angular position of the second minimum is:\nθ₂ ≈ 2.23 * (λ / 2a) = 1.115 * (λ / a)\n\n**Angular distance between the first two minima:**\nThe angular distance (Δθ) is the difference between the angular positions of the second and first minima:\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁\nΔθ ≈ (1.115 * λ / a) - (0.610 * λ / a)\nΔθ ≈ (1.115 - 0.610) * (λ / a)\nΔθ ≈ 0.505 * (λ / a)\n\nUsing more precise values for the zeros of the Bessel function (3.8317 and 7.0156) gives a result of approximately 0.5067 * (λ/a).\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.500 λ / a\nB) 0.610 λ / a\nC) 0.506 λ / a\nD) 1.220 λ /a\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 0.506 λ / a matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
