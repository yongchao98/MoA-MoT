    "To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we first need to find the color of the light it emits. The energy of the emitted light is given as 2.3393 eV.\n\nFirst, we convert the energy from electron volts (eV) to joules (J) and then calculate the corresponding wavelength in nanometers (nm).\n\n1.  **Energy Conversion:**\n    *   Energy (E) = 2.3393 eV\n    *   1 eV = 1.602 x 10⁻¹⁹ J\n    *   E in Joules = 2.3393 * 1.602 x 10⁻¹⁹ J ≈ 3.747 x 10⁻¹⁹ J\n\n2.  **Wavelength Calculation:**\n    *   The relationship between energy and wavelength (λ) is given by the formula E = hc/λ, where:\n        *   h (Planck's constant) = 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n        *   c (speed of light) = 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   Rearranging the formula to solve for wavelength: λ = hc/E\n    *   λ = (6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s * 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s) / (3.747 x 10⁻¹⁹ J)\n    *   λ ≈ 5.305 x 10⁻⁷ meters\n    *   Converting meters to nanometers (1 m = 10⁹ nm): λ ≈ 530.5 nm\n\nA wavelength of approximately 530 nm corresponds to green light in the visible spectrum.\n\nThe color of light absorbed by a substance is the complementary color of the light it emits or reflects. The complementary color of green is red. Therefore, the organic compound absorbs red light.\n\n<<<A>>>"
