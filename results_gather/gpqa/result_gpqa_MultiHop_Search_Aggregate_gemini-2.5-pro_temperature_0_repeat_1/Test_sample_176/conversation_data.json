    "To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we can use the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which relates a star's luminosity (L) to its radius (R) and surface temperature (T). The formula is:\n\nL = 4πR²σT⁴\n\nHere, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\nWe can set up a ratio of the luminosities of the two stars:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have the following information:\n*   The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂), so R₁/R₂ = 1.5.\n*   The peak emission wavelengths \"appeared\" to be the same. This refers to the observed wavelength, which is affected by the Doppler effect due to the stars' radial velocities.\n*   The radial velocity of Star_1 (v₁) is 0 km/s.\n*   The radial velocity of Star_2 (v₂) is 700 km/s.\n\nFirst, let's address the radius ratio. Since R₁/R₂ = 1.5, the term (R₁/R₂)² is (1.5)² = 2.25.\n\nNext, we need to determine the temperature ratio (T₁/T₂). This can be found using Wien's Displacement Law, which states that a star's peak emission wavelength (λ_max) is inversely proportional to its temperature (T). However, we must account for the Doppler effect on the observed wavelength.\n\nFor Star_1, with a radial velocity of 0 km/s, the observed peak wavelength (λ_obs,1) is the same as its intrinsic rest wavelength (λ_rest,1).\n\nFor Star_2, which is moving away at 700 km/s, its light is redshifted. The observed peak wavelength (λ_obs,2) is related to its rest wavelength (λ_rest,2) by the non-relativistic Doppler shift formula:\n\nλ_obs,2 = λ_rest,2 * (1 + v₂/c)\nwhere c is the speed of light (approximately 300,000 km/s).\n\nThe problem states that the observed peak wavelengths are the same: λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2. Therefore:\n\nλ_rest,1 = λ_rest,2 * (1 + v₂/c)\n\nNow, we apply Wien's Law (λ_rest = b/T, where 'b' is Wien's constant) to relate the rest wavelengths to the temperatures:\n\nb/T₁ = (b/T₂) * (1 + v₂/c)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nT₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\nNow we can calculate the value of this ratio:\n\nT₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + 700 km/s / 300,000 km/s) = 1 / (1 + 7/3000) ≈ 1 / 1.002333 ≈ 0.99767\n\nFinally, we substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * (0.99767)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * 0.99073\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23. The information regarding the masses of the stars is not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
