    "To find the probability of measuring 0 for P and then -1 for Q, we need to follow the principles of quantum mechanics for sequential measurements. This involves calculating the probability of the first measurement and then determining the state of the system after this measurement to calculate the probability of the second outcome.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1.  **Normalize the Initial State:**\n    The initial state of the system is given by the column matrix |ψ⟩ = (-1, 2, 1)ᵀ. First, we need to normalize this state. The squared norm is:\n    ||ψ||² = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6\n    The normalized state |ψ_norm⟩ is:\n    |ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * (-1, 2, 1)ᵀ\n\n2.  **Find the Eigenvector of P for the Eigenvalue 0:**\n    The operator P is given by the matrix:\n    P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]\n    We need to find the eigenvector |v_P=0⟩ corresponding to the eigenvalue λ=0. This is done by solving the equation P|v⟩ = 0|v⟩:\n    [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [[x], [y], [z]] = [,,]\n    This gives the equations:\n    *   (1/√2)y = 0  => y = 0\n    *   (1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0 => x = -z\n    The un-normalized eigenvector is of the form (k, 0, -k). To normalize it, we set its length to 1: k² + 0² + (-k)² = 1 => 2k² = 1 => k = 1/√2.\n    So, the normalized eigenvector for the eigenvalue 0 is |v_P=0⟩ = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)ᵀ.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability of Measuring P=0:**\n    The probability of measuring the eigenvalue 0 for P is the squared magnitude of the projection of the initial state onto the corresponding eigenvector.\n    Prob(P=0) = |⟨v_P=0 | ψ_norm⟩|²\n    The inner product is:\n    ⟨v_P=0 | ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2) ⋅ (1/√6) * (-1, 2, 1)ᵀ = (1/√12) * (-1 + 0 - 1) = -2/√12 = -1/√3\n    The probability is:\n    Prob(P=0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3\n\n4.  **State Collapse after Measurement:**\n    Upon measuring the value 0 for P, the system's state collapses to the corresponding normalized eigenvector. The new state of the system, |ψ'⟩, is:\n    |ψ'⟩ = |v_P=0⟩ = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)ᵀ\n\n5.  **Find the Eigenvector of Q for the Eigenvalue -1:**\n    The operator Q is a diagonal matrix:\n    Q = [,, [0, 0, -1]]\n    The eigenvalues of a diagonal matrix are its diagonal elements: 1, 0, and -1. The corresponding normalized eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. For the eigenvalue -1, the eigenvector |v_Q=-1⟩ is:\n    |v_Q=-1⟩ = (0, 0, 1)ᵀ\n\n6.  **Calculate the Probability of Measuring Q=-1:**\n    Now, we calculate the probability of measuring the eigenvalue -1 for Q in the new state |ψ'⟩.\n    Prob(Q=-1 after P=0) = |⟨v_Q=-1 | ψ'⟩|²\n    The inner product is:\n    ⟨v_Q=-1 | ψ'⟩ = (0, 0, 1) ⋅ (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)ᵀ = 0 + 0 - 1/√2 = -1/√2\n    The probability is:\n    Prob(Q=-1 after P=0) = |-1/√2|² = 1/2\n\n7.  **Calculate the Total Probability:**\n    The total probability of the sequence of events (measuring P=0 and then Q=-1) is the product of the individual probabilities calculated in steps 3 and 6.\n    Total Probability = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 after P=0)\n    Total Probability = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6\n\nThe final probability for this sequence of measurements is 1/6.\n\n<<<C>>>"
