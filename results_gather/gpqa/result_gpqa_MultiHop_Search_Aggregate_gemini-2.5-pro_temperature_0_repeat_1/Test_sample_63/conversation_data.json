    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the chemistry problem.\n\n**1. Analyze the Gas Treatment Process**\n\nThe mixture of gases produced from heating the salts is passed through three tubes. We can identify the components of the gas mixture by understanding the function of each tube.\n\n*   **Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂**\n    *   This substance is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass increase of 3.60 g is equal to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2 * 1.008 + 16.00 = 18.016 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.016 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2: Ca(OH)₂ solution (limewater)**\n    *   This solution is used to detect acidic gases, most commonly carbon dioxide (CO₂), which would form a precipitate (CaCO₃).\n    *   The problem states the weight of this tube did not change, which means no acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂ were present in the mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №3: Red-hot copper (Cu)**\n    *   Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) in the gas mixture. The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO.\n    *   The mass increase of the tube is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 2 * 16.00 = 32.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Gas C (Remaining Gas)**\n    *   The gas that remains after passing through all three tubes does not react with water absorbers, acidic gas detectors, or hot copper. It is an inert gas.\n    *   Volume of Gas C = 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Identify Gas C and Verify Mass Conservation**\n\nLet's calculate the total mass of the identified gaseous products (H₂O and O₂) and see what the mass of Gas C must be.\n*   Initial mass of salts = 7.20 g.\n*   By the law of conservation of mass, the total mass of the gaseous products must also be 7.20 g.\n*   Mass of Gas C = Total Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂)\n*   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n\nNow we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\n*   Molar Mass of C = Mass of C / Moles of C = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   A diatomic gas with a molar mass of approximately 28 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂), with a molar mass of 2 * 14.007 = 28.014 g/mol. This fits perfectly.\n\nSo, the decomposition of salts A and B produced:\n*   0.20 mol of H₂O\n*   0.025 mol of O₂\n*   0.10 mol of N₂\n\n**3. Determine the Empirical Formula of the Salt Mixture**\n\nThe original salts must contain the elements that make up the products: Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), and Nitrogen (N). Let's find the total moles of each element in the 7.20 g mixture.\n*   **Moles of N:** 0.10 mol N₂ * (2 mol N / 1 mol N₂) = 0.20 mol N\n*   **Moles of H:** 0.20 mol H₂O * (2 mol H / 1 mol H₂O) = 0.40 mol H\n*   **Moles of O:** (0.20 mol H₂O * 1 mol O/mol H₂O) + (0.025 mol O₂ * 2 mol O/mol O₂) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O\n\nThe molar ratio of the elements in the mixture is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25. To get a simple integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20):\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\nTo eliminate the decimal, we multiply all by 4:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\nSo, the combined empirical formula for the equimolar mixture of (Salt A + Salt B) is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\n**4. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states we have an equimolar mixture of two salts. The products (N₂, O₂, H₂O) are characteristic of the thermal decomposition of ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids.\nLet's try to split the combined formula N₄H₈O₅ into two plausible salt formulas.\nThe presence of 8 hydrogen atoms strongly suggests two ammonium ions (NH₄⁺), as 2 * NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈.\nIf we use two NH₄⁺ cations, the remaining atoms are N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = N₂O₅.\nThe total charge of two NH₄⁺ ions is +2. Therefore, the N₂O₅ portion must form anions with a total charge of -2.\nThe most common nitrogen-oxygen anions (oxyanions) are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\nLet's see if they fit:\n*   Anion 1: NO₃⁻\n*   Anion 2: NO₂⁻\nThe combination of these two anions is (NO₃ + NO₂) = N₂O₅, and their total charge is (-1) + (-1) = -2. This perfectly balances the two NH₄⁺ cations.\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium Nitrate, **NH₄NO₃**\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium Nitrite, **NH₄NO₂**\n\nLet's verify this with the known decomposition reactions around 200-250°C:\n*   2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n*   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nThe mixture is equimolar, so let's assume it contains 'n' moles of each salt.\n*   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₃, we get: n moles of N₂, n/2 moles of O₂, and 2n moles of H₂O.\n*   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₂, we get: n moles of N₂, and 2n moles of H₂O.\n\nTotal moles of products from the mixture:\n*   Total N₂ = n + n = 2n\n*   Total O₂ = n/2\n*   Total H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n\n\nNow, we match this with our findings from step 1:\n*   Moles of O₂ = n/2 = 0.025 mol  => **n = 0.05 mol**\n*   Using this n, we check the other products:\n    *   Moles of N₂ = 2n = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol (Matches)\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 4n = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol (Matches)\nThe value n=0.05 mol is consistent.\n\nFinally, let's check the initial mass:\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 0.05 mol * (80.04 g/mol) = 4.00 g\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 0.05 mol * (64.04 g/mol) = 3.20 g\n*   Total Mass = 4.00 g + 3.20 g = 7.20 g (Matches)\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = 8 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
