    "The decay of a hydrogen atom from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state via two dipole transitions is governed by the electric dipole selection rules. These rules dictate which transitions are allowed based on the change in the quantum numbers $n$, $l$, and $m$.\n\nThe selection rules for electric dipole transitions are:\n*   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n\nLet's analyze the decay process step-by-step:\n\n**First Transition: From $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to an intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n\n*   The initial state has $l=0$. According to the selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the orbital quantum number $l$ must change to $l'=1$.\n*   The principal quantum number $n$ must decrease for a decay to occur. The intermediate state will therefore have $n'=2$.\n*   The initial state has $m=0$. The selection rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ allows the magnetic quantum number $m'$ to be $0$, $1$, or $-1$.\n\nThus, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n**Second Transition: From an intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$**\n\n*   From any of the intermediate states with $l'=1$, a transition to the final state with $l=0$ is allowed, as $\\Delta l = -1$.\n*   The transition from any of the possible $m'$ values (0, 1, -1) to the final state's $m=0$ is also allowed by the selection rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n\nTherefore, there are three possible decay routes:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nDue to the spherical symmetry of the initial $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state, the probabilities of transitioning to each of the three intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$) are equal. Since there are three equally likely paths, the probability for any single path is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nExamining the given options:\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$: The path is correct, but the probability is not.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$: The path is correct, but the probability is not.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$: The path is correct, but the probability is not.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$: Both the transition route and the corresponding probability are correct.\n\n<<<D>>>"
