    "The interaction Lagrangian provided,\n$$ \\mathcal{L}(y) = -\\lambda_f \\bar{\\psi}_f(y) (\\upsilon + X(y)) \\psi_f(y) $$\ndescribes the coupling of a bosonic field $X$ to a pair of fermions $f$ and their corresponding antifermions $\\bar{f}$. This interaction allows the boson $X$ to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, $X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$.\n\nFor a decay to be kinematically allowed, the mass of the initial particle must be greater than or equal to the sum of the masses of the final state particles. In this case, the mass of the boson $X$, denoted as $m_X$, must be greater than or equal to the sum of the masses of the fermion $f$ ($m_f$) and the antifermion $\\bar{f}$ ($m_{\\bar{f}}$). Since a particle and its antiparticle have identical masses ($m_f = m_{\\bar{f}}$), the condition for the decay to be kinematically allowed is:\n$$ m_X \\ge 2m_f $$\nGiven that the mass of the boson X is $m_X = 6$ GeV, the decay is only possible for fermions with a mass $m_f$ such that:\n$$ m_f \\le \\frac{m_X}{2} = \\frac{6 \\text{ GeV}}{2} = 3 \\text{ GeV} $$\nWe must now examine the masses of the fermions listed in the options to determine which decays are permitted.\n\n### Fermion Masses:\n\n**Leptons:**\n*   **Electron ($e$):** The mass of an electron is approximately 0.511 MeV/c², which is equivalent to 0.000511 GeV/c². Since $0.000511 \\text{ GeV} \\le 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$ is kinematically allowed.\n*   **Muon ($\\mu$):** The mass of a muon is approximately 105.7 MeV/c², or 0.1057 GeV/c². As $0.1057 \\text{ GeV} \\le 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ is kinematically allowed.\n*   **Tau ($\\tau$):** The mass of a tau lepton is approximately 1777 MeV/c², which is 1.777 GeV/c². Because $1.777 \\text{ GeV} \\le 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$ is kinematically allowed.\n\n**Quarks:**\n*   **Up ($u$):** The mass of an up quark is approximately 2.2 MeV/c², or 0.0022 GeV/c². This is less than 3 GeV, so the decay $X \\rightarrow u\\bar{u}$ is allowed.\n*   **Down ($d$):** The mass of a down quark is approximately 4.7 MeV/c², or 0.0047 GeV/c². This is less than 3 GeV, making the decay $X \\rightarrow d\\bar{d}$ allowed.\n*   **Strange ($s$):** The mass of a strange quark is approximately 95 MeV/c², or 0.095 GeV/c². Since this is below the 3 GeV threshold, the decay $X \\rightarrow s\\bar{s}$ is allowed.\n*   **Charm ($c$):** The mass of a charm quark is approximately 1.27 GeV/c². As $1.27 \\text{ GeV} \\le 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}$ is allowed.\n*   **Bottom ($b$):** The mass of a bottom quark is approximately 4.18 GeV/c². Since $4.18 \\text{ GeV} > 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ is **kinematically forbidden**.\n*   **Top ($t$):** The mass of a top quark is approximately 173 GeV/c². As $173 \\text{ GeV} > 3 \\text{ GeV}$, the decay $X \\rightarrow t\\bar{t}$ is **kinematically forbidden**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe kinematically allowed decays for the boson X are into pairs of electrons, muons, taus, and up, down, strange, and charm quarks. The decays into bottom and top quark pairs are forbidden as their required energy exceeds the mass of the boson X.\n\nReviewing the options provided:\n*   A) Includes the forbidden decay into a top-antitop pair ($t\\bar{t}$).\n*   B) Includes all the allowed decay channels: $c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$.\n*   C) Includes the forbidden decay into a bottom-antibottom pair ($b\\bar{b}$) and omits several allowed decays.\n*   D) Includes the forbidden decay into a bottom-antibottom pair ($b\\bar{b}$) and omits an allowed decay.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B, as it accurately lists all the kinematically allowed decays.\n\n<<<B>>>"
