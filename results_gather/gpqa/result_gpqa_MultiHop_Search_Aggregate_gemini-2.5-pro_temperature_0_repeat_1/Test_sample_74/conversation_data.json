You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus.

    "To determine the reason for the failed protein overexpression, the provided DNA sequence must be analyzed in the context of protein translation.\n\n1.  **Identify the Start of Translation:** The sequence begins with `5'-ATG...`. `ATG` is the standard start codon, which codes for the amino acid Methionine. Translation by the ribosome begins here.\n\n2.  **Identify the Antigenic Tag Sequence:** The experimental plan involves an N-terminal influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag. The amino acid sequence for a single HA tag is Tyrosine-Proline-Tyrosine-Aspartic Acid-Valine-Proline-Aspartic Acid-Tyrosine-Alanine (YPYDVPDYA). Let's translate the DNA sequence immediately following the `ATG` start codon:\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n    *   `GTT` -> Valine (V)\n    *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n    *   `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `GCC` -> Alanine (A)\n    This confirms that the DNA sequence correctly codes for the HA tag (`M-YPYDVPDYA...`). Therefore, the sequence for the antigenic determinant does not have a missense mutation.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Sequence Immediately Following the Tag:** The process of translation involves reading the mRNA in groups of three nucleotides called codons. Let's continue reading the DNA sequence in this \"reading frame,\" starting from where the HA tag sequence ended.\n    *   The sequence continues: `...GCC` (end of HA tag) `AAATGA...`\n    *   The next codon is `AAA`, which codes for Lysine (K).\n    *   The subsequent codon is `TGA`.\n\n4.  **Identify Stop Codons:** In the standard genetic code, there are three stop codons: `TAA`, `TAG`, and `TGA`. These codons do not code for an amino acid but instead signal the ribosome to terminate protein synthesis. The `TGA` codon is known as the opal or umber stop codon.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The ribosome initiates translation at the `ATG` start codon, correctly synthesizes the HA tag, adds one more amino acid (Lysine), and then immediately encounters a `TGA` stop codon. This is known as a premature termination codon (PTC) or a nonsense mutation. The presence of this PTC causes the ribosome to detach from the mRNA, ending translation. As a result, only a very short, non-functional peptide is produced instead of the full-length GADD45G protein. This directly explains the observed inability to overexpress the protein.\n\nEvaluating the other options:\n*   **A) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** While linkers can be beneficial, their absence is not the primary cause here. The full protein is not even being synthesized due to the premature stop codon.\n*   **B) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** This is incorrect. The experiment is in hamster cells, not a mouse. Furthermore, `UAA` (and `UGA`, the codon present here) is a stop codon recognized by release factors, not a tRNA.\n*   **C) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:** As shown in step 2, the HA tag sequence is correct.\n\nTherefore, the early termination of translation is the definitive cause of the experimental failure.\n\n<<<D>>>"
