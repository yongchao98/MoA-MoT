    "When 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated, it undergoes a-sigmatropic rearrangement known as the Cope rearrangement. This is a common thermal reaction for 1,5-dienes.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n1.  **Identify the starting material:** The starting molecule is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. Its structure is:\n    `CH₃–CH(2)=CH(3)–CH₂(4)–CH(5)(C₄H₉)–CH(6)=CH(7)–CH₂–CH₃`\n    The total number of carbon atoms is 9 (from nona-) + 4 (from butyl) = 13.\n\n2.  **Identify the rearranging 1,5-diene system:** The core of the molecule that participates in the rearrangement is the hexa-1,5-diene system, which includes carbons 2 through 7:\n    `–CH(2)=CH(3)–CH₂(4)–CH(5)–CH(6)=CH(7)–`\n\n3.  **Apply the Cope Rearrangement mechanism:** The Cope rearrangement involves the breaking of the sigma bond between atoms 3 and 4 of the 1,5-diene system, the shifting of two pi bonds, and the formation of a new sigma bond between atoms 1 and 6.\n    *   **Bond breaking:** The C(4)–C(5) single bond breaks.\n    *   **Bond formation:** A new C(2)–C(7) single bond forms.\n    *   **Pi bond migration:** The double bond from C(2)=C(3) moves to C(3)=C(4), and the double bond from C(6)=C(7) moves to C(5)=C(6).\n\n4.  **Determine the structure of the product:** Let's trace the connectivity of the atoms in the product molecule.\n    *   The original methyl group at C1 remains attached to C2.\n    *   The original ethyl group at C8-C9 remains attached to C7.\n    *   The original butyl group remains attached to C5.\n    *   The new connections result in the following structure:\n        `CH₂(4)=CH(3)–CH(2)(CH₃)–CH(7)(CH₂CH₃)–CH(6)=CH(5)(C₄H₉)`\n\n5.  **Name the product using IUPAC nomenclature:** To name the product, we first write it as a linear chain and find the longest carbon chain that includes both double bonds.\n    `CH₂=CH–CH(CH₃)–CH(CH₂CH₃)–CH=CH–CH₂–CH₂–CH₂–CH₃`\n    *   **Find the parent chain:** The longest chain containing both double bonds has 10 carbon atoms, so the parent name is \"deca-diene\".\n    *   **Number the chain:** We number the chain from the end that gives the double bonds the lowest possible locants. Numbering from right to left gives the double bonds positions 1 and 5 (`deca-1,5-diene`). Numbering from the other end would give positions 5 and 9. Therefore, we number from the right.\n    *   **Identify and locate substituents:** With this numbering, there is a methyl group on carbon 3 and an ethyl group on carbon 4.\n    *   **Assemble the name:** Listing the substituents alphabetically, the full IUPAC name of the product is **4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 5-ethylundeca-2,6-diene\nB) 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene\nC) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\nD) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\n\nThe calculated product matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
