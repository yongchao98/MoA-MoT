    "To solve this problem, we will use the Boltzmann equation, which describes the relative populations of atoms in different energy levels in a system in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE).\n\nThe Boltzmann equation is given by:\nN₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (kT)]\n\nWhere:\n*   N₂ and N₁ are the number of atoms in energy levels 2 and 1, respectively.\n*   g₂ and g₁ are the degeneracies (statistical weights) of those energy levels.\n*   E₂ - E₁ is the energy difference between the two levels (ΔE).\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nLet's denote the number of iron atoms in the specific excited state as N_excited and in the ground state as N_ground. The energy of this excited state relative to the ground state is ΔE.\n\nFor star 1, with temperature T₁:\n(N_excited)₁ / N_ground = C * exp[-ΔE / (kT₁)]\nwhere C is the ratio of the degeneracies (g_excited / g_ground), which is constant for a specific energy level transition.\n\nFor star 2, with temperature T₂:\n(N_excited)₂ / N_ground = C * exp[-ΔE / (kT₂)]\n\nThe problem states that the number of excited iron atoms in star 1 is twice that in star 2:\n(N_excited)₁ = 2 * (N_excited)₂\nTherefore, the ratio is:\n(N_excited)₁ / (N_excited)₂ = 2\n\nNow, we can divide the equation for star 1 by the equation for star 2:\n[(N_excited)₁ / N_ground] / [(N_excited)₂ / N_ground] = {C * exp[-ΔE / (kT₁)]} / {C * exp[-ΔE / (kT₂)]}\n\nThis simplifies to:\n(N_excited)₁ / (N_excited)₂ = exp[-ΔE / (kT₁)] / exp[-ΔE / (kT₂)]\n\nUsing the property of exponents (eᵃ / eᵇ = eᵃ⁻ᵇ):\n2 = exp[(-ΔE / (kT₁)) - (-ΔE / (kT₂))]\n2 = exp[(ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁)]\n\nTo solve for the temperatures, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁)\n\nNow, let's simplify the term in the parentheses by finding a common denominator:\n1/T₂ - 1/T₁ = (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂)\n\nSubstituting this back into our equation:\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [(T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂)]\n\nThe problem provides a crucial piece of information: the energy difference ΔE is approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J. The Boltzmann constant, k, is also approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n\nLet's calculate the value of the pre-factor (ΔE / k):\nΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 1 K\n\nSubstituting this value back into our derived equation:\nln(2) ≈ 1 * [(T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂)]\n\nThis gives us the final relationship:\nln(2) = [(T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂)]\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\nB) ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\nC) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\nD) ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n\nThe correct equation is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
