    "To calculate the net potential energy of a system consisting of a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the method of images is employed. This electrostatic problem can be simplified by replacing the grounded sphere with an \"image\" charge.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **The Method of Images**: The electric field outside the sphere can be modeled as the superposition of the field from the original charge `q` and an image charge `q'`. This image charge is placed at a specific location within the sphere such that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero, satisfying the condition of it being grounded.\n\n2.  **Image Charge and Location**: For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` is:\n    *   `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   It is located at a distance `d'` from the center, along the line connecting the center and the charge `q`, where `d' = R^2 / d`.\n\n3.  **Calculating Potential Energy**: The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position at distance `d`. This energy is equivalent to half of the interaction energy between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`. The factor of 1/2 is crucial because the energy is stored in the electric field, which only exists in the region outside the sphere.\n\n4.  **Interaction Energy**: The potential energy of interaction between two point charges is given by `U = k * (q1 * q2) / r`, where `r` is the distance between them.\n    *   The real charge is `q`.\n    *   The image charge is `q' = -qR/d`.\n    *   The distance between them is `d - d' = d - (R^2/d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`.\n\n5.  **Calculation**:\n    *   First, calculate the potential at the location of the charge `q` created by the image charge `q'`:\n        `V' = k * q' / (d - d') = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d) = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    *   The interaction energy between `q` and `q'` is `U_interaction = q * V' = -k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n    *   The net potential energy of the system is half of this interaction energy:\n        `U = (1/2) * U_interaction = (1/2) * [-k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\nB) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\nC) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nD) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe calculated potential energy matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
