    "The initial step-by-step derivation of the solution seems correct. The search results confirm the fundamental principles I used:\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy and Momentum:** This is the core principle governing the annihilation process.\n*   **Relativistic Energy and Momentum Formulas:** The relationships E = γmc² and p = sqrt(γ² - 1) * mc are correct for the electron and positron. The relationship E = pc is correct for the photons.\n*   **Annihilation Process:** An electron and positron annihilate to produce two photons, and the total energy and momentum are conserved. The angle between the photons depends on the initial momentum of the system. If the net momentum is zero, they are emitted 180 degrees apart. If there is a net momentum, the angle will be different.\n\nMy calculation steps were:\n1.  Calculate the total initial energy by summing the relativistic energies of the electron and positron.\n2.  Use energy conservation to find the energy of each of the two final photons, which are stated to have equal energy.\n3.  Calculate the total initial momentum by summing the relativistic momenta of the electron and positron (remembering they move in opposite directions).\n4.  Use momentum conservation to relate the initial momentum to the final momentum of the two photons. The vertical components of the photon momenta cancel out, and the horizontal components add up.\n5.  Solve for the angle `θ` that each photon makes with the horizontal axis.\n6.  The total angle between the photons is `2θ`.\n\nThe calculation was:\n*   `E_initial = (γ_e + γ_p) * m * c^2 = (4 + 2) * m * c^2 = 6mc^2`\n*   `E_final = 2 * E_ph`\n*   `2 * E_ph = 6mc^2  => E_ph = 3mc^2`\n*   `p_initial_x = (sqrt(γ_e^2 - 1) - sqrt(γ_p^2 - 1)) * mc = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * mc`\n*   `p_final_x = 2 * p_ph * cos(θ) = 2 * (E_ph / c) * cos(θ) = 2 * (3mc^2 / c) * cos(θ) = 6mc * cos(θ)`\n*   `(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * mc = 6mc * cos(θ)`\n*   `cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6`\n*   `θ = arccos((sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6) ≈ arccos((3.873 - 1.732) / 6) ≈ arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°`\n*   Angle between photons = `2θ ≈ 138.2°`\n\nThis matches option C. The logic and formulas are sound and supported by the search results. I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation of the answer.\n\n**1. Define the initial state:**\n*   Electron moving from the left with Lorentz factor, γe = 4.\n*   Positron moving from the right with Lorentz factor, γp = 2.\n*   The rest mass of both the electron and positron is denoted by 'm'.\n\n**2. Apply the Law of Conservation of Energy:**\n*   The total energy of a particle is given by E = γmc².\n*   Initial energy of the electron (Ee) = 4mc².\n*   Initial energy of the positron (Ep) = 2mc².\n*   Total initial energy (E_initial) = Ee + Ep = 4mc² + 2mc² = 6mc².\n*   After annihilation, two photons of equal energy (E_ph) are produced.\n*   Total final energy (E_final) = E_ph + E_ph = 2E_ph.\n*   According to the conservation of energy, E_initial = E_final.\n*   6mc² = 2E_ph, which means the energy of each photon is E_ph = 3mc².\n\n**3. Apply the Law of Conservation of Momentum:**\n*   The momentum of a relativistic particle is given by p = √(γ² - 1) * mc.\n*   Momentum of the electron (pe), moving in the positive x-direction: pe = √(4² - 1) * mc = √15 * mc.\n*   Momentum of the positron (pp), moving in the negative x-direction: pp = -√(2² - 1) * mc = -√3 * mc.\n*   Total initial momentum (p_initial) along the horizontal axis is p_initial_x = (√15 - √3)mc. The initial momentum in the vertical direction is zero.\n*   For a photon, the momentum is p_ph = E_ph / c.\n*   Momentum of each photon = (3mc²) / c = 3mc.\n*   The photons move at angles θ and -θ with respect to the horizontal axis. The vertical components of their momenta cancel each other out, and the horizontal components add up.\n*   Final momentum (p_final) along the horizontal axis is p_final_x = p_ph*cos(θ) + p_ph*cos(-θ) = 2 * p_ph * cos(θ) = 2 * (3mc) * cos(θ) = 6mc * cos(θ).\n*   According to the conservation of momentum, p_initial_x = p_final_x.\n*   (√15 - √3)mc = 6mc * cos(θ).\n\n**4. Calculate the angle:**\n*   cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6.\n*   Using the approximate values: √15 ≈ 3.873 and √3 ≈ 1.732.\n*   cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 = 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568.\n*   θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1 degrees.\n*   The angle between the two photons is 2θ.\n*   Angle = 2 * 69.1 ≈ 138.2 degrees.\n\nThis value is closest to 138.\n\n<<<C>>>"
