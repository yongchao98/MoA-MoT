    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This signal is a singlet, meaning the protons are not coupled to any adjacent protons. It integrates to 3 hydrogens. This is characteristic of the methyl protons of an acetate group (CH₃COO-), which is present in all four possible compounds.\n\n2.  **Analyze the signals at 1.6 ppm (3H, d) and 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** The signal at 1.6 ppm is a doublet, indicating a methyl group (CH₃) coupled to a single proton. The signal at 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets, indicating a proton coupled to one proton (making it a doublet) and a group of three protons (making it a quartet). This pattern is consistent with a CH₃-CH=CH- group, which is found in propenyl acetate. Butenyl acetate would have a CH₃CH₂- group, which would show a triplet and a quartet, a pattern not observed here. Therefore, we can eliminate Cis- and Trans-butenyl acetate.\n\n3.  **Analyze the vinyl proton signals and the coupling constant (J):** The two protons on the double bond appear at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm. The key piece of information is the coupling constant (J) of the signal at 7.0 ppm, which is 16.0 Hz. The magnitude of the coupling constant between two protons on a double bond is dependent on their stereochemistry.\n    *   For *trans* protons, the coupling constant (³J) is typically in the range of 11-18 Hz.\n    *   For *cis* protons, the coupling constant (³J) is typically in the range of 6-15 Hz.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The observed coupling constant of 16.0 Hz falls squarely in the range for *trans* protons. This indicates that the two protons on the double bond are in a trans configuration.\n\nBased on this analysis, the unknown compound is identified as Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** Acetate methyl group (CH₃COO-).\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** Vinyl proton adjacent to the oxygen, split into a doublet by the other vinyl proton. The large J value indicates a *trans* relationship.\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** Vinyl proton adjacent to the methyl group, split into a doublet by the other vinyl proton and into a quartet by the three methyl protons.\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** Methyl group on the double bond, split into a doublet by the adjacent vinyl proton.\n\n<<<A>>>"
