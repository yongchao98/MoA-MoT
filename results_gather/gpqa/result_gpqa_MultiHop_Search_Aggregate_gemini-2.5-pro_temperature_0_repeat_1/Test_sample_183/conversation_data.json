    "The goal is to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene in high yield. Let's analyze the structure of the target molecule and evaluate the proposed reaction sequences.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) is at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) is at position 2 (ortho to the ethoxy group).\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) is at position 3 (meta to the ethoxy group and ortho to the tert-butyl group).\n\nThis is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring. Synthesizing such a specific substitution pattern requires careful control of the directing effects of the substituents at each step.\n\nLet's analyze the logical sequence of reactions required to build this molecule, which typically involves installing the groups in a specific order and converting functional groups.\n\n1.  **Formation of the Ether (-OEt):** The ethoxy group is an ether. The most common and effective way to form an aryl ether is the Williamson ether synthesis. This involves reacting a phenoxide (formed by treating a phenol with a base like NaOH) with an alkyl halide (like ethyl bromide, EtBr). This suggests the final step is the conversion of a phenol to an ether. The precursor would be **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Phenol (-OH):** A common method to introduce a hydroxyl group onto a benzene ring is through the hydrolysis of a diazonium salt. The diazonium salt is prepared from a primary aromatic amine (an aniline derivative) by reacting it with nitrous acid (generated in situ from NaNO2 and HCl). This means the precursor to the phenol is **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n\n3.  **Synthesis of 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline:** This is the key intermediate. We need to construct a benzene ring with an amino group, a tert-butyl group, and a nitro group in a 1,2,3-relationship. Let's trace the steps from benzene.\n\nLet's evaluate the options based on this logical retrosynthesis. We are looking for a sequence that first builds the carbon skeleton and installs the nitrogen-containing groups in the correct positions, then converts them to the final functional groups.\n\nThe required core sequence is:\n*   Introduction of the tert-butyl group.\n*   Introduction of two nitrogen-containing groups that will become the amino and nitro groups.\n*   Conversion of one nitrogen group to an amine (-NH2).\n*   Diazotization of the amine (-NH2 → -N2+).\n*   Conversion to a phenol (-N2+ → -OH).\n*   Conversion to an ether (-OH → -OEt).\n\nNow let's examine the provided options:\n\n*   **Option A:**\n    *   i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene to form **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a good first step.\n    *   ii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. This produces a mixture of *o*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene and *p*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. To achieve the 1,2,3-pattern, we must proceed with the minor *ortho* isomer, **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**. This step is not high-yield but is necessary to establish the 1,2 relationship.\n    *   iii) `Fe/HCl`: Reduction of the nitro group to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   iv) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. Under the strong acidic conditions of nitration, the amine group is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director. This directs the incoming nitro group to position 3, forming **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. This is the crucial step to set up the 1,2,3-substitution pattern.\n    *   v) `NaNO2/HCl`: Diazotization of the amino group in 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline.\n    *   vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    *   vii) `NaOH/EtBr`: Williamson ether synthesis to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   viii) `SO3/H2SO4` and ix) `dilute H2SO4`: These sulfonation and desulfonation steps are nonsensically placed at the end of the synthesis and serve no purpose. They are likely an error in the question's options.\n\n*   **Option B:** This sequence is incorrect because it attempts to perform a diazotization reaction (step iv) on a molecule that does not contain a primary amine group.\n\n*   **Option C:** This sequence is flawed. It attempts to perform hydrolysis (step viii) before the necessary diazotization step (v).\n\n*   **Option D:** This sequence is incorrect. It attempts to nitrate a diazonium salt (step vi), which is not a standard or logical reaction in this context.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nDespite the inclusion of two extraneous and misplaced steps at the end (viii and ix), Option A is the only one that presents a chemically logical sequence of core reactions to transform benzene into the target molecule. The pathway correctly utilizes directing group effects (including the meta-directing anilinium ion) to establish the required 1,2,3-substitution pattern before carrying out the final functional group conversions.\n\n<<<A>>>"
