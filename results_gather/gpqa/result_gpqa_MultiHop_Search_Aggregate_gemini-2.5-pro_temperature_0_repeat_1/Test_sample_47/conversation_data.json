    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine**\nThis reaction is the alpha-bromination of a ketone, which results in the substitution of a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group with a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide**\nWhen an α-halo ketone, such as 2-bromocyclohexanone, is treated with a strong base like sodium hydroxide, it undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the formation of a cyclopropanone intermediate, followed by a ring contraction. The six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to form a five-membered ring carboxylic acid derivative.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (after neutralization)\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine**\nThis is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl).\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃) is a mild reducing agent specifically used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes. It is less reactive than lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄), which allows the reaction to stop at the aldehyde stage without further reduction to an alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n**Counting the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)**\n\nTo determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to look at the symmetry of the cyclopentanecarbaldehyde molecule. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO) and the carbon it is attached to (C1).\n\nThe structure is as follows:\n*   An aldehyde proton (-CHO).\n*   A methine proton on the carbon attached to the aldehyde group (C1).\n*   Four methylene groups (-CH₂-) forming the cyclopentane ring.\n\nLet's count the unique hydrogen environments:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (H-C=O):** This is a unique hydrogen in a distinct chemical environment. (1 type)\n2.  **The alpha-proton (on C1):** The single hydrogen on the carbon directly attached to the aldehyde group is also in a unique environment. (1 type)\n3.  **The beta-protons (on C2 and C5):** The two carbons adjacent to C1 are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, the two hydrogens on each of these carbons are diastereotopic—one is *cis* to the aldehyde group and the other is *trans*. Therefore, they are chemically non-equivalent. This gives two distinct types of hydrogens at these positions. (2 types)\n4.  **The gamma-protons (on C3 and C4):** Similarly, the next two carbons in the ring are equivalent to each other. The two hydrogens on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. (2 types)\n\nTotal number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\n<<<D>>>"
