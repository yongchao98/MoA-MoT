    "The search results confirm the initial analysis of the expected NMR spectra for the compounds.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** The spectrum shows two signals. One for the two equivalent aromatic protons (around 6.89 ppm) and one for the four equivalent methyl groups (around 2.18 ppm). This confirms one aromatic singlet and one aliphatic singlet.\n*   **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** The data shows signals at ~6.88 ppm (aromatic) and ~2.17/2.24 ppm (aliphatic). Critically, the two aromatic protons are adjacent (at C5 and C6) and would form an AB quartet (or two doublets), not a singlet. This makes any option with this compound incorrect.\n*   **1,4-Diethylbenzene:** The spectrum would show a singlet for the four equivalent aromatic protons, but a quartet and a triplet for the ethyl groups, not singlets. This rules out any option with this compound.\n*   **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** The molecule has a plane of symmetry, making the two aromatic protons (at C4 and C6) equivalent and isolated, resulting in one aromatic singlet. It has three distinct sets of methyl groups: Me at C2, Me at C5, and the equivalent pair at C1/C3. This should result in three aliphatic singlets with an integration ratio of 3H:3H:6H, which simplifies to 1:1:2.\n\nNow, let's re-evaluate the mixture based on this confirmed information.\n\n**Mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Option B):**\n\n1.  **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one 2H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one 2H singlet.\n    *   In a 1:1 mixture, this results in two singlets of equal integration (1:1 ratio), which perfectly matches the problem description.\n\n2.  **Aliphatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene provides three singlets with integrations of 6H, 3H, and 3H.\n    *   The problem states that the mixture shows **three** singlets in a **2:1:1 ratio**.\n    *   The total number of aliphatic protons in the 1:1 mixture is 12 (from durene) + 12 (from isodurene) = 24 protons.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio for 24 protons means the signals must have integrations of:\n        *   (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n        *   (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n        *   (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Let's see if we can form this pattern from the signals of the two compounds:\n        *   The 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene accounts for the 12H signal (the \"2\" part of the ratio).\n        *   The 6H singlet from the C1/C3 methyls of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene accounts for one of the 6H signals (one \"1\" part of the ratio).\n        *   The remaining two 3H singlets (from C2 and C5 methyls of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene) must be overlapping (accidentally isochronous) to form the third signal, which would have an integration of 3H + 3H = 6H (the other \"1\" part of the ratio).\n\nThis scenario is the only one that fits all the data provided in the question. The other options are ruled out because they do not produce two aromatic singlets.\n\nFinal check:\n- Option A is wrong because 1,2,3,4-TMB gives an aromatic doublet/quartet.\n- Option C is wrong because the aromatic signals would be in a 1:2 ratio, and 1,4-diethylbenzene gives a quartet/triplet in the aliphatic region.\n- Option D is wrong because 1,2,3,4-TMB gives an aromatic doublet/quartet.\n\nTherefore, the mixture must contain 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
