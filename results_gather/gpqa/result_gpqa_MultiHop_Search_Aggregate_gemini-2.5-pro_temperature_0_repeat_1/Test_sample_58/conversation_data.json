    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH of the final solution.\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of the acidic and basic species.**\n\n*   **Moles of H+ from HCl (a strong acid):**\n    *   HCl dissociates completely (HCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻).\n    *   Moles H⁺ = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.080 mol H⁺.\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH (a weak acid):**\n    *   Moles CH3COOH = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.050 mol CH3COOH.\n\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (a strong base):**\n    *   Ba(OH)₂ dissociates completely, yielding two moles of OH⁻ per mole of Ba(OH)₂ (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻).\n    *   Moles Ba(OH)₂ = Molarity × Volume = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol Ba(OH)₂.\n    *   Moles OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol OH⁻.\n\n**2. Perform the neutralization reactions.**\n\nFirst, the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) will react with the strong base (OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂).\n\n*   **Reaction:** H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n*   Initial moles of H⁺ = 0.080 mol\n*   Initial moles of OH⁻ = 0.180 mol\n*   The H⁺ ions are the limiting reactant. They will be completely consumed.\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ remaining after reacting with HCl:** 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol OH⁻.\n\nNext, the remaining strong base (OH⁻) will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   **Reaction:** CH3COOH + OH⁻ → CH3COO⁻ + H₂O\n*   Initial moles of CH3COOH = 0.050 mol\n*   Moles of OH⁻ available = 0.100 mol\n*   The CH3COOH is the limiting reactant in this step. It will be completely consumed.\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ remaining after reacting with CH3COOH:** 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol OH⁻.\n\n**3. Calculate the final concentration of the excess OH⁻.**\n\nThe final solution contains an excess of 0.050 moles of OH⁻, which is a strong base and will determine the pH of the solution.\n\n*   **Total volume of the solution:** 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.\n*   **Final concentration of OH⁻:** [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n*   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L = 0.04167 M.\n\n**4. Calculate the pOH and pH of the solution.**\n\n*   **pOH:** pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38.\n*   **pH:** pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.\n\nThe pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<C>>>"
