    "To identify the mutation most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to determine which change would most severely disrupt the function of the gene responsible for its synthesis. This typically involves creating a non-functional or truncated protein.\n\n### Analysis of the Mutations:\n\nFirst, let's establish the reading frame of the intact gene by grouping the sequence into three-letter codons, starting from the ATG start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT…-3’\n    *   **Amino Acids:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr...\n\nNow, let's analyze each mutant in the same way:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT…-3’\n    *   **Change:** The original third codon, CTC (coding for Leucine), has been changed to TAC (coding for Tyrosine).\n    *   **Mutation Type:** This is a **missense mutation**, where one amino acid is substituted for another. While this can sometimes affect protein function, it may also have little to no effect, or only slightly alter the protein's activity.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT…-3’\n    *   **Change:** The original third codon, CTC (Leucine), has been changed to **TAA**.\n    *   **Mutation Type:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The TAA codon is a **stop codon**, which signals the cellular machinery to terminate protein synthesis. This results in a severely shortened (truncated) protein that is almost certainly non-functional, especially when the stop codon appears so early in the sequence.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT…-3’\n    *   **Change:** The third codon, CTC (Leucine), is changed to TAC (Tyrosine), and the sixth codon, ACT (Threonine), is changed to GTC (Valine).\n    *   **Mutation Type:** This contains two separate **missense mutations**. While multiple amino acid changes increase the likelihood of disrupting the protein's function compared to a single change, it is still not as definitive as a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT…-3’\n    *   **Change:** The third codon, CTC (Leucine), is changed to TAC (Tyrosine).\n    *   **Mutation Type:** This is a **missense mutation**, identical to the first change in Mutant 3. It results in a single amino acid substitution.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe goal is to *eliminate* the compound, which is best achieved by completely knocking out the function of the responsible gene.\n\n*   Mutants 1, 3, and 4 all feature missense mutations, which substitute one amino acid for another. This might alter or reduce the protein's function, but it is not guaranteed to eliminate it.\n*   Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon (a nonsense mutation) very early in the protein sequence. This will cause protein synthesis to halt, producing a very short and non-functional protein fragment. This is the most reliable way among the choices to ensure the final protein product is inactive.\n\nTherefore, the mutation in Mutant 2 is the most likely to eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<D>>>"
