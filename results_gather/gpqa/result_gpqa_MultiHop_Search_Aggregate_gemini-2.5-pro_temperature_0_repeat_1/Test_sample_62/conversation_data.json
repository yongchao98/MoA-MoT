    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the momentum of the absorbed photon.\n\n### 1. Understand the Energy Levels and Transition\n\nThe energy of a diatomic molecule in the quantum rotation-vibration model is given by the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n*   **Energy Levels:** `E(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + B*J(J + 1)`\n    *   `v` is the vibrational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...).\n    *   `J` is the rotational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...).\n    *   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n    *   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration.\n    *   `B` is the rotational constant.\n\n*   **Fundamental State:** The molecule is initially in its fundamental state, which is the state with the lowest possible energy. This corresponds to `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\n    *   `E_initial = E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + B*0(0 + 1) = (1/2)ħω`\n\n*   **Transition to the Next Lowest State:** For a photon to be absorbed, a transition to a higher energy state must occur. The selection rules for rovibrational transitions are Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1. Since the molecule starts at J=0, only a transition to J=1 is possible (ΔJ = +1). Therefore, the final state is `v = 1` and `J = 1`.\n    *   `E_final = E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + B*1(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B`\n\n*   **Energy of the Absorbed Photon:** The energy of the absorbed photon (ΔE) is the difference between the final and initial energy states.\n    *   `ΔE = E_final - E_initial = [(3/2)ħω + 2B] - (1/2)ħω = ħω + 2B`\n\n### 2. Calculate the Physical Constants of the Molecule\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the rotational constant `B`, which depends on the molecule's reduced mass and bond length.\n\n*   **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n    *   Convert the atomic masses from atomic mass units (amu) to kilograms (1 amu = 1.6605 x 10⁻²⁷ kg).\n        *   Mx = 20 amu = 20 * 1.6605 x 10⁻²⁷ kg = 3.321 x 10⁻²⁶ kg\n        *   My = 2 amu = 2 * 1.6605 x 10⁻²⁷ kg = 3.321 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n    *   Calculate the reduced mass:\n        *   `μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (3.321 x 10⁻²⁶ kg * 3.321 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) / (3.321 x 10⁻²⁶ kg + 3.321 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg`\n\n*   **Moment of Inertia (I):**\n    *   Convert the bond length (R) from angstroms to meters (1 Å = 10⁻¹⁰ m).\n        *   R = 2 Å = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   Calculate the moment of inertia:\n        *   `I = μ * R² = (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)² = 1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²`\n\n*   **Rotational Constant (B):**\n    *   `B = ħ² / (2 * I) = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (2 * 1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 4.60 x 10⁻²³ J`\n\n### 3. Calculate the Photon's Energy and Momentum\n\nNow we can calculate the total energy of the absorbed photon.\n\n*   **Photon Energy (ΔE):**\n    *   The vibrational energy term is `ħω = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) = 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J`.\n    *   The rotational energy term is `2B = 2 * 4.60 x 10⁻²³ J = 9.20 x 10⁻²³ J`.\n    *   `ΔE = ħω + 2B = 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J + 9.20 x 10⁻²³ J ≈ 4.225 x 10⁻²⁰ J`\n    (Note that the rotational energy contribution is very small compared to the vibrational energy).\n\n*   **Photon Momentum (p):**\n    *   The relationship between a photon's energy and momentum is `p = E / c`, where `c` is the speed of light (≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s).\n    *   `p = ΔE / c = (4.225 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3 x 10⁸ m/s) ≈ 1.408 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s`\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated momentum is approximately 1.4 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
