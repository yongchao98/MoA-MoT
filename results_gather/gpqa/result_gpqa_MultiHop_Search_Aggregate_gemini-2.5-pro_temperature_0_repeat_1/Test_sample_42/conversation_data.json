    "Here is a step-by-step determination of the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**1. Identify the Parent Structure**\n\nThe molecule is a benzene ring containing a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). According to IUPAC nomenclature rules, when a -COOH group is attached to a benzene ring, the parent name is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is assigned position #1.\n\n**2. Determine the Positions of the Substituents**\n\nLet's map out the substituents based on the provided description:\n\n*   **C1:** Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n*   **Para (to C1):** A methoxy group (-OCH3) is para to the carboxylic acid, placing it at **C4**.\n*   **Meta (to C1):** A carbaldehyde (-CHO, also known as a formyl group) and a cyano group (-CN) are both meta to the carboxylic acid. This means they are at positions C3 and C5. The description also states they are meta to one another, which confirms their placement at **C3** and **C5**.\n*   **Ortho (to C1):** A hydroxyl group (-OH) and a dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2) are ortho to the carboxylic acid, placing them at positions C2 and C6.\n*   **Refining Positions:** The description adds that the methoxy group (at C4) and the hydroxyl group are both ortho to the nitrile (cyano group).\n    *   If the cyano group is at C5, the positions ortho to it are C4 and C6. Since the methoxy group is already at C4, the hydroxyl group must be at **C6**.\n    *   This leaves the remaining ortho position, **C2**, for the dimethylamino group.\n    *   This also confirms the carbaldehyde group is at **C3** and the cyano group is at **C5**.\n\nThis gives us a single, unambiguous structure:\n*   **C1:** -COOH\n*   **C2:** -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n*   **C3:** -CHO (formyl)\n*   **C4:** -OCH3 (methoxy)\n*   **C5:** -CN (cyano)\n*   **C6:** -OH (hydroxy)\n\n**3. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules**\n\nWith a polysubstituted benzene ring, the goal is to number the substituents to give them the lowest possible locants (numbers). If two different numbering directions result in the same set of locants, priority is given based on alphabetical order.\n\n*   **Numbering clockwise (as determined above):** The substituents are at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n*   **Numbering counter-clockwise:** The substituents would be 2-hydroxy, 3-cyano, 4-methoxy, 5-formyl, and 6-dimethylamino. The positions are still 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n\nSince both directions yield the same locant set (2,3,4,5,6), we must use alphabetical order to decide the correct direction. The substituent that comes first alphabetically should be given the lowest possible number.\n\n**4. Alphabetize the Substituents**\n\nThe substituent prefixes are:\n*   **C**yano\n*   **D**imethylamino\n*   **F**ormyl\n*   **H**ydroxy\n*   **M**ethoxy\n\n\"Cyano\" comes first alphabetically.\n\n*   In the first numbering scheme (clockwise), the cyano group is at C5.\n*   In the second numbering scheme (counter-clockwise), the cyano group is at C3.\n\nThe second scheme gives the alphabetically first substituent the lower number (3 vs. 5). Therefore, the correct numbering is counter-clockwise from the carboxylic acid.\n\n**5. Final Structure and Naming**\n\nThe correct numbering and substituent locations are:\n*   **C1:** -COOH (parent benzoic acid)\n*   **C2:** -OH (2-hydroxy)\n*   **C3:** -CN (3-cyano)\n*   **C4:** -OCH3 (4-methoxy)\n*   **C5:** -CHO (5-formyl)\n*   **C6:** -N(CH3)2 (6-dimethylamino)\n\nTo construct the final name, list the substituents alphabetically, followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n*   3-cyano\n*   6-(dimethylamino)\n*   5-formyl\n*   2-hydroxy\n*   4-methoxy\n\nCombining these gives the full IUPAC name: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
