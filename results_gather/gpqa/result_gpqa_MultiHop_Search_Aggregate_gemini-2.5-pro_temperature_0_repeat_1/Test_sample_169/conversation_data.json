    "The calculation for the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, denoted as S_y, for an electron in a given spin state follows a standard procedure in quantum mechanics.\n\nFirst, the given spin state, represented by the vector (3i, 4), must be normalized. The process of normalization ensures that the total probability of finding the electron in any possible spin state is equal to 1. The unnormalized state is represented as a column vector:\n\n|ψ⟩ = [ 3i ]\n      [ 4  ]\n\nTo normalize this state, we first calculate the inner product of the state with itself, which is the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of its components. The \"bra\" vector, ⟨ψ|, is the conjugate transpose of the \"ket\" vector |ψ⟩, so ⟨ψ| = [-3i, 4].\n\nThe inner product ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ is:\n⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = 9 + 16 = 25\n\nThe normalization constant is the reciprocal of the square root of this value, which is 1/√25 = 1/5. The normalized spin state is therefore:\n\n|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/5) * [ 3i ]\n                   [ 4  ]\n\nNext, we use the operator for the spin in the y-direction, S_y. This operator is defined as (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli y-matrix (σ_y).\n\nS_y = (ħ/2) * [ 0  -i ]\n              [ i   0 ]\n\nThe expectation value, ⟨S_y⟩, is found by \"sandwiching\" the S_y operator between the normalized bra and ket vectors.\n\n⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ_norm| S_y |ψ_norm⟩\n\nThis calculation is performed as follows:\n⟨S_y⟩ = (1/5) * [-3i, 4] * ( (ħ/2) * [ 0  -i ] ) * ( (1/5) * [ 3i ] )\n                                    [ i   0 ]           [ 4  ]\n\nCombining the constants gives (ħ/50). The matrix-vector multiplication proceeds as:\n[-3i, 4] * [ (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) ] = [-3i, 4] * [ -4i ]\n           [  (i)(3i) + (0)(4)  ]              [ -3  ]\n\nFinally, the dot product is:\n(-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) = 12i² - 12 = -12 - 12 = -24\n\nMultiplying this result by the constant factor gives:\n⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/50) * (-24) = -24ħ / 50 = -12ħ / 25\n\nThis result matches a known solved problem with the same initial spin state.\n\n<<<B>>>"
