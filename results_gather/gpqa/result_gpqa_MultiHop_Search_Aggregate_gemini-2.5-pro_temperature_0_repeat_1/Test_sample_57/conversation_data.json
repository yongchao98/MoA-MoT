    "Of the options provided, the one physical theory that is believed not to require regularization at high energies is Superstring Theory.\n\n*   **A) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory encounters problems with infinities, for instance, in the self-energy of a point-like charged particle. The energy of the electric field of a charged sphere diverges as its radius goes to zero, which was one of the first indications of infinities in a physical theory.\n*   **C) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** As a quantum field theory, QCD requires regularization to handle the ultraviolet (UV) divergences that appear in calculations involving loop diagrams. Techniques like dimensional regularization are standard procedures to make these calculations meaningful.\n*   **D) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** Similar to QCD, QED is a quantum field theory that suffers from ultraviolet divergences in its perturbative calculations. Regularization and the subsequent process of renormalization are essential to extract finite and predictive results from the theory.\n*   **B) Superstring Theory:** This theory is a leading candidate for a \"UV complete\" theory, meaning it is thought to be well-defined at all energy scales, including arbitrarily high energies (the ultraviolet regime). Unlike theories based on point particles, the fundamental objects in string theory are extended one-dimensional strings. This extended nature smooths out interactions at very short distances, thus avoiding the ultraviolet divergences that plague quantum field theories. Consequently, it does not require the ad-hoc process of regularization at high energies.\n\n<<<B>>>"
