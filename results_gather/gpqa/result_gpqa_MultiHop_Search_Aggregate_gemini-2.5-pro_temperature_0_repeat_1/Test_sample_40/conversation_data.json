    "To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we must use the relativistic velocity addition formula.\n\nLet's define the variables:\n*   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum, which is given as `c=1`.\n*   `n` is the index of refraction of the glass.\n*   `v` is the velocity of the glass moving towards the observer.\n*   The speed of light in the glass, as measured in the rest frame of the glass, is `u' = c/n = 1/n`.\n*   We want to find `u`, the speed of light in the moving glass as measured by the observer in the laboratory.\n\nThe relativistic velocity addition formula for objects moving in the same direction is:\n`u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u'*v)/c^2)`\n\nNow, we substitute the values into this formula:\n`u = (1/n + v) / (1 + ((1/n)*v)/1^2)`\n\nTo simplify this expression, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n`u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n`u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 1\nB) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\nC) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\nD) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n\nThe calculated speed matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
