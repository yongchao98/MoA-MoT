    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the energy of the nucleus.\n\n**1. Identify the Nucleus**\nThe problem specifies the nucleus X as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons.\n*   Lithium has an atomic number (Z) of 3, which means it has 3 protons.\n*   With 3 neutrons (N), the mass number (A) is Z + N = 3 + 3 = 6.\n*   Therefore, the nucleus is Lithium-6 (⁶Li).\n\n**2. Determine the Rest Energy (E₀)**\nFirst, we find the rest mass of the Lithium-6 atom.\n*   The atomic mass of ⁶Li is 6.015122 atomic mass units (u).\nNext, we convert this mass to energy. The energy equivalent of one atomic mass unit is 1 u = 931.4941 MeV/c².\nThe rest energy E₀ is calculated using Einstein's equation E=mc²:\n*   E₀ = 6.015122 u * 931.4941 MeV/u\n*   E₀ ≈ 5603.045 MeV\n\n**3. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\nThe Lorentz factor is determined by the speed of the nucleus, which is given as v = 0.96c (where c is the speed of light).\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.96²)\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216)\n*   γ = 1 / √0.0784\n*   γ = 1 / 0.28\n*   γ ≈ 3.5714\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Relativistic Energy (E)**\nThe total energy of the nucleus moving at a relativistic speed is the product of its rest energy and the Lorentz factor.\n*   E = γ * E₀\n*   E ≈ 3.5714 * 5603.045 MeV\n*   E ≈ 20010.87 MeV\n\n**5. Convert the Energy to Giga-electron Volts (GeV)**\nSince the options are in GeV, we convert our result from MeV to GeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV).\n*   E ≈ 20.01087 GeV\n\n**6. Compare with the Given Options**\nThe calculated total energy is approximately 20.011 GeV. Let's compare this to the choices:\nA) 18.475 GeV\nB) 20.132 GeV\nC) 23.069 GeV\nD) 21.419 GeV\n\nThe calculated value of 20.011 GeV is closest to option B, 20.132 GeV. The small discrepancy may arise from the specific values of constants used or a slight imprecision in the problem statement. However, based on the standard physical constants and the information given, 20.132 GeV is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
