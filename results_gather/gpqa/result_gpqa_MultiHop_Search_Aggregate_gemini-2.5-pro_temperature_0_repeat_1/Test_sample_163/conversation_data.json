    "To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we can use the relationship between the total mass of a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, its orbital period, and the radial velocity amplitudes of its component stars.\n\nFor a binary system where both stellar spectra are visible (a double-lined spectroscopic binary), the sum of the masses of the two stars (M₁ + M₂) is related to the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities (K₁ and K₂). Since both systems are described as eclipsing, we can assume the inclination of their orbits is close to 90 degrees, which simplifies the calculations.\n\nThe formula for the total mass (M_total) of such a system is proportional to the period multiplied by the cube of the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes:\n\nM_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³\n\nUsing this proportionality, we can calculate the relative masses for each system and then find their ratio.\n\n**For System 1:**\n*   Orbital Period (P₁): 2 years\n*   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K₁ₐ and K₁ᵦ): 10 km/s and 5 km/s\nThe total mass of system 1 (M_total_1) is proportional to:\nM_total_1 ∝ 2 * (10 + 5)³ = 2 * (15)³ = 2 * 3375 = 6750\n\n**For System 2:**\n*   Orbital Period (P₂): 1 year\n*   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K₂ₐ and K₂ᵦ): 15 km/s and 10 km/s\nThe total mass of system 2 (M_total_2) is proportional to:\nM_total_2 ∝ 1 * (15 + 10)³ = 1 * (25)³ = 1 * 15625 = 15625\n\n**Ratio of the Masses:**\nTo find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we compute the ratio M_total_1 / M_total_2:\n\nRatio = 6750 / 15625 = 0.432\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
