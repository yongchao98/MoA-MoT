    "The reaction between an enol and a halogen, such as bromine, is a classic example of α-halogenation of a carbonyl compound. The starting material, 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, has a carbon-carbon double bond with a hydroxyl group attached to one of the carbons (C1), making it an enol. Enols are the nucleophilic isomers of ketones and react readily with electrophiles like bromine (Br₂).\n\nThe mechanism proceeds as follows:\n1.  The electron-rich double bond of the enol attacks one of the bromine atoms in the Br₂ molecule.\n2.  Simultaneously, the lone pair of electrons on the enol's oxygen atom moves to form a double bond with the carbon (C1), and a new carbon-bromine bond is formed at the adjacent carbon (C2, the α-carbon).\n3.  This process results in the formation of a protonated α-bromo ketone.\n4.  A base, such as the bromide ion (Br⁻) formed in the first step, removes the proton from the oxygen, yielding the final product.\n\nFollowing this mechanism, the hydroxyl group at C1 of the enol is converted into a carbonyl group (ketone), and a bromine atom is added to the α-carbon (C2). The dimethyl groups at C4 remain unchanged. Therefore, the major product is 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.\n\nThe other options are incorrect:\n*   A) and D) (1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol) would be the result of a standard dihalogenation of an alkene, but the presence of the enol hydroxyl group fundamentally changes the reaction pathway, favoring the formation of the more stable ketone.\n*   C) (4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone) is incorrect as the reaction occurs at the electron-rich enol double bond (C1-C2), not at the saturated C4 position.\n\n<<<B>>>"
