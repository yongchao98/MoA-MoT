    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Normalize the State |α>\n\nThe given state is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Let's call the unnormalized state |ψ>:\n|ψ> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>\n\nTo normalize this state, we need to find a constant C such that |α> = C|ψ> and <α|α> = 1.\nThe inner product <ψ|ψ> is:\n<ψ|ψ> = <(1+i)up + (2-i)down | (1+i)up + (2-i)down>\n<ψ|ψ> = |1+i|² + |2-i|²\n<ψ|ψ> = (1² + 1²) + (2² + (-1)²) = (1+1) + (4+1) = 7\n\nThe normalization constant C is 1/√(7). Therefore, the normalized state |α> is:\n|α> = (1/√7) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]\n\n### 2. Define the Operator A and Find its Eigenstates and Eigenvalues\n\nThe operator A is defined by its matrix elements: Aij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and Aij = 0 otherwise. In the {|up>, |down>} basis, this corresponds to the matrix:\nA = (ħ/2) * [,]\nThis operator is proportional to the Pauli X matrix (σₓ).\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0:\ndet([[ -λ, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -λ]]) = (-λ)(-λ) - (ħ/2)(ħ/2) = λ² - (ħ/2)² = 0\nThis gives two eigenvalues:\n*   λ₁ = +ħ/2\n*   λ₂ = -ħ/2\n\nNext, we find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors:\n*   **For λ₁ = +ħ/2**:\n    (A - λ₁I)v₁ = 0  =>  [[-ħ/2, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -ħ/2]] [x, y]ᵀ = 0\n    This gives the equation -x + y = 0, or x = y. The normalized eigenvector is |v₁> = (1/√2)(|up> + |down>).\n*   **For λ₂ = -ħ/2**:\n    (A - λ₂I)v₂ = 0  =>  [[ħ/2, ħ/2], [ħ/2, ħ/2]] [x, y]ᵀ = 0\n    This gives the equation x + y = 0, or x = -y. The normalized eigenvector is |v₂> = (1/√2)(|up> - |down>).\n\n### 3. Calculate the Measurement Probabilities\n\nThe probability of measuring an eigenvalue λᵢ is given by P(λᵢ) = |<vᵢ|α>|².\n\n*   **Probability P₁ (of measuring λ₁ = +ħ/2)**:\n    P₁ = |<v₁|α>|²\n    <v₁|α> = [(1/√2)(<up| + <down|)] * [(1/√7)((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]\n    <v₁|α> = (1/√14) * [(1+i)<up|up> + (2-i)<down|down>]\n    <v₁|α> = (1/√14) * (1+i + 2-i) = 3/√14\n    P₁ = |3/√14|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.643\n\n*   **Probability P₂ (of measuring λ₂ = -ħ/2)**:\n    P₂ = |<v₂|α>|²\n    <v₂|α> = [(1/√2)(<up| - <down|)] * [(1/√7)((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]\n    <v₂|α> = (1/√14) * [(1+i)<up|up> - (2-i)<down|down>]\n    <v₂|α> = (1/√14) * (1+i - (2-i)) = (1/√14) * (-1 + 2i)\n    P₂ = |(-1 + 2i)/√14|² = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = (1+4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.357\n\nThe probabilities of measuring the particle in the two eigenstates are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\n### 4. Find the Average Value of the Operator\n\nThe average or expectation value <A> can be calculated in two ways.\n\n*   **Method 1: Using probabilities and eigenvalues**\n    <A> = P₁λ₁ + P₂λ₂\n    <A> = (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2)\n    <A> = (ħ/28) * (9 - 5) = 4ħ/28 = ħ/7\n\n*   **Method 2: Using the bra-ket notation <A> = <α|A|α>**\n    A|α> = (ħ/2) [,] * (1/√7) [[1+i], [2-i]]ᵀ = (ħ/(2√7)) [[2-i], [1+i]]ᵀ\n    <α|A|α> = (1/√7) [1-i, 2+i] * (ħ/(2√7)) [[2-i], [1+i]]ᵀ\n    <A> = (ħ/14) * [(1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i)]\n    <A> = (ħ/14) * [(2 - 3i - 1) + (2 + 3i - 1)]\n    <A> = (ħ/14) * (1 - 3i + 1 + 3i) = (ħ/14) * 2 = ħ/7\n\nBoth methods yield the same average value: **ħ/7**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of the operator is ħ/7. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
