    "Of the molecules listed, **triisopropyl borate** is the one that has C3h symmetry.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the symmetry analysis for each molecule:\n\n*   **A) Triisopropyl borate ([(CH₃)₂CHO]₃B):** This molecule consists of a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups. The core structure, BO₃, is planar. The molecule can adopt a conformation where the three isopropoxy groups are arranged in a propeller-like fashion around the central boron atom. This arrangement possesses a three-fold rotational axis (C₃) passing through the boron atom, perpendicular to the BO₃ plane. The planarity of the BO₃ core provides a horizontal mirror plane (σh) that reflects the top and bottom of the molecule. The combination of a C₃ axis and a σh plane defines the C₃h point group.\n\n*   **B) Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone:** Also known as mellitic trianhydride, this molecule has a central benzene ring fused to three anhydride rings. While some studies suggest a slight propeller twist, it is often considered to be planar. If planar, it possesses a C₃ axis, three C₂ axes perpendicular to the C₃ axis, and a horizontal mirror plane (the plane of the molecule). These symmetry elements place it in the D₃h point group, not C₃h.\n\n*   **C) Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone:** This is a large, complex polycyclic aromatic molecule. While it has a three-fold rotational symmetry based on its triphenylene core, its overall symmetry is more complex and does not fit the C₃h point group.\n\n*   **D) Quinuclidine (C₇H₁₃N):** This is a bicyclic amine with a cage-like structure. It has a C₃ axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon. It also possesses three vertical mirror planes (σv). The presence of a C₃ axis and vertical mirror planes, but the absence of a horizontal mirror plane, assigns it to the C₃v point group.\n\nTherefore, triisopropyl borate is the molecule that exhibits C₃h symmetry.\n\n<<<A>>>"
