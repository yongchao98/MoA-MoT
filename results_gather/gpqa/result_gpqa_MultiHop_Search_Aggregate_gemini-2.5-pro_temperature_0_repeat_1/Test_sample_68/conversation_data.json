    "To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays, we must first calculate the characteristic distance the particles travel in the bubble chamber before decaying. This involves concepts from special relativity.\n\n### 1. Calculation of the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)\nThe Lorentz factor relates the time and distance measurements in the particle's rest frame to the laboratory frame (the bubble chamber). It is calculated from the total energy (E) and the rest mass ($m_0$) of the particle.\n\nGiven:\n*   Total Energy (E) = 27 GeV\n*   Rest Mass ($m_0$) = 3.41 GeV\n\nThe formula for the Lorentz factor is:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n### 2. Calculation of the Mean Decay Length (L)\nThe proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) is the lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame. In the lab frame, this lifetime is dilated by the Lorentz factor, $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$. The mean distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying, known as the mean decay length (L), is this dilated lifetime multiplied by the particle's velocity (v). Since the particle is highly relativistic, its velocity is approximately the speed of light (c).\n\nGiven:\n*   Proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) = $8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   Speed of light (c) $\\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\nThe mean decay length is:\n$L = v \\cdot \\tau = v \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot \\tau_0 \\approx c \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot \\tau_0$\n$L \\approx (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (7.918) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 1.90 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### 3. Determining the Required Resolution\nTo \"observe\" a decay, the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution, R. The probability that a particle travels a distance `x` before decaying follows an exponential decay law. The probability of it traveling a distance greater than the resolution R is given by $P(x > R) = e^{-R/L}$.\n\nThe problem requires that we observe at least 30% of the decays. This means the probability of the decay length being greater than the resolution R must be at least 0.30.\n\n$P(x > R) \\ge 0.30$\n$e^{-R/L} \\ge 0.30$\n\nTo find the maximum (or coarsest) resolution that satisfies this condition, we solve for the boundary case:\n$e^{-R/L} = 0.30$\n$-R/L = \\ln(0.30)$\n$R = -L \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\nUsing the calculated mean decay length L:\n$R = -(1.90 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\ln(0.30) \\approx -(1.90 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204)$\n$R \\approx 2.288 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nThe resolution `R` must be less than or equal to this value ($R \\le 2.288 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). Reviewing the options:\n\nA) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\nB) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\nC) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\nD) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\n\nOption A, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is the value that satisfies this condition and is closest to the calculated maximum allowed resolution. With a resolution of $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, the fraction of observed decays would be $e^{-(2.08 \\times 10^{-6}) / (1.90 \\times 10^{-6})} \\approx e^{-1.095} \\approx 0.33$, which is greater than 30%.\n\n<<<A>>>"
