    "### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    *   **Structure:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring (a benzene ring with two substituents).\n    *   **Composition:** 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the benzene ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contain 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **FTIR Data:** Indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (a halogen attached directly to the benzene ring).\n\n2.  **Deduce possible structures:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n    *   The other substituent must contain the remaining atoms, including 2 carbons and a carbonyl group.\n    *   **Possibility 1:** An acetyl group (-COCH₃). This has 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. The total formula would be C₆H₄(X)(COCH₃). This compound is a haloacetophenone. It has 6 + 2 = 8 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Possibility 2:** A formylmethyl group (-CH₂CHO). This also has 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. The total formula would be C₆H₄(X)(CH₂CHO). This compound is a halophenylacetaldehyde. It has 6 + 2 = 8 carbon atoms.\n    *   Both possibilities fit the initial description.\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR options in the context of the possible structures:**\n    *   The options suggest a *para* (1,4) substitution pattern on the benzene ring, which gives a characteristic signal of two doublets in the aromatic region (typically 7-8 ppm), each integrating to 2 protons. Options A and C show this pattern.\n    *   **Option A: ¹H NMR: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum corresponds to the **halophenylacetaldehyde** structure.\n        *   `9.9 (1H, s)`: Aldehyde proton (-CHO). The chemical shift is appropriate.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: Protons on a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n        *   `3.7 (2H, s)`: Methylene protons (-CH₂-).\n        *   **Critique:** While the chemical shifts are plausible, the multiplicities are atypical. The aldehyde proton and the adjacent methylene protons should couple, resulting in a triplet and a doublet, respectively. The provided data shows two singlets, which is unusual. Furthermore, the aromatic protons are significantly deshielded (7.6-7.8 ppm), which is more characteristic of a strongly electron-withdrawing group attached directly to the ring.\n    *   **Option B: ¹H NMR: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This option lacks signals in the aromatic region (around 7-8 ppm), so it cannot be the correct answer for an aromatic compound.\n    *   **Option C: ¹H NMR: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum corresponds to the **haloacetophenone** structure.\n        *   `7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d)`: Protons on a para-substituted aromatic ring. The chemical shifts are consistent with a ring substituted with two electron-withdrawing groups (halogen and acetyl). The protons ortho to the more strongly withdrawing acetyl group are further downfield.\n        *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: Methyl protons of an acetyl group (-COCH₃). The chemical shift is typical for a methyl ketone (around 2.1-2.6 ppm), and it is a singlet because there are no adjacent protons.\n        *   **Critique:** This data is fully consistent with the expected spectrum for a para-haloacetophenone, such as 4-chloroacetophenone.\n    *   **Option D: ¹H NMR: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The integration and splitting patterns do not match a di-substituted benzene ring with 4 protons. This option is incorrect.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Both para-haloacetophenone and para-halophenylacetaldehyde fit the initial description.\n    *   However, the NMR data in option C is a much better and more typical representation for para-haloacetophenone than the data in option A is for para-halophenylacetaldehyde. The chemical shifts and, crucially, the splitting patterns in option C are exactly as expected. The multiplicities in option A are anomalous. Therefore, option C represents the correct ¹H NMR data.\n\n<<<C>>>"
