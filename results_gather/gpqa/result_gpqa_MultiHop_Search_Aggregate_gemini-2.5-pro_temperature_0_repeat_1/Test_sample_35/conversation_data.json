    "The observation is of a cosmologically redshifted signal that, in the Milky Way, corresponds to the cold atomic interstellar medium. Here is a step-by-step explanation:\n\nFirst, it's necessary to identify the rest-frame energy of the observed absorption line. The detected energy is 3.9 micro electron volts (µeV) from a structure at a distance of about 2.1 gigaparsecs (Gpc). This great distance implies that the light from the object has been stretched to longer wavelengths (and lower energies) by the expansion of the universe, an effect known as cosmological redshift.\n\nThe most prominent absorption line in this energy range is the 21 cm line of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI), which has a rest-frame energy of about 5.9 µeV. The relationship between the observed energy (E_obs), the rest-frame energy (E_rest), and the redshift (z) is given by: E_obs = E_rest / (1 + z).\n\nUsing the given and known values:\n*   E_obs = 3.9 µeV\n*   E_rest ≈ 5.9 µeV\n\nWe can calculate the redshift:\n1 + z = 5.9 µeV / 3.9 µeV ≈ 1.51\nz ≈ 0.51\n\nA redshift of z ≈ 0.51 corresponds to a cosmological distance of approximately 2.1 Gpc, which matches the distance provided in the problem. This confirms that the observed line is indeed the redshifted 21 cm hydrogen line.\n\nThe question asks what is most likely to be observed with this absorption line *in the Milky Way*. This refers to the un-redshifted 21 cm line. This line is a fundamental tool for studying the interstellar medium (ISM).\n\n*   **Absorption lines** are typically observed when cool gas lies in front of a hotter, more distant background source.\n*   The 21 cm line, when seen in absorption, is a primary tracer of the **cold atomic interstellar medium**, also known as the Cold Neutral Medium (CNM). This medium consists of neutral hydrogen atoms at temperatures of about 80-100 K.\n\nTherefore, the absorption line in the Milky Way that corresponds to the observed (but redshifted) signal is a characteristic signature of the cold atomic interstellar medium.\n\n<<<C>>>"
