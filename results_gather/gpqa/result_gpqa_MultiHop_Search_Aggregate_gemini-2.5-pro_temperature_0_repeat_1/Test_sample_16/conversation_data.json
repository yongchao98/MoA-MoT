    "To determine the concentration of calcium ions in the solution, we must consider the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex (represented as CaY²⁻) is described by the following equilibrium:\nCa²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ CaY²⁻\n\nThe formation constant, K_f (also called the stability constant), for this reaction is given as:\nK_f = [CaY²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\nThe problem, however, involves the dissociation of the complex, which is the reverse reaction:\nCaY²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this dissociation (K_d), sometimes called the instability constant, is the inverse of the formation constant.\nK_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\nWe can set up an equilibrium table to find the concentration of the dissociated ions. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions at equilibrium. Since the dissociation stoichiometry is 1:1, the concentration of the free EDTA anion (Y⁴⁻) will also be 'x'.\n\n*   **Initial concentration of CaY²⁻:** 0.02 M\n*   **Equilibrium concentration of CaY²⁻:** 0.02 - x\n*   **Equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺:** x\n*   **Equilibrium concentration of Y⁴⁻:** x\n\nNow, we substitute these into the dissociation constant expression:\nK_d = [Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻] / [CaY²⁻]\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n\nBecause the formation constant is very large, the complex is very stable, and the amount of dissociation 'x' will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of the complex. Therefore, we can make the simplifying assumption that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\nThe equation becomes:\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\nNow, we solve for x:\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹)(0.02)\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is therefore approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. This matches option D. The assumption that 'x' is much smaller than 0.02 is valid, as 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ is significantly less than 0.02.\n\nIt is important to note that this calculation assumes an \"ideal pH\". The actual concentration of the fully deprotonated EDTA (Y⁴⁻) is highly dependent on the pH of the solution. At lower pH values, more of the EDTA would be in protonated forms, leading to a higher concentration of free Ca²⁺ ions. However, based on the information given, this simplified calculation is appropriate.\n\n<<<D>>>"
