    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can follow these steps:\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between a planet's equilibrium temperature and its distance from its host star. The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is proportional to the fourth root of the stellar flux received by the planet, which in turn is inversely proportional to the square of the distance (d) from the star. This can be expressed as:\n\nT_eq ∝ (1/d²)¹ᐟ⁴ which simplifies to T_eq ∝ 1/√d.\n\nNext, we use Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion, which states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a). For circular orbits, the semi-major axis is equal to the distance (d) from the star. Therefore:\n\nP² ∝ d³ or d ∝ P²ᐟ³\n\nNow, we can express the equilibrium temperature in terms of the orbital period by substituting the relationship for distance into the temperature equation:\n\nT_eq ∝ 1 / √(P²ᐟ³) which simplifies to T_eq ∝ 1 / P¹ᐟ³\n\nWe are given that the ratio of the orbital periods of the planets is 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. We need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2 (T_eq4 / T_eq2). Using the relationship derived above:\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P₂ / P₄)¹ᐟ³\n\nFrom the given ratios, the orbital period of Planet_2 (P₂) is 2 (in some unit of time) and the orbital period of Planet_4 (P₄) is 3.5 (in the same unit). Plugging these values into the equation:\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)¹ᐟ³ ≈ (0.5714)¹ᐟ³\n\nCalculating the cube root of 0.5714 gives approximately 0.83.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.75\nB) ~0.69\nC) ~0.83\nD) ~0.57\n\nThe calculated ratio of approximately 0.83 matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
