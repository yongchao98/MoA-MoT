    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.\n\n### 1. Initial State and Dilution\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.\n\n*   **Initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH):**\n    Volume = 20.00 cm³ = 0.0200 L\n    Concentration = 0.05 M\n    Moles = 0.0200 L * 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 mol\n\n*   **Concentration after dilution:**\n    Initial volume of acid = 20.00 cm³\n    Volume of water added = 20.00 cm³\n    Total volume = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L\n    New concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M\n\n### 2. pH at 25% Titration\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH to form its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). This creates a buffer solution.\n\n*   **pKa calculation:**\n    The acid dissociation constant, Ka, for acetic acid is 1.85 x 10⁻⁵.\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n\n*   **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:**\n    The pH of a buffer solution can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]), where [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base and [HA] is the concentration of the acid.\n    At 25% titration, the ratio of the conjugate base (acetate) to the remaining acid is 25:75, or 1:3.\n    pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.73 - log(3)\n    pH = 4.73 - 0.477\n    pH ≈ 4.253\n\n    Rounding to two decimal places, the pH is **4.26**.\n\n### 3. pH at the Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by the NaOH, and the solution contains only sodium acetate. The acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) is a weak base and will hydrolyze in water, making the solution basic.\n\n*   **Volume of NaOH added:**\n    To reach the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH must equal the initial moles of acetic acid.\n    Volume of NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n*   **Concentration of Acetate (CH₃COO⁻):**\n    Total volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n    Concentration of acetate = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M\n\n*   **Hydrolysis and Kb Calculation:**\n    The acetate ion reacts with water: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, which can be found using the ion product of water (Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25 °C) and the Ka of acetic acid.\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n\n*   **Calculating [OH⁻]:**\n    We can set up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis: Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    Let x = [OH⁻] = [CH₃COOH].\n    5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    Assuming x is very small compared to 0.02, we can simplify:\n    x² ≈ (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02\n    x² ≈ 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\n*   **Calculating pH:**\n    pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\n    The pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
