    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The significant broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. This, combined with the O-H peak, strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n    *   Another strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), suggesting the compound is an alkene.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinyl hydrogens are those directly attached to the carbons of a double bond.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a key indicator. This value corresponds to the mass of a carboxyl group ([COOH]⁺). This finding is consistent with the FTIR data pointing to a carboxylic acid. Another possibility for m/z = 45 is the [C₂H₅O]⁺ fragment, which can be seen in the mass spectrum of some alcohols like 2-pentanol. However, the combination of a broad O-H stretch and a C=O stretch in the FTIR makes the carboxylic acid assignment more likely.\n\n### Evaluating the Molecular Formulas\n\nThe combined spectral data indicate that the unknown compound contains both a carboxylic acid group (–COOH) and a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). The presence of a carboxylic acid requires two oxygen atoms, which eliminates options A (C₆H₁₂O) and D (C₆H₁₀O).\n\nTo distinguish between the remaining options, C₆H₁₂O₂ and C₆H₁₀O₂, we can calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) for each. The DoU represents the total number of rings and multiple bonds in a molecule.\n\n*   **For C₆H₁₂O₂ (Option B):**\n    *   The degree of unsaturation is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1.\n    *   A DoU of 1 signifies one double bond or one ring. A carboxylic acid group already contains one C=O double bond. This formula does not account for the additional C=C double bond confirmed by the FTIR and ¹H NMR data.\n\n*   **For C₆H₁₀O₂ (Option C):**\n    *   The degree of unsaturation is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2.\n    *   A DoU of 2 is consistent with the presence of two double bonds: one from the carbonyl group (C=O) of the carboxylic acid and one from the alkene group (C=C).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe spectroscopic evidence strongly supports a structure that is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The FTIR and mass spectrometry data confirm the carboxylic acid, while the FTIR and ¹H NMR data confirm the presence of a C=C double bond. Only the molecular formula C₆H₁₀O₂ has a sufficient degree of unsaturation to accommodate both of these structural features.\n\n<<<C>>>"
