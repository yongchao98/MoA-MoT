    "In the decay of a stationary positive pion (π⁺) into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (νμ), the principles of conservation of energy and momentum can be used to determine the kinetic energies of the product particles.\n\nThe decay is represented as:\nπ⁺ → μ⁺ + νμ\n\nGiven the rest masses:\n*   Rest mass of π⁺ (m_π) = 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of μ⁺ (m_μ) = 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   The rest mass of the neutrino (m_ν) is considered to be negligible or zero in this context.\n\nFrom the conservation of energy, the total energy of the initial pion (which is its rest energy since it is stationary) equals the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino:\nE_π = E_μ + E_ν\n\nThe total energy of a particle is the sum of its rest mass energy and its kinetic energy (KE):\nm_π * c² = (m_μ * c² + KE_μ) + (m_ν * c² + KE_ν)\n\nSince the pion is at rest, the total momentum before the decay is zero. By the conservation of momentum, the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n\nThe kinetic energy of the muon (KE_μ) can be calculated using the following formula, derived from the conservation laws:\nKE_μ = [(m_π² - m_μ² - m_ν²)c⁴] / (2 * m_π * c²)\n\nAssuming the neutrino mass is zero (m_ν = 0):\nKE_μ = [(m_π² - m_μ²)c⁴] / (2 * m_π * c²)\nKE_μ = [(139.6² - 105.7²) MeV²] / (2 * 139.6 MeV)\nKE_μ = [(19488.16 - 11172.49) MeV²] / (279.2 MeV)\nKE_μ = [8315.67 MeV²] / (279.2 MeV)\nKE_μ ≈ 29.78 MeV\n\nThe kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_ν) is equal to its total energy since its rest mass is zero. The total energy released in the decay (Q-value) is the difference between the initial and final rest masses:\nQ = (m_π - m_μ - m_ν) * c²\nQ = (139.6 - 105.7 - 0) MeV\nQ = 33.9 MeV\n\nThis total released energy is distributed as kinetic energy between the muon and the neutrino:\nQ = KE_μ + KE_ν\n33.9 MeV = 29.78 MeV + KE_ν\nKE_ν = 33.9 - 29.78 MeV\nKE_ν ≈ 4.12 MeV\n\nTherefore, the kinetic energies of the product particles are approximately 4.12 MeV for the neutrino and 29.8 MeV for the muon.\n\nComparing these calculated values with the given options:\nA) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nB) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nC) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nD) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
