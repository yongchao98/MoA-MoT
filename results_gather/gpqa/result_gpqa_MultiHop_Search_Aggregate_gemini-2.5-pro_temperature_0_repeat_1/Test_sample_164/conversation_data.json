    "Based on the analysis of the provided statements and the supporting research, the correct statement is identified by evaluating each claim against established knowledge in the field of ethylene polymerization and oligomerization.\n\n*   **A) Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.**\n    Research indicates that while tandem catalysis (a combined, one-reactor system) is a significant area of academic and industrial research, the current large-scale industrial production of branched polyethylene involves separate, distinct steps. Companies like Chevron Phillips and Sasol operate industrial plants in the US that first selectively oligomerize ethylene to alpha-olefins like 1-hexene or 1-octene. These alpha-olefins are then used as comonomers in a separate polymerization process to create branched polyethylene. Therefore, a truly combined, single-reactor system is not the current industrial standard on a large scale, making this statement incorrect.\n\n*   **B) One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.**\n    This statement is correct. Group VIa (modern nomenclature: Group 6) includes chromium (Cr). Industrial processes for the selective trimerization of ethylene to 1-hexene, such as the one developed by Chevron Phillips, explicitly use chromium-based catalysts. Similarly, Sasol employs chromium-based catalysts for the selective production of 1-hexene and 1-octene. These alpha-olefins are the source of the regular branches in the final polymer. These catalytic systems require activators to function.\n\n*   **C) Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.**\n    This statement is plausible but not the most accurate or well-supported conclusion from the research. Palladium (a noble metal) catalysts are known to be effective for producing highly branched polyethylene. While it is a general principle in the chemical industry that noble metal catalysts are often prohibitively expensive for large-volume commodity chemicals, the provided research focuses on their technical capabilities rather than their economic viability in this specific context. One study does highlight that an industrial process was chosen in part because its components were \"much cheaper\" than alternatives, underscoring the importance of cost. However, statement B is a more direct and factual description of established industrial chemistry.\n\n*   **D) Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.**\n    This statement is definitively incorrect. The \"essential additional reaction step\" is the oligomerization of ethylene to create the alpha-olefin branches. The literature overwhelmingly shows that aluminum-based activators, such as methylaluminoxane (MAO) and various alkylaluminum compounds (e.g., triethylaluminum), are not only effective but are often essential for activating the chromium-based oligomerization catalysts. Multiple sources confirm that in the absence of these aluminum-based activators, the chromium catalysts show no significant activity.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that is verifiably correct according to the research is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
