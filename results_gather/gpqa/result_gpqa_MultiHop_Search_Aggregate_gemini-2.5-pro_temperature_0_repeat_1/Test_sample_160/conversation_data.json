    "### The Relationship Between Gas Molecule and Electron Mean Free Path\n\nThe scenario describes two different mean free paths within the same sample compartment of a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. The first, λ1, is the mean free path of the remaining gas molecules colliding with each other. The second, λ2, is the mean free path of the electrons from the beam as they travel through these same gas molecules. The key to understanding the relationship between λ1 and λ2 lies in the concept of the collision cross-section.\n\nThe mean free path (λ) of a particle is inversely proportional to the number density of the target particles (n) and the collision cross-section (σ). The formula is generally expressed as:\n\nλ = 1 / (nσ)\n\n1.  **Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules (λ1):** In this case, gas molecules are colliding with other gas molecules. For a collision to occur between two identical spherical molecules of radius 'r', their centers must approach within a distance of 2r of each other. Therefore, the effective area for a collision, or the collision cross-section (σ1), is π(2r)² = 4πr². A more precise calculation that accounts for the relative motion of the molecules introduces a factor of the square root of 2, making the formula λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * 4πr²).\n\n2.  **Mean Free Path of Electrons (λ2):** Here, electrons are colliding with gas molecules. An electron's physical size is negligible compared to that of a gas molecule. Thus, the electron can be treated as a point particle. A collision occurs if the electron passes through the cross-sectional area of the gas molecule. The collision cross-section for this interaction (σ2) is therefore approximately the area of the molecule itself, which is πr². Since the electrons are moving at extremely high speeds (accelerated by 1000 kV) compared to the thermal motion of the gas molecules, the molecules can be considered stationary targets. The formula for the electron's mean free path is λ2 = 1 / (nσ2) = 1 / (nπr²).\n\n**Comparing λ1 and λ2:**\n\nBy comparing the two expressions, we can establish their relationship:\n\n*   λ1 is proportional to 1 / (4πr²)\n*   λ2 is proportional to 1 / (πr²)\n\nFrom this, it is clear that the collision cross-section for molecule-molecule collisions (σ1) is approximately four times larger than for electron-molecule collisions (σ2). Since the mean free path is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section, λ2 will be significantly larger than λ1.\n\nSpecifically, the ratio of λ2 to λ1 is:\n\nλ2 / λ1 ≈ (1 / (nπr²)) / (1 / (4nπr²)) = 4\n\nIf we use the more accurate formula for λ1 that includes the √2 factor, the ratio becomes:\n\nλ2 / λ1 ≈ (1 / (nπr²)) / (1 / (√2 * 4nπr²)) = 4√2 ≈ 5.66\n\nIn either calculation, λ2 is substantially greater than λ1. Therefore, the conclusion that λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 is a valid statement derived from the principles of kinetic theory and collision dynamics.\n\n<<<C>>>"
