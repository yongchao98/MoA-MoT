    "To find the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical particle, we first need to express the given potential in Cartesian coordinates. The potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ) as:\n\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\n\nThe transformation from polar to Cartesian coordinates is given by x = r cos(θ) and y = r sin(θ), which also means r^2 = x^2 + y^2.\n\nSubstituting these into the potential energy function, we get:\n\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k(x^2)\nV(x, y) = 1/2 kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2 + 3/2 kx^2\nV(x, y) = (1/2 k + 3/2 k)x^2 + 1/2 ky^2\nV(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n\nThis potential represents a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. The Schrödinger equation for this system is separable into two independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators, one in the x-direction and one in the y-direction.\n\nThe potential for the x-direction is V_x(x) = 2kx^2, and for the y-direction is V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2.\n\nThe standard form for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential is 1/2 mω^2x^2, where ω is the angular frequency. By comparing this with our potentials, we can find the angular frequencies for the x and y oscillators.\n\nFor the x-direction:\n1/2 m(ω_x)^2 x^2 = 2kx^2\nm(ω_x)^2 = 4k\nω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n\nFor the y-direction:\n1/2 m(ω_y)^2 y^2 = 1/2 ky^2\nm(ω_y)^2 = k\nω_y = sqrt(k/m)\n\nThe energy of a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator is given by E_n = (n + 1/2)ℏω, where n is a non-negative integer (n = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n\nThe total energy E of the two-dimensional system is the sum of the energies of the two independent oscillators:\nE = E_x + E_y\nE = (n_x + 1/2)ℏω_x + (n_y + 1/2)ℏω_y\n\nSubstituting the expressions for ω_x and ω_y:\nE = (n_x + 1/2)ℏ * (2 * sqrt(k/m)) + (n_y + 1/2)ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] * ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2) * ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\nB) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nC) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nD) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n\nThe calculated energy spectrum matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
