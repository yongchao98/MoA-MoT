    "Here is a step-by-step calculation and analysis to determine the correct statement.\n\n**1. Construct the Operator A<sub>y</sub>**\n\nThe problem states that the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator is given by A<sub>y</sub> = c∙S.\nThe constant c is given as h/4π.\nThe matrix S is given with the first row (0 -i) and the second row (i 0).\n\nSo, the matrix S is:\n```\nS = | 0  -i |\n    | i   0 |\n```\nThis is the Pauli spin matrix for the y-direction, σ<sub>y</sub>.\n\nNow, we construct the operator A<sub>y</sub>:\nA<sub>y</sub> = (h/4π) * S = (h/4π) * | 0  -i |\n                               | i   0 |\n\nA<sub>y</sub> = | 0        -i(h/4π) |\n      | i(h/4π)    0        |\n\n**2. Calculate the Eigenvalues of A<sub>y</sub>**\n\nTo find the eigenvalues 'a', we solve the characteristic equation det(A<sub>y</sub> - aI) = 0, where I is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n\ndet | -a        -i(h/4π) | = 0\n    | i(h/4π)    -a       |\n\n(-a) * (-a) - (-i(h/4π)) * (i(h/4π)) = 0\na² - (-i² * (h/4π)²) = 0\na² - (1 * (h/4π)²) = 0\na² = (h/4π)²\na = ± h/4π\n\nThe eigenvalues of the operator A<sub>y</sub> are a₁ = +h/4π and a₂ = -h/4π.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Statements**\n\n*   **A) The imaginary part of the eigenvalue of Ay are +2πh or –2πh, and the real part of that are +h/4π or –h/4π.**\n    This is incorrect. The calculated eigenvalues are purely real (±h/4π) and have no imaginary part.\n\n*   **C) The imaginary part of the eigenvalue of Ay are +1/2 or –1/2, and the real part of that are +1 or –1.**\n    This is incorrect. The eigenvalues are ±h/4π.\n\n*   **D) The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.**\n    The eigenvectors of a Hermitian operator (which A<sub>y</sub> is) form a complete and orthonormal basis for the vector space on which the operator acts. In this case, the two eigenvectors of A<sub>y</sub> form a basis for the 2D complex space. This statement is mathematically correct.\n\n*   **B) The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.**\n    This statement refers to the commutation relations of angular momentum operators in quantum mechanics.\n    *   The components of the angular momentum operator do not commute with each other. For instance, [A<sub>y</sub>, A<sub>z</sub>] = iħA<sub>x</sub>. Because A<sub>y</sub> and A<sub>z</sub> do not commute, they do not share a complete set of simultaneous eigenfunctions. This means an eigenfunction of A<sub>y</sub> cannot also be an eigenfunction of A<sub>z</sub> (unless the state is a null vector).\n    *   The square of the total angular momentum operator, A², commutes with all of its components: [A², A<sub>y</sub>] = 0. Because they commute, it is possible to find a set of functions that are eigenfunctions of both A² and A<sub>y</sub> simultaneously.\n    *   Therefore, this statement accurately describes a fundamental principle of quantum angular momentum.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBoth statements B and D are correct. However, statement B describes a profound and specific physical principle related to the nature of angular momentum in quantum mechanics, which is the central topic of the question. Statement D is a more general mathematical property of Hermitian operators. In the context of physics, the relationships between different physical observables (as described in B) are of primary importance. The non-commutativity of angular momentum components is a key concept that distinguishes quantum from classical mechanics.\n\n<<<B>>>"
