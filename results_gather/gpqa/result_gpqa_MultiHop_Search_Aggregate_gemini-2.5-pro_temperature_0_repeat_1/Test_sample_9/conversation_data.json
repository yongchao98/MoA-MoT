    "To determine which exoplanet has the highest density, let's analyze each option:\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This planet, by definition, has the same average density as Earth, which is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is stated to be about 5.5 g/cm³, which is nearly identical to Earth's density.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** For planets with the same composition, a significant increase in mass results in greater gravitational compression of its materials. This compression leads to a higher overall density. Therefore, a planet that is five times more massive than Earth will be considerably denser than Earth.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** In contrast to the more massive planet, a planet with less mass will experience weaker gravitational compression. Consequently, a planet with half the mass of Earth will be less dense than Earth.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the four scenarios, the planet described in option (c) will have the highest density. While options (a) and (b) have densities similar to Earth's, and option (d) has a lower density, the five-Earth-mass planet's immense gravity will compress its material far more, resulting in the highest density of the group.\n\n<<<D>>>"
