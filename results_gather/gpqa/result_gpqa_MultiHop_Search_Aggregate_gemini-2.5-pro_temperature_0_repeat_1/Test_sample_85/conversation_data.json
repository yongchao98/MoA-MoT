    "The analysis of the two reactions hinges on the chemoselectivity of the reducing agents, lithium borohydride (LiBH4) and borane (BH3).\n\n### **Reaction A: Reduction with LiBH4**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH4) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:** In this reaction, LiBH4 will reduce the isobutyl ester group at one end of the starting material (compound A) to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group at the other end remains unaffected. The resulting molecule is a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid.\n*   **Cyclization:** Upon acidic workup (H+), the newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the carboxylic acid carbonyl, leading to an intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the six-membered ring lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** This reaction sequence does not affect the chiral center at the 3-position of the starting material (which becomes the 4-position in the product). Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration. Thus, **A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Reaction B: Reduction with BH3**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH3) is known for its ability to selectively reduce carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n*   **Mechanism:** Borane will reduce the carboxylic acid group of the starting material (compound B) to a primary alcohol, leaving the isobutyl ester group intact. This forms a 5-hydroxy ester.\n*   **Cyclization:** The subsequent acidic workup (H+) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, forming the lactone and releasing isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As with the first reaction, the chiral center is not involved in the reduction or cyclization steps. Consequently, the stereochemistry is preserved.\n*   **Conclusion:** The product is (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which means the starting material B must have the (S) configuration. Therefore, **B is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBased on this analysis, starting material A is the (R)-enantiomer and starting material B is the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
