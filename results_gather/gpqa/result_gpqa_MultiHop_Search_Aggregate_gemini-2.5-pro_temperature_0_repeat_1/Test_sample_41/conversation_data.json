    "The search results confirm the physical principles I used.\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature**: The formula relates equilibrium temperature (T_eq) to the star's properties and the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis 'a' for a circular orbit) and albedo 'A'. The key relationship is that T_eq is proportional to a^(-1/2). My derivation T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a2 / a1)^(1/2) is correct. The problem states the orbits are circular, so using the semi-major axis 'a' is appropriate. The fact that albedo is constant for all three planets is crucial for this simplification.\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law**: The law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a). This is expressed as P² ∝ a³. Therefore, the relationship (P3 / P1)² = (a3 / a1)³ is correct. The law is a very good approximation when the planets' masses are negligible compared to the star's mass, which is a standard assumption in such problems unless stated otherwise.\n\nThe calculation steps are as follows:\n*   Use the temperature ratios to find the ratios of the semi-major axes.\n*   Combine the semi-major axis ratios to find the ratio between Planet 3 and Planet 1.\n*   Use Kepler's Third Law to convert the semi-major axis ratio into an orbital period ratio.\n\n**Step 1 & 2: Calculate Semi-Major Axis Ratios**\n*   Given: T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 1.4 and T_eq2 / T_eq3 ≈ 2.3.\n*   From the equilibrium temperature formula, a_j / a_i = (T_eq_i / T_eq_j)².\n*   a2 / a1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2)² = (1.4)² = 1.96.\n*   a3 / a2 = (T_eq2 / T_eq3)² = (2.3)² = 5.29.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Overall Semi-Major Axis Ratio (a3 / a1)**\n*   a3 / a1 = (a3 / a2) * (a2 / a1) = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684.\n\n**Step 4 & 5: Calculate the Orbital Period Ratio (P3 / P1)**\n*   From Kepler's Third Law, P3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2).\n*   P3 / P1 = (10.3684)^(1.5) ≈ 33.38.\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4. The information regarding the masses and the TTV discovery method appears to be extraneous detail not required for the calculation.\n\nThe logic is sound and confirmed by the search results. I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\nFinal check of the question and options:\nQuestion: By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1?\nOptions: A) ~ 4.4, B) ~ 33.4, C) ~ 3.2, D) ~ 10.4\nMy result of ~33.4 matches option B.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to relate the equilibrium temperature of a planet to its orbital period. This can be done in two steps, using the formula for equilibrium temperature and Kepler's Third Law.\n\n**Step 1: Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet in a circular orbit is given by the formula:\nT_eq = [L * (1 - A) / (16 * π * σ * a²)]^(1/4)\nwhere:\n*   L is the luminosity of the host star.\n*   A is the planet's albedo.\n*   σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   a is the semi-major axis (orbital radius for a circular orbit).\n\nSince the planets orbit the same star (same L) and have the same albedo (A=0.3), the formula simplifies to show that the equilibrium temperature is proportional to the inverse square root of the orbital distance:\nT_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the semi-major axes of two planets can be found from the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures:\n(a_j / a_i) = (T_eq_i / T_eq_j)²\n\nWe are given the temperature ratios:\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 1.4\n*   T_eq2 / T_eq3 ≈ 2.3\n\nUsing these, we can find the ratios of the orbital distances:\n*   a2 / a1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2)² = (1.4)² = 1.96\n*   a3 / a2 = (T_eq2 / T_eq3)² = (2.3)² = 5.29\n\nTo find the ratio of the orbital distance of Planet3 to Planet1, we multiply these two ratios:\n*   a3 / a1 = (a3 / a2) * (a2 / a1) = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684\n\n**Step 2: Relate Orbital Distance to Orbital Period**\n\nKepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a).\nP² ∝ a³\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the orbital periods of two planets is:\n(P_j / P_i) = (a_j / a_i)^(3/2)\n\nNow we can calculate the ratio of the orbital period of Planet3 to Planet1:\n*   P3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(1.5)\n\nCalculating the final value:\n*   P3 / P1 ≈ 33.38\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4. The information about the planet masses and the TTV discovery method is not needed for this calculation.\n\nFinal Answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
