    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n### 1. Understand the Physics of the Problem\n\nThe problem asks to equate two phenomena that both cause a dip in a star's observed brightness:\n*   **Rotational Modulation by Starspots:** A star with a cooler, darker (spotted) region rotating into view will appear dimmer than when its hotter, unspotted surface is visible.\n*   **Exoplanet Transit:** A planet passing in front of its star blocks a fraction of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness.\n\nThe \"amplitude signal\" refers to the fractional decrease in brightness from the maximum observed flux.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Brightness Drop from Starspots\n\nThe energy radiated per unit area of a star is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, where the flux (F) is proportional to the fourth power of the effective temperature (Teff): F ∝ T⁴.\n\n*   **Star's effective temperature (Teff):** 6000 K\n*   **Spots' temperature (Tspot):** 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n*   **Filling factor of spots (f):** 20% or 0.20 (on one hemisphere)\n\nWe can compare the flux from the unspotted hemisphere (F_max) to the flux from the spotted hemisphere (F_min).\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** When the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer, the flux is proportional to Teff⁴.\n    `F_max ∝ Teff⁴`\n\n*   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** When the spotted hemisphere faces the observer, 80% of the surface has a temperature of Teff and 20% has a temperature of Tspot. The total flux is a weighted average:\n    `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * Teff⁴ + f * Tspot⁴`\n    `F_min ∝ (0.8 * Teff⁴) + (0.2 * Tspot⁴)`\n\nThe relative dip in brightness, or amplitude, is calculated as `(F_max - F_min) / F_max`, which simplifies to `1 - (F_min / F_max)`.\n\n`Amplitude_spots = 1 - [ (0.8 * Teff⁴ + 0.2 * Tspot⁴) / Teff⁴ ]`\n`Amplitude_spots = 1 - [ 0.8 + 0.2 * (Tspot / Teff)⁴ ]`\n\nNow, we plug in the temperature values:\n\n`Amplitude_spots = 1 - [ 0.8 + 0.2 * (5000 / 6000)⁴ ]`\n`Amplitude_spots = 1 - [ 0.8 + 0.2 * (5/6)⁴ ]`\n`Amplitude_spots = 1 - [ 0.8 + 0.2 * (0.48225) ]`\n`Amplitude_spots = 1 - [ 0.8 + 0.09645 ]`\n`Amplitude_spots = 1 - 0.89645`\n`Amplitude_spots = 0.10355`\n\nSo, the star's brightness dips by about 10.36% due to the spotted hemisphere.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Equivalent Exoplanet Transit Depth\n\nThe dip in brightness caused by a transiting exoplanet (its transit depth) is equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n\n`Amplitude_planet = (Area_planet / Area_star) = (π * Rpl²) / (π * Rstar²) = (Rpl / Rstar)²`\n\n### 4. Equate the Two Amplitudes and Solve\n\nThe problem states that the amplitude from the spots is the same as the amplitude from the hypothetical planet.\n\n`(Rpl / Rstar)² = Amplitude_spots`\n`(Rpl / Rstar)² = 0.10355`\n\nTo find the relative radius (Rpl/Rstar), we take the square root of this value:\n\n`Rpl / Rstar = √0.10355`\n`Rpl / Rstar ≈ 0.3218`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nComparing the result to the given options:\nA) ~0.07\nB) ~0.32\nC) ~0.11\nD) ~0.39\n\nThe calculated relative radius of ~0.32 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
