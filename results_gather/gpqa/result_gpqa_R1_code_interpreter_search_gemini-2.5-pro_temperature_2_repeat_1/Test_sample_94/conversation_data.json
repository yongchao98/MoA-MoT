    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the starting material and the first reaction.**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** The IUPAC name is 3,3,6-trimethylhepta-1,5-dien-4-one. Let's determine its structure.\n    *   \"hepta\" indicates a 7-carbon main chain.\n    *   \"-1,5-diene\" indicates double bonds starting at carbon 1 and carbon 5.\n    *   \"-4-one\" indicates a ketone (C=O) at carbon 4.\n    *   \"3,3,6-trimethyl\" indicates methyl groups as substituents: two at carbon 3 and one at carbon 6.\n    *   Following these rules, the structure is:\n        `CH₂(1)=CH(2)-C(3)(CH₃)₂-C(4)(=O)-CH(5)=C(6)(CH₃)-CH₃(7)`\n\n2.  **Reagent 1:** 1 equivalent of meta-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA).\n    *   m-CPBA is a peroxy acid primarily used for the epoxidation of alkenes (C=C double bonds).\n    *   The starting molecule has two different C=C double bonds:\n        *   **C1=C2:** This is a monosubstituted double bond. It is also conjugated with the C4=O group, but in a β,γ-position (`CγH₂=CβH-Cα(CH₃)₂-C(=O)-`), not an α,β-position. This conjugation slightly reduces its electron density.\n        *   **C5=C6:** This is a trisubstituted double bond (`-CH=C(CH₃)₂`), making it more electron-rich and thus more nucleophilic than the C1=C2 bond.\n    *   Epoxidation with m-CPBA is an electrophilic addition reaction. The more electron-rich (more substituted) alkene reacts faster. Therefore, m-CPBA will selectively react with the C5=C6 double bond.\n    *   The problem statement about \"two different products...in a 1:1 ratio\" is unusual. This could refer to diastereomers formed during epoxidation, or perhaps a competing Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of the ketone. However, we should focus on the most likely reaction pathway. The major product will be the epoxide at the C5-C6 position.\n\n3.  **Intermediate Product (P1):** The product of the epoxidation is 5,6-epoxy-3,3,6-trimethylhept-1-en-4-one.\n    *   Structure (P1): `CH₂(1)=CH(2)-C(3)(CH₃)₂-C(4)(=O)-[C(5)H-O-C(6)(CH₃)-CH₃(7)]` (The part in brackets is the epoxide ring).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second reaction.**\n\n1.  **Reagent 2:** Methyllithium (MeLi) is treated with copper(I) iodide (CuI) to form lithium dimethylcuprate (`(CH₃)₂CuLi`). This is known as a Gilman reagent. \"An excess of the resulting solution\" is then added.\n    *   Gilman reagents are soft nucleophiles. Their main reactions include:\n        *   Opening epoxide rings.\n        *   1,4-conjugate addition (Michael addition) to α,β-unsaturated carbonyls.\n    *   Gilman reagents are generally **unreactive** towards ketones, esters, and non-activated alkenes like the β,γ-unsaturated C1=C2 double bond in our intermediate P1.\n\n2.  **Reaction of Gilman Reagent with P1:**\n    *   Intermediate P1 has three functional groups: a ketone, a β,γ-alkene, and an epoxide.\n    *   The Gilman reagent, `(CH₃)₂CuLi`, will selectively react with the most electrophilic site amenable to its soft nucleophilic character, which is the epoxide ring.\n    *   The reaction is the nucleophilic opening of the epoxide by a methyl anion equivalent (`CH₃⁻`). This reaction adds one methyl group to the molecule.\n    *   Therefore, the final product must contain one more methyl group (and thus one more carbon atom) than the starting material.\n\n**Step 3: Atom Counting and Structure Determination.**\n\n1.  **Carbon Count Analysis:** This is a powerful shortcut to eliminate incorrect options.\n    *   Starting Material: 3,3,6-trimethylhepta-1,5-dien-4-one (C₇ main chain + 3 methyls) = 10 carbon atoms.\n    *   The reaction sequence involves adding one methyl group from the Gilman reagent.\n    *   Final Product: Must contain 10 + 1 = 11 carbon atoms.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Options based on Carbon Count:**\n    *   **A) 4,4,5,7,7-pentamethyloctane-3,5-diol:** C₈ chain + 5 methyls = 13 carbons. Incorrect.\n    *   **B) 2,3,4,5,5-pentamethylhept-6-ene-2,4-diol:** C₇ chain + 5 methyls = 12 carbons. Incorrect.\n    *   **C) 5-hydroxy-3,3,6,6-tetramethylhept-1-en-4-one:** C₇ chain + 4 methyls = **11 carbons**. **Correct.**\n    *   **D) 6-hydroxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethyloctan-4-one:** C₈ chain + 4 methyls = 12 carbons. Incorrect.\n\n**Step 4: Confirming the Structure of the Correct Option.**\n\nThe carbon count alone strongly indicates that C is the only possible answer. Let's verify that its structure is consistent with the reaction mechanism.\n\n*   **Option C:** 5-hydroxy-3,3,6,6-tetramethylhept-1-en-4-one.\n    *   Structure: `CH₂=CH-C(CH₃)₂-C(=O)-CH(OH)-C(CH₃)₂-CH₃`.\n*   This structure results from the opening of the epoxide in P1.\n    *   P1 epoxide: `-[C(5)H-O-C(6)(CH₃)CH₃]`\n    *   The nucleophilic methyl group from the Gilman reagent attacks one of the epoxide carbons (C5 or C6), breaking a C-O bond. A subsequent acidic workup protonates the resulting alkoxide to form an alcohol (-OH).\n    *   To get product C, the `CH₃⁻` must attack the more substituted carbon, C6. This forces the C6-O bond to break, forming an alkoxide at C5, which becomes the -OH group after workup. `...-C(=O)-C(5)H(O⁻)-C(6)(CH₃)₂-CH₃`.\n    *   The attack on the more hindered carbon is less common but can occur, especially if the carbon can stabilize a partial positive charge (C6 is tertiary).\n    *   Regardless of the regiochemistry (attack at C5 vs C6), the resulting product is a hydroxy-ketone with 11 carbons and a preserved C1=C2 double bond. Option C is the only answer that fits this structural type and carbon count.\n\nThe information about the 1:1 ratio in the first step and the specific regiochemistry of the epoxide opening are complexities that do not prevent solving the problem using a fundamental analysis of the reaction types and atom counting.\n\n<<<C>>>"
