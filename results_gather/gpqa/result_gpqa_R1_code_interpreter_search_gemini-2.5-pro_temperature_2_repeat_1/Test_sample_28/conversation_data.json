    "This problem requires identifying which mutation is most likely to result in a non-functional protein, thereby eliminating the anti-nutritional compound it produces. We need to analyze the effect of each mutation on the resulting amino acid sequence. The process of protein synthesis involves translating the DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence, reading the DNA in three-base units called codons.\n\n**1.  Analyze the Intact Gene:**\nThe gene sequence begins with `5’-ATG...`. `ATG` is the universal start codon, coding for the amino acid Methionine. The protein synthesis will start here. Let's look at the first few codons and their corresponding amino acids.\n\n*   Intact Gene: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...`\n*   Translation:   Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n\nThe goal is to disrupt this sequence so severely that a functional protein cannot be made.\n\n**2.  Analyze Mutant 1:**\n*   Mutant 1 Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...`\n*   Comparison with Intact: The second codon `TTT` changed to `TTC`, and the third codon `CTC` changed to `TAC`.\n    *   `TTT` -> `TTC`: Both codons code for Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a *silent mutation*.\n    *   `CTC` -> `TAC`: `CTC` codes for Leucine (Leu), while `TAC` codes for Tyrosine (Tyr). This is a *missense mutation*, as it substitutes one amino acid for another.\n*   Effect: The final protein will have a Tyrosine instead of a Leucine at the third position. While this could potentially affect the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely. The protein might just have reduced function or fold slightly differently. This is not the most reliable way to knock out a gene.\n\n**3.  Analyze Mutant 2:**\n*   Mutant 2 Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...`\n*   Comparison with Intact: The second codon `TTT` changed to `TTC`, and the third codon `CTC` changed to `TAA`.\n    *   `TTT` -> `TTC`: This is the same silent mutation as in Mutant 1.\n    *   `CTC` -> `TAA`: `CTC` codes for Leucine (Leu). `TAA`, however, is a **stop codon**.\n*   Effect: This type of mutation is called a *nonsense mutation*. The introduction of a premature stop codon will cause the ribosome (the protein-making machinery) to detach from the mRNA. As a result, translation will terminate after the second amino acid (Phenylalanine). The resulting product will be a tiny, two-amino-acid-long peptide (Met-Phe), which will be completely non-functional. This is a very effective way to eliminate the final protein product.\n\n**4.  Analyze Mutant 3:**\n*   Intact Sequence:  `ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT` (45 bases shown)\n*   Mutant 3 Sequence: `ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT` (48 bases shown)\n*   Effect: Mutant 3 has 3 extra bases compared to the intact sequence. An insertion of 3 bases (or a multiple of 3) adds one or more amino acids but does not shift the reading frame. This is called an *in-frame insertion*. Similar to a missense mutation, this might disrupt protein function, but it is not a guaranteed knockout. The protein will be longer by one amino acid.\n\n**5.  Analyze Mutant 4:**\n*   Intact Sequence:  `ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT` (45 bases shown)\n*   Mutant 4 Sequence: `ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT` (42 bases shown)\n*   Effect: Mutant 4 has 3 fewer bases than the intact sequence. A deletion of 3 bases (or a multiple of 3) removes one or more amino acids without shifting the reading frame. This is an *in-frame deletion*. Like an in-frame insertion, it might alter the protein's function but is less likely to completely abolish it than a premature stop codon.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAmong the given options, the mutation that will most probably eliminate the protein's function is the **nonsense mutation** in Mutant 2. It introduces a stop codon at the very beginning of the gene (the third codon), ensuring that only a tiny, non-functional peptide fragment is synthesized. This is the most effective way to knock out gene function among the choices provided.\n\n<<<C>>>"
