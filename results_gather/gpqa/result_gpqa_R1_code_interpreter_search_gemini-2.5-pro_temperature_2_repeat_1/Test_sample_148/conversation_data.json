    "This problem requires a careful analysis of spectroscopic and chromatographic data to deduce the nature of a synthetic peptide sample. Let's break down the evidence step-by-step.\n\n**1. Analysis of the <sup>1</sup>H NMR Data:**\n\n*   **Observation:** The spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. These peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals sum to 1H, with each peak integrating to roughly 0.5H.\n*   **Interpretation:** The fact that a single proton in the molecule gives rise to two separate signals indicates that this proton exists in two different chemical environments. The roughly equal integrals (0.5H + 0.5H) suggest that these two environments are populated in approximately a 1:1 ratio. Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, the two peaks must represent two different species.\n\n**2. Analysis of the LC-MS Data:**\n\n*   **Observation 1 (LC):** Liquid chromatography (LC) at elevated temperature resolves the sample into two distinct peaks of equal intensity.\n*   **Interpretation 1 (LC):** Standard LC techniques (like reversed-phase HPLC) separate compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity). The presence of two peaks demonstrates that the sample contains two different chemical species that can be separated. The equal intensities of the peaks corroborate the 1:1 ratio observed in the NMR. The \"elevated temperature\" condition helps to rule out slowly interconverting conformational isomers (rotamers), such as those around proline amide bonds, which would likely coalesce into a single, possibly broad, peak at higher temperatures. The fact that the peaks remain clearly defined suggests they are stable, non-interconverting species under these conditions.\n\n*   **Observation 2 (MS):** Both separated peaks yield the exact same mass spectrum, which corresponds to the molecular weight of the expected target peptide.\n*   **Interpretation 2 (MS):** Mass spectrometry (MS) measures the mass-to-charge ratio of molecules. The fact that both species have the same mass means they are isomersâ€”molecules with the same chemical formula but different arrangements of atoms.\n\n**3. Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) 'Double coupling' has occurred:** This would result in a product with a higher molecular weight than the expected peptide. The MS data directly contradicts this, as the observed mass matches the expected molecule.\n*   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor (e.g., a starting amino acid or a smaller peptide fragment) would have a different, likely lower, molecular weight. Again, the MS data refutes this possibility.\n*   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical and chemical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore:\n    *   They would not be resolved by a standard (achiral) LC column; they would elute together as a single peak.\n    *   They are indistinguishable in a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, producing only one set of peaks.\n    *   This option is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data.\n*   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. This occurs when a molecule has at least two chiral centers, and the configuration differs at one or more, but not all, of these centers. In peptide synthesis, racemization (or, more precisely, epimerization) of one amino acid's alpha-carbon can lead to the formation of a diastereomer. For example, coupling L-Ala to L-Phe could yield the desired L-Ala-L-Phe and the diastereomeric D-Ala-L-Phe.\n    *   Diastereoisomers have different physical properties and are chemically distinct.\n    *   **NMR:** They will have different NMR spectra. It is expected that corresponding protons, like the alpha-proton of the epimerized residue, will have slightly different chemical shifts in the two diastereomers. This perfectly explains the two observed alpha-proton peaks.\n    *   **LC:** Their different physical properties allow them to be separated by standard chromatographic techniques. This explains the two peaks in the LC trace.\n    *   **MS:** As isomers, they have the same chemical formula and thus the same molecular weight. This explains why both LC peaks give the identical, correct mass spectrum.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe observation of two sets of signals in the NMR, two separable peaks in the LC, and an identical mass for both species is the classic signature of a diastereomeric mixture. This is a common issue in peptide synthesis where one of the chiral centers epimerizes during a coupling or deprotection step.\n\n<<<D>>>"
