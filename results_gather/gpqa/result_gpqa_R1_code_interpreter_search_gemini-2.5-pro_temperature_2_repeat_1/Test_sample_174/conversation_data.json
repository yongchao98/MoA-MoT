    "An oscillating spheroid-shaped charge distribution can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole, especially if its size is much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation. The axis of symmetry being the z-axis implies the dipole oscillates along this axis.\n\n### 1. Angular Distribution of Radiated Power\n\nFor an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) in the radiation zone is given by:\n\n`dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)`\n\nwhere `C` is a constant that depends on the amplitude and frequency of the oscillation, and `θ` is the angle with respect to the z-axis.\n\nThe radiated power is maximum when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n\nThe problem states that the maximum power thus radiated is `A`. So, we have:\n\n`A = C * sin²(90°) = C * 1 = C`\n\nTherefore, the power radiated at any angle `θ` can be expressed as:\n\n`dP/dΩ = A * sin²(θ)`\n\nWe need to find the fraction of `A` that is radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. This fraction is:\n\n`Fraction = (dP/dΩ at 30°) / A = (A * sin²(30°)) / A = sin²(30°)`\n\nWe know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\nSo, the fraction is `(1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\nThis result eliminates options A and B.\n\nTo be certain of the calculation, we can use a small Python script.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Angle in degrees\ntheta_deg = 30\n\n# Convert angle to radians\ntheta_rad = np.deg2rad(theta_deg)\n\n# Calculate sin^2(theta)\nfraction = np.sin(theta_rad)**2\n\nprint(f\"The value of sin^2({theta_deg} degrees) is: {fraction}\")\n```\n>>>\nThe value of sin^2(30 degrees) is: 0.25000000000000006\n>>>\nThe code confirms that the fraction is indeed 0.25, which is 1/4.\n\n### 2. Wavelength Dependence\n\nThe function `f(λ, θ)` represents the radiated power per unit solid angle. According to the Larmor formula for an accelerating charge, the total radiated power is proportional to the square of the acceleration. For an oscillating charge with frequency `ω`, the position `x(t) ∝ cos(ωt)`, the velocity `v(t) ∝ ωsin(ωt)`, and the acceleration `a(t) ∝ ω²cos(ωt)`.\n\nThe radiated power is proportional to the square of the time-varying dipole moment's second derivative, which means the power is proportional to `ω⁴`.\n\n`dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴`\n\nThe angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by the formula `ω = 2πc/λ`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n\nSubstituting this into the proportionality for power:\n\n`dP/dΩ ∝ (2πc/λ)⁴ ∝ 1/λ⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n\nSo, a possible form for the function `f(λ, θ)` includes a wavelength dependence of `λ⁻⁴`. This phenomenon is also the basis for Rayleigh scattering, which explains why the sky is blue (shorter, blue wavelengths are scattered more strongly).\n\nThis result points to `λ⁻⁴` as the correct wavelength dependence, which narrows the choice to option C.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- The fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at an angle `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n- A possible form for the wavelength dependence of the radiated power function `f` is **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nCombining these two findings, we arrive at option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
