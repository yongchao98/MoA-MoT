    "*   **1. Identify the given information:**\n    *   The components of the quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ are given in terms of Pauli matrices $\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$:\n        $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x$\n        $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\n        $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z$\n        This is the spin angular momentum operator $\\vec{S}$ for a spin-1/2 particle like a muon.\n    *   The direction vector $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane. An arbitrary unit vector in the x-z plane can be parametrized by the angle $\\theta$ it makes with the z-axis. In Cartesian coordinates, $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n    *   We are looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$.\n\n*   **2. Construct the operator along the direction $\\vec{n}$:**\n    The operator along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n    $P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n    Substituting the components of $\\vec{P}$ and $\\vec{n}$:\n    $P_n = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_y (0) + P_z \\cos\\theta$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta$\n    Now, substitute the matrix forms of $\\sigma_x$ and $\\sigma_z$:\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right)$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   **3. Set up the eigenvalue equation:**\n    Let the eigenvector be $v = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalue equation is $P_n v = \\lambda v$.\n    We are given $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$.\n    So, the equation becomes:\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   **4. Solve the eigenvalue equation:**\n    We can cancel the factor $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ from both sides:\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    This matrix equation represents a system of two linear equations:\n    1) $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n    2) $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\n    Let's solve the first equation for the ratio of $b$ to $a$:\n    $b \\sin\\theta = a (1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    Now, we use the trigonometric half-angle identities:\n    $\\sin\\theta = 2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)$\n    $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n    Substituting these into the equation:\n    $b \\cdot (2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)) = a \\cdot (2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2))$\n    Assuming $\\theta$ is not 0 or $2\\pi$ (so that $\\sin(\\theta/2) \\neq 0$), we can divide both sides by $2 \\sin(\\theta/2)$:\n    $b \\cos(\\theta/2) = a \\sin(\\theta/2)$\n    This can be rearranged to $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$.\n    This tells us that the components $a$ and $b$ are proportional to $\\cos(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin(\\theta/2)$ respectively. So, the eigenvector has the form:\n    $v = k \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$ for some normalization constant $k$.\n    (We can verify that this also satisfies the second equation: $a \\sin\\theta = b (1+\\cos\\theta) \\implies k\\cos(\\theta/2) (2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)) = k\\sin(\\theta/2) (2\\cos^2(\\theta/2))$, which is true).\n\n*   **5. Normalize the eigenvector:**\n    The eigenvector must be normalized, which means its norm (length) must be 1. For a vector $\\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$, the squared norm is $|a|^2 + |b|^2$.\n    $|k \\cos(\\theta/2)|^2 + |k \\sin(\\theta/2)|^2 = 1$\n    $|k|^2 (\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2)) = 1$\n    Using the fundamental trigonometric identity $\\cos^2(x) + \\sin^2(x) = 1$:\n    $|k|^2 (1) = 1 \\implies |k| = 1$\n    By convention, we choose the simplest phase, $k=1$.\n    Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is:\n    $v = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   **6. Final Answer:**\n    The elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
