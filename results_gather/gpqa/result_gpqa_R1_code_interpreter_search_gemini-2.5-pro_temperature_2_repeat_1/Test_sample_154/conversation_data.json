    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the uncertainty in the measurement of the operator $P_z$, denoted as $\\Delta P_z$, for a system in a given quantum state.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Uncertainty:** The uncertainty $\\Delta A$ of an operator $A$ in a state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is given by the standard deviation formula:\n    $(\\Delta A)^2 = \\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2$\n    where $\\langle A \\rangle$ is the expectation value of $A$, calculated as $\\langle \\psi | A | \\psi \\rangle$.\n    Therefore, for our problem, the formula is:\n    $(\\Delta P_z)^2 = \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2$\n\n3.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The state of the system is given by the column vector:\n        $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   The matrix representation of the operator $P_z$ is:\n        $P_z = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Step 1: Calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$.**\n    First, we need to find the bra vector $\\langle\\psi|$, which is the conjugate transpose of the ket vector $|\\psi\\rangle$. Since all components of $|\\psi\\rangle$ are real, it's just the transpose:\n    $\\langle\\psi| = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    Next, we calculate the action of $P_z$ on $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n    $P_z |\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} (1)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (0)(-1/2) \\\\ (0)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (0)(-1/2) \\\\ (0)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (-1)(-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    Now, we compute the inner product $\\langle\\psi | (P_z |\\psi\\rangle)$:\n    $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi | P_z |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left[ (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(1/2) \\right] = \\hbar \\left[ \\frac{1}{4} + 0 - \\frac{1}{4} \\right] = 0$\n\n5.  **Step 2: Calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$.**\n    First, we need the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$:\n    $P_z^2 = \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1\\times1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0\\times0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & (-1)\\times(-1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    Next, we calculate the action of $P_z^2$ on $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n    $P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} (1)(-1/2) \\\\ (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) \\\\ (1)(-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    Now, we compute the inner product $\\langle\\psi | (P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle)$:\n    $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi | P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left[ (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-1/2) \\right] = \\hbar^2 \\left[ \\frac{1}{4} + 0 + \\frac{1}{4} \\right] = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\n6.  **Step 3: Calculate the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$.**\n    Using the formula from step 2:\n    $(\\Delta P_z)^2 = \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\n    Take the square root to find the uncertainty:\n    $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\nComparing the result with the given options:\nA) $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$\nB) $\\hbar/2$\nC) $\\sqrt{2}\\hbar$\nD) $\\hbar$\n\nOur calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
