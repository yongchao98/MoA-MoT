    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Process and Selection Rules**\n\nThe problem describes a two-step photon emission process, where a hydrogen atom in the $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ state decays to the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition. The selection rules for an E1 transition from a state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ are:\n*   Change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number: $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$\n*   Change in the magnetic quantum number: $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   The principal quantum number $n$ must change ($\\Delta n \\neq 0$), and for decay (emission), energy must decrease, so $n' < n$.\n\n**2. Analyze the First Transition**\n\n*   **Initial state:** $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$. Here, $n_i=3, l_i=0, m_i=0$.\n*   **Intermediate state:** Let this be $|int\\rangle = |n_{int}, l_{int}, m_{int}\\rangle$.\n\nApplying the selection rules for the first transition:\n*   $\\Delta l = l_{int} - l_i = l_{int} - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ must be non-negative, we have $l_{int} = 1$.\n*   $\\Delta n = n_{int} - n_i < 0 \\implies n_{int} < 3$. Since $l_{int}=1$, we must have $n_{int} \\geq 2$. So, the only possibility is $n_{int} = 2$.\n*   $\\Delta m = m_{int} - m_i = m_{int} - 0 = m_{int} = 0, \\pm 1$. So, $m_{int}$ can be $-1, 0, \\text{ or } 1$.\n\nTherefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. All options correctly identify one of these as part of a potential route.\n\n**3. Analyze the Second Transition**\n\n*   **Intermediate state:** $|int\\rangle = |2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$.\n*   **Final state:** $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$. Here, $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n\nApplying the selection rules for the second transition from any of the possible intermediate states:\n*   $\\Delta l = l_f - l_{int} = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies $\\Delta l=\\pm 1$.\n*   $\\Delta m = m_f - m_{int} = 0 - m_{int} = -m_{int}$. For this to be allowed, we need $-m_{int}$ to be in $\\{0, \\pm 1\\}$, which is true for all possible $m_{int} \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$.\n*   $\\Delta n = n_f - n_{int} = 1-2 = -1$. This is an allowed decay.\n\nThus, all three decay routes are possible:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**4. Calculate the Transition Probabilities (Branching Ratios)**\n\nThe probability of a particular decay path is the product of the branching ratios at each step.\n\n*   **Branching Ratio for the first step ($B_1$)**:\n    The initial state is $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (a $3s$ orbital), which is spherically symmetric. When an atom in a spherically symmetric state decays, the emission is isotropic (the same in all directions). This means there is no preferred orientation for the final state's angular momentum. As a result, the atom has an equal probability of landing in any of the available magnetic substates of the intermediate level. Since there are three possible intermediate states ($m_{int}=-1,0,1$), the probability of transitioning to any specific one is the same.\n    $B_1 = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m_{int}\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$ for each of $m_{int} \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$.\n    (This can be formally shown using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, where the transition rate is proportional to the square of a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle l_i, m_i; 1, q | l_f, m_f \\rangle^2$. For the transition from $l=0$ to $l=1$, this coefficient's squared value is independent of the final $m_f$.)\n\n*   **Branching Ratio for the second step ($B_2$)**:\n    The atom is now in an intermediate state $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$ (a $2p$ orbital). We need to find the probability that it will decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Let's consider what other decay channels are available from the $2p$ state. According to the dipole selection rules, the atom can only decay to a state with $l=0$ or $l=2$. For energy to be released, the principal quantum number $n$ must decrease ($n<2$). The only available state that meets these criteria is the $n=1, l=0$ state (the $1s$ ground state, $|1,0,0\\rangle$). There is no $n=1, l=2$ state.\n    Therefore, the decay from any $|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle$ state *must* proceed to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. There are no other competing E1 decay channels.\n    Thus, the branching ratio for the second step is 1.\n    $B_2 = P(|2,1,m_{int}\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\n*   **Total Probability**:\n    The total probability for any of the three complete decay routes is the product of the branching ratios:\n    $P_{route} = B_1 \\times B_2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**5. Compare with Options**\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect (should be $\\frac{1}{3}$).\n*   B) Typo in the question, but assuming the route is $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$, the probability of $\\frac{2}{3}$ is incorrect.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect (should be $\\frac{1}{3}$).\n\nThe only option that presents a valid route with its correct corresponding probability is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
