    "The user wants to compute the area of a surface defined by the metric:\n$ds^{2}=\\frac{32}{\\left(4-x^{2}-y^{2}\\right)}\\left(dx^{2}+dy^{2}\\right)$\n\nThe term \"pseudosphere of radius r=2\" indicates that the domain of definition for this metric is the open disk $D$ in the $xy$-plane defined by $x^2+y^2 < 4$.\n\n**1. Identify the metric tensor and the area element.**\n\nThe line element is of the form $ds^2 = g_{xx}dx^2 + 2g_{xy}dxdy + g_{yy}dy^2$.\nBy comparing with the given metric, we can identify the components of the metric tensor $g_{ij}$:\n$g_{xx} = \\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}$\n$g_{yy} = \\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}$\n$g_{xy} = g_{yx} = 0$\n\nThe metric tensor in matrix form is:\n$g_{ij} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\n\\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe area element $dA$ on the surface is given by the formula $dA = \\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})} \\, dx \\, dy$.\nFirst, we compute the determinant of the metric tensor:\n$\\det(g_{ij}) = g_{xx}g_{yy} - g_{xy}^2 = \\left(\\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\\right) - 0^2 = \\left(\\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\\right)^2$\n\nNow, we take the square root to find the area element's scaling factor:\n$\\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\\right)^2} = \\left|\\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\\right|$\n\nSince the domain of integration is the disk $x^2 + y^2 < 4$, the denominator $4 - x^2 - y^2$ is always positive. Therefore, the absolute value is not needed.\n$\\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})} = \\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}$\n\nThe area element is:\n$dA = \\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \\, dx \\, dy$\n\n**2. Set up the area integral.**\n\nThe total area $A$ is the integral of the area element $dA$ over the entire domain $D = \\{(x,y) | x^2+y^2 < 4\\}$.\n$A = \\iint_{D} \\frac{32}{4 - (x^2 + y^2)} \\, dx \\, dy$\n\n**3. Evaluate the integral.**\n\nThe integrand and the domain have circular symmetry, so it is convenient to switch to polar coordinates. Let:\n$x = r \\cos \\theta$\n$y = r \\sin \\theta$\nThis implies $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$. The Jacobian of this transformation gives the differential area element $dx \\, dy = r \\, dr \\, d\\theta$.\n\nThe domain in polar coordinates is $0 \\le \\theta \\le 2\\pi$ and $0 \\le r < 2$. The integral becomes:\n$A = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32}{4 - r^2} \\cdot r \\, dr \\, d\\theta$\n\nFirst, we can integrate with respect to $\\theta$, as the integrand does not depend on it:\n$A = 2\\pi \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \\, dr$\n\nThe remaining integral with respect to $r$ is an improper integral because the denominator approaches zero as $r$ approaches the upper limit of integration, 2. We need to evaluate it using a limit:\n$A = 2\\pi \\lim_{R \\to 2^{-}} \\int_{0}^{R} \\frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \\, dr$\n\nTo solve the integral, we use the substitution $u = 4 - r^2$.\nThen, $du = -2r \\, dr$, which means $r \\, dr = -\\frac{1}{2} \\, du$.\nThe limits of integration for $u$ are:\nWhen $r = 0$, $u = 4 - 0^2 = 4$.\nWhen $r = R$, $u = 4 - R^2$.\n\nThe integral in terms of $u$ is:\n$\\int_{4}^{4-R^2} \\frac{32}{u} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} \\, du\\right) = -16 \\int_{4}^{4-R^2} \\frac{1}{u} \\, du$\n\nFlipping the integration limits cancels the negative sign:\n$= 16 \\int_{4-R^2}^{4} \\frac{1}{u} \\, du = 16 \\left[ \\ln|u| \\right]_{4-R^2}^{4}$\n$= 16 (\\ln(4) - \\ln(4 - R^2))$\n\nNow, we substitute this back into the expression for the area and take the limit as $R \\to 2^{-}$:\n$A = 2\\pi \\lim_{R \\to 2^{-}} \\left[ 16 (\\ln(4) - \\ln(4 - R^2)) \\right]$\n$A = 32\\pi \\lim_{R \\to 2^{-}} (\\ln(4) - \\ln(4 - R^2))$\n\nAs $R \\to 2^{-}$, the term $R^2 \\to 4^{-}$, so $4 - R^2 \\to 0^{+}$.\nThe natural logarithm $\\ln(x)$ approaches $-\\infty$ as $x \\to 0^{+}$.\nTherefore:\n$\\lim_{R \\to 2^{-}} \\ln(4 - R^2) = -\\infty$\n\nSubstituting this into the limit for the area:\n$A = 32\\pi (\\ln(4) - (-\\infty)) = 32\\pi (+\\infty) = +\\infty$\n\nThe area of the given surface is infinite.\n\nWe can also verify this by a quick analysis of the integrand's behavior near the singularity. As $r \\to 2$, let $r=2-\\epsilon$. The integrand $\\frac{32r}{4-r^2} = \\frac{32r}{(2-r)(2+r)}$ behaves like $\\frac{32 \\cdot 2}{\\epsilon \\cdot 4} = \\frac{16}{\\epsilon}$. The integral $\\int \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} d\\epsilon$ is logarithmic and diverges as $\\epsilon \\to 0$. Thus, the area integral diverges to infinity.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) $4\\pi\\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\\right)$ - This is an expression, not a numerical value for the area.\nB) $4\\pi\\left(x^{2}-y^{2}\\right)$ - This is an expression, not a numerical value for the area.\nC) $+\\infty$ - This matches our result.\nD) 0 - This is incorrect, as the integrand is strictly positive over the domain.\n\nThus, the area is infinite.\n\n<<<C>>>"
