    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is a Michael addition. The strong, sterically hindered base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), will form an enolate from the ketone, which then acts as a nucleophile in a conjugate addition to the α,β-unsaturated ester, ethyl acrylate.\n\n2.  **Identify the site of enolate formation:** The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. We need to find the acidic α-protons (protons on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n    *   The ketone has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2** is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no α-protons**.\n    *   **C6** is substituted with a methyl group and a hydrogen atom. It is a tertiary carbon and has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Since there is only one possible proton to remove, the base `t-BuOK` will deprotonate C6 to form a single regiochemical enolate.\n\n3.  **Determine the product structure:** The enolate formed at C6 will attack the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (`CH2=CH-COOEt`). This results in a new C-C bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the terminal `CH2` of the acrylate moiety. After workup (protonation), the product will have an `-CH2CH2COOEt` group attached to C6.\n\n    The connectivity of the product is as follows:\n    *   A cyclohexanone ring with C=O at position 1.\n    *   An ethyl and a methyl group at position 2.\n    *   A methyl group and an ethyl propanoate group (`-CH2CH2COOEt`) at position 6.\n\n4.  **Name the product (Product A):** The options provide names in the format `ethyl 3-(...cyclohexyl)propanoate`, where the cyclohexyl ring is treated as a substituent on the propanoate chain.\n    *   We need to number the cyclohexyl ring substituent. The point of attachment to the propanoate chain is designated C1. Numbering of the ring then proceeds to give the principal functional group on the ring (the `oxo` group) the lowest possible number.\n    *   The attachment point (C1) is the original C6 of the ketone.\n    *   Numbering C1 → C2 makes the original ketone carbonyl (C1 of the ketone) the C2 of the substituent name (i.e., `2-oxo`).\n    *   Following this numbering:\n        *   The methyl group on the original C6 is now on C1 of the substituent name.\n        *   The `oxo` group is at C2.\n        *   The ethyl and methyl groups on the original C2 are now on C3 of the substituent name.\n    *   Therefore, the full name is: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O)**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is also a Michael addition. The α-protons of nitroalkanes are quite acidic (pKa ≈ 10), so the base KOH will deprotonate the carbon adjacent to the nitro group.\n2.  **Identify the nucleophile:** KOH deprotonates C1 of 1-nitropropane (`CH3CH2CH2NO2`) to form the nucleophilic nitronate anion, `CH3CH2CH⁻NO2`.\n3.  **Identify the Michael acceptor:** The acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile, which has the structure `CH3-CH=CH-CN`. The nucleophile attacks the β-carbon (the `CH` group bearing the methyl substituent).\n4.  **Determine the product structure:** A new C-C bond forms between C1 of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n    *   The carbon backbone of the product is `(NC-CH2-CH(CH3)) - (CH(NO2)-CH2-CH3)`.\n    *   Let's write this as a single chain: `NC-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(NO2)-CH2-CH3`.\n\n5.  **Name the product (Product B):** We apply IUPAC rules.\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (`-CN`), so the parent chain is a **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   We number the chain starting from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   `NC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(3)(CH3)-CH(4)(NO2)-CH2(5)-CH3(6)`.\n    *   The substituents are a **methyl** group at C3 and a **nitro** group at C4.\n    *   The full name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A** is `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n*   **Product B** is `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`.\n\nMatching these products with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A, Incorrect B)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Correct A, Incorrect B)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (**Correct A, Correct B**)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A, Correct B)\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
