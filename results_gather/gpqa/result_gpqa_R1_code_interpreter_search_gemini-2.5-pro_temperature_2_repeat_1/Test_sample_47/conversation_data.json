    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and count its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine -> Product 1**\nThis reaction is the acid-catalyzed α-halogenation of a ketone. Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine (Br2) to form 2-bromocyclohexanone. The bromine atom is attached to the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n*   **Product 1: 2-bromocyclohexanone**\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 + NaOH (heat) -> Product 2**\nProduct 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) is an α-halo ketone. When treated with a strong base like sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and heated, it can undergo two possible reactions: an elimination reaction or a Favorskii rearrangement.\n*   **Possibility A (Elimination):** This would form cyclohex-2-en-1-one.\n*   **Possibility B (Favorskii Rearrangement):** This reaction involves the formation of a bicyclic intermediate, which then opens to form a ring-contracted carboxylic acid. In this case, the six-membered ring of cyclohexanone would contract to a five-membered ring, yielding cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (after neutralization).\n\nTo decide between these two possibilities, we must look at the subsequent steps. The choice of reagents in the later steps strongly suggests a specific pathway.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 + SOCl2, pyridine -> Product 3**\nThionyl chloride (SOCl2) with pyridine is a standard reagent combination for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride.\n*   If Product 2 were cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (from the Favorskii rearrangement), it would be converted into **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**. This is a very standard, high-yielding reaction.\n*   If Product 2 were cyclohex-2-en-1-one, it could react via its enol form to produce a chloro-diene, but the reaction path with a carboxylic acid is more definitive.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride -> Product 4**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)3) is a mild and sterically hindered reducing agent. Its most common and specific use in organic chemistry is the partial reduction of acid chlorides to aldehydes. It does not typically reduce the resulting aldehyde further to an alcohol.\n*   If Product 3 were cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride, treating it with LiAlH(OtBu)3 would selectively reduce it to **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\nThis reaction sequence (Favorskii rearrangement -> acid chloride formation -> selective reduction to aldehyde) is a classic and logical series of transformations. The high specificity of the reagent in Step 4 makes this pathway far more plausible than the alternative elimination route, which would involve a difficult reduction of a vinyl chloride in the final step.\n\nTherefore, the final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\nNow we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. Chemical distinctness is determined by the molecule's symmetry. Equivalent hydrogens are interchangeable by a symmetry operation (like rotation or reflection) or by rapid conformational changes.\n\nThe structure is a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\n1.  **The Aldehyde Proton:** The single hydrogen atom attached to the carbonyl carbon (`-CHO`) is in a unique chemical environment. This is **1** distinct type of hydrogen.\n2.  **The Alpha-Proton:** The single hydrogen atom on the ring carbon to which the aldehyde group is attached (C1) is also in a unique environment. This is **1** distinct type of hydrogen.\n3.  **Ring Protons:** The cyclopentane ring has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group, the C1 carbon, and the H atom on C1. This plane bisects the rest of the ring.\n    *   This symmetry makes the two carbons adjacent to C1 (let's call them C2 and C5) chemically equivalent to each other.\n    *   It also makes the next pair of carbons (C3 and C4) chemically equivalent to each other.\n4.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** Each of these carbons has two hydrogen atoms. Because C2 (and C5) is adjacent to a chiral center (C1), these two hydrogens are diastereotopic. This means they are not chemically equivalent. So, there is one type of hydrogen \"cis\" to the aldehyde group on C2/C5, and another type of hydrogen \"trans\" to the aldehyde group on C2/C5. This gives **2** more distinct types of hydrogen.\n5.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, the two hydrogens on C3 are diastereotopic, as are the two on C4. By symmetry, the \"cis\" hydrogens on C3 and C4 are equivalent to each other, and the \"trans\" hydrogens on C3 and C4 are equivalent to each other. This gives another **2** distinct types of hydrogen.\n\n**Summary of Distinct Hydrogen Atoms:**\n*   Type 1: Aldehyde proton (1H)\n*   Type 2: Alpha-proton on C1 (1H)\n*   Type 3: \"cis\" protons on C2 and C5 (2H total)\n*   Type 4: \"trans\" protons on C2 and C5 (2H total)\n*   Type 5: \"cis\" protons on C3 and C4 (2H total)\n*   Type 6: \"trans\" protons on C3 and C4 (2H total)\n\nTotal number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6**."
