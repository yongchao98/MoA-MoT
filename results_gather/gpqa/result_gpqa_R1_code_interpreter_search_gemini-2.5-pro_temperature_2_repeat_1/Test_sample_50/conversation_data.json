    "This problem can be solved using the method of images, which is a powerful technique in electrostatics for problems involving conductors.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the System and Goal:** The system consists of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. The charge `q` is at a distance `d` from the sphere's center (`d > R`). The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is held at a constant value, V = 0. We need to find the total potential energy `U` of this configuration.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:** The electric field outside the conducting sphere is identical to the field that would be created by the original charge `q` and an \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific point `b` inside the sphere (while removing the sphere itself). The values of `q'` and `b` are chosen such that the potential on the spherical surface where the conductor used to be is zero.\n\n    *   For a point charge `q` at distance `d` from the center of a grounded sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its position `b` are given by:\n        *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q (R/d)`\n        *   Image charge position: `b = R^2/d` (measured from the center, along the same line as `q`).\n\n    This image system (`q` at `d` and `q'` at `b`) perfectly replicates the electric field outside `r=R` and guarantees that the potential at `r=R` is zero.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:** The potential energy `U` of the system is the work done to assemble it. A general formula for the potential energy of a system of charges and conductors is `U = (1/2) Σ_i q_i V_i`, where `V_i` is the potential at the location of charge `q_i` due to all other charges in the system.\n\n    *   Our system consists of the point charge `q` and the conducting sphere. So the energy can be written as the sum of the energy associated with the point charge and the energy associated with the charge distribution on the sphere:\n        `U = (1/2) q V_at_q + (1/2) ∫ V_sphere σ dA`\n\n    *   The second term represents the energy of the induced charges `σ` on the sphere's surface. Since the sphere is grounded, its potential `V_sphere` is 0 everywhere on its surface. Therefore, the second term `(1/2) ∫ (0) σ dA = 0`.\n\n    *   This leaves us with `U = (1/2) q V_at_q`. Here, `V_at_q` is the potential at the location of `q` created by all *other* charges, which are the induced charges on the sphere.\n\n    *   According to the method of images, the potential created by the induced charges on the sphere is equivalent to the potential created by the single image charge `q'`.\n\n    *   So, we need to calculate the potential at position `d` (where `q` is located) due to the image charge `q'` at position `b`. The distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b`.\n        `V_at_q = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\n    *   Now, substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n        `V_at_q = k * [-q(R/d)] / [d - (R^2/d)]`\n\n    *   Simplify the denominator:\n        `d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\n    *   Substitute this back into the expression for `V_at_q`:\n        `V_at_q = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2)/d]`\n\n    *   Cancel the `d` from the numerator's and denominator's fractions:\n        `V_at_q = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    *   Finally, substitute this potential back into the formula for the total energy `U`:\n        `U = (1/2) q V_at_q`\n        `U = (1/2) q * [- k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n4.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. This matches option A. The negative sign indicates that the force between the charge and the grounded sphere is attractive, and thus the potential energy is lower than the zero-energy state at infinite separation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
