    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the given information from the 1H NMR spectrum:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the possible compounds:**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetric. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they appear as a single **singlet**. Integration: 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups (at C1, C2, C4, C5) are all chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a single **singlet**. Integration: 12H (4 x 3H).\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has lower symmetry. A proper analysis shows the following equivalences:\n        *   Protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent.\n        *   Methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent.\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique.\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two equivalent protons (H4, H6) will give one **singlet**. Integration: 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups. This will result in three **singlets**.\n        *   Singlet 1: C1-CH3 and C3-CH3 (equivalent). Integration: 6H.\n        *   Singlet 2: C2-CH3 (unique). Integration: 3H.\n        *   Singlet 3: C5-CH3 (unique). Integration: 3H.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 alkyl singlets (6H, 3H, 3H, in a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They are adjacent, but equivalent protons do not split each other, so they appear as a single **singlet**. Integration: 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   Methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. This gives one **singlet**. Integration: 6H.\n        *   Methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent. This gives another **singlet**. Integration: 6H.\n    *   **Spectrum Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H, 6H, in a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C6H4(C2H5)2 = C10H14. It matches.\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are equivalent, giving one **singlet** (4H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** This compound has ethyl groups. Ethyl groups show a characteristic quartet (for the CH2) and triplet (for the CH3) pattern due to spin-spin splitting. They do not produce singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the experimental spectrum only shows singlets in the alkyl region, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**. This rules out option A.\n\n**3. Analyze the mixture based on the predictions:**\n\nWe have a 1:1 mixture. This means we add the spectra of two compounds.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The spectrum has two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   Each of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers produces one aromatic singlet of integration 2H.\n    *   A 1:1 mixture of any two of these isomers will produce two aromatic singlets (assuming their chemical shifts are different, which is expected), each corresponding to 2H. The ratio will be 2H:2H = 1:1.\n    *   Therefore, the aromatic region data is consistent with a mixture of any two of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region:** The spectrum has three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n    *   The total number of alkyl protons in a 1:1 mixture is 12H (from compound 1) + 12H (from compound 2) = 24H.\n    *   A 2:1:1 ratio means the total integration (2+1+1=4 parts) is divided into signals with relative sizes of 2/4, 1/4, and 1/4.\n    *   Absolute integrations: (2/4)*24H = **12H**, (1/4)*24H = **6H**, (1/4)*24H = **6H**.\n    *   So, we are looking for a pair of compounds whose alkyl singlets combine to give exactly three signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n**4. Test the remaining options:**\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,3,4-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB gives: two 6H singlets.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB gives: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined signals: Three 6H singlets and two 3H singlets. This would result in at least 4 signals (if one 6H signal overlaps), which does not match the observed 3 signals.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,4-TMB**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB gives: one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB gives: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Combined signals: one 12H singlet, and two 6H singlets.\n    *   This gives a total of **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   This combination perfectly matches all the data from the spectrum without requiring any further assumptions.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB gives: one 12H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB gives: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined signals: one 12H, one 6H, and two 3H singlets. This is four signals. To get three signals with the correct 12H, 6H, 6H integrations, the two 3H signals must accidentally have the exact same chemical shift (accidental isochrony) to appear as one 6H signal. While possible, the combination in option C explains the data directly and is therefore the much more likely answer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only one that directly accounts for the observed 1H NMR spectrum, which shows two 1:1 aromatic singlets and three 2:1:1 alkyl singlets.\n\n<<<C>>>"
