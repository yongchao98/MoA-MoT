    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   Let the laboratory be the stationary frame, which we'll call `S`.\n    *   Let the moving glass be the moving frame, which we'll call `S'`.\n\n2.  **Define the Velocities:**\n    *   The velocity of the moving frame `S'` (the glass) relative to the stationary frame `S` (the lab) is `v`.\n    *   The velocity of the light beam relative to the moving frame `S'` (i.e., its speed *within* the glass) is `u'`. The speed of light in a medium with refractive index `n` is given by `c/n`. Since the problem states `c=1`, the speed of light in the glass is `u' = 1/n`.\n    *   We need to find the velocity of the light beam relative to the stationary frame `S` (the lab). Let's call this `u`.\n\n3.  **Choose the Correct Physical Law:**\n    Since the velocities can be comparable to the speed of light, we must use the relativistic velocity addition formula, not the classical Galilean one. The formula for velocities in the same direction is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'v / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the Known Values:**\n    We substitute the values from step 2 into the formula:\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    This gives us:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n) * v / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    *   `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n    *   To clear the fractions in the numerator and denominator, we can multiply both by `n`:\n    *   `u = [ n * (1/n + v) ] / [ n * (1 + v/n) ]`\n    *   Distribute `n` in both the numerator and the denominator:\n    *   `u = ( n/n + n*v ) / ( n*1 + n*v/n )`\n    *   `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated speed `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)` matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
