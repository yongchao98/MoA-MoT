    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Normalize the Initial State**\n\nThe state of the electron, `|alpha>`, is given as being proportional to `(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>`.\nLet's denote the unnormalized state as `|psi> = (1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>`.\n\nTo find the normalized state `|alpha>`, we must ensure that the inner product `<alpha|alpha>` is equal to 1.\nThe state `|alpha>` can be written as `|alpha> = C * |psi>`, where C is the normalization constant.\nThe squared norm of `|psi>` is:\n`<psi|psi> = <((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)|((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)>`\n`<psi|psi> = (1-i)(1+i)<up|up> + (2+i)(2-i)<down|down>` (since `<up|down> = 0` and `<c*v| = c_conjugate*<v|`)\n`<psi|psi> = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2`\n`<psi|psi> = (1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 2 + 5 = 7`\n\nThe normalization constant C is `1/sqrt(<psi|psi>)`, so `C = 1/sqrt(7)`.\nTherefore, the normalized state is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>]`\n\nIn the `|up>, |down>` basis, where `|up> = [1, 0]^T` and `|down> = [0, 1]^T`, the state vector is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [1+i, 2-i]^T`\n\n### **2. Define the Operator A and Find its Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**\n\nThe problem defines the operator `A` by its matrix elements: `Aij = hbar/2` if `i != j`, and `Aij = 0` otherwise. In the 2x2 basis of `(|up>, |down>)`, this corresponds to:\n`A = [[A11, A12], [A21, A22]] = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\nThis operator is proportional to the Pauli-X matrix, `sigma_x`.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (`lambda`), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - lambda*I) = 0`:\n`det([[ -lambda, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -lambda]]) = 0`\n`(-lambda)(-lambda) - (hbar/2)(hbar/2) = 0`\n`lambda^2 - (hbar/2)^2 = 0`\n`lambda^2 = (hbar/2)^2`\nSo, the eigenvalues are `lambda_1 = +hbar/2` and `lambda_2 = -hbar/2`.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding eigenvectors:\n*   For `lambda_1 = +hbar/2`:\n    `(A - lambda_1*I) |v1> = 0`\n    `[[-hbar/2, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -hbar/2]] * [x, y]^T = [0, 0]^T`\n    This gives the equation `-(hbar/2)x + (hbar/2)y = 0`, which simplifies to `x = y`.\n    The normalized eigenvector is `|v1> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 1]^T = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> + |down>)`.\n\n*   For `lambda_2 = -hbar/2`:\n    `(A - lambda_2*I) |v2> = 0`\n    `[[hbar/2, hbar/2], [hbar/2, hbar/2]] * [x, y]^T = [0, 0]^T`\n    This gives the equation `(hbar/2)x + (hbar/2)y = 0`, which simplifies to `x = -y`.\n    The normalized eigenvector is `|v2> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, -1]^T = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> - |down>)`.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Measurement Probabilities**\n\nThe probability of measuring an eigenvalue `lambda_i` is given by the square of the magnitude of the projection of the state `|alpha>` onto the corresponding eigenvector `|vi>`, i.e., `P(lambda_i) = |<vi|alpha>|^2`.\n\n*   **Probability of measuring `lambda_1 = +hbar/2`:**\n    `P(+hbar/2) = |<v1|alpha>|^2`\n    `<v1|alpha> = [(1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| + <down|)] * [(1/sqrt(7)) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n    `<v1|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [1*(1+i) + 1*(2-i)]`\n    `<v1|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * (3)`\n    `P(+hbar/2) = |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.6428`\n\n*   **Probability of measuring `lambda_2 = -hbar/2`:**\n    `P(-hbar/2) = |<v2|alpha>|^2`\n    `<v2|alpha> = [(1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| - <down|)] * [(1/sqrt(7)) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n    `<v2|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [1*(1+i) - 1*(2-i)]`\n    `<v2|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * (1+i - 2+i) = (1/sqrt(14)) * (-1 + 2i)`\n    `P(-hbar/2) = |(-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)|^2 = ((-1)^2 + 2^2) / 14 = (1 + 4) / 14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571`\n\nThe probabilities are approximately `0.64` and `0.36`.\n\n### **4. Find the Average (Expectation) Value**\n\nThe average or expectation value of the operator `A`, denoted as `<A>`, can be calculated in two ways:\n\n*   **Method 1: Using eigenvalues and probabilities**\n    `<A> = sum(P_i * lambda_i)`\n    `<A> = P(+hbar/2) * (hbar/2) + P(-hbar/2) * (-hbar/2)`\n    `<A> = (9/14) * (hbar/2) + (5/14) * (-hbar/2)`\n    `<A> = (hbar/28) * (9 - 5) = 4*hbar/28 = hbar/7`\n\n*   **Method 2: Using the definition `<A> = <alpha|A|alpha>`**\n    `A|alpha> = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [1+i, 2-i]^T`\n    `A|alpha> = (hbar / (2*sqrt(7))) * [2-i, 1+i]^T`\n    `<A> = <alpha|A|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [1-i, 2+i] * (hbar / (2*sqrt(7))) * [2-i, 1+i]^T`\n    `<A> = (hbar / 14) * [(1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i)]`\n    `<A> = (hbar / 14) * [(2 - 3i - 1) + (2 + 3i - 1)]`\n    `<A> = (hbar / 14) * [(1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i)] = (hbar/14) * 2 = hbar/7`\n\nBoth methods yield `<A> = hbar/7`.\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\n\nThe probabilities of measuring the two eigenvalues of operator A are approximately `0.64` and `0.36`.\nThe average value of the operator A is `hbar/7`.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) 0.28, 0.72 and hbar / sqrt(7)\nB) 0.61, 0.29 and 2*hbar / sqrt(7)\nC) 0.54, 0.46 and 3*hbar / sqrt(7)\nD) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar / 7\n\nThe calculated values match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
