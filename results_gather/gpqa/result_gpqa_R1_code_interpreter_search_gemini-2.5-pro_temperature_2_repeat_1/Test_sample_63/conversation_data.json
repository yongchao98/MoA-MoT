    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the experimental results to identify the gaseous products and their quantities.**\n\nThe problem states that a mixture of gases is formed and passed through three tubes sequentially. Let's analyze the mass change in each tube to identify the components of the gas mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong dehydrating agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 2 * 1.008 + 16.00 = 18.016 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.016 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. Since the first tube removed all water vapor, any mass change would be due to the absorption of such gases. The problem states the weight of this tube did not change, which means there were no acidic gases in the mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The increase in the tube's mass is due to the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Reaction: 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO\n    *   The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen that was in the gas mixture.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 2 * 16.00 = 32.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is unreactive towards H₂O absorbers, alkaline solutions, and hot copper.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\n**Step 2: Use the Law of Conservation of Mass to determine the molar mass of Gas C.**\n\nThe initial mass of the salts was 7.20 g. This mass must equal the total mass of the gaseous products formed upon heating.\nTotal mass of products = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(Gas C)\n7.20 g = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + Mass(Gas C)\nMass(Gas C) = 7.20 - 3.60 - 0.80 = 2.80 g.\n\nNow, we can calculate the molar mass of Gas C.\nMolar Mass(C) = Mass(C) / Moles(C) = 2.80 g / 0.1 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\nA diatomic gas that is inert under these conditions with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the empirical formula of the combined salts A and B.**\n\nThe decomposition of salts A and B produced H₂O, O₂, and N₂. This means the original salts must contain hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen atoms. Let's calculate the total moles of each element in the initial 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** from 0.2 mol of H₂O → 2 * 0.2 = 0.4 mol H.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** from 0.1 mol of N₂ → 2 * 0.1 = 0.2 mol N.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** from 0.2 mol of H₂O and 0.025 mol of O₂ → (1 * 0.2) + (2 * 0.025) = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O.\n\nThe molar ratio of the elements in the mixture is N : H : O = 0.2 : 0.4 : 0.25.\nTo get integer ratios, we can multiply by 20:\nN : H : O = (0.2 * 20) : (0.4 * 20) : (0.25 * 20) = 4 : 8 : 5.\nThis gives the total elemental composition of one mole of salt A plus one mole of salt B (since they are an equimolar mixture).\n(Formula of A) + (Formula of B) = N₄H₈O₅.\n\n**Step 4: Identify Salts A and B.**\n\nThe salts contain N, H, and O. They are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen-based oxoanions. The H₈ part suggests two ammonium ions, (NH₄⁺)₂, which have the formula N₂H₈.\nSubtracting N₂H₈ from the total formula N₄H₈O₅ leaves N₂O₅ for the anions.\nThe anions must sum to N₂O₅. A logical combination of common nitrogen oxoanions is nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n(NO₃⁻) + (NO₂⁻) = N₂O₅.\n\nThis leads to the conclusion that the salts are:\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)\n\nLet's verify this with the mole calculations.\n```python\n# Molar masses\nM_NH4NO2 = 14.01 * 2 + 1.008 * 4 + 16.00 * 2  # Ammonium nitrite\nM_NH4NO3 = 14.01 * 2 + 1.008 * 4 + 16.00 * 3  # Ammonium nitrate\n\n# Given total mass\ntotal_mass = 7.20\n\n# We assume an equimolar mixture of n moles each.\n# n * M_NH4NO2 + n * M_NH4NO3 = total_mass\n# n * (M_NH4NO2 + M_NH4NO3) = total_mass\n# n = total_mass / (M_NH4NO2 + M_NH4NO3)\nn = total_mass / (M_NH4NO2 + M_NH4NO3)\nprint(f\"Calculated moles of each salt (n): {n:.4f}\")\n```\n<execute_return>\n```text\nCalculated moles of each salt (n): 0.0500\n```\n</execute_return>\nThe calculation shows that we have 0.05 mol of each salt. Now let's check if the decomposition of this mixture yields the correct amount of products.\n\n*   Decomposition of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂:\n    NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n    0.05 mol → 0.05 mol N₂ + 0.1 mol H₂O\n*   Decomposition of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃: At the given temperature and to yield the observed products, the reaction must be:\n    2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n    So, 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ → 0.05 mol N₂ + 0.025 mol O₂ + 0.1 mol H₂O\n\nTotal products:\n*   **N₂:** 0.05 + 0.05 = 0.1 mol (Matches our calculation)\n*   **H₂O:** 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.2 mol (Matches our calculation)\n*   **O₂:** 0.025 mol (Matches our calculation)\n\nThe identified salts and their reaction pathways perfectly match all the experimental data.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9\n\nTotal number of atoms in salts A and B = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem is solved by analyzing the products of the decomposition to identify the composition of the original salts.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe gas mixture from the decomposition was passed through a series of tubes, and the mass changes were recorded.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass increase = Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. The weight did not change, so no acidic gases were produced.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The mass increase is due to the oxygen consumed.\n    *   Reaction: 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO\n    *   Mass increase = Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\n**2. Identification of Gas C and the Original Elements**\n\n*   By the Law of Conservation of Mass, the total mass of the products must equal the initial mass of the salts (7.20 g).\n    *   Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(Gas C) = 7.20 g\n    *   3.60 g + 0.80 g + Mass(Gas C) = 7.20 g\n    *   Mass(Gas C) = 7.20 - 4.40 = 2.80 g.\n*   Now we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\n    *   Molar Mass(C) = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.1 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   A gas that is unreactive under these conditions with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**3. Determination of the Empirical Formula and Identity of the Salts**\n\n*   Since the products are N₂, O₂, and H₂O, the original salts A and B must contain Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O) atoms. Let's find the total moles of each element in the initial mixture.\n    *   Total moles of H = 2 × Moles(H₂O) = 2 × 0.2 = 0.4 mol.\n    *   Total moles of N = 2 × Moles(N₂) = 2 × 0.1 = 0.2 mol.\n    *   Total moles of O = (1 × Moles(H₂O)) + (2 × Moles(O₂)) = 0.2 + (2 × 0.025) = 0.25 mol.\n*   The molar ratio of elements in the combined salts (A+B) is N : H : O = 0.2 : 0.4 : 0.25. To get a simple integer ratio, multiply by 20:\n    *   N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5.\n*   So, the combined formula of one mole of salt A plus one mole of salt B (as they are an equimolar mixture) is N₄H₈O₅.\n*   Given that these are salts formed from N, H, and O, they are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxoanions. The 8 hydrogen atoms strongly suggest the presence of two ammonium ions (2 x NH₄⁺), which account for N₂H₈.\n*   The remaining part, for the anions, is N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = N₂O₅.\n*   Two common anions that sum to N₂O₅ are the nitrite ion (NO₂⁻) and the nitrate ion (NO₃⁻).\n*   Thus, the salts are:\n    *   **Salt A:** Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)\n    *   **Salt B:** Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)\n\n**4. Verification**\nLet's check the decomposition reactions.\n*   NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n*   At 200°C, a relevant decomposition for ammonium nitrate is: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n*   The python code execution confirms that a mixture of 0.05 mol of each salt has a total mass of 7.20 g. Let's check the products from these amounts:\n    *   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂: 0.05 mol N₂ and 0.1 mol H₂O.\n    *   From 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ (using the 2:2:1:4 ratio): 0.05 mol N₂, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.1 mol H₂O.\n    *   **Total products:** 0.1 mol N₂, 0.2 mol H₂O, and 0.025 mol O₂. This perfectly matches our initial calculations.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B combined.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n*   **Total atoms = Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 8 + 9 = 17.**\n\n<<<D>>>"
