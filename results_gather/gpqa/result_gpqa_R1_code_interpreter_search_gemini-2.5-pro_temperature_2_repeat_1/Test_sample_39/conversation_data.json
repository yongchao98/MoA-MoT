    "*   **Analysis of the Context:** The conversation takes place between two synthetic organic chemists. A key task in synthetic chemistry is not just making a new compound but also purifying it from the reaction mixture, which may contain unreacted starting materials, byproducts, and the desired product.\n*   **Meaning of the Phrase:** The phrase \"on top of each other\" is a common piece of laboratory slang. It's a visual metaphor. It evokes an image of two or more things that should be separate but are instead occupying the same space.\n*   **Evaluation of Separation Techniques:** We need to consider which common laboratory technique would lead to this description.\n    *   **Chromatography:** This is the most common method for purifying compounds in an organic chemistry lab. Techniques like Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC) and Column Chromatography separate compounds based on their differential affinity for a stationary phase (like silica gel) and a mobile phase (a solvent or mixture of solvents). This affinity is primarily governed by the **polarity** of the compounds. On a TLC plate, separated compounds appear as distinct spots at different heights. If two compounds have very similar polarities, they will travel at nearly the same rate, and their spots will overlap, appearing visually \"on top of each other.\" Similarly, in column chromatography, they will exit the column at the same time (co-elute), making it impossible to collect them separately. This is a perfect match for the chemist's complaint.\n    *   **Distillation:** This technique separates liquids based on their **boiling points**. While compounds with similar boiling points are difficult to separate, chemists would more likely say \"the boiling points are too close\" or \"they co-distill.\" The phrase \"on top of each other\" doesn't fit as well.\n    *   **Spectroscopy/Analysis:** In an analytical technique like NMR spectroscopy, signals (peaks) from different compounds in a mixture can overlap. A chemist might say the peaks are \"on top of each other.\" However, this is a symptom of an impure sample, and the root cause of the impurity is usually a failed separation. The statement \"my *compounds* are on top of each other\" more directly refers to the physical separation attempt rather than just the resulting analytical data.\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) Non-covalent interactions are the basis for physical properties like polarity and boiling point, but this statement is too general. It doesn't describe the specific practical problem.\n    *   B) Similar polarities directly lead to the problem described in chromatography. If the compounds have similar polarities, they will behave almost identically during chromatographic separation, resulting in them being \"on top of each other.\" This is the most direct and common cause for the chemist's complaint.\n    *   C) Similar boiling points are a problem for distillation, but the phrasing is less common for this issue.\n    *   D) Similar optical rotations relate to a specific property of chiral molecules and are measured by polarimetry. This is an analytical measurement, not a separation technique, and the phrase doesn't fit the context of a failed purification.\n\n**Conclusion:** The phrase \"on top of each other\" most commonly refers to a failed separation by chromatography, which occurs when the compounds have very similar polarities.\n\n<<<B>>>"
