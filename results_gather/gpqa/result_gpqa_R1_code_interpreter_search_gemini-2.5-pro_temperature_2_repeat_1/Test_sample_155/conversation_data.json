    "This problem requires a step-by-step analysis of two stereospecific reactions and the subsequent chromatographic separation of the resulting product mixture.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene, which is achiral.\n    ```\n        Pr      H\n         \\    /\n          C==C\n         /    \\\n        H      Pr   (Pr = propyl, -CH2CH2CH3)\n    ```\n*   **Reagent 1: mCPBA (meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid).** This reagent performs epoxidation, which is a *syn-addition* across the double bond. The oxygen atom adds to both carbons from the same face of the alkene.\n    *   Because the starting alkene is planar, the mCPBA can attack from the \"top\" face or the \"bottom\" face with equal probability.\n    *   Attack from the top and bottom faces of the trans-alkene produces two different stereoisomers of the epoxide, which are enantiomers to each other.\n    *   The products are (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    *   So, the first step produces a **racemic mixture** of epoxides.\n\n*   **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This reagent catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The mechanism involves protonation of the epoxide oxygen, followed by a backside (Sɴ2-type) attack by a water molecule on one of the carbon atoms of the ring. This is an *anti-addition* of the two hydroxyl groups (one from the epoxide oxygen, one from the water molecule).\n    *   The overall reaction (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed opening) results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n    *   A useful stereochemistry rule is: **anti-addition to a trans-alkene yields a meso compound.**\n    *   Let's verify this:\n        *   Opening the (4R,5R)-epoxide by backside attack of water at C4 leads to inversion at C4 (R → S), while C5 remains R. The product is (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Opening the (4S,5S)-epoxide by backside attack of water at C4 leads to inversion at C4 (S → R), while C5 remains S. The product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   The (4R,5S) and (4S,5R) designations describe the exact same molecule. This molecule has two chiral centers but is achiral overall due to a center of inversion, making it a **meso compound**.\n\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single product, the meso compound (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene, which is achiral.\n    ```\n        Pr      Pr\n         \\    /\n          C==C\n         /    \\\n        H      H\n    ```\n*   **Reagent 1: mCPBA.** The *syn-addition* of oxygen to the cis-alkene can happen from the top or bottom face. However, due to the symmetry of the cis-alkene, both modes of attack produce the same, single achiral epoxide. This product is a **meso epoxide**, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n*   **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** The acid-catalyzed *anti*-opening of this meso-epoxide will occur.\n    *   The overall reaction is again *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n    *   The stereochemistry rule is: **anti-addition to a cis-alkene yields a racemic mixture of enantiomers.**\n    *   Let's verify this:\n        *   The starting epoxide is the meso compound (4R,5S)-epoxyoctane.\n        *   Backside attack by water at C4 (which is R) will invert it to S. The configuration at C5 remains S. The product is **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        *   Backside attack by water at C5 (which is S) will invert it to R. The configuration at C4 remains R. The product is **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        *   (4S,5S) and (4R,5R) are non-superimposable mirror images, i.e., they are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the attack at C4 and C5 is equally likely, they are formed in equal amounts.\n\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products. The final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n1.  **Meso-diol** ((4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol) from Reaction 1.\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (one enantiomer from Reaction 2).\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the other enantiomer from Reaction 2).\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is as follows:\n*   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers**.\n*   The Meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by achiral HPLC and will elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols will form one peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated by achiral HPLC. The meso-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Thus, it will have a different retention time.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso-diol and one for the racemic pair of enantiomers.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which interacts differently with different stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n    *   It will separate the two **enantiomers**, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, into two distinct peaks.\n    *   It will also separate the **meso-diol** from the two chiral diols, as it is a diastereomer and will have a different interaction with the chiral stationary phase.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will resolve all three stereoisomers, showing **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<B>>>"
