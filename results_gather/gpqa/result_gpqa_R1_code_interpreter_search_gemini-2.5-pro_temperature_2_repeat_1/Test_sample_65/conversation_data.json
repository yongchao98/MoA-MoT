    "SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory. It is a quantum field theory that extends the Standard Model (SM) by including higher-dimensional operators. The construction of the SMEFT Lagrangian relies on a set of fundamental principles and symmetries. Let's analyze each of the proposed symmetries:\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry**: Lorentz symmetry (invariance under boosts and rotations) is a cornerstone of special relativity and a fundamental postulate of any quantum field theory (QFT) describing particle physics, including the Standard Model and its extensions like SMEFT. All terms in the Lagrangian, including the higher-dimensional SMEFT operators, are constructed to be Lorentz scalars to ensure the laws of physics are the same for all inertial observers. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.\n\n2.  **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and, additionally, symmetry under spacetime translations. Invariance under translations leads to the conservation of energy and momentum. Like Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry is a fundamental spacetime symmetry upon which local quantum field theories are built. All operators in the SMEFT Lagrangian must be invariant under Poincaré transformations. Thus, Poincaré symmetry must be respected.\n\n3.  **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry is the combination of Charge Conjugation (C) and Parity (P). It is well-established that the weak interaction in the Standard Model violates CP symmetry (e.g., through the complex phase in the CKM matrix). SMEFT, being an extension of the SM, is not required to preserve CP symmetry. In fact, many SMEFT operators, when assigned complex Wilson coefficients, introduce new sources of CP violation beyond the Standard Model. Therefore, CP symmetry is *not* a required symmetry for all operators in SMEFT.\n\n4.  **CPT Symmetry**: The CPT theorem is a fundamental result in QFT. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the combined transformation of C, P, and Time Reversal (T). Since SMEFT is constructed as a local and Lorentz-invariant QFT, it must respect CPT symmetry. All operators in the SMEFT are CPT-even.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- Lorentz symmetry (1) must be respected.\n- Poincaré symmetry (2) must be respected.\n- CP symmetry (3) is not necessarily respected.\n- CPT symmetry (4) must be respected due to the CPT theorem.\n\nThe symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\nThis corresponds to the combination 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
