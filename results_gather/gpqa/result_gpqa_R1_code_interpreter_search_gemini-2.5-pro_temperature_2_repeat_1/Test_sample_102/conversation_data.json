    "This problem asks for the best reaction sequence to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene. Let's analyze the target molecule and the provided reaction options.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   The parent is acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n*   It has three substituents on the benzene ring: an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   Let's number the ring starting from the acetyl group at C1. The bromo group is at C3, and the nitro group is at C5.\n*   This is a **1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene derivative**. All three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects\nTo plan a synthesis, we must consider how each group directs incoming electrophiles during electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS).\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl group)**: Deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo group)**: Deactivating, *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro group)**: Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **-NH2 (amino group)**: Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director. This group is relevant as it is formed by reducing a nitro group (Fe/HCl).\n*   **-NH3+ (anilinium ion)**: Formed from -NH2 in strong acid. Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\nA critical rule in EAS is that **Friedel-Crafts reactions (acylation and alkylation) do not work on strongly deactivated rings**. This means we cannot perform a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a ring that already has a -NO2 group or other strongly deactivating groups.\n\n### 3. Evaluating a \"Simple\" Direct Synthesis\nLet's first consider the most direct way to assemble the molecule. The Friedel-Crafts acylation must be done before the ring is strongly deactivated (i.e., before nitration).\n1.  **Acylation**: Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.\n2.  Now we need to add -Br and -NO2 to acetophenone at the meta positions (C3 and C5). Let's consider the two possible orders.\n    *   **Order A: Nitrate then Brominate**\n        a. **Nitration**: Acetophenone (-COCH3 is m-directing) → 3-Nitroacetophenone. This works well.\n        b. **Bromination**: 3-Nitroacetophenone. The substituents are -COCH3 (at C1, m-director) and -NO2 (at C3, m-director). Both groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the C5 position. The directing effects are **reinforcing**. This is an excellent synthetic step.\n        *This sequence (Acylation → Nitration → Bromination) is a highly efficient and logical route to the target molecule.*\n\n    *   **Order B: Brominate then Nitrate**\n        a. **Bromination**: Acetophenone (-COCH3 is m-directing) → 3-Bromoacetophenone. This works.\n        b. **Nitration**: 3-Bromoacetophenone. The substituents are -COCH3 (at C1, m-director) and -Br (at C3, o,p-director). The directors are in **conflict**. -COCH3 directs to C5, while -Br directs to C2, C4, and C6. This would likely lead to a mixture of products and is not ideal for a \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n\nThe best simple route is Acylation → Nitration → Bromination. However, none of the options list this sequence. This suggests we must evaluate the given, more complex options, which likely involve using a temporary directing group that is later removed. The presence of the `Fe/HCl` (reduction), `NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization), and `H3PO2` (deamination) sequence points to this strategy. This sequence effectively replaces a -NO2 group with a -H atom, via an -NH2 intermediate.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Given Options\n\n*   **Option A**: i) Acylation; ii) Bromination; iii) Nitration... This follows Order B discussed above. It's plausible but potentially low-yield. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are chemically flawed if they are to follow step (iii). For instance, step (v) involves nitrating a product that contains an unprotected amino group under strongly acidic conditions, which would either oxidize the amine or protonate it into a meta-director, leading to the wrong product.\n\n*   **Option C & D**: Option C fails because step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene, a strongly deactivated ring. This reaction does not work. Option D involves a circular sequence of steps (i-iv) that converts benzene back to benzene, making it nonsensical.\n\n*   **Option B**: Let's trace this pathway carefully. It employs the temporary directing group strategy.\n    i)   **Benzene → Nitrobenzene** (HNO3/H2SO4). Standard.\n    ii)  **Nitrobenzene → Aniline** (Fe/HCl). Standard reduction. The ring now has a powerful o,p-directing -NH2 group.\n    iii) **Aniline → p-Aminoacetophenone** (CH3COCl/AlCl3). This step is written as a Friedel-Crafts acylation of aniline, which is problematic because the Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group. However, this sequence of reagents can be interpreted as a shorthand for an N-acylation followed by a **Fries Rearrangement**, which moves the acetyl group from the nitrogen to the ring, predominantly at the para position. Let's assume this gives p-aminoacetophenone.\n    iv) **p-Aminoacetophenone → 4-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone** (Br2/FeBr3). We brominate p-aminoacetophenone. The strong o,p-directing -NH2 group at C4 will direct the bromine to its ortho position, C3. This is a plausible step.\n    v)  **4-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone → 4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone** (HNO3/H2SO4). We nitrate the product from step (iv). Again, the powerful activating -NH2 group at C4 will direct the incoming -NO2 group to its other vacant ortho position, C5. (Note: In practice, the amino group would be protected as an amide to prevent oxidation and protonation, but in the context of a multiple-choice question, we assume the desired regiochemistry is achieved).\n    vi) **4-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone → Diazonium salt** (NaNO2/HCl). The amino group at C4 is converted to a diazonium group (-N2+).\n    vii) **Diazonium salt → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one** (H3PO2). The diazonium group is removed and replaced by a hydrogen atom (deamination).\n\nThe final product has the -COCH3 group at C1, -Br at C3, and -NO2 at C5. This matches the target molecule exactly. Although this path relies on a charitable interpretation of steps (iii) and (v), it is the only sequence provided that logically leads to the desired 1,3,5-substitution pattern. The other options contain chemically impossible steps or lead to incorrect products.\n\n<<<B>>>"
