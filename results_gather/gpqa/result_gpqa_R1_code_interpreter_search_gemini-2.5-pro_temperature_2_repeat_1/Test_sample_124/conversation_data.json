    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the System and its Hamiltonian:**\n    The potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" means the potential is the same in all directions, as it only depends on the radial distance $r = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}$.\n    The Hamiltonian for this system is:\n    $H = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\nabla^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2+y^2+z^2)$\n    This Hamiltonian is separable in Cartesian coordinates. It can be written as the sum of three independent one-dimensional (1D) harmonic oscillator Hamiltonians:\n    $H = H_x + H_y + H_z$, where $H_i = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x_i^2} + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 x_i^2$ for $i=x, y, z$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Energy Eigenvalues:**\n    The energy eigenvalue for a 1D harmonic oscillator in the state $n_i$ is $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i=0, 1, 2, ...$.\n    For the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the three independent 1D oscillators:\n    $E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z}$\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    $E_{n} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n    Let the principal quantum number be $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy levels are given by:\n    $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, for $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$\n\n3.  **Identify the Energy of the Third Excited State:**\n    The energy levels are determined by the integer value of $n$.\n    *   **Ground State:** This is the lowest energy level, which corresponds to the smallest possible value of $n$. Since $n_x, n_y, n_z$ must be non-negative, the minimum value is $n = 0+0+0=0$.\n        Energy: $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **First Excited State:** This is the next energy level, corresponding to $n=1$.\n        Energy: $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=2$.\n        Energy: $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=3$.\n        Energy: $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State:**\n    The degeneracy of an energy level is the number of different quantum states (linearly independent eigenfunctions) that have the same energy. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of different combinations of non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to $n=3$.\n    Let's list them out:\n    1.  One quantum number is 3, the others are 0:\n        (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3) --- (3 states)\n    2.  One quantum number is 2, one is 1, one is 0:\n        (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2) --- (6 states)\n    3.  All three quantum numbers are 1:\n        (1, 1, 1) --- (1 state)\n\n    The total number of states (degeneracy) is the sum: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\n    Alternatively, the degeneracy $g_n$ of the n-th level for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is given by the formula:\n    $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n    For the third excited state, $n=3$:\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The energy of the third excited state ($n=3$) is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    The degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) for this energy level is 10.\n    This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
