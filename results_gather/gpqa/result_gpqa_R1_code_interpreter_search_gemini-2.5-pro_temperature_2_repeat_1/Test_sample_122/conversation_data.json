    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation. We need to calculate the distance traveled by the supernova ejecta from the perspective of an observer in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n\n**1. Understand the Frames of Reference:**\n*   **Galaxy's Frame (S):** This is the stationary frame from which we want to measure the distance traveled.\n*   **Ejecta's Frame (S'):** This is the moving frame. The time measured in this frame is the \"proper time\".\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information:**\n*   **Relative velocity (v):** The ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s relative to the Galaxy.\n*   **Proper time (Δt₀):** The time that passes in the ejecta's moving frame is Δt₀ = 50 s.\n*   **Speed of light (c):** c ≈ 300,000 km/s.\n\n**3. The Physics: Time Dilation**\nAccording to the theory of special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure time passing more slowly for a moving object (the ejecta) than an observer in the moving frame. This effect is called time dilation. The time elapsed in the stationary frame (Δt) is related to the proper time (Δt₀) by the Lorentz factor (γ).\n\nThe formula for the Lorentz factor is:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nThe time dilation formula is:\nΔt = γ * Δt₀\n\n**4. The Goal:**\nWe need to find the distance (d) traveled by the ejecta as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame. The formula for distance is:\nd = v * Δt\n\n**5. Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n**Step a: Calculate the ratio v/c.**\nv/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2\n\n**Step b: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\nγ = 1 / √(1 - (0.2)²)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04)\nγ = 1 / √0.96\n\n**Step c: Calculate the dilated time (Δt) in the Galaxy's frame.**\nΔt = γ * Δt₀\nΔt = (1 / √0.96) * 50 s\n\n**Step d: Calculate the distance (d) in the Galaxy's frame.**\nd = v * Δt\nd = 60,000 km/s * [(1 / √0.96) * 50 s]\n\nNow let's compute the final value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # km/s\ndelta_t0 = 50  # s\nc = 300000 # km/s\n\n# Step a: Calculate v/c\nv_over_c = v / c\n\n# Step b: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v_over_c**2)\n\n# Step c: Calculate the dilated time (delta_t) in the Galaxy's frame\ndelta_t = gamma * delta_t0\n\n# Step d: Calculate the distance (d) in the Galaxy's frame\ndistance = v * delta_t\n\nprint(distance)\n```\nEXECUTION_SUCCESS:\n`3061862.178478972`\n\nThe calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km. This value is closest to option A.\n\nLet's re-verify the calculation:\nd = 60,000 * 50 / √0.96\nd = 3,000,000 / √0.96\nd = 3,000,000 / 0.979795897...\nd ≈ 3,061,862.18 km\n\nThe closest answer is 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem.\n\n**1. Identify the Frames of Reference and Knowns**\n*   **Galaxy's Frame (S):** We can consider this the \"stationary\" frame of reference. We need to find the distance traveled in this frame.\n*   **Ejecta's Frame (S'):** This is the moving frame of reference.\n*   **Relative Velocity (v):** The ejecta moves at `v = 60,000 km/s` relative to the Galaxy.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt₀):** The time that elapses in the ejecta's own frame is `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is the \"proper time\" because it's measured in the frame where the event (the ticking of a clock on the ejecta) is at rest.\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**2. Identify the Physical Principle**\nThe problem involves two inertial frames moving relative to each other at a significant fraction of the speed of light (v = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2c). Therefore, we must use the principles of special relativity.\n\nSpecifically, time measured by an observer in the Galaxy's frame (S) will appear to pass more slowly for the moving ejecta than the time measured in the ejecta's frame (S'). This effect is known as **time dilation**.\n\n**3. Goal**\nThe question asks for the distance the ejecta travels *in the Galaxy reference frame*. The formula for distance is `distance = velocity × time`.\nCrucially, all variables in this equation must be measured in the same reference frame. So, we need to use the velocity of the ejecta *as measured from the Galaxy* (`v`) and the time elapsed *as measured from the Galaxy* (`Δt`).\n\n**4. The Calculation Steps**\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the Dilated Time (Δt)**\n    The time `Δt` that passes in the Galaxy's frame is related to the proper time `Δt₀` by the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the Distance (d)**\n    Once we have the time `Δt` in the Galaxy's frame, we can calculate the distance traveled in that frame using:\n    `d = v * Δt`\n\n**5. Executing the Calculation**\n\n*   **First, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n    1.  `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    2.  `v²/c² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n    3.  `1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.04 = 0.96`\n    4.  `γ = 1 / √0.96`\n\n*   **Next, calculate the dilated time (Δt) in the Galaxy's frame:**\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / √0.96) * 50 s`\n    `Δt ≈ (1 / 0.9798) * 50 s ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n    As expected, the time measured in the Galaxy's frame is longer than the time measured in the ejecta's frame.\n\n*   **Finally, calculate the distance (d) in the Galaxy's frame:**\n    `d = v * Δt`\n    `d = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / √0.96) * 50 s )`\n    `d = (60,000 * 50) / √0.96`\n    `d = 3,000,000 / √0.96`\n    `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**6. Conclusion**\nThe calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km. This value is closest to option A. A non-relativistic calculation would have given `d = 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km` (Option B), which is incorrect because it ignores time dilation.\n\nThe provided python code executed the exact same calculation:\n`distance = v * (1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v/c)**2)) * delta_t0`\nAnd yielded the output `3061862.178478973`.\n\nThis result is closest to **3,060,000 km**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
