    "The user wants to identify the assumptions that constitute the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. Let's break down the physical meaning of this approximation and then evaluate each statement.\n\n**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **What is the Impulse Approximation?** The impulse approximation is a simplifying assumption used in scattering theory, particularly in nuclear and particle physics. The core idea is that when a high-energy probe (like an electron, neutrino, or photon) strikes a composite system (like a nucleus), the interaction is very rapid. It happens over such a short timescale that it can be treated as an instantaneous \"impulse\" delivered to one of the constituents (a nucleon).\n\n2.  **Implications of a \"Rapid Impulse\":**\n    *   If the interaction is extremely fast, the target nucleon doesn't have time to communicate or interact with its fellow nucleons in the nucleus *during* the primary interaction. The binding forces that hold it in place are effectively \"frozen\" for that brief moment. This means the nucleon behaves as if it were a free particle, albeit with some initial momentum from its motion within the nucleus.\n    *   The interaction is localized to a single constituent. The probe doesn't interact with multiple nucleons simultaneously (this would be a \"two-body current\" or higher-order effect, which is neglected).\n    *   For the simplest version of the approximation (often called the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation or PWIA), we also assume that the incoming probe and the outgoing particles do not interact with the rest of the nucleus on their way in or out.\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Statements:**\n    *   **Statement 1: \"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"** This is a direct consequence of the localized, single-particle nature of the assumed interaction. We neglect multi-nucleon currents (e.g., meson-exchange currents). This is a foundational part of the impulse approximation. This statement is correct.\n\n    *   **Statement 2: \"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"** This deals with what happens before and after the main interaction. It assumes that the incoming probe interacts only with the target nucleon and that the outgoing particles (the scattered probe and the struck nucleon) escape the nucleus without any further scattering. These subsequent scatterings are known as \"Final-State Interactions\" (FSI). Neglecting FSI is a key part of the simplest form of the impulse approximation (the PWIA). More sophisticated models try to account for FSI, but transparency is a core assumption of the basic approximation. This statement is correct.\n\n    *   **Statement 3: \"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"** This is an assumption about the *internal structure* of the nucleon, not about the nucleon's behavior within the nucleus during scattering. The impulse approximation treats the *nucleon* as the fundamental object of the interaction. What the quarks are doing inside is a separate physical model. In fact, many experiments where the impulse approximation is used involve high energy and momentum transfers, a regime where quarks are highly relativistic. Therefore, this assumption is not part of the impulse approximation; it belongs to a different (and often incorrect) level of theory. This statement is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Statement 4: \"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"** This is the very essence of the \"impulse\" concept. The interaction time is assumed to be so short that the potential energy due to the nuclear binding force is negligible compared to the kinetic energy transferred. The nucleon acts as if it's \"free\" at the moment of the collision. This statement is correct.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The three assumptions that jointly define the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4. Statement 3 is unrelated.\n\n5.  **Matching with Options:**\n    *   A) 1, 2, 4\n    *   B) 2, 3, 4\n    *   C) 1, 3, 4\n    *   D) 1, 2, 3\n\n    The correct combination is (1, 2, 4), which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
