    "*   **Step 1: Identify the reactants.**\n    *   The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum of this anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates two equivalent vinylic protons.\n    *   The ¹³C NMR spectrum has two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons). This also points to a symmetrical molecule.\n    *   The simplest *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is *cis*-butenedioic acid, also known as maleic acid. Dehydration of maleic acid yields maleic anhydride. Maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) perfectly matches the NMR data. The two vinylic protons are equivalent, giving a singlet around 7 ppm. The two vinylic carbons are equivalent (around 137 ppm), and the two carbonyl carbons are equivalent (around 165 ppm).\n    *   Therefore, the dienophile is **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene** (C₉H₁₄).\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the reaction and its products.**\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition between 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (the diene) and maleic anhydride (the dienophile).\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is given as C₁₃H₁₆O₃. Let's verify this: C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (dienophile) = C₁₃H₁₆O₃. The formula is correct.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic dienes can produce two stereoisomers: an *endo* adduct and an *exo* adduct.\n    *   The *Alder endo rule* predicts that the *endo* product is typically the major, kinetically favored product, due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions between the diene and the dienophile's electron-withdrawing groups.\n    *   However, this rule can be overridden by severe steric hindrance. In our diene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, there are methyl groups at carbons C1 and C4, the positions that form the new sigma bonds.\n    *   In the *endo* transition state, the maleic anhydride ring approaches from under the diene ring, causing a significant steric clash between the anhydride and the methyl groups at C1 and C4.\n    *   In the *exo* transition state, the maleic anhydride ring approaches from above, pointing away from the methyl groups at C1 and C4, minimizing steric hindrance.\n    *   Due to this severe steric clash, the **exo adduct is the major product**, and the *endo* adduct is the minor product. This is a classic exception to the endo rule.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the stereochemistry and proton proximities of the products.**\n    *   We use 2D NOESY NMR to determine which protons are close in space (< 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of protons that are spatially close. We are looking for a cross-peak present in the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product.\n    *   **Major Product (Exo Isomer):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the bicyclic system from the C7-methylene bridge. In this geometry, the two protons on the anhydride part of the molecule (let's call them H_anhydride) are close to the two vinyl methyl groups (at C2 and C3 of the original diene).\n    *   **Minor Product (Endo Isomer):** The anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the C7-methylene bridge. In this geometry, the H_anhydride protons are far from the vinyl methyl groups. They are instead close to the protons of the C7 bridge and the bridgehead methyl groups (at C1 and C4).\n    *   Therefore, the NOE interaction (cross-peak) between the **H_anhydride protons** and the **vinyl methyl protons** will be present and strong in the major (exo) product and absent or very weak in the minor (endo) product.\n\n*   **Step 4: Assign the ¹H NMR signals.**\n    *   The product molecule has a plane of symmetry, simplifying the NMR spectrum.\n    *   **H_anhydride protons:** Two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring. They are on sp³ carbons alpha to a carbonyl group in a strained ring system. A typical chemical shift for such protons is around **~3.5 ppm**. They are chemically equivalent and do not have adjacent protons to couple with, so they appear as a **2H singlet**.\n    *   **Vinyl methyl groups:** Two equivalent methyl groups attached to the double bond. A typical chemical shift for vinyl methyls is **~1.7 ppm**. They are equivalent, so they appear as a **6H singlet**.\n    *   **Bridgehead methyl groups:** Two equivalent methyl groups attached to the sp³ bridgehead carbons. These are further from electronegative groups and double bonds. A typical chemical shift is **~1.0 ppm**. They are equivalent, so they appear as a **6H singlet**.\n    *   The options with \"1H doublet\" (B and C) are inconsistent with the symmetrical structure of the product.\n\n*   **Step 5: Identify the cross-peak.**\n    *   The distinguishing cross-peak in the major (exo) product's NOESY spectrum is between the H_anhydride protons and the vinyl methyl protons.\n    *   Based on our assignments, this corresponds to a cross-peak between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n    *   This matches option A.\n\n    *   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinyl methyls) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride).** This is the correct pair of resonances, as they are close in space only in the major (exo) product.\n    *   B) Inconsistent integral and splitting pattern.\n    *   C) Inconsistent integral and splitting pattern.\n    *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead methyls) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinyl methyls). These groups are relatively far apart in both isomers, so a strong, distinguishing NOE is not expected.\n\n<<<A>>>"
