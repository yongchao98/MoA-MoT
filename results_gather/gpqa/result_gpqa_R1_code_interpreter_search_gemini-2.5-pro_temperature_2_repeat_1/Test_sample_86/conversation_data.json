    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Decipher the Compound's Structure from the Description**\n\n*   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two groups attached to it. A benzene ring has 6 carbon atoms and, when di-substituted, 4 hydrogen atoms attached to the ring (C6H4).\n*   **\"containing 8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **\"FTIR spectrum... indicate the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) as well as an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X)\"**: This tells us about the functional groups present. One substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the aromatic ring. The other substituent must contain the two carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n\n**2. Assemble the Substituents**\n\n*   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n*   The other substituent must have the formula C2O. A very common and stable chemical group that fits this description is the acetyl group: -COCH3.\n*   Let's check other possibilities for a 2-carbon carbonyl-containing group. Another option is -CH2CHO.\n\n**3. Propose Candidate Structures**\n\n*   **Structure 1 (from -COCH3 substituent): Haloacetophenone.**\n    *   This compound consists of a benzene ring substituted with a halogen and an acetyl group.\n    *   Total carbons: 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 8. This matches.\n    *   It has the required functional groups (Ar-X, C=O).\n\n*   **Structure 2 (from -CH2CHO substituent): (Halophenyl)acetaldehyde.**\n    *   This compound consists of a benzene ring substituted with a halogen and a -CH2CHO group.\n    *   Total carbons: 6 (ring) + 2 (-CH2CHO) = 8. This also matches.\n    *   It has the required functional groups (Ar-X, C=O).\n\n**4. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Structure and Compare with Options**\n\nLet's analyze the expected signals for each structure. The substitution can be ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4). The provided options show a simple pattern (two doublets) in the aromatic region, which is highly characteristic of para (1,4) substitution. We will assume a para-substituted ring.\n\n*   **Prediction for para-Haloacetophenone (Structure 1)**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (C6H4)**: In a para-disubstituted ring, there are two sets of equivalent protons. This results in two signals, each appearing as a doublet due to splitting by the adjacent proton. Each doublet should integrate to 2H. The chemical shift will be in the aromatic region, typically 7.0-8.0 ppm.\n    *   **Acetyl Protons (-COCH3)**: The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent and have no adjacent protons. This will result in a singlet signal integrating to 3H. The chemical shift for a methyl group next to a carbonyl is typically 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n    *   **Summary Prediction:**\n        *   ~7-8 ppm (2H, d)\n        *   ~7-8 ppm (2H, d)\n        *   ~2.1-2.6 ppm (3H, s)\n\n*   **Prediction for para-(Halophenyl)acetaldehyde (Structure 2)**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (C6H4)**: Same as above, two doublets, each integrating to 2H, in the 7.0-8.0 ppm region.\n    *   **Aldehyde Proton (-CHO)**: The single proton of the aldehyde group is adjacent to the two CH2 protons. It should appear as a triplet. The chemical shift for an aldehyde proton is very distinct, typically 9.5-10.0 ppm.\n    *   **Methylene Protons (-CH2-)**: The two protons of the methylene group are adjacent to the single aldehyde proton. They should appear as a doublet. The chemical shift for protons on a carbon between a benzene ring and a carbonyl is typically 3.5-4.0 ppm.\n    *   **Summary Prediction:**\n        *   ~9.5-10.0 ppm (1H, t)\n        *   ~7-8 ppm (2H, d)\n        *   ~7-8 ppm (2H, d)\n        *   ~3.5-4.0 ppm (2H, d)\n\n**5. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   This matches the chemical shifts for the acetaldehyde structure (aldehyde H at 9.9, aromatic Hs at 7.8/7.6, methylene Hs at 3.7). However, the multiplicities are incorrect. The aldehyde proton should be a triplet (t), not a singlet (s), and the methylene protons should be a doublet (d), not a singlet (s). This option is incorrect due to the inconsistent splitting patterns.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks signals in the typical aromatic proton region (7-8 ppm). It is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H, which is classic for a para-substituted ring.\n    *   It also shows a singlet integrating to 3H at 2.3 ppm, which is a perfect match for an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   This data perfectly matches our prediction for para-haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum also lacks signals in the aromatic proton region. It is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe 1H NMR data in option C is the only one that perfectly matches a molecule that satisfies all the conditions described in the problem. The molecule is a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<C>>>"
