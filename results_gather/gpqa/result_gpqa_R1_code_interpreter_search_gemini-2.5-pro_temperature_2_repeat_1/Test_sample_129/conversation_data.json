    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Goal:** Find the minimum (lower limit) redshift `z` for an object to be detectable by a ground-based optical telescope.\n    *   **Signal:** An absorption feature at the Lyman-alpha (Lyman-α) wavelength.\n    *   **Rest Wavelength (λ_em):** The problem states the Lyman-α wavelength is ~1216 Angstroms (Å). This is the wavelength at which the light is absorbed by the hydrogen cloud (in its own reference frame). This wavelength is in the far ultraviolet (UV) part of the spectrum.\n    *   **Detector:** A \"ground-based optical telescope\". The key constraint here is \"ground-based\". The Earth's atmosphere is opaque to most ultraviolet radiation. We need to find the shortest wavelength of light that can pass through the atmosphere and reach the ground. This is known as the atmospheric cutoff wavelength.\n    *   **Physics Principle:** The relationship between the emitted wavelength (λ_em), the observed wavelength (λ_obs), and redshift (z) is given by the formula:\n        `λ_obs = λ_em * (1 + z)`\n\n2.  **Identify the Limiting Factor:**\n    *   The Lyman-α line at 1216 Å cannot be observed directly from the ground because it is deep in the UV and will be absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere (primarily by the ozone layer).\n    *   For the line to be detected, it must be redshifted into the \"optical window,\" the range of wavelengths that the atmosphere is transparent to.\n    *   Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift corresponds to the case where the Lyman-α line is shifted to the very shortest wavelength that can be observed from the ground.\n\n3.  **Determine the Atmospheric Cutoff Wavelength:**\n    *   What is the shortest wavelength that ground-based optical telescopes can see? The atmospheric transmission drops very sharply below about 350 nanometers (3500 Å) and is essentially zero below 320 nm (3200 Å). For a feature to be reliably \"detected,\" it needs to fall into a range where instruments are sensitive and the atmosphere is reasonably transparent. A commonly used practical lower limit for ground-based observation is around 3500 Å. This corresponds to the blue edge of the \"U-band\" (Ultraviolet) in standard astronomical filter systems. Let's use this value for our `λ_obs`.\n    *   So, we have:\n        *   `λ_em` (rest wavelength of Lyman-α) = 1216 Å\n        *   `λ_obs_min` (minimum observable wavelength from the ground) ≈ 3500 Å\n\n4.  **Calculate the Redshift:**\n    *   We can now rearrange the redshift formula to solve for `z`:\n        `1 + z = λ_obs / λ_em`\n        `z = (λ_obs / λ_em) - 1`\n    *   Now, let's plug in the values and calculate the minimum redshift, `z_min`.\n\n5.  **Use Python for the Calculation:**\n    To get a precise value, a simple python script is efficient.\n\n```python\n# The rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line in Angstroms.\nlambda_em = 1216\n\n# The approximate shortest wavelength observable from the ground due to the\n# atmospheric cutoff. This is the minimum observed wavelength.\n# A practical limit for observation is around 3500 Angstroms.\nlambda_obs_min = 3500\n\n# Calculate the lower limit on the redshift using the formula: z = (lambda_obs / lambda_em) - 1\nz_min = (lambda_obs_min / lambda_em) - 1\n\nprint(z_min)\n```\n```output\n1.8782894736842104\n```\n\n6.  **Analyze the Result and Select the Answer:**\n    *   The calculation gives a redshift of `z ≈ 1.88`.\n    *   Now, let's compare this result to the given options:\n        A) 1.2\n        B) 2.4\n        C) 3\n        D) 1.9\n    *   Our calculated value of 1.88 is extremely close to 1.9. The small difference is due to the precise choice of the atmospheric cutoff wavelength, which isn't a single number but a range (e.g., if we had used 3526 Å as the cutoff, the answer would be exactly 1.9).\n    *   Therefore, a redshift of at least ~1.9 is required to shift the 1216 Å Lyman-α line into the observable window for ground-based telescopes.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum redshift `z` required for the Lyman-alpha (Lyman-α) line, which is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, to be shifted into the optical window observable by ground-based telescopes.\n\n1.  **Identify the Rest Wavelength (λ_em)**: The problem states that the Lyman-α absorption occurs at a rest wavelength of approximately 1216 Å. This wavelength is in the far ultraviolet.\n\n2.  **Identify the Observed Wavelength Limit (λ_obs)**: Ground-based telescopes are limited by the Earth's atmosphere, which absorbs most radiation with wavelengths shorter than the near-ultraviolet. This \"atmospheric cutoff\" is approximately at 3500 Å (or 350 nm). For a spectral line to be reliably detected from the ground, its observed wavelength must be longer than this cutoff. Therefore, the minimum observed wavelength (`λ_obs_min`) we can consider is ~3500 Å.\n\n3.  **Use the Redshift Formula**: The relationship between the emitted wavelength (`λ_em`), the observed wavelength (`λ_obs`), and the redshift (`z`) is given by:\n    `λ_obs = λ_em * (1 + z)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Minimum Redshift (z_min)**: To find the lower limit on the redshift, we use the minimum observable wavelength (`λ_obs_min`):\n    `z_min = (λ_obs_min / λ_em) - 1`\n\n    Plugging in the values:\n    *   `λ_em` = 1216 Å\n    *   `λ_obs_min` ≈ 3500 Å\n\n    The Python code calculated this value as:\n    `z_min = (3500 / 1216) - 1 ≈ 1.878`\n\n5.  **Compare with Options**: The calculated redshift is approximately 1.88. Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) 1.2\n    B) 2.4\n    C) 3\n    D) 1.9\n\nThe value 1.9 is the closest match to our calculated lower limit of ~1.88. The small difference is due to the precise value chosen for the atmospheric cutoff, which isn't a hard edge but a rapid transition.\n\nTherefore, the object must have a redshift of at least ~1.9 for its Lyman-α absorption feature to be detectable from a ground-based optical telescope.\n\n<<<D>>>"
