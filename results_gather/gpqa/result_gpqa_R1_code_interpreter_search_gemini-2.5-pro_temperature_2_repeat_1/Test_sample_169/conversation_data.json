    "An electron is in a spin state represented by the vector $|\\psi\\rangle$. In the standard basis, where spin-up is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and spin-down is $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, the given state is:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 3i \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe expectation value of an operator $A$ for a state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is given by the formula:\n$\\langle A \\rangle = \\frac{\\langle\\psi|A|\\psi\\rangle}{\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle}$\n\nHere, the operator is the spin angular momentum in the y-direction, $S_y$. It is related to the Pauli spin matrix $\\sigma_y$ by:\n$S_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\n\nThe Pauli-y matrix is given as:\n$\\sigma_y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nTherefore, the spin operator $S_y$ is:\n$S_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, we follow the steps to calculate the expectation value:\n\n**1. Find the bra vector $\\langle\\psi|$**\nThe bra vector $\\langle\\psi|$ is the conjugate transpose of the ket vector $|\\psi\\rangle$.\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 3i \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}$\nThe complex conjugate is $\\begin{pmatrix} -3i \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe transpose of the conjugate is $\\langle\\psi| = \\begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n**2. Calculate the normalization factor $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle$**\nThis is the inner product of the state with itself.\n$\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 3i \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix} = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = -9i^2 + 16$\nSince $i^2 = -1$, this becomes:\n$\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = -9(-1) + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25$\n\n**3. Calculate the term $\\langle\\psi|S_y|\\psi\\rangle$**\nFirst, let's calculate the action of the operator $S_y$ on the state $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$S_y |\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 3i \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$S_y |\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) \\\\ (i)(3i) + (0)(4) \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} -4i \\\\ 3i^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} -4i \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, multiply this result by the bra vector $\\langle\\psi|$:\n$\\langle\\psi|S_y|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} -4i \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$\\langle\\psi|S_y|\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left[ (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) \\right]$\n$\\langle\\psi|S_y|\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} [12i^2 - 12] = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} [-12 - 12] = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} [-24] = -12\\hbar$\n\n**4. Calculate the expectation value $\\langle S_y \\rangle$**\n$\\langle S_y \\rangle = \\frac{\\langle\\psi|S_y|\\psi\\rangle}{\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle} = \\frac{-12\\hbar}{25}$\n\nThe expectation value of the spin along the y-direction is -12Ä§/25. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
