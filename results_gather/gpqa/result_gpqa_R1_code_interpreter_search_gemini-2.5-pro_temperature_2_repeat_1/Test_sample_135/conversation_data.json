    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are asked to calculate the volume integral of the divergence of a given vector field `f(r)` over a specific volume.\n*   **Vector Field `f(r)`:** The field has a magnitude of `1/r^2` and points radially outward from the origin. In spherical coordinates, this is expressed as:\n    `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\n    where `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n*   **Volume `V`:** The volume is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n*   **Integral to Evaluate:** We need to find the value of:\n    `∫∫∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`\n\n**2. Choose the Method: The Divergence Theorem**\n\nThis problem is a classic application of the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem). The theorem relates a volume integral of a divergence of a vector field to a surface integral of the field over the boundary of the volume. The theorem states:\n\n`∫∫∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `V` is the volume (the sphere of radius R).\n*   `S` is the closed surface that encloses the volume `V` (the surface of the sphere of radius R).\n*   `dS` is the outward-pointing differential surface area vector on the surface `S`.\n\nThe Divergence Theorem is particularly useful here because the vector field `f(r)` is undefined at the origin (`r=0`). Directly calculating the divergence `∇ ⋅ f` gives zero for `r ≠ 0`, but it hides a singularity at the origin (a Dirac delta function). The Divergence Theorem allows us to bypass this complexity by working on the surface `S`, where the field is well-behaved.\n\n**3. Set up the Surface Integral**\n\nWe need to evaluate the right side of the Divergence Theorem: `∮∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`.\n\n*   **Field on the Surface `S`:** The surface `S` is a sphere of constant radius `R`. On this surface, the vector field `f` is:\n    `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`\n\n*   **Surface Area Element `dS`:** For a sphere, the differential surface area element vector `dS` always points in the outward radial direction. Its magnitude is `dS = R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ`. Therefore, the vector is:\n    `dS = (R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat`\n\n*   **The Dot Product `f ⋅ dS`:** Now, we compute the dot product of the field and the surface element vector:\n    `f ⋅ dS = [ (1/R^2) * r_hat ] ⋅ [ (R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r_hat ]`\n    Since `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`, the expression simplifies:\n    `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n    `f ⋅ dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n**4. Evaluate the Integral**\n\nNow we integrate `f ⋅ dS` over the entire surface of the sphere. In spherical coordinates, this means integrating over `θ` from `0` to `π` and over `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n\n`∮∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_φ=0 to 2π ∫_θ=0 to π sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nLet's solve the integral in parts:\n1.  **Integrate with respect to `θ`:**\n    `∫_0 to π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n2.  **Integrate with respect to `φ`:**\n    Now we take the result from the first step and integrate it with respect to `φ`:\n    `∫_0 to 2π (2) dφ = [2φ]_0^2π = 2(2π) - 2(0) = 4π`\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe value of the surface integral is `4π`. By the Divergence Theorem, this is equal to the original volume integral:\n\n`∫∫∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 1\nB) 0\nC) 4/3 π R\nD) 4 π\n\nThe correct answer is 4π.\n\n<<<D>>>"
