    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Compound A (C3H6):** The molecular formula C3H6 corresponds to the general formula CnH2n, indicating one degree of unsaturation. This could be either propene (CH3-CH=CH2) or cyclopropane. The reaction with bromine (Br2) in carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) is a characteristic electrophilic addition reaction for alkenes. Therefore, Compound A is propene.\n\n2.  **Identify Compound B:** Propene (A) undergoes bromination. Bromine adds across the double bond.\n    `CH3-CH=CH2 + Br2 --(CCl4)--> CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br)`\n    Compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane.\n\n3.  **Identify Compound C:** Compound B (1,2-dibromopropane) reacts with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH). Alcoholic KOH is a strong dehydrohalogenating agent. It removes two molecules of HBr from 1,2-dibromopropane to form an alkyne.\n    `CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br) + 2 alc. KOH --> CH3-C≡CH + 2 KBr + 2 H2O`\n    Compound C is propyne.\n\n4.  **Identify Compound D:** Compound C (propyne) is passed through a red-hot iron tube. This reaction causes cyclic polymerization. Three molecules of propyne trimerize to form mesitylene (1,3,5-trimethylbenzene), a stable aromatic compound.\n    `3 CH3-C≡CH --(red-hot Fe tube)--> 1,3,5-C6H3(CH3)3`\n    Compound D is mesitylene (1,3,5-trimethylbenzene).\n\n5.  **Identify Compound E:** Compound D (mesitylene) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids. This is nitration, using a mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4). The methyl (-CH3) group is an activating, ortho-para directing group. In mesitylene, all three available positions (2, 4, 6) are equivalent and highly activated.\n    Mesitylene + HNO3/H2SO4 --> 2-Nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene.\n    Compound E is 2-Nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene.\n\n6.  **Identify Compound F:** Compound E is treated with iron scrap (Fe) and hydrochloric acid (HCl). This is a standard method for the reduction of a nitro group (-NO2) to an amino group (-NH2).\n    2-Nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene --(Fe/HCl)--> 2-Amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene.\n    This compound is also known as mesidine or 2,4,6-trimethylaniline. Compound F is an aromatic primary amine.\n\n7.  **Identify Compound G:** Compound F (mesidine) reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2), typically formed in situ from NaNO2 and HCl at low temperature (0-5 °C). This is a diazotization reaction, which converts a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt.\n    Mesidine + HNO2 --> 1,3,5-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt.\n    Compound G is the 1,3,5-trimethylbenzenediazonium salt.\n\n8.  **Identify Compound H:** Compound G (the diazonium salt) reacts with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and warming. The diazonium group (-N2+) is an excellent leaving group and is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH) from water/hydroxide.\n    Diazonium salt --(NaOH/H2O, warm)--> 2,4,6-trimethylphenol.\n    Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n**A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\nCompound F is mesidine (2,4,6-trimethylaniline), a primary aromatic amine. Primary aromatic amines are precursors for diazonium salts, which are key intermediates in the synthesis of azo dyes via coupling reactions. This statement is **correct**.\n\n**B) C is a flammable gas.**\nCompound C is propyne (CH3-C≡CH). Its boiling point is -23.2 °C. At standard room temperature (around 25 °C), it is a gas. As a low-molecular-weight hydrocarbon, it is highly flammable. This statement is **correct**.\n\n**C) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\nCompound D is mesitylene (1,3,5-trimethylbenzene). Due to its high C3 symmetry:\n*   The protons of the three methyl groups (9H) are chemically equivalent and do not have any adjacent protons to couple with. They produce one singlet.\n*   The three protons on the aromatic ring are also chemically equivalent and have no adjacent proton neighbors. They produce a second singlet.\nTherefore, the 1H NMR spectrum consists of two singlets. This statement is **correct**.\n\n**D) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\nCompound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is a characteristic test for phenols, where a positive result is typically a purple, green, or blue colored complex. However, for this test to work, the phenolic -OH group must be sterically accessible to form a complex with the Fe³⁺ ion. In 2,4,6-trimethylphenol, the two methyl groups at the ortho positions (positions 2 and 6) sterically hinder the -OH group. This steric hindrance prevents the formation of the colored complex. As a result, no reaction occurs, and the solution simply retains the yellow/brown color of the ferric chloride reagent itself. The statement implies that a yellow product is formed (a positive result), which is chemically incorrect. A negative test result is observed. Thus, this statement is **incorrect**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
