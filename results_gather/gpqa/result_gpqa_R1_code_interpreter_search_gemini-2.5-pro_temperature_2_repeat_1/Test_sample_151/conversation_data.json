    "*   **Analysis of the experimental setup:**\n    *   The organism is *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (yeast).\n    *   The yeast is treated with a peptide that induces \"shmoo\" formation. In yeast, shmoo formation is the characteristic response to mating pheromones.\n    *   This response involves two key cellular events:\n        1.  **Cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase.** The cell stops dividing and prepares for mating.\n        2.  **A massive transcriptional program is initiated** to express genes required for mating (e.g., genes for cell-cell fusion, signaling).\n    *   The experiment aims to identify the proteome of **active chromatin**. Active chromatin (euchromatin) is the region of the genome where genes are being actively transcribed.\n    *   The technique is Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by mass spectrometry. This will pull down DNA-binding protein complexes from the active chromatin regions.\n\n*   **Evaluation of the options:**\n    *   **A) Nucleosome histone complex:** Nucleosomes are the fundamental building blocks of all chromatin, both active and inactive. They are composed of histone proteins. Therefore, any analysis of chromatin will abundantly detect histones.\n    *   **B) Enhancer protein complex:** Enhancers are DNA regulatory elements that bind transcription factors to activate gene expression. Since the shmoo response involves turning on many new genes, the enhancer regions for these genes will be bound by their activating proteins. These complexes are a hallmark of active chromatin and would be abundant.\n    *   **D) Pre-initiation complex (PIC):** The PIC is the large complex, including RNA polymerase II and general transcription factors, that assembles on gene promoters to begin transcription. As many genes are being actively transcribed in the shmoo, PICs will be highly prevalent in the active chromatin fraction.\n    *   **C) Pre-replication complex (pre-RC):** The pre-RC assembles on origins of replication during the G1 phase to \"license\" them for DNA replication in the subsequent S phase. However, the shmoo response involves a firm **arrest** of the cell cycle in G1. The cell is actively prevented from entering S phase and starting DNA replication. Although pre-RCs are assembled in G1, their function is inhibited, and the cell's resources are redirected to transcription for mating, not replication. Compared to the complexes directly involved in the massive transcriptional upregulation that defines the shmoo response (enhancer complexes and PICs), the pre-replication complexes related to a blocked process will be the least represented protein complexes in the functionally *active* chromatin.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The cell is transcriptionally hyperactive but is blocked from replicating its DNA. Therefore, complexes involved in transcription (B and D) will be abundant, while complexes for DNA replication (C) will be the least prominent in the assay.\n\n<<<C>>>"
