    "**1. Deconstruction of the problem**\nThe user has provided FTIR and ¹H NMR data for an unknown compound and a list of four possible structures. I need to use this spectroscopic information to identify the correct structure.\n\n*   **FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹. This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹. This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not differentiate between the isomers.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   No signals corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. This confirms the absence of C=C double bonds, which is consistent with all four structures.\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).** According to the n+1 rule, this means the proton generating this signal is coupled to three distinct sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing a doublet (d) splitting.\n        *   Two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), causing a triplet (t) splitting.\n        *   Three equivalent neighboring protons (n=3), causing a quartet (q) splitting.\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).** This means the proton generating this signal is coupled to three distinct sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing a doublet (d) splitting.\n        *   Two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), causing a triplet (t) splitting.\n        *   Another, different set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), causing a second triplet (t) splitting.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Candidate Structures**\n\nThe key to solving the problem is to find the single structure that contains protons that would give rise to *both* a `dtq` signal and a `dtt` signal. I will analyze the most complex protons in each structure, which are the methine protons (`-CH-`) on the carbon chain.\n\n*   **Structure A: CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH**\n    This is 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid, or `(CH₃)₂CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂COOH`. Let's analyze the proton on carbon-3, H(c) in `-CH(c)(CH₃)-CH₂(e)-`.\n    *   H(c) is coupled to: the H on carbon-4 (1H, doublet), the `CH₂` group at carbon-2 (2H, triplet), and the methyl group at carbon-3 (3H, quartet).\n    *   This gives a `dtq` signal. However, there is no proton in this molecule that is coupled to one proton, a two-proton group, and another two-proton group. Thus, there is no `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **Structure B: CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**\n    This is 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid, `CH₃CH₂-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-COOH`. Let's analyze the proton on carbon-3, H(c) in `...-CH(c)(C₂H₅)-CH(f)...`.\n    *   H(c) is coupled to: the H on carbon-2 (1H, doublet), the `CH₂` of the ethyl group at the end of the chain (2H, triplet), and the `CH₂` of the ethyl substituent on C3 (2H, triplet).\n    *   This gives a `dtt` signal. However, there is no proton in this molecule that is coupled to 1H, 2H, and 3H neighbours. The methine proton on C2 would be a doublet of triplets. Methylene protons in the ethyl groups would be complex multiplets (likely ddq's), but not a clean `dtq`.\n\n*   **Structure D: CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**\n    This is 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid, `CH₃CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH`. Let's analyze the proton on carbon-3, H(c) in `...-CH(c)(CH₃)-CH(e)...`.\n    *   H(c) is coupled to: the H on carbon-2 (1H, doublet), the `CH₂` group of the terminal ethyl group (2H, triplet), and the methyl group substituent (3H, quartet).\n    *   This gives a `dtq` signal. However, similar to structure A, there is no environment that would produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **Structure C: CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\n    This corresponds to the structure **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**, `CH₃-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-CH₂-COOH`. Let's number the main chain starting from the carboxyl carbon as C1.\n    Structure:\n```\n           Et (ethyl on C3)\n           |\nHOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH(4)(Et)-CH₅(from formula string)\n```\n    No, this naming is incorrect. Let's interpret the line formula `CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH` correctly.\n    It describes a pentanoic acid backbone with ethyl groups on carbons 3 and 4: `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH₃`.\n    Let's analyze the methine protons on carbons 3 and 4 of **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n    `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(4)(Et)-CH₃(5)`\n\n    *   **Proton at C4 (H-4):**\n        *   It is adjacent to the `CH₃` group at C5 (3H, gives a **quartet**).\n        *   It is adjacent to the methine proton at C3 (1H, gives a **doublet**).\n        *   It is adjacent to the `CH₂` group of the ethyl substituent on C4 (2H, gives a **triplet**).\n        *   Combining these, the signal for H-4 is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches Signal 1.\n\n    *   **Proton at C3 (H-3):**\n        *   It is adjacent to the methine proton at C4 (1H, gives a **doublet**).\n        *   It is adjacent to the `CH₂` group at C2 (2H, gives a **triplet**).\n        *   It is adjacent to the `CH₂` group of the ethyl substituent on C3 (2H, gives another **triplet**).\n        *   Combining these, the signal for H-3 is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches Signal 2.\n\n**Conclusion**\nStructure C is the only candidate that possesses the necessary structural features to produce both a `dtq` signal and a `dtt` signal in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<C>>>"
