    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   Let's draw the structure: The parent chain is hexane. There's a ketone (C=O) at position 3 and a methoxy group (-OCH3) at position 5. The stereocenter at carbon 5 has the (S) configuration.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-CH(OCH3)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3`. The chiral center at C5 is marked (S).\n\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H3O+).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols.\n\n*   **Products:**\n    *   The ketone at carbon 3 is prochiral. Its reduction to an alcohol will create a new chiral center at C3.\n    *   The nucleophilic hydride ion (H-) can attack the carbonyl carbon from either the top face or the bottom face. This results in the formation of two possible stereoisomers for the new alcohol group at C3, which can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   The original chiral center at C5 is not involved in the reaction, so its (S) configuration remains unchanged.\n    *   The two products formed are:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two molecules are stereoisomers but are not mirror images of each other (the mirror image of (3R, 5S) is (3S, 5R)). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`. This molecule is achiral and has a plane of symmetry.\n\n*   **Reagents:** Excess Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH4 is also a reducing agent for ketones. Since it is in excess, both ketone groups will be reduced to secondary alcohols.\n\n*   **Products:**\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: `CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3`.\n    *   This reduction creates two new chiral centers at carbons C2 and C4.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   However, the molecule is symmetric around C3. This means that (2R, 4S) is the same molecule as (2S, 4R). This specific stereoisomer has an internal plane of symmetry and is an achiral **meso compound**.\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) stereoisomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**.\n    *   Since the starting material and the reagent are both achiral, any chiral products must be formed in equal amounts as a racemic mixture.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: the meso compound and a racemic mixture of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe products from both reactions are combined. We have a total of 5 stereoisomers in the mixture:\n*   **From Rxn I:**\n    *   Compound 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Compound 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **From Rxn II:**\n    *   Compound 3: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Compound 4: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Compound 5: meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n#### **Analysis on Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but **it cannot separate enantiomers**.\n*   **Separating Rxn I products:** Compounds 1 and 2 are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and are separable by normal-phase HPLC. This will produce **2 peaks**.\n*   **Separating Rxn II products:**\n    *   Compounds 3 and 4 are enantiomers. They have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will co-elute as a single peak.\n    *   Compound 5 (the meso compound) is a diastereomer of compounds 3 and 4. It has different physical properties and will be separated from them.\n    *   Therefore, the products from Reaction II will produce **2 peaks** on a normal-phase column (one for the racemic pair, one for the meso compound).\n*   **Combining the results:** The products from Reaction I (methoxyhexanols) are constitutionally different from the products of Reaction II (pentanediols). They have different molecular formulas, sizes, and polarities, and will thus be separated from each other.\n*   **Total Peaks on Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Rxn I) + 2 peaks (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Analysis on Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase. This chiral environment allows for the separation of **enantiomers** as well as diastereomers.\n*   The goal of chiral chromatography is to resolve all stereoisomers. We assume the column and conditions are suitable for this task.\n*   We have 5 chemically distinct stereoisomers in our mixture.\n    *   Compound 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Compound 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (diastereomer of 1)\n    *   Compound 3: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Compound 4: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (enantiomer of 3)\n    *   Compound 5: meso-pentane-2,4-diol (diastereomer of 3 and 4)\n*   A chiral HPLC column can distinguish between all of these. Enantiomers (3 and 4) will be separated. Diastereomers (e.g., 1 vs 2, or 3 vs 5) will be separated. Constitutional isomers (the hexanols vs the diols) will be separated.\n*   **Total Peaks on Chiral HPLC:** Each of the 5 unique stereoisomers will produce its own peak. Thus, we expect **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
