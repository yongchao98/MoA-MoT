    "*   **Analyze the options:**\n\n    *   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is simply a planet with the same characteristics as Earth. The average density of Earth is approximately 5.51 g/cm³. This will serve as our baseline for comparison.\n\n    *   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The problem explicitly states the density is ~5.5 g/cm³, which is virtually the same as Earth's density.\n\n    *   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** The key here is \"same composition\" and \"5 times more massive.\" For celestial bodies like rocky planets, as the mass increases, the force of its own gravity also increases. This immense gravitational force compresses the materials (rock and iron, in this case) at the planet's core and throughout its volume. This compression forces the atoms closer together, resulting in a higher overall density. Therefore, a 5-Earth-mass planet with the same composition as Earth will be significantly denser than Earth.\n\n    *   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** Following the same logic as in option (c), but in reverse. A planet with less mass will have weaker gravity. With less gravitational compression, the material it's made of will not be squeezed as tightly. Therefore, a planet with half of Earth's mass but the same composition will be less dense than Earth.\n\n*   **Comparison:**\n\n    *   Density of (a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Density of (b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n    *   Density of (c) > 5.51 g/cm³ (due to increased gravitational compression)\n    *   Density of (d) < 5.51 g/cm³ (due to decreased gravitational compression)\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n\n    The planet in option (c) is the most massive among those with Earth-like composition (a, c, d). The increased mass leads to greater gravitational compression, which in turn leads to the highest density.\n\n<<<A>>>"
