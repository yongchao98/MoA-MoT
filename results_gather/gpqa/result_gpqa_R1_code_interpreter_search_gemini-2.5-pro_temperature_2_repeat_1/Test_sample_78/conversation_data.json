    "**1. Analysis of the Reaction Conditions**\n\n*   **Compound X:** Has the molecular formula C11H12O. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation (DBE):\n    DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6.\n    A benzene ring accounts for 4 DBE. This leaves 2 DBE for the rest of the molecule. The oxygen atom suggests functional groups like an ether, alcohol, ketone, or epoxide. The options provided all feature an epoxide ring (1 DBE) and a double bond (1 DBE), which matches the calculated DBE of 6.\n*   **Reagents:** 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) is a non-nucleophilic organic base.\n*   **Conditions:** High temperature (403 K = 130 °C) in a nonpolar solvent.\n\nThese conditions—a base and heat—are characteristic of an elimination or rearrangement reaction. Given the likely presence of an epoxide ring in the starting material, a base-catalyzed rearrangement is highly probable. A well-known reaction is the Kornblum–DeLaMare rearrangement, where a base promotes the conversion of an epoxide to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Product's NMR Spectra**\n\nThe NMR data is for the product formed after the reaction. Let's deduce its structure.\n\n*   **¹³C NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **δ 197.7 (1C):** This is a key signal in the characteristic region for a carbonyl carbon (C=O). Since it's a singlet ('s', meaning no attached protons in DEPT, i.e., quaternary), it corresponds to a **ketone**.\n    *   **δ 144.1 to 126.9:** This range contains 8 carbons, typical for aromatic and vinylic (C=C) carbons. The presence of a C=O group suggests the product is an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n        *   δ 129.1 (2C) and 126.9 (2C): The presence of two signals each integrating to two carbons is a strong indicator of a **para-substituted benzene ring**.\n    *   **δ 28.4 and δ 21.3:** These two signals are in the aliphatic region and correspond to the remaining two carbons. They are most likely **methyl (CH₃) groups**. δ 21.3 is typical for a methyl group on an aromatic ring (a tolyl group), and δ 28.4 would be the methyl group of the ketone.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **δ 7.71 (2H, d) and 7.08 (2H, d):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic A₂B₂ spin system of a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n    *   **δ 7.68 (1H, d) and 6.75 (1H, d):** These two doublets in the alkene region represent two adjacent vinylic protons (C**H**=C**H**) that are splitting each other. These belong to the α,β-unsaturated system.\n    *   **δ 2.31 (3H, s) and 2.28 (3H, s):** These two singlets, each integrating to three protons, represent two different **methyl groups** that are not adjacent to any protons. One is the methyl group on the benzene ring (tolyl), and the other is the methyl group of the acetyl function (-COCH₃).\n\n**3. Deducing the Product and Starting Material**\n\n*   **Product Structure:** Based on the NMR analysis, the product contains a *p*-tolyl group (a methyl group on a para-substituted ring), and an acetyl group (-COCH₃) attached to a C=C double bond. The structure is **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**, also known as 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n    *   Formula: C₁₁H₁₂O. (C₇H₇ from p-tolyl, C₄H₅O from the butenone part). Matches.\n    *   This structure is consistent with all NMR signals.\n\n*   **Reaction Mechanism and Compound X:** The product, an α,β-unsaturated ketone, is formed via the rearrangement of an epoxide. We must find which of the given options for Compound X would rearrange to form 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one. This specific reaction is a **vinylogous Kornblum–DeLaMare rearrangement**. It proceeds by the deprotonation of a proton on the epoxide ring that is also allylic to a double bond.\n\nLet's examine the options:\n*   A) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane: Contains a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group. Cannot yield the correct product.\n*   B) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane: The molecular formula is likely incorrect (C₉H₁₀O), and it contains a phenyl group, not p-tolyl.\n*   C) 2-styrylepoxide: The molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₀O, which is incorrect. It also has a phenyl group, not p-tolyl.\n*   **D) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:**\n    *   **Structure:** A 4-methylstyryl group (p-Me-C₆H₄-CH=CH-) is attached to an oxirane ring. The full structure is p-Me-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂.\n    *   **Formula:** C₁₁H₁₂O. This matches.\n    *   **Rearrangement:** The proton on the epoxide carbon adjacent to the vinyl group is acidic (it's doubly allylic). DABCO removes this proton. The resulting carbanion triggers the opening of the epoxide ring to form an enolate, which then tautomerizes to the final ketone product.\n        *   `p-Me-Ph-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂  --[DABCO]-->  p-Me-Ph-CH=CH-CO-CH₃`\n    *   This pathway correctly links the starting material in option D to the product deduced from the NMR data.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCompound X has the formula C11H12O. It reacts with DABCO at high temperature to form a product whose NMR spectra are consistent with 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one. This transformation is a vinylogous Kornblum-DeLaMare rearrangement. The only plausible starting material among the options that fits the molecular formula and would yield the observed product is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<D>>>"
