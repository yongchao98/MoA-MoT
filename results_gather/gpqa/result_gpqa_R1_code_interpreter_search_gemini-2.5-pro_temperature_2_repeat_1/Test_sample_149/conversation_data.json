    "*   **Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from the molecular formula (C8H9NO) and 1H-NMR data.**\n\n    1.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n        DoU = C + 1 + N/2 - H/2 = 8 + 1 + 1/2 - 9/2 = 9.5 - 4.5 = 5.\n        A DoU of 5 suggests a benzene ring (DoU = 4) and one additional degree of unsaturation (a C=C or C=O bond).\n\n    2.  **Analyze the 1H-NMR Spectrum:**\n        *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This high chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), indicates that it is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-), as per the n+1 rule (2+1=3). This confirms a **-CH2-CHO** fragment.\n        *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to the aldehyde. Its chemical shift is consistent with being attached to both an aromatic ring and the electron-withdrawing aldehyde group. The splitting pattern, a doublet (d), confirms it is coupled to the single aldehyde proton (1+1=2). This further supports the **-CH2-CHO** fragment.\n        *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, both doublets integrating to 2 protons each, are classic indicators of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n        *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet that integrates to 2 protons is typical for exchangeable protons like those in an amino (-NH2) or hydroxyl (-OH) group. Given the presence of nitrogen in the molecular formula, this signal is assigned to a primary **amino group (-NH2)**.\n\n    3.  **Assemble the Structure:**\n        The fragments are a para-substituted benzene ring, a -CH2-CHO group, and an -NH2 group. Assembling these gives **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n        Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (from the ring) + C2H3O (from -CH2CHO) + NH2 = C8H9NO. The formula matches.\n        The structure of the starting material is 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the sequence of reactions.**\n\n    1.  **Reagents: 1. NaNO2 + HCl; 2. H2O**\n        *   This is a two-step process. The first step (NaNO2 + HCl, typically at 0-5 °C) is the **diazotization** of the primary aromatic amine. The -NH2 group is converted into a diazonium salt group (-N2+Cl-).\n        *   The second step (H2O, with warming) is the **hydrolysis** of the diazonium salt. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (it leaves as N2 gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH) from water.\n        *   The net result of these two steps is the conversion of the primary aromatic amine into a phenol.\n        *   The intermediate product formed after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n        *   Structure: HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO\n\n    2.  **Reagent: 3. aq. KOH, Heat**\n        *   The intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, possesses both an aldehyde group and acidic α-protons (on the -CH2- group adjacent to the carbonyl).\n        *   These are the conditions for a **self-aldol condensation** reaction. A strong base (KOH) deprotonates the α-carbon of one molecule to form an enolate nucleophile. This enolate then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule.\n        *   **Aldol Addition:** The initial product is the β-hydroxy aldehyde, called the aldol adduct.\n            *   Molecule 1 (enolate): [HO-C6H4-CH-CHO]⁻\n            *   Molecule 2 (aldehyde): HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO\n            *   Attack and protonation yield the aldol adduct: 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal. This corresponds to option (D).\n        *   **Aldol Condensation (Dehydration):** The reaction is carried out with **heat**. Heating an aldol addition product in the presence of base (or acid) causes dehydration (elimination of a water molecule) to form an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. This product is thermodynamically more stable due to the extended conjugation between the double bond and the carbonyl group.\n            *   Aldol Adduct: HO-Ph-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(Ph-OH)-CHO\n            *   The hydroxyl group is on the β-carbon (C-3), and an acidic proton is on the α-carbon (C-2).\n            *   Elimination of H2O (the -OH from C-3 and the -H from C-2) forms a double bond between C-2 and C-3.\n            *   Final Product: HO-Ph-CH2-CH=C(Ph-OH)-CHO\n        *   **Naming the final product:**\n            *   The main chain is a butenal (4 carbons, aldehyde at C-1, double bond at C-2). So, `but-2-enal`.\n            *   There is a (4-hydroxyphenyl) group at C-2 and another (4-hydroxyphenyl) group at C-4.\n            *   The IUPAC name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This matches option (A).\n\n*   **Step 3: Conclusion**\n    Since the reaction is heated, the final isolated product is the result of condensation (dehydration), not just addition. Therefore, the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde is the correct answer.\n\n    *   Start: 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde\n    *   -> Intermediate: 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde\n    *   -> Final Product (Aldol Condensation): 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal - This is the correct aldol condensation product.\nB) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal - Incorrect structure.\nC) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal - Incorrect structure (missing OH groups).\nD) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal - This is the aldol addition product, which would be the intermediate before the final dehydration step promoted by heat.\n\nThe final product is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
