    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze Substance Z**\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with the general formula CxHy.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. Let's calculate the empirical formula.\n    *   Mass % of H = 14.28% = 0.1428\n    *   Mass % of C = 100% - 14.28% = 85.72%\n    *   Molar ratio C:H = (85.72 / 12.01) : (14.28 / 1.008) = 7.13 : 14.17 ≈ 1:2.\n*   The empirical formula is CH2.\n*   The molecular formula of a stable hydrocarbon with this ratio is CnH2n. This corresponds to the general formula for cycloalkanes or alkenes.\n*   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n*   The problem also states Z is a widely used solvent and a liquid.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and Mixture Y**\n*   Mixture Y is formed from mixture X by heating with platinum. Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n*   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated (alkanes, cycloalkanes) or aromatic.\n*   We know one component of Y is Z, the cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n*   The reaction from X to Y is a disproportionation, which in this context (Pt catalyst, formation of a saturated compound) implies a catalytic hydrogen transfer. One substance is hydrogenated (reduced) to Z, and another must be dehydrogenated (oxidized).\n*   For the resulting mixture Y to not decolorize bromine water, the dehydrogenated product must be stable and unreactive to Br2 water. The most common examples are aromatic compounds.\n*   Therefore, mixture Y consists of an equimolar mixture of a cycloalkane (Z, CnH2n) and an aromatic compound. The aromatic compound must have the same carbon skeleton as Z, which is formed upon its full hydrogenation.\n\n**3. Identify the Carbon Skeleton and the Components**\n*   The hydrogenation of *both* mixtures X and Y yields *only* substance Z. This is a crucial point that confirms all compounds in X and Y share the same carbon skeleton.\n*   Let's consider the most common example of this type of reaction, which involves a six-membered ring.\n    *   If n=6, Z is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. This fits the CnH2n formula, is a very common solvent, and is a liquid.\n    *   The corresponding aromatic compound with a C6 skeleton is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene does not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **benzene (C6H6)** and **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**4. Analyze Mixture X**\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B.\n*   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n*   Hydrogenation of A and B must both yield Z (cyclohexane). This means A and B are unsaturated compounds with a C6H12 carbon skeleton. They are likely cyclohexene or a cyclohexadiene.\n*   The transformation from X to Y is a reaction where the components of X form the components of Y. Since Y is an equimolar mixture of benzene and cyclohexane, the reaction can be written as:\n    A + B → C6H6 + C6H12\n*   By the law of conservation of mass, the atoms must balance. Both A and B have 6 carbons, so the carbon atoms are balanced (6+6 → 6+6). Let the formula of A be C6Hx and B be C6Hy. The hydrogen atoms must also balance:\n    x + y = 6 + 12\n    x + y = 18\n*   This means the total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of compound A and one molecule of compound B is 18.\n*   Let's find plausible identities for A and B.\n    *   They are unsaturated cyclohexanes. A stable unsaturated cyclic C6 hydrocarbon can be cyclohexene (C6H10) or a cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   If A is C6H10 and B is C6H8, then the sum of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This fits our deduction.\n    *   So, Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and a **cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n    *   The problem states there are *no conjugated multiple bonds* in the compounds of mixture X. Cyclohexene has one double bond, so no conjugation. For cyclohexadiene, there are two isomers: 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated). Therefore, the diene must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**.\n    *   Mixture X = {Cyclohexene, 1,4-Cyclohexadiene}. Both are liquids and will decolorize bromine water.\n\n**5. Final Verification**\n*   **X** = {C6H10, C6H8} (equimolar, liquids, unsaturated, non-conjugated). Check.\n*   **Reaction** X → Y: C6H10 + C6H8 --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 + C6H6. This is a hydrogen transfer reaction where cyclohexene is hydrogenated and 1,4-cyclohexadiene is dehydrogenated. It produces an equimolar mixture. Check.\n*   **Y** = {C6H12, C6H6} (equimolar, do not decolorize Br2 water). Check.\n*   **Z** = C6H12 (constituent of Y, widely used solvent, CnH2n, %H=14.28%). Check.\n*   **Hydrogenation of X**: C6H10 and C6H8 both hydrogenate to C6H12. Gives only Z. Check.\n*   **Hydrogenation of Y**: C6H6 and C6H12 both yield C6H12 under hydrogenation. Gives only Z. Check.\n\nThe logic is consistent. The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This corresponds to the sum of hydrogens in one molecule of each component.\n\nNumber of H atoms = (H in C6H10) + (H in C6H8) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
