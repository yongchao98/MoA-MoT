    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning and calculations used to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem\n\nThe core of the problem is to compare two different phenomena that cause a star's brightness to dim:\n1.  **Rotational Modulation:** A star has one hemisphere covered in dark spots. As the star rotates, we observe it from different angles. When the spotted hemisphere faces us, the star appears dimmer than when the unspotted hemisphere faces us. This creates a periodic variation in brightness.\n2.  **Exoplanet Transit:** A hypothetical planet passes in front of its star (which is assumed to have no spots). As it transits, it blocks a portion of the star's light, causing a temporary dip in brightness.\n\nThe goal is to find the size of the exoplanet (relative to its star) that would cause the same *amplitude* of brightness dip as the star with the spots.\n\n### 2. Modeling the Flux from the Spotted Star\n\nThe brightness or flux (`F`) of a star is related to its surface temperature (`T`) and its emitting area (`A`) by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that Flux is proportional to `A * T^4`. We are interested in the relative change in flux, so we can ignore the Stefan-Boltzmann constant (`σ`) and other geometric constants as they will cancel out.\n\nLet's define the key parameters:\n*   Star's effective temperature, `T_eff = 6000 K`.\n*   Spot temperature, `T_spot = T_eff - 1000 K = 5000 K`.\n*   Spot filling factor on one hemisphere, `f = 20% = 0.2`.\n\nThe problem implies a simplified model where we compare the brightness when the \"unspotted\" hemisphere faces us (maximum brightness, `F_max`) versus when the \"spotted\" hemisphere faces us (minimum brightness, `F_min`).\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (`F_max`):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The flux is proportional to the projected area of the star's disk (`A_disk`) and the fourth power of its effective temperature.\n    `F_max ∝ A_disk * T_eff^4`\n\n*   **Minimum Flux (`F_min`):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. A fraction `f` of this hemisphere's area is covered by cooler spots. The total flux is a weighted average of the flux from the hot photosphere and the cooler spots.\n    `F_min ∝ A_disk * [ (1-f) * T_eff^4 + f * T_spot^4 ]`\n    The term `(1-f)` represents the fraction of the area at temperature `T_eff`, and `f` is the fraction at `T_spot`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Amplitude due to Spots\n\nThe amplitude of the signal is the fractional drop in brightness from maximum to minimum. This is analogous to the transit depth.\n\n`Amplitude_spots = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n\nBy substituting the expressions for `F_max` and `F_min` and simplifying, we get:\n\n`Amplitude_spots = 1 - (F_min / F_max)`\n`Amplitude_spots = 1 - [ ( (1-f) * T_eff^4 + f * T_spot^4 ) / T_eff^4 ]`\n`Amplitude_spots = 1 - (1 - f + f * (T_spot / T_eff)^4)`\n`Amplitude_spots = f - f * (T_spot / T_eff)^4`\n`Amplitude_spots = f * ( 1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4 )`\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n`Amplitude_spots = 0.2 * ( 1 - (5000 / 6000)^4 )`\n`Amplitude_spots = 0.2 * ( 1 - (5/6)^4 )`\n`Amplitude_spots = 0.2 * ( 1 - 625/1296 )`\n`Amplitude_spots = 0.2 * ( (1296 - 625) / 1296 )`\n`Amplitude_spots = 0.2 * ( 671 / 1296 )`\n`Amplitude_spots ≈ 0.2 * 0.51775 = 0.10355`\n\nSo, the brightness of the star dips by approximately 10.36% due to the spotted hemisphere.\n\n### 4. Modeling the Flux from an Exoplanet Transit\n\nWhen an exoplanet transits a star (that has no spots, as per the question), it blocks an amount of light equal to the ratio of its projected area to the star's projected area.\n\n*   Projected area of the planet: `A_pl = π * R_pl^2`\n*   Projected area of the star: `A_star = π * R_star^2`\n\nThe amplitude of the transit signal (the transit depth) is:\n\n`Amplitude_planet = A_pl / A_star = (π * R_pl^2) / (π * R_star^2) = (R_pl / R_star)^2`\n\n### 5. Equating the Amplitudes and Solving\n\nThe problem asks for the planet radius (`R_pl/R_star`) that would produce the same amplitude signal. Therefore, we set the two amplitudes equal to each other:\n\n`Amplitude_planet = Amplitude_spots`\n`(R_pl / R_star)^2 = 0.10355`\n\nTo find the relative radius `R_pl / R_star`, we take the square root of this value:\n\n`R_pl / R_star = √0.10355 ≈ 0.32179`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\n### 6. Final Conclusion\n\nComparing our calculated value with the given options:\nA) ~0.39\nB) ~0.11\nC) ~0.32\nD) ~0.07\n\nOur result of `~0.32` matches option C.\n\nTo verify the calculation, the following Python script can be executed:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given parameters\nT_eff = 6000  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\nT_spot = 5000 # Temperature of the spots in Kelvin\nf = 0.20      # Filling factor of spots on one hemisphere\n\n# 1. Calculate the amplitude of the signal due to the spotted star\n# The fractional flux drop is given by f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4)\nflux_ratio_spot_vs_photosphere = (T_spot / T_eff)**4\namplitude_spots = f * (1 - flux_ratio_spot_vs_photosphere)\n\n# 2. Relate this amplitude to the transit of a hypothetical exoplanet\n# The amplitude of a transit is (R_pl / R_star)^2\n# We set amplitude_planet = amplitude_spots\n# So, (R_pl / R_star)^2 = amplitude_spots\n# Therefore, R_pl / R_star = sqrt(amplitude_spots)\nrelative_radius = math.sqrt(amplitude_spots)\n\nprint(f\"The amplitude due to spots is: {amplitude_spots:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"The required relative radius of the exoplanet (R_pl/R_star) is: {relative_radius:.4f}\")\n```\nRunning this code confirms that the relative radius is approximately 0.3218.\n\n<<<C>>>",
