    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**Part 1: Calculating the Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nTo find the relative speed of the two astronauts, we use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula. Let's denote the speeds of the two astronauts as v1 and v2, as measured by a stationary observer.\n*   Speed of the first astronaut (mass 2m), v1 = 0.6c\n*   Speed of the second astronaut (mass 3m), v2 = 0.5c\n\nThe formula for relative velocity (the speed of the first astronaut as seen by the second astronaut) is:\nv_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)\n\nSubstitute the given values into the formula:\n*   v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)\n*   v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3c^2 / c^2)\n*   v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)\n*   v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7\n*   v_rel ≈ 0.142857 c\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n**Part 2: Calculating the Total Energy of the System (E_total)**\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total energies of the two astronauts. The total energy (E) of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is given by E = γmc², where m is the rest mass and γ (the Lorentz factor) is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).\n\n**Energy of the first astronaut (E1):**\n*   Rest mass, m1 = 2m\n*   Speed, v1 = 0.6c\n*   Lorentz factor, γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\n*   Energy, E1 = γ1 * m1 * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = **2.5 mc²**\n\n**Energy of the second astronaut (E2):**\n*   Rest mass, m2 = 3m\n*   Speed, v2 = 0.5c\n*   Lorentz factor, γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547\n*   Energy, E2 = γ2 * m2 * c² = (1 / sqrt(0.75)) * (3m) * c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3 * mc² ≈ **3.464 mc²**\n\n**Total Energy (E_total):**\n*   E_total = E1 + E2\n*   E_total = 2.5 mc² + 3.464 mc²\n*   E_total = **5.964 mc²**\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately 0.14c and the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc².

    "Based on the problem statement and the results from the executed code, let's break down the solution and arrive at the final answer.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Reasoning**\n\n1.  **Calculate the Relative Speed (v_rel):**\n    The problem asks for the relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds. The formula for relativistic velocity subtraction is:\n    `v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - v1*v2 / c^2)`\n    Given:\n    *   v1 = 0.6c\n    *   v2 = 0.5c\n    Plugging the values into the formula:\n    `v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n    `v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3c^2 / c^2)`\n    `v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)`\n    `v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7`\n    `v_rel ≈ 0.142857c`\n    The code output `The relative speed is 0.143c` confirms this calculation. Rounding to two decimal places, we get **v_rel = 0.14c**.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Total Energy of the System (E_total):**\n    The total energy of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is given by the formula `E = γmc^2`, where `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is `1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`.\n    The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the two astronauts.\n\n    *   **Energy of Astronaut 1 (E1):**\n        *   Mass (m1) = 2m\n        *   Speed (v1) = 0.6c\n        *   Lorentz factor (γ1) = `1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n        *   E1 = `γ1 * m1 * c^2 = 1.25 * (2m) * c^2 = 2.5 mc^2`\n\n    *   **Energy of Astronaut 2 (E2):**\n        *   Mass (m2) = 3m\n        *   Speed (v2) = 0.5c\n        *   Lorentz factor (γ2) = `1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2/c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547`\n        *   E2 = `γ2 * m2 * c^2 ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c^2 ≈ 3.4641 mc^2`\n\n    *   **Total Energy (E_total):**\n        *   E_total = E1 + E2\n        *   E_total = `2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2`\n        *   E_total = `5.9641 mc^2`\n    The code output `The total energy is 5.964mc^2` confirms this calculation. Rounding to two decimal places, we get **E = 5.96 mc^2**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately **0.14c**, and the total energy is approximately **5.96 mc^2**.
