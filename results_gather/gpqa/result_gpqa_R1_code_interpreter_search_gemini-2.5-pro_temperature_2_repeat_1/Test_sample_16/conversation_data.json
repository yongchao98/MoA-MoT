    "The problem asks for the concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) in a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species and equilibrium:**\n    The species involved are the calcium-EDTA complex ($CaY^{2-}$, where Y represents the EDTA ligand), free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$), and the free EDTA ligand ($Y^{4-}$). The complex is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions.\n\n2.  **Write the equilibrium reaction:**\n    The formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is given by:\n    $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons CaY^{2-}$\n\n    The question asks for the concentration of free $Ca^{2+}$ ions, which are produced by the dissociation of the complex. The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    $CaY^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n3.  **Use the formation constant ($K_f$):**\n    The problem provides the formation constant (also called the stability constant), $K_f$, for the Ca-EDTA complex.\n    $K_f = \\frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n    The problem states to assume an ideal pH. This means we can use the absolute formation constant and assume that any dissociated EDTA exists as the fully deprotonated $Y^{4-}$ species.\n\n4.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:**\n    Let's analyze the dissociation reaction. The initial stoichiometric concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. We assume that initially, there are no free calcium or EDTA ions. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n    | Species     | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n    | :---------- | :---------- | :--------- | :-------------- |\n    | $CaY^{2-}$  | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n    | $Ca^{2+}$   | 0           | +x         | x               |\n    | $Y^{4-}$    | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n5.  **Substitute equilibrium concentrations into the $K_f$ expression:**\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n6.  **Simplify and solve for x:**\n    Because the formation constant ($K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$) is very large, the equilibrium lies far to the left for the dissociation reaction. This means very little of the complex will dissociate, so 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M.\n    We can make the approximation: $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n    The expression simplifies to:\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Now, we can solve for 'x', which represents the equilibrium concentration of $Ca^{2+}$.\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n    $x^2 \\approx 0.4 \\times 10^{-12}$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\n    To solve for x, take the square root of both sides:\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = \\sqrt{0.4 \\times 10^{-12}} \\approx 0.632 \\times 10^{-6}$ M\n\n    This can be written in scientific notation as $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n7.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    The calculated concentration of calcium ions is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This matches option D.\n\nTo verify the calculation, let's use a script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nK_f = 5e10\nC_complex = 0.02\n\n# The equilibrium expression is K_f = (C_complex - x) / x^2\n# Approximating C_complex - x to C_complex\n# K_f = C_complex / x^2\n# x^2 = C_complex / K_f\n# x = sqrt(C_complex / K_f)\n\nx_squared = C_complex / K_f\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\nExecution of the code gives the following result:\n```\n6.32e-07\n```\nThe result is $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The user's question is to determine the concentration of calcium ions in a 0.02 M Ca-EDTA solution.\n\n**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Understand the chemical system:** The problem involves a solution of a metal-ligand complex, specifically Calcium-EDTA ($CaY^{2-}$). This complex is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, free calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and free EDTA ($Y^{4-}$).\n\n2.  **Write the relevant chemical reaction:** The dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex is the reaction that produces the free calcium ions we are interested in.\n    $CaY^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n3.  **Identify the equilibrium constant:** The problem provides the formation constant ($K_f$ or $K_{Ca-EDTA}$) for the complex, which corresponds to the formation reaction ($Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons CaY^{2-}$).\n    $K_f = \\frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n4.  **Set up an equilibrium table (ICE table):** Let's consider the dissociation of the complex. The initial stoichiometric concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let 'x' be the change in concentration due to dissociation. At equilibrium, 'x' will be the concentration of free $Ca^{2+}$ and free $Y^{4-}$.\n\n| Species     | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :---------- | :---------- | :--------- | :-------------- |\n| $CaY^{2-}$  | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$   | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| $Y^{4-}$    | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n5.  **Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:**\n    $K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{(x)(x)} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\n6.  **Make a simplifying approximation:** The formation constant ($K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$) is a very large number. This indicates that the equilibrium strongly favors the formation of the complex, and very little of it will dissociate. Therefore, the value of 'x' will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can reasonably assume that $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$.\n\n7.  **Solve the simplified equation for x:**\n    $5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\n    Rearrange to solve for $x^2$:\n    $x^2 \\approx \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 0.4 \\times 10^{-12} = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\n    Now, solve for x (which is $[Ca^{2+}]$):\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = \\sqrt{0.4 \\times 10^{-12}} = (\\sqrt{0.4}) \\times 10^{-6}$\n    $x \\approx 0.632 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ M}$\n    In standard scientific notation, this is $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n8.  **Check the approximation:** The calculated value $x = 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ is indeed much smaller than 0.02, so the approximation ($0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$) was valid.\n\n9.  **Compare with the provided options:**\n    A) 2.0x10⁻² M\n    B) 1.0x10⁻² M\n    C) 5.0x10⁻³ M\n    D) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\n\n    The calculated concentration of calcium ions, $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M, matches option D.\n\n**Confirmation with the Python code:**\nThe python code executed the calculation `sqrt(0.02 / 5e10)` which is the same as the manual calculation. The output was `6.32e-07`, confirming the result.\n\n<<<D>>>"
