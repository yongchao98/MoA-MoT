    "*   **Analysis of the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound containing the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   There is another significant peak at m/z = 158 (the M+2 peak), which is about one-third (32%) the intensity of the M+ peak.\n    *   This characteristic M:M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a tell-tale sign for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (due to the natural abundance of its isotopes, ~75.8% for ³⁵Cl and ~24.2% for ³⁷Cl).\n    *   Let's check the molecular weights of the options for the ³⁵Cl isotope:\n        *   All options (2-chlorobenzoic acid, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, Phenyl chloroformate) have the same molecular formula: C₇H₅ClO₂.\n        *   The molecular weight is calculated as: (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol.\n        *   For the ³⁷Cl isotope, the weight would be 158 g/mol.\n    *   Conclusion from MS: The compound has the formula C₇H₅ClO₂. All four options are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A very broad peak stretching from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is observed. This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid, where the broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a C=O (carbonyl) group stretch. This value falls squarely in the range for the carbonyl of an aromatic carboxylic acid (typically 1710-1680 cm⁻¹), often slightly higher due to conjugation or electron-withdrawing substituents.\n    *   Based on these two key peaks, the compound must be a carboxylic acid.\n    *   This allows us to eliminate option C (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde), which is a phenol and an aldehyde. While it has an O-H and C=O group, the O-H stretch of a phenol is typically less broad (~3600-3200 cm⁻¹), and the very broad peak down to 2700 cm⁻¹ is the classic sign of a carboxylic acid dimer.\n    *   We can also eliminate option D (Phenyl chloroformate), which is an acid chloride/ester hybrid. It has a C=O bond but no O-H group, so it would not show the broad peak in the 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ region.\n    *   Conclusion from IR: The compound is a carboxylic acid, narrowing the choices down to A (2-chlorobenzoic acid) and B (4-chlorobenzoic acid).\n\n*   **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   The signal at 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H) is in the far downfield region, which is characteristic of the highly deshielded proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The integration of 1H confirms one such proton. This is consistent with both remaining options A and B.\n    *   The signals in the aromatic region are key to determining the substitution pattern on the benzene ring. We see two distinct signals:\n        *   8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H)\n        *   7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H)\n    *   This pattern, two doublets each integrating to two protons, indicates a highly symmetric, 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The molecule has a plane of symmetry, making the two protons ortho to one substituent equivalent to each other, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent also equivalent to each other.\n    *   Let's examine the remaining structures:\n        *   A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid is 1,2-disubstituted (ortho). It has no such plane of symmetry. All four of its aromatic protons are in unique chemical environments and would give rise to a more complex spectrum with four distinct signals. This does not match the data.\n        *   B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid is 1,4-disubstituted (para). It possesses the required symmetry. The two protons at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to the -COOH group) are equivalent. The two protons at positions 3 and 5 (ortho to the -Cl group) are equivalent. This structure would produce exactly two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H. The protons ortho to the strongly electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group would be more deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the protons ortho to the chlorine atom would be at a slightly higher field (7.72 ppm). This matches the NMR data perfectly.\n\n*   **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   The MS data indicates a formula of C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   The IR data identifies the functional group as a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The ¹H NMR data establishes a 1,4- (para) substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n    *   Combining all the evidence, the only structure that fits all the data is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>"
