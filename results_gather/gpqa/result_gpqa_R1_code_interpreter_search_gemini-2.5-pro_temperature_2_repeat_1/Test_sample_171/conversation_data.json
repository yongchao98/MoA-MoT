    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the two stars.\n\n**1. Understand the Physical Principle**\n\nThe problem involves the population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of stars. The key information is that the stellar photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This means we can use the Boltzmann equation to describe the distribution of atoms among their different energy states.\n\n**2. The Boltzmann Equation**\n\nThe Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms `N_i` in an excited energy state `i` to the number of atoms `N_j` in a lower energy state `j`:\n\n`N_i / N_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp(-(E_i - E_j) / (k * T))`\n\nWhere:\n*   `N_i`, `N_j` are the number of atoms in states `i` and `j`.\n*   `g_i`, `g_j` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of those states.\n*   `E_i`, `E_j` are the energies of the states.\n*   `ΔE = E_i - E_j` is the energy difference between the states.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (`k ≈ 1.380649 x 10^-23 J/K`).\n*   `T` is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.\n\nIn this problem, we are comparing the \"excitation\" of iron atoms. This typically refers to the ratio of the population of an excited state (`N_i`) to the population of the ground state (`N_0`). So we will use state `j` as the ground state.\n\nThe equation for the excitation level `R` is:\n`R = N_i / N_0 = (g_i / g_0) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n\n**3. Apply the Equation to Both Stars**\n\nWe apply this formula to both star_1 (with temperature T_1) and star_2 (with temperature T_2).\n\n*   For star_1: `R_1 = (g_i / g_0) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))`\n*   For star_2: `R_2 = (g_i / g_0) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\nThe energy levels (`E_i`, `E_0`), the energy difference (`ΔE`), and the statistical weights (`g_i`, `g_0`) are properties of the iron atom, so they are the same for both stars.\n\n**4. Use the Given Information from the Problem**\n\nThe problem states that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. This means:\n`R_1 = 2 * R_2`\nor\n`R_1 / R_2 = 2`\n\n**5. Formulate the Relationship**\n\nNow, we can take the ratio of the excitation equations for the two stars:\n\n`R_1 / R_2 = [ (g_i / g_0) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) ] / [ (g_i / g_0) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]`\n\nThe constant term `(g_i / g_0)` cancels out:\n\n`R_1 / R_2 = exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\nUsing the rule of exponents `e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)`:\n\n`R_1 / R_2 = exp( [-ΔE / (k * T_1)] - [-ΔE / (k * T_2)] )`\n`R_1 / R_2 = exp( -ΔE / (k * T_1) + ΔE / (k * T_2) )`\n\nFactoring out the common term `(ΔE / k)`:\n\n`R_1 / R_2 = exp( (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) )`\n\n**6. Substitute Known Values and Simplify**\n\nWe know `R_1 / R_2 = 2`. Substituting this into the equation:\n\n`2 = exp( (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) )`\n\nTo solve for the temperatures, we take the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides:\n\n`ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)`\n\nNow, combine the fractions in the parenthesis using a common denominator `(T_1 * T_2)`:\n\n`1/T_2 - 1/T_1 = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)`\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n`ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n**7. Analyze the Numerical Constants**\n\nThe problem gives the energy difference `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^-23 J`.\nThe Boltzmann constant is `k ≈ 1.38 x 10^-23 J/K`.\n\nLet's compute the ratio `ΔE / k`:\n\n`ΔE / k = (1.38 x 10^-23 J) / (1.38 x 10^-23 J/K) = 1 K`\n\nThe factor `(ΔE / k)` is not a dimensionless `1`, but rather `1 K`. However, looking at the answer choices, they are presented as dimensionless equations. This implies a simplification where this factor is treated as a numerical value of 1. This is a common practice in physics problems where characteristic scales are used.\n\nSubstituting `ΔE / k = 1` into our derived equation:\n\n`ln(2) = 1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n`ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n**8. Conclusion**\n\nThis final expression matches option A. The derivation follows directly from the principles of statistical mechanics applied to astrophysics, and the other options do not match the resulting functional form.\n\n<<<A>>>"
