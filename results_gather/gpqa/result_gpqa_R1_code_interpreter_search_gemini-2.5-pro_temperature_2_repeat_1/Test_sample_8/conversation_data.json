    "This question asks to identify which of the given molecules possesses C3h symmetry. Let's analyze the symmetry of each molecule.\n\nThe C3h point group requires two essential symmetry elements:\n1.  A principal axis of rotation of order 3 (a C3 axis), which means the molecule looks the same after a 120° rotation.\n2.  A horizontal mirror plane (a σh plane) that is perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n\nA molecule with C3h symmetry must not have higher symmetry, such as three C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis (which would make it D3 or D3h) or vertical mirror planes (which would make it C3v).\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\n**A) Quinuclidine**\n*   **Structure**: This is a bicyclic amine, 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It has a cage-like structure.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**: There is a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon atom (CH group). The molecule can be rotated by 120° about this axis and remain unchanged. Additionally, there are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain this C3 axis and one of the three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n*   **Point Group**: The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes defines the point group as **C3v**. This is not C3h.\n\n**B) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\n*   **Structure**: This is a large, planar aromatic molecule. It consists of a triphenylene core with three anhydride rings fused symmetrically to its outer edges.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**: The molecule is planar, and its overall shape is trigonal.\n    *   It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, passing through the center of the molecule.\n    *   Because it is planar, the molecular plane itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   It also possesses three C2 axes lying within the molecular plane, passing through the center of the molecule and the center of each outer fused ring system. The presence of a C3 axis and three perpendicular C2 axes makes the point group at least D3.\n*   **Point Group**: Combining the D3 elements with the horizontal mirror plane (σh) results in the **D3h** point group. This is a higher symmetry group than C3h.\n\n**D) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\n*   **Structure**: This is the common chemical mellitic trianhydride. It is a planar molecule consisting of a central benzene ring fused with three anhydride rings.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**: Similar to option B, this molecule is planar and highly symmetric.\n    *   It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane.\n    *   The molecular plane is a σh plane.\n    *   It has three C2 axes in the molecular plane that pass through the center of the molecule and bisect the bonds connecting the anhydride groups.\n*   **Point Group**: For the same reasons as molecule B, the point group is **D3h**. This is not C3h.\n\n**C) triisopropyl borate**\n*   **Structure**: The formula is B(O-iPr)3, or B(OCH(CH3)2)3. It has a central boron atom bonded to three isopropoxy groups. The molecule is flexible due to the rotation around B-O and O-C bonds.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis**: The B(O)3 core is trigonal planar. We need to consider the conformation of the three isopropyl groups. While the lowest energy conformation is likely a C3 \"propeller\" shape, it is possible for the molecule to adopt a higher-symmetry conformation.\n    *   Consider a conformation where the B and the three O atoms lie in a plane. This plane can act as a σh plane. For this to be true, each of the three isopropyl groups must be arranged symmetrically with respect to this plane.\n    *   This can be achieved if, for each isopropyl group, the central carbon (C_a) and the hydrogen attached to it (C_a-H) also lie in the B-O plane, with the two methyl groups (-CH3) positioned symmetrically, one above the plane and one below.\n    *   In this specific conformation, there is a C3 axis perpendicular to the B(O)3 plane.\n    *   The plane containing the B, O, C_a, and H atoms is a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n    *   Crucially, this conformation does *not* have any vertical mirror planes (σv) or any C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n*   **Point Group**: The combination of a C3 axis and a σh plane, with no other symmetry elements, defines the point group as **C3h**. Although this may not be the lowest-energy conformer, it is a possible conformation, and this molecule is the only one among the options whose point group can be exactly C3h. The other molecules have rigid structures with point groups C3v or D3h.\n\nTherefore, triisopropyl borate is the molecule that has C3h symmetry.\n\n<<<C>>>"
