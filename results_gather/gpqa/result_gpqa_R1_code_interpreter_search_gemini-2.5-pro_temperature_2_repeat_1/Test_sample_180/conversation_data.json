    "The user wants to determine the ratio of neutrino fluxes in two energy bands (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV) under the hypothetical scenario that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core has just stopped.\n\n### Reasoning and Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant neutrino sources:** The Sun produces neutrinos from various nuclear reactions. We need to identify which of these reactions produce neutrinos in the specified energy ranges:\n    *   **Band 1:** 700 keV - 800 keV\n    *   **Band 2:** 800 keV - 900 keV\n\n2.  **Examine the standard solar neutrino spectrum:** Let's analyze the contributions from different branches of the proton-proton (pp) chain and other relevant reactions.\n    *   **pp-I chain (pp neutrinos):** These neutrinos have a continuous spectrum with a maximum energy of 420 keV. They do *not* contribute to either Band 1 or Band 2.\n    *   **pep reaction:** This produces monoenergetic neutrinos at 1.44 MeV (1440 keV), which is well above both bands.\n    *   **pp-III branch (Boron-8 or ⁸B neutrinos):** This reaction produces neutrinos with a continuous energy spectrum extending up to about 15 MeV. The flux from these neutrinos is relatively smooth and does not have sharp peaks or valleys. Therefore, the flux of ⁸B neutrinos in the 700-800 keV band is approximately the same as in the 800-900 keV band. Let's denote the flux from ⁸B in a given band as `Flux_B`. So, `Flux_B(band 1) ≈ Flux_B(band 2)`.\n    *   **pp-II branch (Beryllium-7 or ⁷Be neutrinos):** This branch produces neutrinos at two discrete energy lines. About 90% of them are at 861 keV, and about 10% are at 384 keV. The 384 keV line is below our bands of interest. The prominent **861 keV line falls squarely within Band 2 (800-900 keV)** and contributes nothing to Band 1 (700-800 keV).\n\n3.  **Calculate the total flux in each band (Normal Operation):**\n    *   **Flux (Band 1)** = Flux from ⁸B neutrinos.\n    *   **Flux (Band 2)** = Flux from ⁸B neutrinos + Flux from the 861 keV ⁷Be neutrinos.\n\n4.  **Analyze the hypothetical scenario:** The pp-III branch stops. This means the production of ⁸B neutrinos ceases. Since the question states this happened about 8.5 minutes ago (the light/neutrino travel time from the Sun), we would observe this effect on Earth \"now\". The pp-II branch, however, remains unaffected.\n\n5.  **Calculate the flux in each band (Hypothetical Scenario):**\n    *   The source of ⁸B neutrinos is gone.\n    *   The source of ⁷Be neutrinos (pp-II branch) remains.\n\n    *   **Flux (Band 1):** The only source in this band was the ⁸B neutrinos. With the pp-III branch stopped, the flux in this band becomes essentially zero.\n        `Flux (band 1) ≈ 0`\n\n    *   **Flux (Band 2):** The ⁸B neutrino flux is gone, but the strong monoenergetic line from the 861 keV ⁷Be neutrinos remains. The flux in this band is now dominated by these ⁷Be neutrinos and is therefore significantly greater than zero.\n        `Flux (band 2) = Flux_Be > 0`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio:**\n    The question asks for the ratio: `Flux (band 1) / Flux (band 2)`\n\n    Under the hypothetical scenario:\n    `Ratio = 0 / Flux_Be ≈ 0`\n\n7.  **Match with options:**\n    The calculated ratio is approximately zero. The options are:\n    A) 0.01 (10⁻²)\n    B) 10\n    C) 0.1 (10⁻¹)\n    D) 1\n\n    The value closest to zero is 0.01. It is not exactly zero because other minor sources like the CNO cycle contribute a very small background flux, but this is negligible compared to the main sources we've considered. The dominant effect is the removal of the ⁸B continuum, leaving the ⁷Be peak in Band 2 and virtually nothing in Band 1. Therefore, the ratio is a very small number.\n\n<<<A>>>"
