    "`Classical Electrodynamics` is a classical theory, not a quantum one. It does not deal with quantum fluctuations or virtual particles. The concept of \"regularization at high energies\" (also known as UV regularization) is a procedure specifically developed to handle infinities that arise from loop diagrams in quantum field theory (QFT). These loop diagrams represent the contributions of virtual particles at all possible energies, and the integrals over these energies often diverge at the high-energy (ultraviolet) end.\n\nLet's examine the options:\n\nA) **Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** This is the QFT of the strong force. Like other non-trivial QFTs, its calculations involving interaction loops (e.g., gluon loops) lead to infinities that must be handled by regularization and subsequently absorbed by renormalization. Thus, it requires regularization.\n\nB) **Superstring Theory:** One of the primary motivations for superstring theory is that it is believed to be a UV-finite theory. Unlike point particles in QFT, strings are extended objects. This extension \"smears out\" interactions at very short distances (high energies), naturally cutting off the divergences that plague QFTs. Therefore, it is not expected to require regularization in the same way QFTs do.\n\nC) **Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** This is the QFT of the electromagnetic force. It was the first theory where regularization and renormalization were successfully applied to make sense of infinite quantities that appeared in calculations. Thus, it certainly requires regularization.\n\nD) **Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory is governed by Maxwell's equations. As a classical theory, it does not have the quantum loop diagrams that cause UV divergences in QFTs. However, the theory does have its own infinity problem: the self-energy of an ideal point charge is infinite. To get a finite energy, one must assume the charge is not a point but is spread out over a small volume, which can be seen as a form of *classical* regularization. But this is a different issue from the \"regularization at high energies\" associated with quantum loops. The question's phrasing strongly implies the context of quantum field theory. Given that Superstring Theory is specifically designed to be finite at high energies and avoid the need for regularization found in its QFT counterparts, it is the best answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
