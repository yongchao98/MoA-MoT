    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Identify the Initial State\nThe problem states that a spin-1/2 particle is \"aligned\" with a magnetic field `B` in the `+Z` direction. This means the particle is in the lowest energy eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian.\n\n*   The magnetic moment is given by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `S` is the spin operator.\n*   The initial Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -μ ⋅ B = -γ(S_x, S_y, S_z) ⋅ (0, 0, B) = -γB S_z`.\n*   The eigenstates of `S_z` are spin-up `|+z⟩` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z⟩` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n*   The corresponding energy levels are `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_down = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n*   For the magnetic moment to be \"aligned\" with the field (i.e., point in the `+Z` direction), the system must be in the state with the lowest energy. The expectation value of the magnetic moment is `⟨μ_z⟩ = γ⟨S_z⟩`. For `⟨μ_z⟩` to be positive (aligned with `+Z`), we need `γ⟨S_z⟩ > 0`.\n    *   If `γ > 0`, the lowest energy state is `|+z⟩` (`E_up` is lower). In this state `⟨S_z⟩ = +ħ/2`, so `⟨μ_z⟩ > 0`.\n    *   If `γ < 0`, the lowest energy state is `|-z⟩` (`E_down` is lower). In this state `⟨S_z⟩ = -ħ/2`, so `⟨μ_z⟩ > 0`.\n*   Therefore, the initial state is an eigenstate of `S_z`. Let's assume the initial state is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`. We will see that the final frequency is independent of this choice.\n\n### 2. Define the New Hamiltonian and Time Evolution\nAt `t=0`, the magnetic field is \"suddenly\" switched to the `+Y` direction. The \"sudden approximation\" means the state of the particle does not have time to change. So, at `t=0+`, the state is still `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`.\n\n*   The new Hamiltonian for `t > 0` is `H = -μ ⋅ B = -γ(S_x, S_y, S_z) ⋅ (0, B, 0) = -γB S_y`.\n*   The time evolution of the state is governed by the Schrödinger equation, `|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|ψ(0)⟩`, where `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ)` is the time evolution operator.\n*   `|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-i(-γB S_y)t/ħ)|+z⟩ = exp(iγBt S_y / ħ)|+z⟩`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Expectation Value of `μ_z`\nWe need to find the oscillation frequency of the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `⟨μ_z(t)⟩`.\n\n*   `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)⟩`.\n*   Substituting `|ψ(t)⟩`, we get:\n    `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ ⟨+z| exp(-iγBt S_y / ħ) S_z exp(iγBt S_y / ħ) |+z⟩`.\n\nThis is a classic example of Larmor precession. The evolution of the expectation value `⟨S⟩` follows the classical equation of motion for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field: `d⟨S⟩/dt = γ⟨S⟩ × B`. This describes the precession of the spin vector `⟨S⟩` around the magnetic field `B` with an angular frequency known as the Larmor frequency, `ω_L`.\n\nLet's calculate this quantum mechanically. The expression `exp(-iθn⋅S/ħ) S_k exp(iθn⋅S/ħ)` represents a rotation of the operator `S_k` around the axis `n` by an angle `θ`.\n\n*   Here, the rotation axis `n` is the Y-axis.\n*   The rotation angle is `θ = γBt`.\n*   The operator `S_z` is rotated around the Y-axis. The rotated operator `S_z(t)` is:\n    `S_z(t) = S_z cos(θ) - S_x sin(θ)`.\n    `S_z(t) = S_z cos(γBt) - S_x sin(γBt)`.\n\nNow, we compute the expectation value in the initial state `|+z⟩`:\n\n*   `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = ⟨+z| S_z(t) |+z⟩ = ⟨+z| S_z cos(γBt) - S_x sin(γBt) |+z⟩`.\n*   This splits into two terms: `cos(γBt)⟨+z| S_z |+z⟩ - sin(γBt)⟨+z| S_x |+z⟩`.\n\nWe need the expectation values of `S_z` and `S_x` in the state `|+z⟩`:\n\n*   `⟨+z| S_z |+z⟩ = ħ/2` (since `|+z⟩` is an eigenstate of `S_z`).\n*   `⟨+z| S_x |+z⟩ = 0` (The expectation value of `S_x` in an eigenstate of `S_z` is zero).\n\nPlugging these values back:\n\n*   `⟨S_z(t)⟩ = (ħ/2)cos(γBt) - 0 = (ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n\nFinally, we find the expectation value of the magnetic moment's z-component:\n\n*   `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = γ⟨S_z(t)⟩ = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n\n### 4. Determine the Oscillation Frequency\nThe expression for `⟨μ_z(t)⟩` shows that it oscillates sinusoidally with time. The general form of an oscillation is `cos(ωt)`, where `ω` is the angular frequency.\n\n*   By comparing `cos(γBt)` with `cos(ωt)`, we can identify the angular frequency of oscillation as `ω = γB`.\n\nThis frequency is the Larmor frequency. If we had chosen the initial state to be `|-z⟩`, the result would have been `⟨μ_z(t)⟩ = -γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`, which has the same oscillation frequency.\n\nThe oscillation frequency is `γB`. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
