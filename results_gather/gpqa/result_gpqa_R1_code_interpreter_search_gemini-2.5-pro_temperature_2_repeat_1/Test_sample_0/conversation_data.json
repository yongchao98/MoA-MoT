    "This problem requires the application of the time-energy uncertainty principle from quantum mechanics.\n\n1.  **Understand the Time-Energy Uncertainty Principle:**\n    The principle states that the uncertainty in the energy of a quantum state (ΔE) and the lifetime of that state (Δt or τ) are related by the inequality:\n    ΔE ⋅ τ ≥ ħ/2\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n    This uncertainty in energy, ΔE, is also known as the natural linewidth of the energy level. A state with a finite lifetime does not have a perfectly defined energy. Instead, its energy is \"smeared out\" over a range ΔE. For practical purposes, we can approximate the relationship as:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n2.  **Calculate the Energy Linewidth for Each State:**\n    We are given the lifetimes for two states:\n    *   τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n\n    We need to calculate the energy uncertainty (ΔE) for each state. It's convenient to use the value of ħ in units of eV·s, which is ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n    *   For the first state (E₁):\n        ΔE₁ = ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   For the second state (E₂):\n        ΔE₂ = ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n3.  **Determine the Condition for Resolvability:**\n    To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be larger than their energy uncertainties. If the energy difference is smaller than the linewidth of either state, the two energy levels will overlap to an extent that they cannot be told apart. A common criterion for resolvability is that the energy separation must be greater than the larger of the two linewidths.\n\n    The larger linewidth is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    Therefore, the condition for the two levels to be clearly resolved is:\n    |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁\n    |E₁ - E₂| > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n4.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    We now check which of the given options satisfies this condition.\n\n    A) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is less than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Not sufficient.\n    B) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is less than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Not sufficient.\n    C) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is less than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Not sufficient.\n    D) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is much greater than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. This is a possible energy difference for the levels to be clearly resolved.\n\nLet's verify the calculations with a Python script.\n```python\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nhbar_eVs = 6.582119569e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states in seconds\ntau1 = 1e-9\ntau2 = 1e-8\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainties (natural linewidths) in eV\ndelta_E1 = hbar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = hbar_eVs / tau2\n\n# To be clearly resolved, the energy difference must be larger than the broadest linewidth.\n# The broadest linewidth corresponds to the shorter lifetime.\nresolvability_limit = max(delta_E1, delta_E2)\n\n# Print the results\nprint(f\"Linewidth of state 1 (ΔE1): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Linewidth of state 2 (ΔE2): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"To be resolved, the energy difference must be > {resolvability_limit:.3e} eV\")\n\n# Check which option is valid\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1e-8,\n    \"B\": 1e-9,\n    \"C\": 1e-11,\n    \"D\": 1e-4\n}\n\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    if value > resolvability_limit:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is a valid energy difference.\")\n        final_answer = option\n```\nLinewidth of state 1 (ΔE1): 6.582e-07 eV\nLinewidth of state 2 (ΔE2): 6.582e-08 eV\nTo be resolved, the energy difference must be > 6.582e-07 eV\nOption D (1.0e-04 eV) is a valid energy difference.\n\nThe calculation confirms that the energy separation must be greater than approximately 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.

    "The problem deals with the time-energy uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics, which connects the lifetime of a state (Δt or τ) to the uncertainty in its energy (ΔE).\n\n1.  **The Uncertainty Principle**: The relationship is given by ΔE ⋅ τ ≥ ħ/2. For practical calculations, we can approximate the minimum uncertainty (also called the natural linewidth of the energy level) as ΔE ≈ ħ / τ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\n2.  **Calculate Energy Linewidths**: A shorter lifetime leads to a larger uncertainty in energy. We need to calculate the energy uncertainty for both states.\n    *   **State 1**: Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s.\n        The energy uncertainty is ΔE₁ = ħ / τ₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   **State 2**: Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s.\n        The energy uncertainty is ΔE₂ = ħ / τ₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV.\n\n3.  **Condition for Resolvability**: For two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguished, the difference between their central energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be larger than their energy widths. If the energy difference is smaller than the linewidths, the two smeared-out energy levels will overlap significantly, making them indistinguishable. A common criterion for resolvability is that the energy separation must be greater than the broader of the two linewidths.\n\n4.  **Determine the Minimum Energy Difference**:\n    *   The broader linewidth is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV, as it corresponds to the shorter lifetime.\n    *   Therefore, the condition to resolve the two levels is |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁.\n    *   So, we need |E₁ - E₂| > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n5.  **Compare with Options**: We check which of the given options satisfies this condition.\n    *   A) 10⁻⁸ eV is less than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV is less than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV is less than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   D) 10⁻⁴ eV is much greater than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly option D provides an energy difference large enough to be clearly distinguished from the natural linewidth of the states.\n\n<<<D>>>"
