    "**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe question asks for the relationship between the number of stars per unit distance (`dN/dr`) and distance (`r`), given a relationship between the number of stars per unit parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) and parallax (`plx`).\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information:**\nThe number of stars varies with parallax as `1/plx^5`. This means the number of stars in a small parallax interval `d(plx)` is proportional to `1/plx^5`. We can write this as a proportionality:\n`dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\n**3. Identify the Relationship between Distance and Parallax:**\nDistance (`r`) and parallax (`plx`) are inversely related. The standard definition in astronomy is:\n`r = 1/plx`\nThis also means:\n`plx = 1/r`\n\n**4. Formulate a Plan using the Chain Rule:**\nWe want to find `dN/dr`. We have an expression for `dN/d(plx)`. We can relate these two derivatives using the chain rule from calculus:\n`dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n**5. Execute the Plan:**\n*   **Step 5a: Find the derivative `d(plx)/dr`**\n    We start with the relationship `plx = 1/r`. Differentiating `plx` with respect to `r` gives:\n    `d(plx)/dr = d/dr(r⁻¹) = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n\n*   **Step 5b: Express `dN/d(plx)` in terms of `r`**\n    We are given `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`.\n    Substitute `plx = 1/r` into this expression:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/(1/r)⁵ = 1/(r⁻⁵) = r⁵`\n\n*   **Step 5c: Combine the parts using the chain rule**\n    Now substitute the results from steps 5a and 5b into the chain rule formula:\n    `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (-1/r²)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ -r^(5-2)`\n    `dN/dr ∝ -r³`\n\n**6. Interpret the Result:**\nThe term `dN/dr` represents the number density of stars at a distance `r`. This quantity must be positive (we can't have a negative number of stars). The negative sign arises from the fact that as distance `r` increases, parallax `plx` decreases (an inverse relationship). When relating the densities, we are interested in the magnitude of the change.\n\nA more formal way to handle this is to relate the number of stars `dN` in a small interval. The number of stars in a distance shell `dr` must equal the number of stars in the corresponding parallax shell `d(plx)`. Since `dN` must be positive:\n`dN = |(dN/dr) * dr| = |(dN/d(plx)) * d(plx)|`\nThis implies:\n`(dN/dr) = (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n\nUsing our previously calculated values:\n`(dN/dr) ∝ (r⁵) * |-1/r²|`\n`(dN/dr) ∝ r⁵ * (1/r²)`\n`(dN/dr) ∝ r³`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars in that region of the sky per unit range of distance changes proportionally to `r³`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
