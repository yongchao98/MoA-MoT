    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Products and Reactions**\n\n*   **Product Structure:** The product in both reactions, after cyclization, is a substituted tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered cyclic ester, also known as a delta-lactone. The name indicates an ethyl group at position 4. This C4 position is a chiral center, and the products are specified as the (R) and (S) enantiomers.\n*   **Formation of a Delta-Lactone:** A delta-lactone is typically formed by the intramolecular esterification of a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid. The structure of this precursor would be HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2-OH (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid). The hydroxyl group on carbon 5 attacks the carboxylic acid on carbon 1.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\n*   The options provided are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. Let's break down this name and draw the structure.\n    *   It is a derivative of pentanedioic acid (glutaric acid) with an ethyl group at position 3.\n    *   It is a mono-ester. One carboxylic acid group is free, while the other is an isobutyl ester. By IUPAC naming conventions for acids, the free carboxylic acid carbon is C1.\n    *   Structure: `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)O-isobutyl(5)`\n*   This molecule has a single chiral center at C3 (the carbon with the ethyl group). The starting materials A and B are the (R) and (S) enantiomers of this compound.\n*   The key feature of this starting material is that it has two different functional groups that can be reduced: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-COOR`).\n\n**3. Analyze the Reagents and Reaction Pathways**\n\nThe two reactions use different reducing agents with different selectivities.\n\n**Reaction A: Reagents LiBH₄ + H⁺**\n\n1.  **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a selective reducing agent. It reduces esters to primary alcohols but reduces carboxylic acids much more slowly. Therefore, in the given starting material, LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the isobutyl ester group at C5.\n2.  **Reaction:**\n    `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu` + LiBH₄ → `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH` + isobutanol\n    The product of the reduction is 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid.\n3.  **Lactonization:** The acid workup (H⁺) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of the hydroxy acid. The hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the carboxylic acid at C1 to form the six-membered delta-lactone.\n4.  **Stereochemistry:** The reactions (reduction of the ester and lactonization) occur at C1 and C5. The chiral center at C3 is not involved in the reaction. Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained. The C3 of the starting acid becomes the C4 of the product lactone.\n    *   (R)-starting acid → (R)-lactone\n    *   (S)-starting acid → (S)-lactone\n5.  **Conclusion for Reaction A:** The product is **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This means the starting material A must have had the **(R)** configuration.\n    *   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**Reaction B: Reagents BH₃ + H⁺**\n\n1.  **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) has the opposite selectivity to LiBH₄. It selectively and rapidly reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols but is generally unreactive towards esters.\n2.  **Reaction:**\n    `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu` + BH₃ → `HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu`\n    The product of this reduction is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n3.  **Lactonization:** The acid workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The hydroxyl group at C5 attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing the isobutanol and forming the same six-membered delta-lactone.\n4.  **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the chemistry happens at the functional groups (C1 and C5) and not at the chiral center (C3). The stereochemistry at C3 is retained.\n    *   (R)-starting acid → (R)-lactone\n    *   (S)-starting acid → (S)-lactone\n5.  **Conclusion for Reaction B:** The product is **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This means the starting material B must have had the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**4. Final Matching**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
