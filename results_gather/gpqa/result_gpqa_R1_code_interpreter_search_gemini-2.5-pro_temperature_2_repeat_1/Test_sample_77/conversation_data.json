    "1.  **Identify the physical system:** The problem describes a single point charge `q` moving along a specified path $\\vec{s}(t)$. We are asked to find the scalar potential (V) and the vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) at a field point $\\vec{r}$ and time `t`.\n\n2.  **Recall the relevant physical laws:** The potentials generated by time-varying charge and current distributions are described by the retarded potentials. For a point charge, these specialized solutions are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key idea is that electromagnetic fields propagate at the speed of light, `c`. Therefore, the field measured at position $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` was generated by the charge at an earlier time, called the retarded time, $t_r$.\n\n3.  **Define the variables based on the problem statement:**\n    *   $\\vec{r}$: The position vector of the observation point.\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: The position vector of the charge `q` at the retarded time $t_r$. This is the point where the field was generated.\n    *   $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}\\Big|_{t=t_r}$: The velocity of the charge `q` at the retarded time $t_r$.\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$: The vector pointing from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}|$: The distance from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n\n4.  **Formulate the retarded time condition:** The time it takes for the signal to travel from the retarded position $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$ is $d/c$. This gives the fundamental relationship between the observation time `t` and the retarded time $t_r$:\n    $t = t_r + \\frac{d}{c} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad t_r = t - \\frac{d}{c}$\n\n5.  **State the general formulas for Liénard-Wiechert potentials:** The scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge are derived from the general retarded potential integrals. The results are:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}| (1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot (\\vec{r} - \\vec{s})}{c|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}|})} \\right]_{t_r}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}| (1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot (\\vec{r} - \\vec{s})}{c|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}|})} \\right]_{t_r}$\n    The subscript $t_r$ indicates that all quantities inside the brackets (namely $\\vec{s}$, $\\vec{v}$, and the distance $|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}|$) must be evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n6.  **Substitute the notation from the problem:**\n    Using the given notation, $|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}| = d$ and $\\vec{r} - \\vec{s} = \\vec{d}$.\n    The formulas become:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d (1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{cd})}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d (1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{cd})}$\n\n7.  **Simplify the expressions:**\n    Let's simplify the denominator term:\n    $d \\left(1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{cd}\\right) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n    So the potentials are:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\n8.  **Match with the given options:** The expressions in the options have a different form in the denominator. Let's manipulate our derived expression to match the options. Multiply the numerator and the denominator by `c`:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q \\cdot c}{(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}) \\cdot c} = \\frac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n    Putting this into the full expression for V:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    Similarly for A:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v} \\cdot c}{(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}) \\cdot c} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n9.  **Compare with the choices:**\n    *   A) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$ (Incorrect sign in the denominator)\n    *   B) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$ (Incorrect form for V, which is for a static or quasi-static charge and uses the distance to the origin `r` instead of the retarded distance `d`)\n    *   C) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$ (Incorrect form for V and A)\n    *   D) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$ (This exactly matches our derived expressions).\n\nThe factor $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$ in the denominator accounts for the relativistic effects of the moving source, including the propagation delay and a Doppler-like effect. The sign is negative because if the charge is moving towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$), the denominator becomes smaller, and the potential becomes larger, which is physically correct.\n\nFinal check of the relationship between V and A in option D:\n$\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v}}{\\epsilon_o} \\frac{qc}{4\\pi(dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot \\vec{v})} = (\\mu_o \\epsilon_o) \\vec{v} \\left( \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o(dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\frac{1}{c^2}\\vec{v}V(\\vec{r},t)$.\nThis is the correct relation, $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V$, which holds for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<D>>>"
