    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Compound A**\n\n*   The proton NMR spectrum of Compound A shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm (6H) and a quartet at 1.3 ppm (4H).\n*   The signal at 0.9 ppm is a triplet, which according to the n+1 rule, means the corresponding protons are adjacent to a group with 2 protons (a -CH2- group). The integration of 6H suggests two equivalent methyl (-CH3) groups.\n*   The signal at 1.3 ppm is a quartet, meaning the corresponding protons are adjacent to a group with 3 protons (a -CH3 group). The integration of 4H suggests two equivalent methylene (-CH2-) groups.\n*   Putting this together (two -CH3 groups next to -CH2- and two -CH2- groups next to -CH3-) strongly suggests the presence of two equivalent ethyl groups (-CH2CH3).\n*   The simplest alkane containing two ethyl groups is n-butane (CH3-CH2-CH2-CH3). Let's analyze its theoretical NMR spectrum:\n    *   The two terminal -CH3 groups are chemically equivalent. They are adjacent to a -CH2- group, so they would appear as a triplet with an integration of 6H. This matches the data (t, 0.9 ppm, 6H).\n    *   The two internal -CH2- groups are also chemically equivalent. They are adjacent to a -CH3 group (3 protons) on one side and the other -CH2- group (2 protons) on the other. Therefore, they should appear as a multiplet, specifically a sextet (3+2+1 = 6), with an integration of 4H.\n*   The problem states the signal for the 4H is a quartet, not a sextet. This is a known common simplification or inaccuracy in textbook problems. Given the subsequent reaction sequence, it is highly probable that Compound A is indeed **n-butane**. No other simple alkane fits the description as well.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Compound B and C**\n\n*   Compound A (n-butane) undergoes monobromination to form Compound B. The bromination of an alkane proceeds via a free-radical mechanism. n-butane has primary (C1) and secondary (C2) carbons. The secondary radical is more stable, so the major product will be **2-bromobutane**.\n    *   A (CH3-CH2-CH2-CH3) + Br2/light -> B (CH3-CH(Br)-CH2-CH3)\n*   Compound B (2-bromobutane) reacts with alcoholic KOH. This is a strong base in alcohol, which favors an E2 elimination reaction. According to Zaitsev's rule, elimination will favor the formation of the more substituted (more stable) alkene.\n    *   Elimination from 2-bromobutane can form 1-butene (minor product) or 2-butene (major product).\n    *   Therefore, Compound C is **2-butene** (CH3-CH=CH-CH3).\n*   The problem states that C has two geometrical isomers. This is true for 2-butene, which exists as *cis*-2-butene and *trans*-2-butene. This confirms our identification of C.\n\n**Step 3: The Diels-Alder Reaction to form Compound D**\n\n*   The *cis*-isomer of C (*cis*-2-butene) is used as the dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction.\n*   The diene is given as (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol.\n*   The product of a Diels-Alder reaction between a 1,3-diene and an alkene (dienophile) is a six-membered ring (a cyclohexene derivative).\n*   Let's identify the substituents on the final product, Compound D:\n    *   From the diene (HO-C1=C2-C3=C4-CH3): an -OH group at position 1 and a -CH3 group at position 4.\n    *   From the dienophile (*cis*-CH3-CH=CH-CH3): a -CH3 group at position 5 and a -CH3 group at position 6.\n*   The resulting structure is a **4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol**. This eliminates options C and D, which are 4,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol derivatives (which would have required 3-methylbut-1-ene as the dienophile, a compound with no geometrical isomers).\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Stereochemistry of Compound D**\n\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction is stereospecific. The stereochemistry of both the diene and the dienophile is retained in the product.\n    1.  **Dienophile stereochemistry:** We start with *cis*-2-butene. This means the two methyl groups (at the future C5 and C6) must be *cis* to each other in the final product. This means their stereochemical descriptors must correspond to a cis relationship (e.g., S,R or R,S if they are on opposite sides of the ring when flattened, or both up/both down). Option A is (5S, 6R) and option B is (5S, 6S). Let's check: (S,S) or (R,R) at adjacent chiral centers indicates a *trans* relationship, while (S,R) or (R,S) indicates a *cis* relationship. Therefore, the (5S, 6S) configuration in option B is *trans* and is impossible from *cis*-2-butene. This already strongly points to option A.\n    2.  **Full Stereochemical Analysis (Exo/Endo Rule):**\n        *   For the diene (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol, the outer substituents (-OH and C4-CH3) will be *cis* in the product.\n        *   For the dienophile (*cis*-2-butene), the two -CH3 groups will be *cis* in the product.\n        *   The overall stereochemistry depends on the transition state geometry (endo vs. exo). While the endo rule is often favored, steric hindrance between the C4-methyl group of the diene and the incoming methyl groups of the dienophile favors the **exo** transition state.\n        *   In the exo approach, the dienophile substituents are oriented *cis* to the outer substituents of the diene.\n        *   This means all four major substituents (-OH at C1, -CH3 at C4, -CH3 at C5, -CH3 at C6) end up on the same side of the cyclohexene ring (all *cis* to each other).\n    3.  **Assigning Absolute Configuration:** We assign the R/S configuration to the all-*cis* isomer. Assuming the enantiomer starting with 1S:\n        *   C1 is **S**\n        *   C4 is **R**\n        *   C5 is **S**\n        *   C6 is **R**\n    *   This gives the final product D as **(1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol**.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
