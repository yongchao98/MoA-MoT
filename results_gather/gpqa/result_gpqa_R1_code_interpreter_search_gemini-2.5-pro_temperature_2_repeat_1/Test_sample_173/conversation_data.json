    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Define Variables and Extract Given Information**\n\n*   Initial nucleus:\n    *   Rest mass: `M`\n    *   Initial state: at rest.\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`\n*   Final fragments:\n    *   Rest masses: `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   `m1` is the more massive fragment. Let `T1` be its kinetic energy.\n*   Relationships given:\n    *   `m1 = 2 * m2`\n    *   `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\n**2. Calculate Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\nFirst, let's find the rest masses `m1` and `m2` in terms of `M`.\nSubstitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the second equation:\n`(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow, find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, calculate their rest-mass energies:\n*   `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`\n*   `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe total energy released as kinetic energy (`Q`) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies. This is due to the conservation of total energy.\n`Q = Initial_Rest_Energy - Final_Rest_Energy`\n`Q = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: `Q = T1 + T2`.\n`Q = 3 GeV = 3000 MeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`, where `p` is momentum.\nThe initial nucleus is at rest, so the initial momentum is zero. By conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero. This means the fragments fly apart with equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of their momentum be `p`.\n`p1 = p2 = p`\n\nNow we can relate the kinetic energies of the two fragments:\n`T1_classical = p^2 / (2 * m1)`\n`T2_classical = p^2 / (2 * m2)`\n\nDivide the two equations:\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / (2 * m1)) / (p^2 / (2 * m2)) = m2 / m1`\nSince `m1 = 2 * m2`, the ratio `m2 / m1 = 1 / 2`.\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = 1 / 2  => T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`\n\nNow use the total kinetic energy:\n`T1_classical + T2_classical = Q`\n`T1_classical + (2 * T1_classical) = Q`\n`3 * T1_classical = Q`\n`T1_classical = Q / 3 = 3000 MeV / 3 = 1000 MeV`\n\n**5. Calculate T1 using Relativistic (Correct) Formulation**\n\nIn relativity, we use conservation of total energy and momentum.\n*   Conservation of Energy: `M*c^2 = E1 + E2`, where `E` is the total energy (rest + kinetic). `E = T + m*c^2`.\n*   Conservation of Momentum: `p1 = p2 = p` (in magnitude).\n\nThe relativistic energy-momentum relation is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\nFor the two fragments:\n1) `E1^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m1*c^2)^2`\n2) `E2^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m2*c^2)^2`\n\nSince the initial nucleus is at rest, we can derive a direct formula for the total energy of fragment 1:\n`E1 = ( (M*c^2)^2 + (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2 ) / ( 2 * M*c^2 )`\n\nLet's plug in the values (all in GeV):\n`E1 = ( 300^2 + 198^2 - 99^2 ) / ( 2 * 300 )`\n`E1 = ( 90000 + 39204 - 9801 ) / 600`\n`E1 = 119403 / 600 = 199.005 GeV`\n\nThe kinetic energy `T1` is the total energy `E1` minus the rest-mass energy `m1*c^2`:\n`T1_relativistic = E1 - m1*c^2`\n`T1_relativistic = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n`T1_relativistic = 1005 MeV`\n\n**6. Find the Difference**\n\nThe final step is to find the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n`Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n`Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nTo verify the calculations, let's use a Python script.\n```python\n# All energy values are in GeV for the calculation\n\n# Given initial rest-mass energy\nMc2 = 300.0\n\n# Calculate rest-mass energies of the fragments\n# m1 = 2*m2 and m1+m2 = 0.99*M\n# This gives m1 = 0.66*M and m2 = 0.33*M\nm1c2 = 0.66 * Mc2\nm2c2 = 0.33 * Mc2\n\n# Calculate total kinetic energy release (Q-value)\nQ = Mc2 - (m1c2 + m2c2)\n\n# Classical calculation for T1\n# From momentum conservation, T1/T2 = m2/m1 = 1/2.\n# With T1+T2 = Q, this gives T1 = Q/3.\nT1_classical_GeV = Q / 3.0\nT1_classical_MeV = T1_classical_GeV * 1000\n\n# Relativistic calculation for T1\n# The total energy of the first fragment (E1) from 2-body decay is:\n# E1 = ( (Mc2)^2 + (m1c2)^2 - (m2c2)^2 ) / ( 2 * Mc2 )\nE1_GeV = (Mc2**2 + m1c2**2 - m2c2**2) / (2 * Mc2)\n# The kinetic energy T1 is E1 minus the rest energy m1c2\nT1_relativistic_GeV = E1_GeV - m1c2\nT1_relativistic_MeV = T1_relativistic_GeV * 1000\n\n# Calculate the difference\ndifference_MeV = T1_relativistic_MeV - T1_classical_MeV\n\nprint(f\"{difference_MeV}\")\n```\n5.0\n\nThe difference is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>",
