    "*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    *   `butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile`\n    *   This is a nucleophilic addition reaction, specifically the formation of a cyanohydrin.\n    *   Butan-2-one is a ketone. NaCN provides the nucleophile, the cyanide ion (CN⁻).\n    *   The mechanism involves the attack of the CN⁻ on the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms an alkoxide intermediate.\n    *   `CH3-CO-CH2-CH3 + CN⁻ → (CH3)(C2H5)C(O⁻)(CN)`\n    *   This alkoxide intermediate must be protonated to form the final product, which has a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   `(CH3)(C2H5)C(O⁻)(CN) + H⁺ → (CH3)(C2H5)C(OH)(CN)` (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile)\n    *   Therefore, reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺). This is typically a mineral acid, represented generically as H₃O⁺. Among the options for A, H₃O⁺ is the most appropriate proton source for this step. NaHSO₃ is a reagent for forming bisulfite adducts and is not the correct reagent 'A' in this context. Thus, we can narrow down our choices to options A and C.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n    *   `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`\n    *   This reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   This transformation is known as nitrile hydrolysis.\n    *   Nitrile hydrolysis requires water (H₂O) and is catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base.\n    *   Looking at the options for reagent B, we have HCl and CH₃COOH. Both are acids.\n    *   HCl is a strong mineral acid.\n    *   CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is a weak organic acid.\n    *   For the complete hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, a strong acid like HCl is generally required and much more effective than a weak acid like CH₃COOH. The reaction proceeds faster and to completion under strongly acidic conditions.\n    *   Therefore, B = HCl is the more suitable reagent.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the analysis of Reaction 1, A = H₃O⁺.\n    *   Based on the analysis of Reaction 2, B = HCl.\n    *   Combining these two findings, the correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
