    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe primary goal is to compare the transit probabilities of two exoplanets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, to decide which one is a better candidate for observation.\n\n**2. Define Transit Probability:**\nThe geometric probability of a planet transiting its host star is the ratio of the stellar radius (`R_s`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`). For a circular orbit, the semi-major axis is simply the orbital radius.\n`p_transit = R_s / a`\n\n**3. Set up the Ratio:**\nWe need to find the ratio of the transit probability of Planet_1 to that of Planet_2.\n`Ratio = p_transit_1 / p_transit_2 = (R_s1 / a_1) / (R_s2 / a_2)`\nThis can be rewritten as:\n`Ratio = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (a_2 / a_1)`\n\n**4. Use the Given Information:**\nLet's analyze the information provided in the problem statement:\n*   The host stars have the same radii: `R_s1 = R_s2`. This means the term `(R_s1 / R_s2)` is equal to 1.\n*   The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: `P_2 = 3 * P_1`.\n*   The mass of the host star of Planet_1 is twice that of Planet_2's host: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`.\n\nWith `R_s1 = R_s2`, the probability ratio simplifies to:\n`Ratio = a_2 / a_1`\n\n**5. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Known Quantities:**\nTo find the ratio `a_2 / a_1`, we must express the semi-major axis `a` in terms of the orbital period `P` and stellar mass `M_s`. We can do this using Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion. The law states:\n`P^2 = (4π² * a³) / (G * (M_s + m_p))`\nwhere `G` is the gravitational constant and `m_p` is the planet's mass.\n\nSince the problem states the planets are \"Earth-like\", their masses (`m_p`) are negligible compared to the masses of their host stars (`M_s`). Therefore, `(M_s + m_p)` can be accurately approximated as `M_s`.\nThe simplified law becomes:\n`P² ≈ (4π² * a³) / (G * M_s)`\n\nNow, we solve for the semi-major axis, `a`:\n`a³ ≈ (G * M_s * P²) / (4π²)`\n`a ≈ [ (G * M_s * P²) / (4π²) ]^(1/3)`\n\nSince `G` and `4π²` are constants, we can establish a proportionality:\n`a ∝ (M_s * P²)^(1/3)`\n\n**6. Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:**\nUsing the proportionality, we can write the ratio `a_2 / a_1` as:\n`a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * P_2²) / (M_s1 * P_1²) ]^(1/3)`\n\nNow, substitute the known relationships (`P_2 = 3 * P_1` and `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`):\n`a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * (3 * P_1)²) / ((2 * M_s2) * P_1²) ]^(1/3)`\n`a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * 9 * P_1²) / (2 * M_s2 * P_1²) ]^(1/3)`\n\nCancel out the common terms (`M_s2` and `P_1²`):\n`a_2 / a_1 = (9 / 2)^(1/3)`\n`a_2 / a_1 = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\n**7. Compute the Final Value:**\nNow we calculate the numerical value.\n```python\nimport math\n\nratio = math.pow(4.5, 1/3)\nprint(ratio)\n```\n```output\n1.6509640131429995\n```\nThe result is approximately 1.65.\n\n**8. Conclusion:**\nThe ratio of the probabilities is `p_transit_1 / p_transit_2 = a_2 / a_1 ≈ 1.65`.\nThis means that the transit probability of Planet_1 is about 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, Planet_1 is the preferred target for observation. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The transit probability (`p_transit`) of a planet is given by the ratio of the stellar radius (`R_s`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`), assuming a random inclination. For circular orbits, the formula is:\n`p_transit = R_s / a`\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the transit probability of Planet_1 to that of Planet_2:\n`Ratio = p_transit_1 / p_transit_2`\n`Ratio = (R_s1 / a_1) / (R_s2 / a_2)`\n\nThis can be rearranged as:\n`Ratio = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (a_2 / a_1)`\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following information:\n1.  The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: `P_2 = 3 * P_1`.\n2.  The mass of the host star of Planet_1 is twice that of Planet_2: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`.\n3.  Both host stars have the same radii: `R_s1 = R_s2`.\n\nUsing the fact that `R_s1 = R_s2`, the term `(R_s1 / R_s2)` becomes 1. Our ratio simplifies to:\n`Ratio = a_2 / a_1`\n\nTo find the ratio of the semi-major axes, we use Kepler's Third Law. The law relates the orbital period (`P`), the semi-major axis (`a`), and the mass of the host star (`M_s`), assuming the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star's mass (`m_p << M_s`):\n`P^2 = (4π^2 / (G * M_s)) * a^3`\nwhere `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for `a`:\n`a^3 = (G * M_s * P^2) / (4π^2)`\nThis shows that `a` is proportional to `(M_s * P^2)^(1/3)`.\n\nNow, we can express the ratio `a_2 / a_1` in terms of the stellar masses and orbital periods:\n`a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * P_2^2) / (M_s1 * P_1^2) ]^(1/3)`\n\nSubstitute the known relationships (`P_2 = 3 * P_1` and `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`) into the equation:\n`a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * (3 * P_1)^2) / ((2 * M_s2) * P_1^2) ]^(1/3)`\n`a_2 / a_1 = [ (M_s2 * 9 * P_1^2) / (2 * M_s2 * P_1^2) ]^(1/3)`\n\nCancel the common terms `M_s2` and `P_1^2`:\n`a_2 / a_1 = (9 / 2)^(1/3)`\n`a_2 / a_1 = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\nCalculating the value:\n`a_2 / a_1 ≈ 1.65096`\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the transit probabilities is:\n`Ratio = p_transit_1 / p_transit_2 = a_2 / a_1 ≈ 1.65`\n\nThis means that the transit probability of Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Consequently, the researchers should prefer to observe Planet_1.\n\n<<<A>>>"
