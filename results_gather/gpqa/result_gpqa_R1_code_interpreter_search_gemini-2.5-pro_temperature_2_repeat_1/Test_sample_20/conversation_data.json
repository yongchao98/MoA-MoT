    "*   **Step 1: Analyze Tautomerism for Compound A**\n\n    Tautomerism, specifically keto-enol tautomerism, is an equilibrium between a keto form (containing a C=O group) and an enol form (containing a C=C-OH group). This process requires the presence of an \"alpha-hydrogen,\" which is a hydrogen atom on the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n\n    *   **Benzoquinone (specifically p-benzoquinone):** The structure consists of a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbon atoms alpha (adjacent) to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds. These alpha-carbons are bonded to other carbon atoms within the ring and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached to them. Without an alpha-hydrogen, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n        \n         ![Structure of p-benzoquinone](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/P-Benzoquinone-2D-skeletal.svg/200px-P-Benzoquinone-2D-skeletal.svg.png) \n        *The alpha-carbons (adjacent to C=O) have no attached hydrogens.*\n\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** The structure is a six-membered ring with three C=O groups separated by CH₂ groups. The carbon atoms of these CH₂ groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are alpha to two carbonyl groups each. They have two acidic alpha-hydrogens. These hydrogens can be removed, allowing the molecule to tautomerize to its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is an aromatic compound, which is exceptionally stable. Due to this stabilization, the equilibrium heavily favors the aromatic enol form. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily exhibits tautomerism.\n        \n         ![Tautomerism of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione](https://www.chem.ucla.edu/~harding/IGOC/P/phloroglucinol01.png) \n        *The keto form has alpha-hydrogens and tautomerizes to the very stable aromatic enol form.*\n\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Benzoquinone is the compound that does not show tautomerism. Thus, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze Optical Isomerism for Compound B**\n\n    Optical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is typically chiral if it contains at least one chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) and lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n        \n        Since this carbon atom is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism (it has two non-superimposable mirror images, or enantiomers).\n\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene with a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃) on each of the double-bonded carbons. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule is planar around the double bond. It does not contain any carbon atom bonded to four different groups, so it has no chiral center. The molecule possesses a center of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image, meaning it is achiral. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the compound that will show optical isomerism. Thus, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Combine the Results**\n\n    Based on the analysis:\n    *   Compound A (no tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n    This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
