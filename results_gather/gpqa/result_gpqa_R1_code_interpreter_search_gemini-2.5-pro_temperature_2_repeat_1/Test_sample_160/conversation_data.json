    "This problem requires a comparison between two different types of mean free paths in the same environment. Let's break down the physics behind each one.\n\n### 1. Understanding Mean Free Path (MFP)\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula for the mean free path of a particle moving through a collection of target particles is:\n\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\n\nWhere:\n*   `n` is the number density of the target particles (number of particles per unit volume).\n*   `σ` is the collision cross-section, which represents the effective area that a target particle presents to the moving particle for a collision to occur.\n\nIn this scenario, the sample compartment's vacuum state, volume, and temperature are constant (before and after the beam is on). According to the ideal gas law (P = nkT), the number density of the gas molecules (`n_gas`) remains the same in both scenarios.\n\nTherefore, the difference between λ1 and λ2 must arise from the difference in their respective collision cross-sections (σ).\n\n### 2. Analyzing λ1: Gas Molecule - Gas Molecule Collisions\n\n*   λ1 represents the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves. This involves a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules.\n*   The particles are of similar size and mass, and their collisions are primarily governed by their kinetic size (van der Waals radius). This can be modeled as a \"billiard ball\" or hard-sphere collision.\n*   The collision cross-section, let's call it σ1, is therefore related to the physical diameter of the gas molecules. For two identical spherical molecules of diameter d, the cross-section is σ1 = πd².\n*   A more precise formula for MFP in a gas of identical particles includes a factor of √2 to account for the relative motion of the target particles, so λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n_gas * σ1). However, the key component is σ1, the geometric cross-section.\n\n### 3. Analyzing λ2: Electron - Gas Molecule Collisions\n\n*   λ2 is defined based on electron scattering with the gas molecules. Here, the moving particle is a high-energy electron (1000 kV), and the target particles are the stationary (in comparison) gas molecules.\n*   The collision here is not a simple physical impact. It is an electromagnetic interaction (scattering) between the charged electron and the electric field of the gas molecule (its nucleus and its electron cloud).\n*   The range of the electromagnetic force is much greater than the physical size of the molecule. An electron can be significantly deflected (scattered) even if it passes at a distance much larger than the molecule's radius.\n*   This means the effective area for an interaction, the electron scattering cross-section (σ2), is significantly **larger** than the geometric collision cross-section of the gas molecules (σ1). The gas molecule presents a much \"bigger target\" to an incoming electron than it does to another gas molecule.\n\n### 4. Comparing λ1 and λ2\n\nWe have:\n*   λ1 is inversely proportional to σ1 (gas-gas geometric cross-section).\n*   λ2 is inversely proportional to σ2 (electron-gas scattering cross-section).\n*   The number density `n_gas` is the same for both calculations.\n\nFrom our analysis, we concluded that the electron scattering cross-section is much larger than the gas-gas collision cross-section:\n\nσ2 > σ1\n\nSince the mean free path is inversely proportional to the cross-section (λ ∝ 1/σ), a larger cross-section leads to a shorter mean free path.\n\nTherefore, it must be that:\n\nλ2 < λ1\n\nThe electron, experiencing a larger effective target area for each gas molecule, is much more likely to interact (scatter) and thus travels a shorter average distance between these interactions compared to a gas molecule traveling amongst its peers.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mean free path based on electron scattering (λ2) is shorter than the mean free path of gas-gas collisions (λ1) because the electron-gas scattering cross-section is larger than the gas-gas geometric cross-section.\n\n<<<C>>>"
