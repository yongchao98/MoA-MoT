    "This problem requires us to calculate the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in a buffer solution containing KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O.\n\n1.  **Understand the chemical species in solution:**\n    *   KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate).\n    *   Na2HPO4●2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+, HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and water.\n    *   This creates a buffer system consisting of the weak acid H2PO4- and its conjugate base HPO4^2-.\n\n2.  **Determine the equilibrium that governs the pH of the solution:**\n    The primary equilibrium in this buffer is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H3PO4):\n    H2PO4- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-\n    This equilibrium is described by the acid dissociation constant Ka2 = 6.2 x 10^-8.\n\n3.  **Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components:**\n    *   Volume (V) = 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L\n    *   Molar mass of KH2PO4 = 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O = 177.99 g/mol\n\n    *   Moles of H2PO4- = (1.00 g) / (136.09 g/mol) = 0.007348 moles\n    *   Concentration of H2PO4- = (0.007348 moles) / (0.200 L) = 0.03674 M\n\n    *   Moles of HPO4^2- = (1.00 g) / (177.99 g/mol) = 0.005618 moles\n    *   Concentration of HPO4^2- = (0.005618 moles) / (0.200 L) = 0.02809 M\n\n4.  **Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] in the buffer:**\n    Using the expression for Ka2:\n    Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n    Rearranging to solve for [H+]:\n    [H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n    [H+] = (6.2 x 10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M) = 8.11 x 10^-8 M\n\n5.  **Calculate the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-):**\n    The orthophosphate ion is produced from the dissociation of hydrogen phosphate, which is the third dissociation step of phosphoric acid:\n    HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-\n    This equilibrium is described by the acid dissociation constant Ka3 = 1.8 x 10^-12.\n\n    Using the expression for Ka3:\n    Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n    Rearranging to solve for [PO4^3-]:\n    [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * ([HPO4^2-] / [H+])\n\n    We use the equilibrium concentrations of HPO4^2- and H+. Since Ka3 is very small, the amount of HPO4^2- that dissociates is negligible, so its equilibrium concentration is approximately its initial concentration (0.02809 M). We use the [H+] calculated from the buffer system.\n\n    [PO4^3-] = (1.8 x 10^-12) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10^-8 M) = 6.236 x 10^-7 M\n\nThis calculation can be performed using a single script for precision.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given constants\nV_L = 0.200 # Volume in Liters\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00 # g\nMw_KH2PO4 = 136.09 # g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00 # g\nMw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99 # g/mol\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate moles and initial concentrations\nmoles_H2PO4_minus = mass_KH2PO4 / Mw_KH2PO4\nmoles_HPO4_2minus = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / Mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\n\nconc_H2PO4_minus = moles_H2PO4_minus / V_L\nconc_HPO4_2minus = moles_HPO4_2minus / V_L\n\n# Step 2: Calculate [H+] from the buffer equilibrium (Ka2)\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4-] -> [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-]/[HPO4^2-]\nconc_H_plus = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4_minus / conc_HPO4_2minus)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate [PO4^3-] from the Ka3 equilibrium\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] -> [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]/[H+]\n# We assume [HPO4^2-] at equilibrium is the same as the initial concentration due to very low Ka3\nconc_PO4_3minus = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4_2minus / conc_H_plus)\n\nprint(f\"{conc_PO4_3minus:.3e}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\n6.236e-07\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.236 x 10^-7 M.

    "Here's the step-by-step reasoning behind the calculation:\n\n1.  **Identify the Components and Reactions:**\n    *   We have a solution containing potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4●2H2O).\n    *   In water, these salts dissociate completely:\n        *   KH2PO4(s) → K+(aq) + H2PO4-(aq)\n        *   Na2HPO4●2H2O(s) → 2 Na+(aq) + HPO4^2-(aq) + 2 H2O(l)\n    *   The key species are the dihydrogen phosphate ion (H2PO4-) and the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO4^2-). These form a buffer pair corresponding to the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H3PO4).\n\n2.  **Calculate Initial Concentrations:**\n    *   First, we need to find the molar concentration of each component in the 200.00 cm³ (0.200 L) solution.\n    *   Moles of KH2PO4 (and thus H2PO4-) = mass / Molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 moles.\n    *   Initial concentration of H2PO4- = [H2PO4-] = 0.007348 moles / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M.\n    *   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O (and thus HPO4^2-) = mass / Molar mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 moles.\n    *   Initial concentration of HPO4^2- = [HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 moles / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M.\n\n3.  **Determine the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H+] of the Buffer:**\n    *   The pH of the buffer is determined by the equilibrium involving the buffer pair (H2PO4- and HPO4^2-). This is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid, described by Ka2.\n    *   H2PO4-(aq) ⇌ H+(aq) + HPO4^2-(aq)\n    *   The equilibrium expression is: Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for [H+]: [H+] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-])\n    *   Using the initial concentrations as a good approximation for the equilibrium concentrations (because K is small):\n    *   [H+] = (6.2 x 10^-8) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M) ≈ 8.11 x 10^-8 M.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO4^3-]:**\n    *   The orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) is formed in the third dissociation step of phosphoric acid:\n    *   HPO4^2-(aq) ⇌ H+(aq) + PO4^3-(aq)\n    *   This equilibrium is described by Ka3 = 1.8 x 10^-12.\n    *   The equilibrium expression is: Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n    *   We rearrange to solve for the unknown, [PO4^3-]:\n    *   [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * ([HPO4^2-] / [H+])\n    *   We use the concentration of [H+] calculated from the buffer in the previous step and the initial concentration of [HPO4^2-] (since its dissociation is negligible due to the very small Ka3).\n    *   [PO4^3-] = (1.8 x 10^-12) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10^-8 M)\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The python code performed this final calculation precisely:\n        ```\n        conc_PO4_3minus = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) / 8.11e-8\n        ```\n    *   This gives a result of **6.236 x 10^-7 M**.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.236 x 10^-7 M.\n    *   This value matches option A (6.24 x 10^-7 M) when rounded to three significant figures.\n\n<<<A>>>"
