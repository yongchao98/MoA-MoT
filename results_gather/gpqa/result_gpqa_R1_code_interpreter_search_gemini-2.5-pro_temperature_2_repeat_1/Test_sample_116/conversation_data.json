    "*   **Analysis of the Molecules**\n\n    Optical isomerism is a property of chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality in organic molecules are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality (due to restricted rotation about a single bond, as seen in some substituted biphenyls).\n\n    1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This is a substituted biphenyl compound. The two phenyl rings are linked by a C-C single bond. The positions ortho to this bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6') are occupied by bulky groups: nitro (-NO₂) and dimethyl carboxylate (-COOCH₃). These bulky groups hinder the free rotation around the C-C single bond connecting the rings. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, forces the two rings to be in different planes. Because the substitution pattern on each ring is asymmetric, the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. It is therefore chiral and will have a non-superimposable mirror image. Thus, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n    2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This molecule is an ester commonly known as methyl lactate. Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). This carbon is attached to four different groups:\n        *   A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        *   A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        *   A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        *   A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n        Since this carbon atom is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are always chiral and thus exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n    3.  **benzophenone**: The structure is C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅. The central carbon is part of a carbonyl group (C=O), so it is sp² hybridized and bonded to only three groups (two phenyl rings and one oxygen atom). There are no chiral centers. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the molecule through the C=O group. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral and cannot be optically active. Therefore, benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n    4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which has a *trans* geometry about the carbon-carbon double bond. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule is planar. It has a center of symmetry (inversion center) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. A molecule with a center of symmetry is achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n\n    Based on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate (1) and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2) are chiral and exhibit optical isomerism. Benzophenone (3) and dimethyl fumarate (4) are achiral and do not.\n\n    Therefore, the correct combination is 1 and 2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
