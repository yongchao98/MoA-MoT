    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH), bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents performs an α-halogenation of the carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The α-carbon of acetic acid is brominated.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH₂-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (BrCH₂COOH), ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH), and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid reacts with the alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃) and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (S_N2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbon bonded to bromine and displacing the bromide ion (Br⁻), which is a good leaving group.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (NC-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH₂)₅-Br).\n*   **Reaction analysis:**\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that removes one of the acidic α-protons from ethyl cyanoacetate. These protons are acidic because they are positioned between two electron-withdrawing groups (a nitrile and an ester carbonyl). This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion (enolate): [NC-CH-COOCH₂CH₃]⁻.\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The carbanion attacks one of the carbons in 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing one bromine atom in an S_N2 reaction. This forms an intermediate: NC-CH(COOCH₂CH₃)-(CH₂)₅-Br.\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since \"excess\" NaH is used, the remaining acidic α-proton on the intermediate is also removed, forming a new carbanion: [NC-C(COOCH₂CH₃)-(CH₂)₅-Br]⁻.\n    4.  **Cyclization:** The carbanion within this intermediate now attacks the other end of the pentane chain, displacing the second bromine atom in an intramolecular S_N2 reaction. This reaction forms a ring. The ring will contain the α-carbon and the five carbons from the pentane chain, resulting in a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is **1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane**.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4 (1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane)**\n\nNow, we must determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in this final product. Chemical non-equivalence is determined by the absence of symmetry operations (like planes or axes of symmetry) that can interchange protons.\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring where one carbon (C1) is attached to two different substituents: a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nLet's analyze the symmetry and the different types of protons:\n\n1.  **Ring Protons:**\n    *   The two substituents on C1 (-CN and -COOCH₂CH₃) are different. This breaks any potential plane of symmetry that would pass through the C1-C4 axis of the ring.\n    *   Because there is no such plane of symmetry, the carbons on one side of the ring are not equivalent to the carbons on the other side.\n        *   C2 is not equivalent to C6.\n        *   C3 is not equivalent to C5.\n        *   C4 is unique.\n    *   This gives us 5 distinct methylene (-CH₂-) groups in the ring: C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6.\n    *   Now, we must consider the protons on each methylene group. In a cyclohexane ring, the two geminal protons on a single carbon atom (the axial and equatorial protons) are diastereotopic (they have different spatial relationships with the rest of the molecule) and thus are chemically distinct.\n    *   The most rigorous count gives 2 distinct protons for each of the 5 distinct methylene groups. This would lead to 10 signals from the ring protons.\n    *   However, at room temperature, many substituted cyclohexanes undergo rapid chair-chair interconversion. This flipping averages the chemical environments of the axial and equatorial protons. If we assume this fast-flipping model, each of the 5 distinct methylene groups gives rise to one time-averaged signal.\n    *   Under the fast-flipping assumption, the ring protons contribute **5 signals**.\n\n2.  **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The C1 carbon of the ring is attached to four different groups: -CN, -COOCH₂CH₃, and the two different paths around the ring (-C2-C3... and -C6-C5...). Therefore, C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The methylene (-OCH₂-) group of the ethyl ester is adjacent to this chiral center. Protons on a CH₂ group adjacent to a chiral center are diastereotopic and are chemically non-equivalent. They should give two separate signals.\n    *   The methyl (-CH₃) group has three equivalent protons due to free rotation, which give one signal.\n    *   Therefore, a strict analysis of the ethyl group yields 2 signals from the -OCH₂- protons and 1 signal from the -CH₃ protons, for a total of **3 signals**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nCombining the two simplifying assumptions that are most common for such problems at room temperature:\n*   Fast ring-flipping model for the cyclohexane ring: **5 signals**.\n*   Strict diastereotopicity model for the ethyl group attached to a chiral center: **3 signals**.\n\nTotal signals = 5 (from ring) + 3 (from ethyl) = **8**.\n\nLet's quickly check other possibilities. If we assumed a locked ring (10 signals) and a simplified ethyl group (2 signals, ignoring diastereotopicity), we would get 12 signals. However, it's inconsistent to assume the ring is chiral (giving 10 distinct signals) while ignoring the consequence of that chirality on the adjacent ethyl group. The analysis leading to 8 signals is more self-consistent under common simplifying physical assumptions (fast flipping). The fact that an alternative, more complex symmetry argument also leads to 8 reinforces this conclusion.\n\nThus, the number of distinct hydrogen signals is 8.\n\n<<<A>>>"
