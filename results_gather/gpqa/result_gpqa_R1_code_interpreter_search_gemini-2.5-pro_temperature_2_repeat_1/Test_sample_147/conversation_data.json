    "I will solve this step-by-step, analyzing each piece of information provided in the problem statement.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the mass percentage of fluorine in compound A2.**\n\nThe problem states that substance A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), with the formula YFm. The mass percentage of fluorine (ωF) is given as 31.96%. We can use this to find a relationship between the atomic mass of Y (M(Y)) and the number of fluorine atoms (m).\n\nThe formula for mass percentage is:\nωF = (m * M(F)) / (M(Y) + m * M(F))\n\nUsing the atomic mass of fluorine, M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol, and the given percentage:\n0.3196 = (m * 19.00) / (M(Y) + m * 19.00)\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for M(Y):\nM(Y) + 19.00m = (m * 19.00) / 0.3196\nM(Y) + 19.00m ≈ 59.45m\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45m\n\nNow, we can test integer values for 'm' (the number of fluorine atoms) to find plausible atomic masses for element Y.\n*   If m = 1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Calcium)\n*   If m = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.90 g/mol (close to Bromine)\n*   If m = 3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (very close to Antimony, Sb, M=121.76 g/mol)\n*   If m = 4, M(Y) ≈ 161.80 g/mol (close to Dysprosium, Dy, M=162.50 g/mol)\n*   If m = 5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (close to Gold or Mercury)\n\nLet's calculate the theoretical fluorine percentage for the most likely candidates:\n*   For Y = Sb (Antimony) and m = 3 (compound SbF3):\n    ωF(SbF3) = (3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 * 19.00) = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%. This is extremely close to the given 31.96% (a relative difference of only 0.25%).\n*   For Y = Dy (Dysprosium) and m = 4 (compound DyF4):\n    ωF(DyF4) = (4 * 19.00) / (162.50 + 4 * 19.00) = 76 / 238.50 ≈ 0.31865 or 31.87%. This is also extremely close.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the chemical properties to identify Y.**\n\nLet's compare the chemical properties of Antimony and Dysprosium with the problem description.\n*   **A1 oxidizes xenon:** This implies A1 is a very strong oxidizing agent, typically a high-valent fluoride. Antimony forms SbF5, which is a very strong Lewis acid and can participate in reactions that oxidize xenon (e.g., forming salts like [XeF][Sb2F11]). A hypothetical higher fluoride of antimony (A1) would be an even stronger oxidizer. Dysprosium is an electropositive lanthanide metal and is not known to form compounds that can oxidize xenon. This strongly favors **Y = Sb**.\n*   **Other clues:** While other clues like \"five binary compounds\" and \"bright-red substance A1\" do not perfectly match the known chemistry of antimony (only SbF3 and SbF5 are common, and both are colorless/white), these are more likely to be idealized or erroneous statements in a complex problem than the core chemical reactivity and mass percentage data. For instance, A1 could be a hypothetical unstable, colored higher fluoride that decomposes to A2.\n\nBased on the combination of the mass percentage calculation and chemical properties, we can confidently identify **Y = Sb** (Antimony) and **A2 = SbF3**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the other substances, particularly A4.**\n\nWith Y = Sb, we can deduce the identities of the other compounds.\n*   **A2 = SbF3**.\n*   **A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y and interacts with xenon:** The exhaustive fluorination of antimony yields antimony pentafluoride, SbF5. SbF5 is a known interactor with xenon. So, **A3 = SbF5**.\n*   **A1 decomposes into A2 (SbF3) and fluorine:** This means A1 must be a higher fluoride than SbF3. The most logical candidate is SbF5, though the decomposition conditions given are unusual.\n*   **A4 is used in a reaction with element Y:** The reaction is described as \"adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained\". This describes a comproportionation reaction, where an element in its zero oxidation state (Y) reacts with a compound of the same element in a higher oxidation state (A4) to form a product in an intermediate oxidation state (A5).\n\nThe most well-known comproportionation reaction for antimony is:\n2 Sb(0) + 3 SbF5(+5) → 5 SbF3(+3)\n\nFor this type of reaction to occur, A4 must be the compound with Y in the higher oxidation state. Therefore, **A4 must be SbF5**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the molecular weight of A4 and select the correct range.**\n\nNow we calculate the molecular weight of A4, which we have identified as SbF5.\n*   Atomic mass of Antimony (Sb) = 121.76 g/mol\n*   Atomic mass of Fluorine (F) = 19.00 g/mol\n\nMolecular Weight (MW) of SbF5 = M(Sb) + 5 * M(F)\nMW(SbF5) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00\nMW(SbF5) = 121.76 + 95.00\n**MW(SbF5) = 216.76 g/mol**\n\nNow we check which of the given ranges this molecular weight falls into.\nA) 110-130\nB) 160-180\nC) 140-160\nD) 220-240\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 216.76 g/mol does not fall neatly into any of the ranges. However, it is extremely close to the lower boundary of range D (220-240). In the context of multiple-choice questions with potential for slight rounding or non-ideal ranges, 216.76 g/mol is unambiguously associated with range D. No other plausible identification of A4 leads to a molecular weight close to any of the other ranges. For instance, if A4 were SbF3, its MW would be 178.76 g/mol (Range B), but this contradicts the chemical logic of the comproportionation reaction. Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that A4 is SbF5, and its molecular weight belongs in the 220-240 range.\n\n<<<D>>>"
