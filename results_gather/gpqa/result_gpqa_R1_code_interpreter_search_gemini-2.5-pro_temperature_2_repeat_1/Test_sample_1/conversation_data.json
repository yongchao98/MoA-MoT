    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the number of carbon atoms in Product 3.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** The starting material is `trans-cinnamaldehyde`. The structure is a phenyl group (C6H5) attached to a trans-propenal group (-CH=CH-CHO). Let's count the carbons: 6 carbons in the phenyl ring + 3 carbons in the propenal chain = 9 carbon atoms.\n*   The reagent is `methylmagnesium bromide (CH3MgBr)`, a Grignard reagent. This reagent acts as a source of a nucleophilic methyl group (CH3-).\n*   **Reaction:** The Grignard reagent performs a 1,2-nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group of the aldehyde. The methyl group attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon, and upon an implied acidic workup step, the resulting alkoxide is protonated to form a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Product 1 Structure:** The methyl group from CH3MgBr is added to the carbonyl carbon of cinnamaldehyde.\n    *   Starting material: C6H5-CH=CH-CHO (9 carbons)\n    *   Product 1: C6H5-CH=CH-CH(OH)-CH3 (1-phenylbut-1-en-3-ol)\n*   **Carbon Count for Product 1:** The initial 9 carbons from cinnamaldehyde plus the 1 carbon from the methyl group results in 10 carbon atoms.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (C6H5-CH=CH-CH(OH)-CH3) is treated with `pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC)`.\n*   **Reaction:** PCC is an oxidizing agent that selectively oxidizes secondary alcohols to ketones. It does not affect other functional groups present, such as the phenyl ring or the carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Product 2 Structure:** The secondary alcohol group (-CH(OH)-) in Product 1 is oxidized to a ketone group (-C(=O)-).\n    *   Starting material (Product 1): C6H5-CH=CH-CH(OH)-CH3 (10 carbons)\n    *   Product 2: C6H5-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3 (4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one)\n*   **Carbon Count for Product 2:** Oxidation reactions do not change the number of carbon atoms in the skeleton. Product 2 still has 10 carbon atoms.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (C6H5-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3) is treated with `(dimethyl(oxo)-λ6-sulfaneylidene)methane`. This is the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent, a sulfur ylide with the formula (CH3)2S(=O)CH2. (Note: The question has a typo, \"3 was treated...\", which should logically be \"Product 2 was treated...\").\n*   **Reaction:** The Corey-Chaykovsky reagent is a source of a methylene group (:CH2). It reacts with carbonyl compounds or α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. In this case, it reacts with Product 2, an α,β-unsaturated ketone. The ylide transfers its CH2 group to the substrate.\n    *   There are two main possibilities: 1) epoxidation at the carbonyl group, or 2) conjugate addition to the C=C double bond, resulting in a cyclopropane ring. For the stabilized Corey-Chaykovsky ylide reacting with an α,β-unsaturated ketone, either product could potentially form depending on conditions, but regardless of the pathway, the net result is the addition of one carbon atom from the ylide's CH2 group to the molecule.\n*   **Product 3 Structure:** The structure of Product 3 will be the structure of Product 2 with one additional CH2 group incorporated into it.\n*   **Carbon Count for Product 3:**\n    *   Carbon atoms in Product 2 = 10\n    *   Carbon atoms added from the ylide = 1\n    *   Total carbon atoms in Product 3 = 10 + 1 = 11.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nFollowing the reaction sequence:\n1.  Cinnamaldehyde (9C) + CH3MgBr (1C) → Product 1 (10C)\n2.  Product 1 (10C) + PCC → Product 2 (10C)\n3.  Product 2 (10C) + Corey-Chaykovsky reagent (adds 1C) → Product 3 (11C)\n\nThe final product, Product 3, contains 11 carbon atoms.\n\n<<<C>>>"
