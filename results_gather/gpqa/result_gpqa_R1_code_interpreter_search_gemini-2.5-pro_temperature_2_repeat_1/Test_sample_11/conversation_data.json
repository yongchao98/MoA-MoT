    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principles:** The decay process is governed by the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. Since the particles involved can move at speeds close to the speed of light, we must use relativistic formulas for energy and momentum.\n\n2.  **Define the initial state:**\n    *   The initial particle is a positive pion (π⁺).\n    *   It is \"stationary,\" which means its initial velocity is 0.\n    *   Therefore, its initial momentum (p_initial) is 0.\n    *   Its initial total energy (E_initial) is its rest energy, E_π = m_πc².\n    *   Given: m_πc² = 139.6 MeV.\n\n3.  **Define the final state:**\n    *   The final particles are a positive muon (μ⁺) and a neutrino (ν).\n    *   Let the total energy and momentum of the muon be E_μ and p_μ, respectively.\n    *   Let the total energy and momentum of the neutrino be E_ν and p_ν, respectively.\n    *   Given: Rest mass (energy) of muon, m_μc² = 105.7 MeV.\n    *   The neutrino (ν) is considered to be massless, so its rest mass (energy), m_νc², is 0.\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after.\n    *   p_initial = p_final\n    *   0 = **p_μ** + **p_ν**\n    *   This implies that the muon and the neutrino must move in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude. Let's call this magnitude 'p'.\n    *   |**p_μ**| = |**p_ν**| = p\n\n5.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after.\n    *   E_initial = E_final\n    *   m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν\n    *   139.6 MeV = E_μ + E_ν  ---(Equation 1)\n\n6.  **Use the Energy-Momentum Relation (E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²):**\n    *   For the muon (μ⁺): E_μ² = (p_μc)² + (m_μc²)²  =>  E_μ² = (pc)² + (105.7)²\n    *   For the neutrino (ν): E_ν² = (p_νc)² + (m_νc²)². Since m_νc² = 0, we get E_ν² = (pc)², which simplifies to E_ν = pc.\n\n7.  **Solve for the energies:**\n    *   From the neutrino's energy-momentum relation, we have (pc)² = E_ν².\n    *   Substitute this into the muon's energy-momentum relation: E_μ² = E_ν² + (105.7)².\n    *   From the conservation of energy (Equation 1), we can write E_μ = 139.6 - E_ν.\n    *   Now substitute this expression for E_μ into the equation above:\n        (139.6 - E_ν)² = E_ν² + (105.7)²\n    *   Expand the left side: 139.6² - 2(139.6)E_ν + E_ν² = E_ν² + (105.7)²\n    *   The E_ν² terms cancel out. Rearrange to solve for E_ν:\n        139.6² - 105.7² = 2(139.6)E_ν\n        E_ν = (139.6² - 105.7²) / (2 * 139.6)\n\n8.  **Calculate the Kinetic Energies (KE):**\n    *   For the massless neutrino, its total energy is its kinetic energy: KE_ν = E_ν.\n    *   For the muon, its kinetic energy is its total energy minus its rest energy: KE_μ = E_μ - m_μc². We can find E_μ from E_μ = 139.6 - E_ν.\n\nNow, let's use a Python script to perform the calculations accurately.\n```python\n# Rest energies in MeV\nm_pi = 139.6\nm_mu = 105.7\n\n# Calculate the total energy of the neutrino (E_nu)\n# This formula comes from solving the conservation of energy and momentum equations.\nE_nu = (m_pi**2 - m_mu**2) / (2 * m_pi)\n\n# For a massless particle like a neutrino, its kinetic energy is its total energy.\nKE_nu = E_nu\n\n# Calculate the total energy of the muon (E_mu) using conservation of energy.\n# E_pi = E_mu + E_nu  =>  m_pi = E_mu + E_nu\nE_mu = m_pi - E_nu\n\n# Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon.\n# KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu (rest energy)\nKE_mu = E_mu - m_mu\n\n# Print the results, formatted to two decimal places to match the options.\nprint(f\"KE of muon (mu+): {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of neutrino (nu): {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n executar\nKE of muon (mu+): 4.12 MeV\nKE of neutrino (nu): 29.78 MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energy for the muon (μ⁺) is 4.12 MeV, and the kinetic energy for the neutrino (ν) is 29.78 MeV.\n\nComparing these results to the given options:\nA) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nB) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nC) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nD) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values (4.12 MeV and 29.78 MeV) match option C when the neutrino's energy is rounded to one decimal place.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem involves the decay of a stationary positive pion (π⁺) into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a neutrino (ν). This decay must obey the laws of conservation of energy and momentum. Since the speeds can be relativistic, we will use relativistic equations.\n\n**1. Initial State:**\n*   Particle: Positive Pion (π⁺)\n*   It is stationary, so its initial velocity is 0 and initial momentum (**p_initial**) is 0.\n*   The initial total energy (E_initial) is its rest mass energy, E_π = m_πc² = 139.6 MeV.\n\n**2. Final State:**\n*   Particles: Positive Muon (μ⁺) and a neutrino (ν).\n*   Rest mass energy of muon: m_μc² = 105.7 MeV.\n*   Neutrinos are considered massless in this context, so m_νc² = 0.\n*   Let the final momenta of the muon and neutrino be **p_μ** and **p_ν**, and their total energies be E_μ and E_ν.\n\n**3. Conservation of Momentum:**\nThe total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after.\n**p_initial** = **p_final**\n0 = **p_μ** + **p_ν**\nThis vector equation tells us that the muon and neutrino must move in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude. Let's call this magnitude 'p'.\n|**p_μ**| = |**p_ν**| = p\n\n**4. Conservation of Energy:**\nThe total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after.\nE_initial = E_final\nm_πc² = E_μ + E_ν\n\n**5. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\nThe total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) of a particle are related by: E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n\n*   For the muon (μ⁺): E_μ² = (p c)² + (m_μc²)²\n*   For the massless neutrino (ν): E_ν² = (p c)² + (0)², which simplifies to E_ν = pc.\n\n**6. Solving the System of Equations:**\nWe have a system of equations. We can solve for the unknown energies.\n\n1.  From the neutrino's energy relation, we get (pc)² = E_ν².\n2.  Substitute this into the muon's energy relation: E_μ² = E_ν² + (m_μc²)².\n3.  From the conservation of energy, express E_μ in terms of E_ν: E_μ = m_πc² - E_ν.\n4.  Substitute this expression for E_μ into the equation from step 2:\n    (m_πc² - E_ν)² = E_ν² + (m_μc²)²\n5.  Expand the left side:\n    (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)E_ν + E_ν² = E_ν² + (m_μc²)²\n6.  The E_ν² terms on both sides cancel out. Rearrange the equation to solve for E_ν:\n    (m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)² = 2(m_πc²)E_ν\n    E_ν = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2(m_πc²)]\n\n**7. Calculation:**\nUsing the given rest mass energies:\nE_ν = [ (139.6)² - (105.7)² ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]\nE_ν = [ 19488.16 - 11172.49 ] / [ 279.2 ]\nE_ν = 8315.67 / 279.2\nE_ν ≈ 29.78 MeV\n\nThis is the total energy of the neutrino. Since it is massless, its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy.\n**KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV**\n\nNow find the total energy of the muon using energy conservation:\nE_μ = m_πc² - E_ν\nE_μ = 139.6 MeV - 29.78 MeV\nE_μ = 109.82 MeV\n\nThe kinetic energy of the muon (KE_μ) is its total energy minus its rest mass energy:\nKE_μ = E_μ - m_μc²\nKE_μ = 109.82 MeV - 105.7 MeV\n**KE_μ = 4.12 MeV**\n\nThe kinetic energies of the product particles are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. These values correspond to option C.\n\nThe output from the Python code confirms these calculations:\n*   KE of muon (mu+): 4.12 MeV\n*   KE of neutrino (nu): 29.78 MeV\n\nComparing these results with the given options, we find a match with option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
