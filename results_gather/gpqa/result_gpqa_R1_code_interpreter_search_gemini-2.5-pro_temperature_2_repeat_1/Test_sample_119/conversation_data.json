    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the relationship between distance and parallax.**\n    Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to a star. We can write this relationship as:\n    `d = 1 / plx`\n    (We can ignore the constants for this proportionality analysis).\n\n2.  **Model the distribution of stars.**\n    The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (rho), is constant everywhere. The number of stars per unit volume is constant.\n\n3.  **Consider a volume of space.**\n    Let's consider the number of stars, `N`, within a sphere of radius `d` centered on the observer (Earth). The volume `V` of this sphere is:\n    `V = (4/3)πd³`\n    Since the density `ρ` is constant, the number of stars `N` within this volume is:\n    `N = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πd³`\n\n4.  **Consider a thin shell of space.**\n    We are interested in the number of stars *per unit range* of some quantity. Let's find the number of stars `dN` in a thin spherical shell at distance `d` with a thickness `dd`.\n    The volume of this shell `dV` is the derivative of the sphere's volume `V` with respect to its radius `d`:\n    `dV = dV/dd * dd = d/dd[(4/3)πd³] * dd = 4πd² dd`\n    The number of stars `dN` in this shell is:\n    `dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² dd`\n\n5.  **Express the number of stars in terms of parallax.**\n    Now we need to convert this expression from being in terms of `d` and `dd` to being in terms of `plx` and `d(plx)`.\n    We have `d = 1/plx`.\n    We also need to relate `dd` to `d(plx)`. We can find this by differentiating `d` with respect to `plx`:\n    `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [1/plx] = -1/plx²`\n    So, `dd = -d(plx)/plx²`.\n    The negative sign just indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. For counting the number of stars in a given range, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can write `dd = |d(plx)|/plx²`.\n\n6.  **Substitute `d` and `dd` into the equation for `dN`.**\n    `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx)² * (|d(plx)|/plx²) `\n    `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx⁴) * |d(plx)|`\n\n7.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax.**\n    The question asks for \"the number of stars per unit range of parallax\", which is the quantity `dN / |d(plx)|`.\n    From the equation in step 6, we can rearrange to find this:\n    `dN / |d(plx)| = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n8.  **Conclusion.**\n    Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, the number of stars per unit parallax range is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n`Number of stars per unit parallax range ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
