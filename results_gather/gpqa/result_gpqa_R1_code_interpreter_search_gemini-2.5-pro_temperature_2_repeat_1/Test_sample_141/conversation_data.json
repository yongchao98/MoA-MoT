    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the geometrical position of the given density matrix.\n\n1.  **Understand the Density Matrix**\n    The given density matrix is:\n    $\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$\n\n    This represents a statistical mixture of the quantum state $|0\\rangle$ and the quantum state $|1\\rangle$, with an equal probability of 50% for each. This is known as a maximally mixed state for a single qubit.\n\n2.  **Represent the Density Matrix in Matrix Form**\n    The basis states $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ are represented by column vectors:\n    $|0\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $|1\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    The outer products are:\n    $|0\\rangle\\langle0| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $|1\\rangle\\langle1| = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    Now, substitute these into the expression for $\\rho$:\n    $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2}I$\n    where $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n\n3.  **Relate the Density Matrix to the Bloch Vector**\n    Any single-qubit density matrix can be expressed in terms of the identity matrix $I$ and the Pauli matrices $(\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ using the Bloch vector $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$:\n    $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}) = \\frac{1}{2}(I + r_x\\sigma_x + r_y\\sigma_y + r_z\\sigma_z)$\n\n    The components of the Bloch vector, which define the geometrical position in the Bloch sphere, can be calculated using the formula:\n    $r_i = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_i)$ for $i \\in \\{x, y, z\\}$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Components of the Bloch Vector**\n    Let's calculate $r_x, r_y, r_z$ using $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$.\n\n    *   $r_x = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_x) = \\text{Tr}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_x\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_x)$\n        $\\sigma_x = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, so $\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_x) = 0 + 0 = 0$.\n        $r_x = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$.\n\n    *   $r_y = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_y) = \\text{Tr}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_y\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_y)$\n        $\\sigma_y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, so $\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_y) = 0 + 0 = 0$.\n        $r_y = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$.\n\n    *   $r_z = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_z) = \\text{Tr}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_z\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_z)$\n        $\\sigma_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$, so $\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_z) = 1 + (-1) = 0$.\n        $r_z = \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    The components of the Bloch vector are all zero: $r_x=0, r_y=0, r_z=0$.\n    Therefore, the geometrical position is represented by the vector $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n    This result is expected, as the maximally mixed state lies at the very center (the origin) of the Bloch sphere, which has coordinates (0,0,0).\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) r=(1,1,1)\nB) r=(0,0,0)\nC) r=(1,1,0)\nD) r=(0,0,1)\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
