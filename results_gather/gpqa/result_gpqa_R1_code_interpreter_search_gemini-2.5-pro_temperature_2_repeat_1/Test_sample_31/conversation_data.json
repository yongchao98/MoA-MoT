    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Identify the Nucleus and its Properties\n\n*   The problem specifies the nucleus **X** as Lithium (**Li**) with **3 neutrons**.\n*   Lithium (Li) has an atomic number (Z) of 3, meaning it has **3 protons**.\n*   The number of neutrons (N) is given as **3**.\n*   The mass number (A) is the sum of protons and neutrons: A = Z + N = 3 + 3 = 6.\n*   Therefore, the nucleus is an isotope of Lithium-6, denoted as **⁶Li**.\n\n### 2. Determine the Particle's Speed and Relativistic Factor (γ)\n\n*   The speed (**v**) of the nucleus is given as **0.96c**, where 'c' is the speed of light.\n*   The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by the formula:  `E = γ * E₀`, where `E₀` is the rest energy and `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n*   The Lorentz factor is calculated as: `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\nLet's calculate γ:\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96c)²/c²)`\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96²)`\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216)`\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(0.0784)`\n`γ = 1 / 0.28`\n`γ ≈ 3.5714`\n\n### 3. Calculate the Rest Energy (E₀) of the Nucleus\n\nThe rest energy `E₀` is equal to the rest mass `m₀` times `c²` (`E₀ = m₀c²`). There are two common methods to determine the rest mass of the nucleus:\n\n*   **Method A (Physically Accurate):** Use the known atomic mass of ⁶Li and subtract the mass of the electrons to get the precise nuclear mass. This method accounts for the nuclear binding energy.\n*   **Method B (Approximation):** Calculate the mass by summing the individual rest masses of the constituent protons and neutrons. This method ignores binding energy and is a common approximation in physics problems.\n\nLet's compare both methods. The multiple-choice options will guide us to the intended method.\n\n#### Calculation via Method B (Approximation)\n\nThis method often aligns with textbook problems where binding energy is ignored for simplicity.\n*   We need the rest masses of a proton (mₚ) and a neutron (mₙ).\n*   mₚ ≈ 1.007276 u\n*   mₙ ≈ 1.008665 u\n*   Rest mass of ⁶Li nucleus `m₀ ≈ 3 * mₚ + 3 * mₙ`\n*   `m₀ ≈ 3 * (1.007276 u) + 3 * (1.008665 u) ≈ 3.021828 u + 3.025995 u ≈ 6.047823 u`\n\nNow, convert this mass to energy (in GeV). The conversion factor is `1 u ≈ 931.494 MeV/c²` or `0.931494 GeV/c²`.\n*   `E₀ = m₀c² ≈ 6.047823 u * 0.931494 GeV/u`\n*   `E₀ ≈ 5.6335 GeV`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Total Energy (E)\n\nNow we use the formula `E = γ * E₀` with the values we calculated.\n*   `E ≈ 3.5714 * 5.6335 GeV`\n*   `E ≈ 20.120 GeV`\n\n### 5. Compare with Options\n\nLet's look at the given options:\nA) 20.132 GeV\nB) 23.069 GeV\nC) 18.475 GeV\nD) 21.419 GeV\n\nOur calculated value using the approximation method is `20.120 GeV`. This is extremely close to option **A) 20.132 GeV**. The small difference (~0.06%) can be attributed to the use of slightly different values for the physical constants (mass of proton, neutron, or the u-to-GeV conversion factor) in the source material for this question.\n\nFor completeness, using the more accurate Method A (which gives `E ≈ 20.005 GeV`) does not align well with any of the options, further suggesting that the approximate method was intended.\n\nTo confirm the calculation with high precision, we can use a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Use standard CODATA values for constants\nmass_proton_gev = 0.938272088  # Rest energy in GeV\nmass_neutron_gev = 0.939565420  # Rest energy in GeV\n\n# Properties of the Li-6 nucleus\nnum_protons = 3\nnum_neutrons = 3\n\n# Given speed relative to c\nv_over_c = 0.96\n\n# 1. Calculate the approximate rest energy (E0) by summing constituent masses\nrest_energy_gev = (num_protons * mass_proton_gev) + (num_neutrons * mass_neutron_gev)\n\n# 2. Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v_over_c**2)\n\n# 3. Calculate the total relativistic energy (E)\ntotal_energy_gev = gamma * rest_energy_gev\n\n# Print the result with the required precision\nprint(f\"{total_energy_gev:.4f}\")\n\n```\n<execute_code>\n20.1197\n</execute_code>\nThe high-precision calculation gives **20.1197 GeV**. This confirms that the value is very close to **20.132 GeV**. Given the choices, this is the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The calculation of the energy of the relativistic heavy ion is as follows:\n\n**1. Determine the nucleus and its components**\n- The nucleus is defined as **Lithium (Li)**. The atomic number of Li is 3, so it has 3 protons.\n- It is given that there are 3 neutrons.\n- The total mass number (A) is the sum of protons and neutrons: `A = 3 (protons) + 3 (neutrons) = 6`.\n- Thus, the nucleus is **⁶Li**.\n\n**2. Determine the Lorentz factor (γ)**\nThe Lorentz factor is a function of the particle's speed, `v`, which is given as `v = 0.96c`.\nThe formula is: `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n`γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.96c)²/c²)`\n`γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.96²)`\n`γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216)`\n`γ = 1 / √(0.0784)`\n`γ = 1 / 0.28`\n`γ ≈ 3.5714`\n\n**3. Determine the rest energy of the nucleus (E₀)**\nThe rest energy of the nucleus can be approximated by summing the rest energies of its constituent protons and neutrons. We use the following standard values for rest energy:\n- Rest energy of a proton (mₚc²): ~0.93827 GeV\n- Rest energy of a neutron (mₙc²): ~0.93957 GeV\n\nThe rest energy of the ⁶Li nucleus is:\n`E₀ = (3 * E_proton) + (3 * E_neutron)`\n`E₀ ≈ (3 * 0.93827 GeV) + (3 * 0.93957 GeV)`\n`E₀ ≈ 2.81481 GeV + 2.81871 GeV`\n`E₀ ≈ 5.63352 GeV`\n\n**4. Calculate the total relativistic energy (E)**\nThe total energy of a relativistic particle is given by `E = γ * E₀`.\n`E ≈ 3.5714 * 5.63352 GeV`\n`E ≈ 20.1196 GeV`\n\nAs confirmed by the Python script which yielded **20.1197 GeV**.\n\n**5. Compare with the options**\nThe calculated value of `20.1197 GeV` is closest to option A.\n- A) 20.132 GeV\n- B) 23.069 GeV\n- C) 18.475 GeV\n- D) 21.419 GeV\n\nThe small difference between our calculation (20.1197 GeV) and option A (20.132 GeV) is likely due to the use of slightly different precision or values for the fundamental constants (rest masses of proton and neutron) in the problem's source material. However, the result clearly points to A as the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
