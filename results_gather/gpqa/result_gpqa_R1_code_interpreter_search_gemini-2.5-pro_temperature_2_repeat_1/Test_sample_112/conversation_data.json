    "*   **FTIR Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n    *   A strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is in the typical range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. In conjugation with the O-H peak, this strongly suggests a carboxylic acid functional group.\n    *   A strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=C (alkene) double bond stretch.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of an alkene (C=C) in the molecule. Vinyl-hydrogens are the protons directly attached to the carbons of the double bond.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a classic fragmentation pattern for carboxylic acids. This fragment corresponds to the [COOH]⁺ ion (Mass = 12 (C) + 16 (O) + 16 (O) + 1 (H) = 45 amu).\n\n*   **Synthesis and Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    *   The evidence collectively points to a molecule that contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n    *   A carboxylic acid contains a C=O double bond, which counts as one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   An alkene group contains a C=C double bond, which counts as another degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the unknown compound must have a total of at least two degrees of unsaturation (DBE = 2).\n    *   The presence of a carboxylic acid means the molecule must contain at least two oxygen atoms.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    Let's calculate the DBE for each given formula using the formula: DBE = C + 1 - (H/2).\n    *   A) **C6H10O2:** DBE = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This formula has two oxygen atoms and two degrees of unsaturation. It can accommodate both a carboxylic acid group and an alkene group. This is a perfect match for all the spectroscopic data.\n    *   B) **C6H10O:** DBE = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This formula has two degrees of unsaturation but only one oxygen atom, which is inconsistent with the evidence for a carboxylic acid.\n    *   C) **C6H12O:** DBE = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This formula has only one degree of unsaturation and one oxygen. It cannot contain both a C=O and a C=C group.\n    *   D) **C6H12O2:** DBE = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This formula has only one degree of unsaturation. While it has two oxygens (enough for a carboxylic acid), a single DBE would be fully accounted for by the C=O in the acid group, leaving no room for the required C=C alkene group. A structure with this formula would be saturated (e.g., hexanoic acid), contradicting the FTIR and NMR data.\n\n**Conclusion:** Only the formula C6H10O2 is consistent with all the provided analytical data, indicating an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>"
