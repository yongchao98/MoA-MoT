    "```python\n# Final Answer Calculation\n# The user wants to identify the chemical formula of a compound based on spectroscopic data.\n\n# Step 1: Analyze the information provided to deduce structural fragments.\n# - A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring implies a C6H4 group. This fragment has 6 carbon atoms and 4 hydrogen atoms.\nC_from_ring = 6\nH_from_ring = 4\n\n# - FTIR shows an ester group (-COO-). This adds 2 oxygen atoms and 1 carbon atom (the carbonyl carbon).\nO_from_ester = 2\nC_from_ester = 1\n\n# - 1H NMR analysis for hydrogen and associated carbon counts:\n#   - Two signals for aromatic-H: This is consistent with the 4 protons on the C6H4 ring, which are in two different chemical environments (e.g., in a para-substituted ring), giving two signals (each integrating to 2H). Total aromatic hydrogens = 4. This is already accounted for.\n#   - Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets): This splitting pattern is highly characteristic of a propenyl group, -CH=CH-CH3.\n#     - The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (into a doublet) and the three methyl protons (into a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets.\n#     - The other vinyl proton is split only by its vinyl neighbor, resulting in a doublet.\n#     - This fragment (-CH=CH-CH3) contains 2 vinyl hydrogens and one methyl group.\n#     - This fragment contributes 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens (1+1+3).\nH_from_propenyl = 5\nC_from_propenyl = 3\n\n#   - Two signals for -CH3 groups: We identified one methyl group as part of the propenyl fragment.

    "The user wants me to identify the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on several pieces of spectroscopic data. I will break down each piece of information to determine the constituent atoms.\n\n1.  **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**:\n    *   A benzene ring has the formula C6H6.\n    *   If it is di-substituted, two hydrogen atoms are replaced by other groups.\n    *   This leaves a **C6H4** fragment.\n    *   Running tally: C=6, H=4\n\n2.  **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicates the presence of an ester group\"**:\n    *   An ester group has the functional formula -COO-.\n    *   This adds **2 Oxygen atoms** and **1 Carbon atom** (from the C=O carbonyl).\n    *   Running tally: C=6+1=7, H=4, O=2\n\n3.  **\"1H NMR spectrum shows six signals\"**: This provides information about the hydrogen atoms and their neighboring groups.\n\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\"**: This confirms the C6H4 fragment. The four hydrogens are in two different chemical environments (which is consistent with ortho or para substitution), giving rise to two distinct signals. We have already accounted for these 4 hydrogens.\n\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\"**: Vinyl-H are protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n        *   A signal that is a \"doublet of quartets\" (dq) is highly characteristic of a proton on a double bond that is adjacent to both another proton on the double bond and a methyl group. This points strongly to a propenyl group fragment: **-CH=CH-CH3**.\n        *   Let's verify the splitting: The H atom on the carbon next to the CH3 group (`=CH-CH3`) is split by the other vinyl H (into a doublet) and by the three protons of the CH3 group (into a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl H (`-CH=`) is split only by its vinyl neighbor, resulting in a doublet. This perfectly matches the description.\n        *   This fragment (-CH=CH-CH3) contains **3 Carbon atoms** and **5 Hydrogen atoms** (1+1+3=5).\n        *   Running tally: C=7+3=10, H=4+5=9, O=2\n\n    *   **\"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\"**:\n        *   We have already identified one CH3 group as part of the propenyl fragment. The data states there are *two* signals for CH3 groups, so there must be another one.\n        *   This second methyl group (**-CH3**) must be attached somewhere else in the molecule, likely as part of the ester (e.g., -COOCH3) or attached to the aromatic ring.\n        *   This fragment adds **1 Carbon atom** and **3 Hydrogen atoms**.\n        *   Running tally: C=10+1=11, H=9+3=12, O=2\n\n    *   **\"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\"**: This is a useful piece of negative information, confirming we are not missing any methylene (-CH2-) units.\n\n**Final Calculation**\n\n*   **Carbon (C)**: 6 (from aromatic ring) + 1 (from ester carbonyl) + 3 (from propenyl group) + 1 (from second methyl group) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**: 4 (from aromatic ring) + 5 (from propenyl group) + 3 (from second methyl group) = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O)**: 2 (from ester group) = **2**\n\nThe deduced chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\nThis matches option C from the choices provided.\n\n<<<C>>>"
