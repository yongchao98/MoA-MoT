    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order:\n\n**1. Classify the Substituents and their Directing Effects**\n\nThe reaction is an electrophilic substitution (bromination). The substituent on the benzene ring determines where the incoming electrophile (Br⁺) will add. We need to classify each substituent as either an *ortho,para-director* or a *meta-director*.\n\n*   **Ortho,para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the positions ortho and para to themselves. They generally result in a high yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   **1) -CH₃ (Methyl):** Activating, ortho,para-director.\n    *   **5) -C₂H₅ (Ethyl):** Activating, ortho,para-director.\n    *   **3) -Cl (Chloro):** Deactivating, but ortho,para-director.\n\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They produce very small, almost negligible, amounts of the ortho and para isomers.\n    *   **4) -NO₂ (Nitro):** Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   **6) -COOH (Carboxylic acid):** Deactivating, meta-director.\n    *   **2) -COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl ester):** Deactivating, meta-director.\n\nFrom this classification, we know that substances 4, 6, and 2 will have the lowest yield of the para-isomer, while substances 1, 5, and 3 will have the highest yield. The final sequence will look like this: {Group of 4, 6, 2} < {Group of 1, 5, 3}.\n\n**2. Rank the Meta-Directors (4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor meta-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer is extremely low. The amount of para product formed is inversely related to the strength of the group's deactivating and meta-directing effect. A stronger deactivating group will \"enforce\" meta-direction more strongly, leading to an even smaller percentage of the para-isomer.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength for these groups is well-established:\n-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅\n(Nitro is stronger than carboxylic acid, which is slightly stronger than an ester).\n\nTherefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order of deactivating strength:\nYield for -NO₂ < Yield for -COOH < Yield for -COOC₂H₅\n\nThis gives us the order for the first part of the sequence:\n**4 < 6 < 2**\n\n**3. Rank the Ortho,Para-Directors (1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor ortho,para-directors, the proportion of the para-isomer depends on a balance of steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH₃ (1) and -C₂H₅ (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The main difference affecting the ortho/para ratio is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This bulkiness hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent *ortho* positions, making the remote *para* position more accessible. Therefore, ethylbenzene will produce a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   Para % for -CH₃ < Para % for -C₂H₅\n    *   This gives the relative order: **1 < 5**\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups with -Cl (3):** Chlorine is a halogen. Halogens have a unique combination of effects: they are deactivating due to a strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I), but they are ortho,para-directing due to an electron-donating resonance effect (+M). The inductive effect is strongest at the closest positions (ortho) and weaker at the more distant para position. This strong deactivation of the ortho positions makes the para position electronically much more favored for attack compared to alkyl-substituted rings. Consequently, halobenzenes like chlorobenzene are known to give a very high yield of the para-isomer, often higher than that from toluene or ethylbenzene.\n    *   Para % for -C₂H₅ < Para % for -Cl\n    *   This gives the relative order: **5 < 3**\n\nCombining the ranking for the ortho,para-directors, we get:\n**1 < 5 < 3**\n\n**4. Assemble the Final Sequence**\n\nNow, we combine the two ranked groups:\n{Ranking of meta-directors} < {Ranking of ortho,para-directors}\n{4 < 6 < 2} < {1 < 5 < 3}\n\nThe final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to the substances:\nNitrobenzene < Benzoic acid < Ethyl benzoate < Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene\n\nThis sequence matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
