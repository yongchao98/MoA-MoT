    "*   **Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Analyze the IR Spectrum of Compound X.**\n    *   A very broad absorption in the range of **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid, where the broadening is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong, sharp absorption at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. Its position is consistent with a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   Absorptions at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic (benzene) ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Compound X.**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A very downfield, broad singlet for one proton is a classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, which deshields them. The two protons at 7.2 ppm are meta to the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   **Putting it together so far:** We have a benzoic acid skeleton with a substituent at position 4 (the para position).\n        ```\n           HOOC - [Benzene Ring] - [Substituent]\n        ```\n    *   **Now, let's determine the alkyl substituent from the remaining signals:**\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons is a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons is likely the methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to the methyl group. This confirms an ethyl fragment (-CH₂CH₃).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons is a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton, shifted downfield, is the methine group (-CH-). It's downfield because it is benzylic (attached directly to the benzene ring). It is a multiplet because it is coupled to the protons of the adjacent -CH₂- group and the adjacent -CH₃ group.\n    *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** The methine (-CH-) group is attached to the benzene ring. It is also attached to an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) and a methyl group (-CH₃). This structure is a *sec*-butyl group: -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Identify Compound X.**\n    *   Combining the pieces, Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. This matches option (D), but the question asks for the final product of the reaction, not the starting material.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Analyze the Reaction.**\n    *   Compound X reacts with **red phosphorus and HI (hydroiodic acid)**.\n    *   This is a very powerful reducing system. It is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃), while typically leaving aromatic rings and saturated alkyl groups unchanged.\n    *   The reaction is:\n        4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid + HI / red P → Product\n\n5.  **Step 5: Determine the Final Product.**\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 1 is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The *sec*-butyl group at position 4 remains unchanged.\n    *   The benzene ring remains unchanged.\n    *   The resulting product is 4-sec-butyl-1-methylbenzene, which can also be named **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n6.  **Step 6: Compare with the Given Options.**\n    *   A) **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene:** This matches our derived product structure.\n    *   B) **2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid:** Incorrect structure and functional group.\n    *   C) **1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene:** Incorrect alkyl group (isobutyl instead of sec-butyl).\n    *   D) **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid:** This is the starting material (Compound X), not the final product.\n\nTherefore, the correct final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
