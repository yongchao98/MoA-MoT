    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n\n*   The molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) is calculated to determine the number of rings and/or double/triple bonds.\n*   DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n*   DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DBE of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs: 3 double bonds + 1 ring) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n\n*   **3420 cm-1, 3325 cm-1 (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH2) group, corresponding to the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm-1 (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Given the aromaticity suggested by the DBE, this value is consistent with a conjugated ester. A typical non-conjugated ester appears around 1735-1750 cm-1; conjugation with the benzene ring lowers the frequency into this range.\n\n**3. 1H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   These signals are in the aromatic region of the spectrum (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm).\n    *   The total integration is 4H, which confirms a disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring.\n    *   The chemical shift difference indicates that one substituent is electron-donating (causing the upfield shift to ~7.0 ppm for its ortho protons) and the other is electron-withdrawing (causing the downfield shift to ~8.0 ppm for its ortho protons).\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   This pair of signals is the signature pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH2CH3)**.\n    *   The 1.20 ppm signal is a triplet (t) because the 3 protons of the methyl (CH3) group are coupled to the 2 protons of the adjacent methylene (CH2) group (2+1=3 peaks).\n    *   The 4.5 ppm signal is a quartet (q) because the 2 protons of the methylene (CH2) group are coupled to the 3 protons of the adjacent methyl (CH3) group (3+1=4 peaks).\n    *   The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm indicates the CH2 group is attached to a very electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom of an ester or ether. Combined with the C=O group from the IR, an **ethoxy group attached to a carbonyl, forming an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3)**, is strongly indicated.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   A broad singlet (bs) integrating to 2 protons is highly characteristic of the protons on a primary amine (-NH2). The broadening is due to quadropolar coupling with the nitrogen nucleus and chemical exchange. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nLet's put all the identified pieces together:\n1.  A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n2.  A primary amine group (-NH2), which is an electron-donating group.\n3.  An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3), which is an electron-withdrawing group.\n\nPlacing these two groups in a para (1,4) arrangement on the benzene ring gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Structure:** H2N-C6H4-COOCH2CH3\n*   The electron-donating -NH2 group would shield its ortho protons, pushing them upfield (the signal at 7.0 ppm).\n*   The electron-withdrawing -COOCH2CH3 group would deshield its ortho protons, pushing them downfield (the signal at 8.0 ppm). This is a perfect match for the observed aromatic signals.\n\n**5. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Has a secondary amide (wrong IR) and a formyl proton (not in NMR).\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all data: primary amine (IR, NMR), conjugated ester (IR), para-substituted ring with correct electronic effects (NMR), and an ethyl group attached to an ester oxygen (NMR). The molecular formula C9H11NO2 is correct.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Is a primary amide (amide C=O is ~1680 cm-1, not 1720 cm-1) and has meta substitution (wrong NMR aromatic pattern).\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is a phenyl ester, not an ethyl ester. The ethyl group is part of a propionyl group (CH3CH2CO-), so the CH2 quartet would be around 2.3-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAll spectral data points conclusively to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
