    "This question asks for the conditions under which the Mott-Gurney equation for space-charge-limited current (SCLC) is valid. Let's break down the equation and the physical model behind it.\n\n**1. The Mott-Gurney Equation and SCLC**\n\nThe equation $J = \\frac{9}{8} \\epsilon \\mu \\frac{V^2}{L^3}$ describes the current in a regime where the number of injected charge carriers from a contact is so high that they form a \"space charge\" cloud within the semiconductor or insulator. This charge cloud modifies the electric field distribution, and the current is limited by the transport of these injected charges, not by the intrinsic conductivity of the material.\n\n**2. Derivation and Core Assumptions**\n\nTo arrive at this specific $V^2$ dependence, several key assumptions must be made:\n\n*   **Single-Carrier Device:** The model assumes that only one type of charge carrier (either electrons or holes) is mobile and contributes to the current. If both electrons and holes were mobile (a two-carrier device), recombination effects would have to be included, leading to a different current-voltage relationship. This eliminates option **C**.\n*   **Trap-Free Material:** The derivation assumes the material is an ideal insulator or semiconductor with no localized energy states (traps) in the bandgap. If traps exist, they capture a portion of the injected carriers, immobilizing them. This reduces the mobile charge and alters the J-V characteristic, often leading to a steeper voltage dependence ($V^n$ with n > 2) in certain voltage ranges. This makes \"trap-free\" a critical condition. This is mentioned in options **B** and **D**.\n*   **Ohmic Contact (No Injection Barrier):** For the current to be limited by space charge in the bulk, the injecting contact must be able to supply an essentially unlimited number of carriers. This means there should be no energy barrier to injection. This type of contact is called an \"Ohmic contact\". A \"Schottky contact\" is a rectifying contact that has an energy barrier, limiting injection, and is therefore inconsistent with the SCLC model. This eliminates option **A**. Option **D** correctly states this condition as \"no carrier injection barrier\".\n*   **Dominant Drift Current (Negligible Diffusion Current):** The model assumes that carriers are transported primarily by drifting under the influence of the applied electric field. The current arising from the random thermal motion and concentration gradients (diffusion) is assumed to be negligible compared to the drift current. This is a valid assumption for devices that are not extremely thin and at voltages above the thermal voltage. Options **A**, **C**, and **D** correctly mention this. However, option **B** states \"negligible *drift* current,\" which is the exact opposite of the physical reality in SCLC, where drift is the dominant transport mechanism. This eliminates option **B**.\n\n**3. Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n    *   Incorrect. A Schottky contact limits injection, which is contrary to the SCLC requirement of a carrier reservoir.\n*   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.**\n    *   Incorrect. SCLC is a *drift-dominated* current. Stating that drift current is negligible is a fundamental contradiction.\n*   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n    *   Incorrect. The simple Mott-Gurney law is derived for single-carrier transport.\n*   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.**\n    *   Correct. This statement accurately lists all the key assumptions:\n        *   \"trap-free\" - Yes.\n        *   \"single-carrier device\" - Yes.\n        *   \"no carrier injection barrier\" - Yes, this is the definition of the ideal Ohmic contact needed for SCLC.\n        *   \"negligible diffusion current\" - Yes, the current is dominated by drift.\n\n<<<D>>>"
