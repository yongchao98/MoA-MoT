    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the principle of conservation of energy.**\n    The system is a harmonic oscillator, for which the total energy is conserved. The force is a conservative force ($F = -kx$), so we can define a potential energy function. In a relativistic framework, the total energy of a particle includes its kinetic energy and potential energy. We will equate the total energy at two specific points of the oscillation: the point of maximum displacement (and zero velocity) and the equilibrium point (and maximum velocity).\n\n2.  **Define the relativistic kinetic energy and potential energy.**\n    *   The potential energy for a spring obeying Hooke's Law is given by $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, where $x$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position.\n    *   The relativistic kinetic energy is given by $K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$, where $m$ is the rest mass, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   The total mechanical energy, which is a conserved quantity, is $E = K + U = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\n3.  **Apply the conservation of energy to the two extreme points of motion.**\n    *   **State 1: At maximum amplitude.**\n        The particle is at its maximum displacement, $x = A$. At this point, the particle momentarily stops, so its velocity is $v = 0$.\n        For $v=0$, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n        The kinetic energy is $K_1 = (1 - 1)mc^2 = 0$.\n        The potential energy is $U_1 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n        The total energy is $E_1 = K_1 + U_1 = 0 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n    *   **State 2: At the equilibrium position.**\n        The particle is at the equilibrium position, $x = 0$. At this point, the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy (and thus speed) is at its maximum. Let's call the maximum speed $v_{max}$.\n        The kinetic energy is $K_2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$, where $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        The potential energy is $U_2 = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$.\n        The total energy is $E_2 = K_2 + U_2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2 + 0 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n\n4.  **Equate the energies and solve for $v_{max}$.**\n    Since energy is conserved, $E_1 = E_2$.\n    $\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$\n\n    Now, we isolate $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} - 1 = \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Now, substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    To solve for $v_{max}$, we first square both sides of the equation:\n    $\\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2} = \\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2$\n\n    Next, we take the reciprocal of both sides:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    Rearrange the equation to solve for $v_{max}^2/c^2$:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n5.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The derived expression for $v_{max}$ is:\n    $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n    This matches option D exactly.\n\n    *Checking the non-relativistic limit:* If the speeds involved are much smaller than $c$, then the term $\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$ is very small. Let $\\epsilon = \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \\ll 1$.\n    $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - (1+\\epsilon)^{-2}}$. Using the binomial approximation $(1+\\epsilon)^n \\approx 1+n\\epsilon$ for small $\\epsilon$, we get $(1+\\epsilon)^{-2} \\approx 1 - 2\\epsilon$.\n    $v_{max} \\approx c \\sqrt{1 - (1 - 2\\epsilon)} = c \\sqrt{2\\epsilon} = c \\sqrt{2 \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}} = c \\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{mc^2}} = c \\frac{A\\sqrt{k}}{c\\sqrt{m}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$.\n    This is the classical result for the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator, which confirms our relativistic formula is correct.\n\n<<<D>>>"
