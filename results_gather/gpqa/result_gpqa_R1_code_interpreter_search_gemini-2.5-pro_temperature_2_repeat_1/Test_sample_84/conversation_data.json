    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the Goal:**\nThe primary objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet 1 and Planet 2, which can be expressed as T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n**2. Recall the Formula for Equilibrium Temperature:**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\nwhere:\n*   `T_star` is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   `R_star` is the radius of the star.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\n**3. Formulate the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures:**\nWe need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [T_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star (`T_star` and `R_star` are constant) and have the same albedo (`A1` = `A2`). Therefore, these terms cancel out:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (R_star / (2 * a1)) * ((2 * a2) / R_star) )\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes, `a2 / a1`.\n\n**4. Relate the Semi-Major Axis to the Given Observational Data:**\nThe problem provides the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ) for each planet, which is related to the star's maximum radial velocity (K), also known as the radial velocity semi-amplitude.\n\nThe relationship between radial velocity and Doppler shift is:\nK / c = Δλ_max / λ₀  =>  K = c * (Δλ_max / λ₀)\nwhere `c` is the speed of light and `λ₀` is the rest wavelength.\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude `K` is given by:\nK = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * v_star_orb\nwhere `v_star_orb` is the orbital speed of the star. Due to conservation of momentum and Kepler's laws, this can be expressed as:\nK = (M_p * sin(i)) / sqrt(M_star) * sqrt(G / a)\n\nSince the problem states that the planets were detected using the transit method, it is a very strong indication that their orbital inclination `i` is close to 90 degrees, meaning `sin(i) ≈ 1`. We can reasonably assume `sin(i)` is the same and approximately 1 for both planets.\n\n**5. Determine the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes (a2 / a1):**\nLet's rearrange the formula for `K` to solve for the semi-major axis `a`:\nsqrt(a) = (M_p * sin(i) / K) * sqrt(G / M_star)\na = (M_p² * sin²(i) * G) / (K² * M_star)\n\nNow, let's form the ratio `a2 / a1`:\na2 / a1 = [ (M_p2² * sin²(i2) * G) / (K2² * M_star) ] / [ (M_p1² * sin²(i1) * G) / (K1² * M_star) ]\n\nThe terms `G`, `M_star`, and `sin²(i)` (since we assume i1 ≈ i2) cancel out, leaving:\na2 / a1 = (M_p2² / K2²) / (M_p1² / K1²)\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²\n\n**6. Calculate the Ratios of Masses and Radial Velocities:**\n*   **Mass Ratio:**\n    M_p1 = 7 M_earth\n    M_p2 = 5 M_earth\n    M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n\n*   **Radial Velocity Ratio:**\n    The ratio of radial velocities `K1 / K2` is directly proportional to the ratio of their maximum Doppler shifts `Δλ_1 / Δλ_2`.\n    K1 / K2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3 / 4\n\n**7. Calculate the Final Result:**\nSubstitute the calculated ratios back into the expressions for `a2 / a1` and then `T_eq1 / T_eq2`.\n\n*   Calculate `a2 / a1`:\n    a2 / a1 = (5/7)² * (3/4)² = (25/49) * (9/16) = 225 / 784\n\n*   Calculate the temperature ratio:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = sqrt(225 / 784) = 15 / 28\n\nTo find the numerical value, we perform the division:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 ÷ 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the given ratios\n# Ratio of planet masses (M_p2 / M_p1)\nM_p1 = 7  # in Earth masses\nM_p2 = 5  # in Earth masses\nmass_ratio = M_p2 / M_p1\n\n# Ratio of Doppler shifts, which is equal to the ratio of radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K1 / K2)\ndelta_lambda_1 = 0.03  # Angstroms\ndelta_lambda_2 = 0.04  # Angstroms\nK_ratio = delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2 / a1)\n# a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2\na_ratio = (mass_ratio)**2 * (K_ratio)**2\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2)\n# T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\ntemp_ratio = math.sqrt(a_ratio)\n\n# Print the final result rounded to two decimal places\nprint(f\"~ {temp_ratio:.2f}\")\n```\n\n~ 0.54\n\nFinal check of the manual calculation: 15 / 28 = 0.5357...\nThe code calculates: sqrt( (5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2 ) = sqrt( (25/49) * (9/16) ) = sqrt(225/784) = 15/28 = 0.5357... which rounds to 0.54. Let's recheck the options.\nA) ~ 1.30\nB) ~ 0.98\nC) ~ 1.05\nD) ~ 0.53\nMy result of 0.5357 is closest to 0.53.\n\nFinal result based on calculations is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2, i.e., T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    Where:\n    *   `T_star` = Star's effective temperature\n    *   `A` = Planet's albedo\n    *   `R_star` = Star's radius\n    *   `a` = Planet's semi-major axis (orbital distance for a circular orbit)\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [T_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:**\n    *   Both planets orbit the same star, so `T_star` and `R_star` are the same for both and cancel out.\n    *   The problem states that both planets have the same albedo, so `A1 = A2`. The term `(1 - A)^(1/4)` also cancels out.\n    *   The constants `2` also cancel out.\n    *   After simplification, the ratio becomes:\n        T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1 / a1) / sqrt(1 / a2)\n        T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\n5.  **Determine the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a2 / a1):** To find the temperature ratio, we need the ratio of the semi-major axes. We can derive this from the information provided about the radial velocity (RV) method.\n\n6.  **Relate RV Data to the Semi-Major Axis:** The star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    K ≈ (M_p * sin(i)) / M_star * v_orb  (where v_orb is the planet's orbital velocity)\n    Using Kepler's third law (v_orb = sqrt(G * M_star / a)), this becomes:\n    K ≈ (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n    K ≈ (M_p * sin(i)) * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n\n    *   `M_p` = Planet's mass\n    *   `M_star` = Star's mass\n    *   `i` = Orbital inclination\n    *   `G` = Gravitational constant\n    *   `a` = Semi-major axis\n\n7.  **Isolate 'a' and Form the Ratio a2/a1:**\n    *   Rearrange the formula to solve for `a`:\n        K² ≈ (M_p² * sin²(i) * G) / (M_star * a)\n        a ≈ (M_p² * sin²(i) * G) / (M_star * K²)\n    *   Now, form the ratio a2 / a1:\n        a2 / a1 ≈ [ (M_p2² * sin²(i2) * G) / (M_star * K2²) ] / [ (M_p1² * sin²(i1) * G) / (M_star * K1²) ]\n\n8.  **Simplify the 'a' Ratio:**\n    *   The terms for the star (`M_star`) and gravity (`G`) are constant and cancel out.\n    *   The problem states the planets were detected using the transit method, which implies the inclination `i` is very close to 90° for both. Therefore, `sin(i1) ≈ sin(i2) ≈ 1`, and this term also cancels.\n    *   The simplified ratio for `a` is:\n        a2 / a1 = (M_p2² / K2²) / (M_p1² / K1²)\n        a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²\n\n9.  **Calculate the Component Ratios:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio (M_p2 / M_p1):**\n        M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n        M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n        M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n    *   **RV Semi-Amplitude Ratio (K1 / K2):** The radial velocity `K` is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift `Δλ` (since K/c = Δλ/λ₀). Therefore, the ratio `K1 / K2` is equal to the ratio `Δλ1 / Δλ2`.\n        Δλ1 = 0.03 Å\n        Δλ2 = 0.04 Å\n        K1 / K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n10. **Calculate a2 / a1:**\n    a2 / a1 = (5/7)² * (3/4)²\n    a2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\n    a2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\n11. **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio (T_eq1 / T_eq2):**\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = sqrt(225 / 784)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225) / sqrt(784)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\n12. **Final Numerical Value:**\n    15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n    This value is closest to option D.\n\nThe python code from the thinking process confirmed this calculation, yielding a result of ~0.54 when rounded to two decimal places. Given the options, 0.53 is the correct choice.\n\n<<<D>>>"
