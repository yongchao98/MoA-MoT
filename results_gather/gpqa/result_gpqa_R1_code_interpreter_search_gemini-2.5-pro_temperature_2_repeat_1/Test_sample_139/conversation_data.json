    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify the Substances:**\n    *   **Clue 6:** \"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\" 277 Kelvin is 3.85 °C. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K), but heavy water (D₂O) melts at 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This is a very strong indicator that substance **B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n    *   **Clue 1:** \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements...\". Since we've identified B as D₂O, the heavier isotope is Deuterium (D or ²H), which is an isotope of Hydrogen. Therefore, **Substance X must contain Deuterium**.\n    *   **Clue 5 & G:** \"a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B (D₂O)\". Heating metal hydroxides (M(OH)ₙ) typically yields a metal oxide and water (H₂O). By analogy, heating a metal deuteroxide (M(OD)ₙ) would yield a metal oxide and heavy water (D₂O). So, **G must be a metal deuteroxide**.\n    *   **Clue 3 & W:** \"...release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons...\". Since the reaction involves Deuterium, let's consider deuterium gas (D₂). A deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. The numbers are equal. Thus, **W is very likely D₂ gas**.\n    *   **Clue 2, 8, 9 & X:** Substance X reacts violently with a liquid Y. Its analog is a common reagent in organic chemistry, and it reacts with a keto acid. These properties strongly point towards powerful reducing agents like lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) or sodium borohydride (NaBH₄). Since X contains deuterium, the candidates are their deuterated analogs: lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄) or sodium borohydride (NaBD₄).\n    *   **The Reaction:** Let's test the reaction of LiAlD₄ with a suitable liquid Y that would produce the identified products. The most logical reaction to produce D₂ gas is the reaction of the deuteride with heavy water (D₂O), which would also be the source for the deuteroxide precipitate.\n        `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4 D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4 D₂ (W)`\n    *   **Validation of the Reaction:**\n        *   This reaction is known to be extremely violent. (Matches clue 2)\n        *   The products are lithium deuteroxide (LiOD, soluble), aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃, a precipitate), and deuterium gas (D₂). This matches the formation of precipitate **G = Al(OD)₃** and gas **W = D₂**.\n        *   Heating the precipitate G: `2 Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O (B)`. This correctly produces **B = D₂O**.\n        *   The analog, LiAlH₄, is a very common reagent in organic chemistry. (Matches clue 9)\n        *   The reaction of LiAlD₄ with a keto acid (e.g., R-CO-COOH) would reduce the keto group to a deuterated alcohol (R-CD(OH)-COOH). The product contains a carboxyl group (-COOH) and a hydroxyl group (-OH), meaning it has 2 oxygen atoms. (Matches clue 8)\n\n    *   Based on all the clues, we can confidently identify **Substance X as LiAlD₄ (Lithium aluminum deuteride)**.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Required Value:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H, present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Heaviest element:** Aluminum (Al). Its most common isotope has a mass number of 27. There is one Al atom in the formula.\n    *   **Lightest element:** Hydrogen (H). Its isotope in the molecule is Deuterium (D), which has a mass number of 2. There are four D atoms in the formula.\n    *   The term \"cumulative atomic masses\" and \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... isotopes must be summed\" means we need to sum the mass of the single Al atom and the four D atoms.\n    *   Sum = (Mass of Al) + (4 × Mass of D)\n    *   Using integer mass numbers for the calculation: Sum = 27 + (4 × 2)\n    *   Sum = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n3.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   The calculated value is 35, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
