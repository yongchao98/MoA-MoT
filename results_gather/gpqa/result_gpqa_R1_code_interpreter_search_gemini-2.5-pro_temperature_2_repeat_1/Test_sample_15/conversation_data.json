    "A compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. The most common feature leading to chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters. However, a molecule with stereocenters can still be achiral if it possesses an element of symmetry, such as a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion (such molecules are called meso compounds). We will analyze each compound to determine if it is chiral.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `CH3-CH2-C(CH3)=CHCl`.\n    *   This molecule does not have any chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that is the plane containing the double bond atoms (C1, C2, Cl, H attached to C1, C3 and the first carbon of the ethyl group).\n    *   Since it is achiral, it is **not optically active**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR, 7aS)`. These R/S assignments specify a particular stereoisomer.\n    *   The presence of such specific descriptors indicates that the molecule has stereocenters and that we are considering a single, defined stereoisomer.\n    *   Unless this specific combination of R and S configurations results in a meso compound (which is highly unlikely for such a complex, unsymmetrical structure), the molecule is chiral. A single enantiomer is, by definition, chiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters, at C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3 (-H, -CH3, -COOH). This suggests the possibility of a meso compound.\n    *   The (2R,3S) configuration refers to the meso form of this molecule. A meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral overall due to an internal element of symmetry.\n    *   Let's draw the molecule in a staggered conformation looking down the C2-C3 bond. The (2R, 3S) conformer can adopt a conformation with a center of inversion (a point of symmetry). It also has a conformation with a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Because it is a meso compound, it is achiral and **not optically active**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   The (2R,3R) configuration and its mirror image, (2S,3S), are enantiomers. They are non-superimposable mirror images.\n    *   This molecule lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   Thus, the (2R,3R) isomer is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond (between C3 and C4) and a hydroxyl group on C1.\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` configuration at C1. C1 is a stereocenter because it is attached to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH2-CH=, and -CH2-CH2-CH=.\n    *   The molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Since the name describes a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is cyclohexane with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5, all on the same side of the ring (cis).\n    *   Let's consider its chair conformation. With all OH groups in axial positions, the molecule has three planes of symmetry, each passing through a C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group. It also has a C3 axis of rotation.\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry means the molecule is achiral. The carbons C1, C3, and C5 are prochiral, not true stereocenters, because the path around the ring from these positions is identical in both directions.\n    *   Since the molecule is achiral, it is **not optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The IUPAC name describes a butan-1-one parent chain, substituted with a cyclopentyl group at C1 and a methyl group at C3.\n    *   The structure is: `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`. This is also known as isobutyl cyclopentyl ketone, `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`.\n    *   We need to check for any chiral centers. The only potential candidate is C3 of the butanoyl chain. However, this carbon atom is bonded to two identical methyl groups (one being C4 of the chain and one being the substituent), a hydrogen atom, and the `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group. Since it is attached to two identical groups, it is not a chiral center.\n    *   The rest of the molecule also lacks any stereocenters or other elements of chirality.\n    *   The molecule is achiral and therefore **not optically active**.\n\nSummary of optically active compounds:\n- (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No\n- (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: Yes\n- (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: No (meso)\n- (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Yes\n- (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Yes\n- (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: No (achiral)\n- 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: No (achiral)\n\nThere are 3 compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<D>>>"
