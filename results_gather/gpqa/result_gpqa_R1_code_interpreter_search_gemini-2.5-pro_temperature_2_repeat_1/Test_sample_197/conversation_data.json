    "This problem requires us to calculate the distribution of cobalt-containing species in a solution with a given free thiocyanate concentration.\n\n**1. Understand the System and Equilibria**\n\nIn the solution, cobalt(II) ions (Co²⁺) react with thiocyanate ions (SCN⁻) to form a series of complexes. The equilibria are described by overall stability constants (β).\n\n*   Co²⁺ (aq) (let's denote this as Co²⁺)\n*   Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺ ; β₁ = [[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) = 9\n*   Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂] ; β₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) = 40\n*   Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ ; β₃ = [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) = 63\n*   Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ ; β₄ = [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) = 16\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\n**2. Formulate the Mole Fraction (α)**\n\nThe fraction of a specific complex, say [Co(SCN)ₙ]²⁻ⁿ, relative to the total cobalt concentration is called the mole fraction, αₙ. We are interested in the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)₂], which corresponds to α₂.\n\nPercentage of [Co(SCN)₂] = α₂ * 100% = ([[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)) * 100%\n\n**3. Express Concentrations and Simplify**\n\nWe can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, [Co²⁺], and the free ligand concentration, [SCN⁻]:\n*   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nNow substitute these into the equation for total cobalt concentration:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nNow we can write the expression for α₂:\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\nα₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))\n\nThe [Co²⁺] term cancels out, which means the distribution of species only depends on the free ligand concentration, [SCN⁻]. The total cobalt concentration, c(Co), is not needed for this calculation.\n\nThe simplified formula for α₂ is:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**4. Calculation**\n\nWe are given:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nLet's calculate each term in the expression:\n*   Numerator: β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   Denominator term 0 (for free Co²⁺): 1\n*   Denominator term 1: β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * (0.1)¹ = 0.9\n*   Denominator term 2: β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4\n*   Denominator term 3: β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063\n*   Denominator term 4: β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n\nNow, we sum the terms in the denominator:\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nFinally, we calculate α₂ and the percentage:\nα₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nPercentage = α₂ * 100% ≈ 16.916%\n\nThis value is closest to 16.9%.\n\nWe can perform the calculation using Python to ensure accuracy.\n```python\n# Given values\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nSCN_conc = 0.1  # [SCN-], free ligand concentration\n\n# Calculate the term for the dithiocyanato complex in the numerator\nnumerator_term = beta2 * (SCN_conc ** 2)\n\n# Calculate the terms for the denominator sum\n# Let's define the sum as S = 1 + Σ(β_n * [SCN-]^n) for n=1 to 4\nsum_terms = 1 + (beta1 * SCN_conc**1) + (beta2 * SCN_conc**2) + (beta3 * SCN_conc**3) + (beta4 * SCN_conc**4)\n\n# The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (alpha_2)\nalpha_2 = numerator_term / sum_terms\n\n# Convert to percentage\npercentage_alpha_2 = alpha_2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage_alpha_2)\n```\n\n16.916180326482278\n\nThe calculated percentage is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is a breakdown of the calculation:\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical System**\nIn the solution, cobalt(II) ions, Co²⁺, react with thiocyanate ions, SCN⁻, to form a series of complexes. The equilibrium concentration of each complex can be related to the free cobalt ion concentration, [Co²⁺], and the free thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻], through the overall stability constants (β).\n\nThe cobalt-containing species are:\n*   Free Co²⁺\n*   [Co(SCN)]⁺\n*   [Co(SCN)₂] (dithiocyanato cobalt(II))\n*   [Co(SCN)₃]⁻\n*   [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n**2. Formulate the Calculation for Mole Fraction (α)**\nThe percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], is its mole fraction (α₂) multiplied by 100.\n`Percentage = α₂ * 100 = ( [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co) ) * 100`\n\nWe can express the concentration of each complex using the stability constants:\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\nSubstituting these into the equation for c(Co):\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\nBy factoring out [Co²⁺], we get:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nNow, let's write the expression for α₂:\n`α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ( [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴) )`\n\nThe free cobalt concentration, [Co²⁺], cancels out, simplifying the equation. The species distribution depends only on the free ligand concentration, [SCN⁻].\n\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**3. Substitute the Given Values and Calculate**\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator:\n`Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\nNext, calculate the terms in the denominator:\n*   Term 0 (for free Co²⁺): `1`\n*   Term 1: `β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n*   Term 2: `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4`\n*   Term 3: `β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063`\n*   Term 4: `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016`\n\nSum of the denominator terms:\n`Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nNow, calculate α₂:\n`α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nFinally, convert the fraction to a percentage:\n`Percentage = 0.16916 * 100% = 16.916%`\n\nThis result matches the value from the code output (`16.91618...`). The closest option is 16.9%.\n\n<<<A>>>"
