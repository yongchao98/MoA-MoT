    "The user is asking to identify a specific immunological process based on experimental observations. Let's break down the key elements of the experiment:\n\n1.  **Antigen and Delivery:** Rotavirus capsid proteins are delivered orally. This mimics a natural infection route for an enteric virus.\n2.  **Location:** The response is observed in Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs located in the small intestine. They are critical sites for initiating immune responses to intestinal antigens.\n3.  **Cellular Response:** There is a \"proliferating cell population\" in the Peyer's patches. This indicates an active immune response, likely within a germinal center, where B cells and T cells are activated and expand.\n4.  **Genetic Observation:** The \"variable heavy chain gene\" of these proliferating cells shows \"high variability.\" This is the most crucial piece of information. The variable region of an antibody is what binds to the antigen.\n\nNow let's evaluate the options in the context of these observations:\n\n*   **A) Complement activation:** This is a part of the innate immune system involving a cascade of plasma proteins. While it would be part of the overall response to the virus, it does not directly cause mutations or variability in the genes of lymphocytes.\n*   **B) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that generates the initial diversity of B cell receptors (antibodies) and T cell receptors. It occurs in primary lymphoid organs (bone marrow for B cells) during the development of lymphocytes, *before* they encounter an antigen. The question describes a process happening in a secondary lymphoid organ *after* antigen exposure, in an already-existing B cell population. Therefore, VDJ recombination has already been completed for these cells.\n*   **C) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a process that occurs in activated B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches) following antigen stimulation. It involves the introduction of random point mutations into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). The goal of SHM is to create B cells with higher-affinity antibodies for the specific antigen. B cells whose receptors have been mutated to bind the antigen more tightly are selected for survival and proliferation. This process results in \"high variability\" specifically in the \"variable heavy chain gene\" among the proliferating B cells, perfectly matching the experimental observation.\n*   **D) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process also occurs in activated B cells within germinal centers. It changes the constant region of the heavy chain, switching the antibody isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgA or IgG). This alters the antibody's effector function but does *not* change the variable region or its antigen-binding specificity. Therefore, it would not account for the high variability observed in the variable heavy chain gene.\n\n**Conclusion:** The observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating cells in a Peyer's patch after antigen exposure is the classic signature of somatic hypermutation, the mechanism of antibody affinity maturation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
