    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the orbital period of Planet3 to that of Planet1 (P3 / P1).\n\n**2. Identify the Relevant Physical Principles:**\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature of a Planet:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's albedo (reflectivity), and its distance from the star.\n*   **Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion:** This law relates a planet's orbital period (P) to its average orbital distance (the semi-major axis, 'd' for a circular orbit).\n\n**3. Formulate the Equations:**\n\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq):**\n    The formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature is:\n    `T_eq^4 = (L_star * (1 - A)) / (16 * π * σ * d^2)`\n    Where:\n    *   `L_star` is the luminosity of the star.\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n    *   `d` is the orbital distance.\n    *   `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n    Since all three planets orbit the same star, `L_star` is constant. The problem states that the albedo `A` is the same for all three planets. Therefore, all terms except `d` are constant. This gives us the proportionality:\n    `T_eq^4 ∝ 1 / d^2`\n    Taking the fourth root of both sides gives:\n    `T_eq ∝ 1 / d^(1/2)` or `T_eq ∝ 1 / √d`\n    This can be rearranged to show the relationship for orbital distance:\n    `d ∝ 1 / T_eq^2`\n    So, the ratio of the distances of two planets (i and j) is inversely related to the square of their temperature ratio:\n    `d_i / d_j = (T_eq_j / T_eq_i)^2`\n\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:**\n    For planets orbiting the same central star, the law is:\n    `P^2 ∝ d^3`\n    Where:\n    *   `P` is the orbital period.\n    *   `d` is the orbital distance.\n    The ratio of the periods of two planets (i and j) is:\n    `(P_i / P_j)^2 = (d_i / d_j)^3`\n    Taking the square root gives:\n    `P_i / P_j = (d_i / d_j)^(3/2)`\n\n*   **Handling Extraneous Information:**\n    The problem mentions the discovery method (TTV), the albedo value (0.3), and the mass ratios of the planets.\n    *   **Albedo:** Since the albedo is the *same* for all planets, it cancels out when creating ratios and does not affect the final calculation.\n    *   **Mass Ratios & TTV:** Kepler's Third Law in its most precise form includes the mass of the planet (`P² ∝ d³ / (M_star + M_planet)`). However, the mass of a planet is typically thousands of times smaller than the mass of its star, making `M_planet` negligible in the sum `(M_star + M_planet)`. The simplified law (`P² ∝ d³`) is almost always sufficient. The mass information is likely extraneous, provided to see if one correctly identifies the core relationships.\n\n**4. Combine the Equations:**\nNow, substitute the expression for the distance ratio (`d_i / d_j`) into the equation for the period ratio (`P_i / P_j`). We want to find P3 / P1:\n`P3 / P1 = (d3 / d1)^(3/2)`\nFrom the temperature relationship, we know `d3 / d1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)^2`.\nSubstitute this in:\n`P3 / P1 = ( (T_eq1 / T_eq3)^2 )^(3/2)`\nThe exponents multiply (`2 * 3/2 = 3`), simplifying the equation to:\n`P3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)^3`\n\n**5. Perform the Calculation:**\nThe final step is to calculate the numerical value.\n\n*   First, find the temperature ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq3` from the given ratios:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 1.4`\n    `T_eq2 / T_eq3 = 2.3`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3) = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22`\n\n*   Now, cube this value to find the period ratio `P3 / P1`:\n    `P3 / P1 = (3.22)^3`\n\nThis calculation can be done with Python.\n```python\n# Ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2\nT1_div_T2 = 1.4\n\n# Ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet2 and Planet3\nT2_div_T3 = 2.3\n\n# Calculate the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet3\nT1_div_T3 = T1_div_T2 * T2_div_T3\n\n# The ratio of orbital periods P3/P1 is related by (T1/T3)^3\nP3_div_P1 = T1_div_T3 ** 3\n\nprint(P3_div_P1)\n```\n>\n>33.386248\n\nThe result is approximately 33.4.\n\n<<<D>>>",
