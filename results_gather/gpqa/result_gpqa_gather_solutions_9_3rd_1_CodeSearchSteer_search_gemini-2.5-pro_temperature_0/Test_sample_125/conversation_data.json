This is a chiral molecule with a single, defined stereocenter at carbon C5.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at C3 is reduced by LAH to a secondary alcohol. This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected. The attack of the hydride ion on the planar carbonyl group at C3 can occur from two different faces. Since the starting material is already chiral, this leads to the formation of two products that are not mirror images of each other.\n*   **Products:** The two products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** These two molecules have two stereocenters. They have the same configuration at one center (C5) but a different configuration at the other (C3). This makes them **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is symmetric and achiral (it has an internal plane of symmetry).\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced by excess NaBH₄ to form pentane-2,4-diol. This creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, all possible stereoisomers are formed. For a symmetric molecule with two new chiral centers, we must check for meso compounds.\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are non-superimposable mirror images. They are a pair of **enantiomers** and are formed as a racemic (1:1) mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has an internal plane of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image ((2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol). It is therefore a single, achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: a pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis of the Mixture:**\n    *   **From Reaction I:** The two products are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** The products are a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound. The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers and has different physical properties, so it will be separated from the enantiomeric pair's peak. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different (constitutional isomers with different molecular formulas) and will have different retention times.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It can separate all non-identical stereoisomers.\n*   **Analysis of the Mixture:** The combined mixture contains a total of 5 unique stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** A chiral column will resolve all five of these distinct stereoisomers. Therefore, there will be **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows there will be **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule with a single stereocenter at carbon C5 in the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol by LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride). This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material is already chiral, the attack of the hydride on the planar carbonyl group can occur from two different faces, creating two products. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected. The two products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other because they have the same configuration at one stereocenter (C5) but differ at the other (C3). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two distinct diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral because it has an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols by excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride), forming pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material is achiral, we must consider all possible stereoisomers of the product.\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, forming a pair of **enantiomers**. They are produced as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    2.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image ((2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol). It is therefore a single, achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: a pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in physical properties (like polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the pair of enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as **1 peak**. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, has different physical properties, and will be separated, giving a **second peak**. Thus, the products from Reaction II yield **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different (constitutional isomers) and will not have the same retention times.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with all non-identical stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Analysis:** The combined mixture contains a total of five unique stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   A chiral column is designed to resolve all five of these distinct compounds.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows there will be **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to logically deduce the number of products from each reaction and then determine how they would be separated by the two different types of HPLC.\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction I**: I will determine the products of the reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This involves creating a new stereocenter in a molecule that is already chiral, which will produce diastereomers. I will count the number of products.\n2.  **Analyze Reaction II**: I will determine the products of the reduction of pentane-2,4-dione. This involves creating two new stereocenters in a symmetric, achiral molecule, which will produce a mix of enantiomers and a meso compound. I will count the number of unique products.\n3.  **Calculate Normal-Phase HPLC Peaks**: I will sum the number of peaks expected from the combined mixture. Normal-phase (achiral) HPLC separates diastereomers but not enantiomers.\n4.  **Calculate Chiral HPLC Peaks**: I will determine the number of peaks expected from the combined mixture on a chiral column, which separates all unique stereoisomers (both diastereomers and enantiomers).\n5.  **Select the Final Answer**: I will match the calculated peak counts to the given options.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_hplc():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function logically determines the number of peaks in normal-phase and chiral HPLC\n    for the products of two specified organic reactions.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze Reaction I\n    # Starting material: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one (chiral, 1 stereocenter)\n    # Reaction: Reduction of a ketone creates a new stereocenter.\n    # Since the original molecule is chiral, the two possible products are diastereomers.\n    # Products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    products_reaction_1 = 2\n    print(\"Analysis of Reaction I:\")\n    print(f\"Reaction I produces {products_reaction_1} products, which are diastereomers.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze Reaction II\n    # Starting material: Pentane-2,4-dione (achiral, symmetric)\n    # Reaction: Reduction of two ketones creates two new stereocenters.\n    # The products are a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n    # Products: (2R,4R)-diol, (2S,4S)-diol (enantiomers), and (2R,4S)-diol (meso).\n    products_reaction_2 = 3\n    print(\"Analysis of Reaction II:\")\n    print(f\"Reaction II produces {products_reaction_2} unique stereoisomers (a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate Normal-Phase HPLC Peaks\n    # Normal-phase (achiral) HPLC separates diastereomers but NOT enantiomers.\n    # From Reaction I: The 2 diastereomers will separate. -> 2 peaks.\n    peaks_normal_rxn1 = 2\n    # From Reaction II: The enantiomeric pair will elute as 1 peak.

Analyze Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This molecule is chiral, with a pre-existing stereocenter at the C5 position in the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol by LAH. This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction. The attack of the hydride on the planar carbonyl group can happen from two faces, creating two possible configurations at the new C3 stereocenter (R and S). This results in two products:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have the same configuration at one stereocenter (C5) but differ at the other (C3).

Analyze Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral because it has an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols by excess NaBH₄, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material is achiral, we must consider all possible stereoisomers of the product.\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are non-superimposable mirror images. They form a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts with achiral materials, they are produced as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has an internal plane of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image, (2S, 4R). It is therefore a single, achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomeric products are formed (a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound).\n\n**3. Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase (achiral) HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers and will be separated from them, giving a second peak. This results in **2 peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally different (constitutional isomers) and will have different retention times. There will be no accidental co-elution.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**4.

This is a chiral molecule with a single, defined stereocenter at carbon C5 in the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol by LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride), a strong reducing agent.

The two enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers and has different physical properties, so it will be separated from the enantiomeric pair's peak.

Therefore, Reaction I produces **two** distinct compounds.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral because it has an internal plane of symmetry passing through the C3 carbon.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols using excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), forming pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since the starting material is achiral, all possible stereoisomers of the product are formed. We must consider the relationships between the (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and (2R, 4S)/(2S, 4R) configurations.\n*   **Products:**\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They constitute a pair of **enantiomers**. As the reaction starts from achiral precursors, they are formed as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    2.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image, (2S, 4R). It is therefore a single, achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. In total, Reaction II produces **three** distinct stereoisomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated into **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the enantiomers, has different physical properties and will elute separately. This gives **2 peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally different and will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks:** The total number of peaks is the sum from both reactions: 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with all stereoisomers, enabling the separation of enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Analysis:** The total mixture contains five unique stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Total Peaks:** A chiral column is designed to resolve all of these distinct compounds. Therefore, each of the **5** unique stereoisomers will produce its own peak.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram.

Deconstruction of the Problem**\n\nThe core of the question requires determining the number of stereoisomers produced in two separate reactions and then predicting how many distinct peaks these compounds will generate on two different types of HPLC columns: normal-phase (achiral) and chiral.\n\n### **2. Analysis of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule with one existing stereocenter at C5.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to an alcohol, creating a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** Since a new stereocenter is formed in a molecule that is already chiral, the two resulting products, (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** This reaction produces **2** distinct chemical compounds.\n\nAll 15 candidate answers correctly reach this conclusion.\n\n### **3. Analysis of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetric, achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketones are reduced to alcohols, creating two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Products:** For a symmetric molecule where two stereocenters are created, we must consider the possible stereoisomers:\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This is a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts from achiral materials, they are formed as a racemic mixture.\n    2.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** This reaction produces **3** distinct stereoisomers (the two enantiomers and the meso compound).\n\nAll 15 candidate answers also correctly reach this conclusion.\n\n### **4. Analysis of the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\nThe combined mixture contains a total of 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5** unique stereoisomers.\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):** This technique separates compounds with different physical properties. Diastereomers have different properties and are separated. Enantiomers have identical properties (in an achiral environment) and are not separated.\n    *   The 2 diastereomers from Reaction I will produce **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the pair of enantiomers will elute together as 1 peak, and the meso compound (which is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair) will elute separately. This produces **2 peaks**.\n    *   Total peaks = 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC (Chiral Column):** This technique is designed to separate all stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n    *   Since there are 5 unique stereoisomers in the mixture, the chiral column will resolve all of them.\n    *   Total peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **5.

While many of the candidate answers presented the correct reasoning, they failed to match it to the correct option letter. Based on the correct scientific analysis, option A is the only valid answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This molecule is chiral, with a single defined stereocenter at the C5 position in the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at the C3 position is reduced to a secondary alcohol by Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH). This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material is already chiral, the creation of a new stereocenter results in the formation of two products. The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected. The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have the same configuration at one stereocenter (C5) but differ at the other (C3). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Reaction I produces **two** distinct products.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral because it has an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols by excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), forming pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material is achiral, all possible stereoisomers are formed. We must analyze the stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They constitute a pair of **enantiomers**. They are formed as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has an internal plane of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image ((2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol). It is therefore a single, achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Reaction II produces **three** distinct stereoisomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated.

This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule with a single stereocenter at the C5 position, which has the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at the C3 position is reduced to a secondary alcohol by Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH). This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected. Since the starting material is already chiral, the attack of the hydride on the planar carbonyl group creates two products that are not mirror images of each other.\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have the same configuration at one stereocenter (C5) but different configurations at the other (C3). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Reaction I produces **two** distinct stereoisomeric products.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral because it has an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols by excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), forming pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material is achiral, all possible stereoisomers are formed. We must analyze the stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol:\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These are non-superimposable mirror images, forming a pair of **enantiomers**. They are produced as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    2.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same meso molecule.\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Reaction II produces **three** distinct stereoisomeric products.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase (achiral) HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the pair of enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers and will be separated from them, giving a second peak. This results in **2 peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally different and will not have the same retention times.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with all non-identical stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Analysis:** The total mixture contains five unique stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** A chiral column is designed to resolve all of these distinct stereoisomers. Each of the five compounds will produce a separate peak. Therefore, there will be **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction I**\n\n1.  **Starting Material**: The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. It is a chiral molecule with a single stereocenter at the C5 position, which has a defined (S) configuration.\n2.  **Reaction**: The ketone at the C3 position is reduced to a secondary alcohol by Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH). This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n3.  **Products**: The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected. The attack of the hydride on the planar carbonyl group can occur from two different faces, leading to two possible configurations at the new C3 stereocenter, (R) and (S). This results in the formation of two products:\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n4.  **Relationship**: These two products are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other because they have the same configuration at one stereocenter (C5) but different configurations at the other (C3). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Reaction I produces **two** distinct compounds.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction II**\n\n1.  **Starting Material**: The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione.

This reaction creates two new stereocenters at positions C2 and C4.\n3.  **Products**: Since the starting material is achiral, all possible stereoisomers of the product are formed. We must consider the stereochemical outcomes for a symmetric molecule with two new stereocenters:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol: These are non-superimposable mirror images, forming a pair of **enantiomers**. They are produced as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image ((2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol).

They have different physical properties and will be separated, yielding **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers and will be separated from them.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and verifying each step.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule because it has a single stereocenter at the C5 position with a defined (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at the C3 position is reduced to a secondary alcohol by LAH. This chemical transformation creates a new stereocenter at the C3 position.\n*   **Products and their Relationship:** The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction. The reduction of the planar ketone group can occur from two different faces, leading to two possible configurations (R or S) at the new C3 stereocenter. This results in two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Since these two molecules have the same configuration at one stereocenter (C5) but differ at the other (C3), they are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two distinct diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols by excess NaBH₄, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new stereocenters at positions C2 and C4.\n*   **Products and their Relationship:** Since the starting material is achiral and symmetric, we must consider all possible stereoisomers of the product.\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They form a pair of **enantiomers**. Because the reaction starts from achiral materials, they are produced as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    2.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, which means it is superimposable on its mirror image ((2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol). It is therefore a single, achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: a pair of enantiomers and one meso compound. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Analysis:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated, yielding **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the enantiomers, has different physical properties and will be separated from them. This gives **2 peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally different (constitutional isomers) and will have different retention times. There is no risk of accidental co-elution.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with all non-identical stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Peak Analysis:** The combined mixture contains a total of 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 unique stereoisomers**.\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.

Analyze Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This molecule is chiral, with a pre-existing stereocenter at the C5 position in the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol by LAH. This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction. The attack of the hydride on the planar carbonyl group can happen from two faces, creating two possible configurations at the new C3 stereocenter (R and S). This results in two products:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have the same configuration at one stereocenter (C5) but differ at the other (C3). By definition, they are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two distinct diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n**2. Analyze Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral because it has an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols by excess NaBH₄, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material is achiral, we must consider all possible stereoisomers of the product.\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are non-superimposable mirror images. They form a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts with achiral materials, they are produced as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has an internal plane of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image, (2S, 4R). It is therefore a single, achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomeric products are formed (a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound).\n\n**3. Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase (achiral) HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers and will be separated from them, giving a second peak. This results in **2 peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally different (constitutional isomers) and will have different retention times. There will be no accidental co-elution.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**4. Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with all non-identical stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Analysis:** The combined mixture contains a total of 2 + 3 = **5 unique stereoisomers**.\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   A chiral column is designed to resolve all five of these distinct compounds.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** **5 peaks**.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe analysis shows there will be **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule with a single, defined stereocenter at carbon C5 in the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol by LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride), a strong reducing agent. This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since the starting material is already chiral, the attack of the hydride ion on the two non-equivalent faces of the planar carbonyl group will produce two different products. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected. The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n*   **Products:** The two products formed are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** These two molecules have the same configuration at one stereocenter (C5) but a different configuration at the other (C3). By definition, they are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two distinct diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols by excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride). The product is pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, all possible stereoisomers of the product will be formed. For a symmetric molecule like this, we must consider the possibility of a meso compound.\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers** and will be formed as a racemic (1:1) mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has an internal plane of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image ((2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol). It is therefore a single, achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: a pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis of the Mixture:** The combined mixture contains 5 total stereoisomers.\n    *   **From Reaction I:** The two products are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** The products are a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound. The two enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers and has different physical properties, so it will be separated from the enantiomeric pair's peak. Therefore, the products from Reaction II will produce **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally distinct (constitutional isomers) and will have different retention times. There will be no accidental co-elution.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It can separate all non-identical stereoisomers.\n*   **Analysis of the Mixture:** The mixture contains 5 unique stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Since a chiral column can resolve all of these distinct stereoisomers, each one will produce a separate peak. Therefore, there will be **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows there will be **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram.

Therefore, there will be **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram.

The attack of the hydride ion on the planar carbonyl group can occur from two different faces, resulting in two possible configurations, (R) and (S), at the newly formed C3 stereocenter.\n*   **Products:** The reaction yields two products:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have two stereocenters. They share the same configuration at C5 but differ at C3. By definition, they are **diastereomers**. Therefore, Reaction I produces **two** distinct compounds.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral because it has an internal plane of symmetry passing through the C3 carbon.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols using excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), forming pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since the starting material is achiral, all possible stereoisomers of the product are formed. We must consider the relationships between the (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and (2R, 4S)/(2S, 4R) configurations.\n*   **Products:**\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They constitute a pair of **enantiomers**. As the reaction starts from achiral precursors, they are formed as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    2.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image, (2S, 4R). It is therefore a single, achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. In total, Reaction II produces **three** distinct stereoisomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral.

The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the enantiomers, has different physical properties and will elute separately. This gives **2 peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally different and will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks:** The total number of peaks is the sum from both reactions: 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with all stereoisomers, enabling the separation of enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Analysis:** The total mixture contains five unique stereoisomers:\n    1.

This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer, based on a synthesis of the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule, meaning it is a single enantiomer with a defined stereocenter at the C5 position.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol by LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride). This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The original stereocenter at C5 remains unchanged. The reduction of the planar ketone can happen from two different faces, creating two possible configurations (R and S) at the new C3 stereocenter.\n*   **Products:** The reaction produces two distinct molecules:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have two stereocenters. They share the same configuration at one center (C5) but differ at the other (C3). By definition, they are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two distinct diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral because it has an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols by excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride), forming pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since the starting material is achiral, all possible stereoisomers of the product are formed.\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are non-superimposable mirror images. They are a pair of **enantiomers** and are formed as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has an internal plane of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image ((2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol). It is therefore a single, achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomeric products are formed (a pair of enantiomers and one meso compound).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in physical properties (like polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis of the Mixture:**\n    *   **From Reaction I:** The two products are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated into **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** The products are a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound. The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as **1 peak**. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, has different physical properties, and will be separated, giving a **second peak**. Thus, the products from Reaction II yield **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally different and will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with all non-identical stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of **both diastereomers and enantiomers**.\n*   **Analysis of the Mixture:** The combined mixture contains a total of 2 + 3 = **5 unique stereoisomers**.\n    1.

(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   A chiral column will resolve all five of these distinct compounds.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis consistently shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule with a single stereocenter at carbon C5, which has the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol by LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride). This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material is already chiral, the attack of the hydride on the planar carbonyl group creates two products. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected.\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have the same configuration at one stereocenter (C5) but different configurations at the other (C3). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Reaction I produces **two** distinct compounds.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral due to a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols by excess NaBH₄, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** We must consider the stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol.\n    1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    3.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Relationship:**\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images, making them a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the starting materials are achiral, they are formed as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) isomer has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**. (The (2S, 4R) configuration is the same molecule).\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   Reaction II produces **three** distinct stereoisomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe total mixture contains 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5** unique stereoisomers.\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle:** An achiral column separates compounds based on differences in physical properties (like polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The enantiomers will co-elute as one peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers and will be separated from them. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different (different molecular formulas, C₇H₁₆O₂ vs. C₅H₁₂O₂) and will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks (Normal-Phase):** 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC (Chiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral column has a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with all stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The mixture contains 5 unique stereoisomers.\n    *   A chiral column is designed to resolve all of them.\n*   **Total Peaks (Chiral):** Each of the 5 unique stereoisomers will produce its own peak. Therefore, there will be **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows there will be **5 peaks in chiral HPLC** and **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the Problem**\n\nThe core of the question requires determining the number of stereoisomers produced in two separate reactions and then predicting how many distinct peaks these compounds will generate on two different types of HPLC columns: normal-phase (achiral) and chiral.\n\n### **2. Analysis of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule with one existing stereocenter at C5.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to an alcohol, creating a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** Since a new stereocenter is formed in a molecule that is already chiral, the two resulting products, (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** This reaction produces **2** distinct chemical compounds.\n\nAll 15 candidate answers correctly reach this conclusion.\n\n### **3. Analysis of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetric, achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketones are reduced to alcohols, creating two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Products:** For a symmetric molecule where two stereocenters are created, we must consider the possible stereoisomers:\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This is a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts from achiral materials, they are formed as a racemic mixture.\n    2.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** This reaction produces **3** distinct stereoisomers (the two enantiomers and the meso compound).\n\nAll 15 candidate answers also correctly reach this conclusion.\n\n### **4. Analysis of the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\nThe combined mixture contains a total of 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5** unique stereoisomers.\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):** This technique separates compounds with different physical properties. Diastereomers have different properties and are separated. Enantiomers have identical properties (in an achiral environment) and are not separated.\n    *   The 2 diastereomers from Reaction I will produce **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the pair of enantiomers will elute together as 1 peak, and the meso compound (which is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair) will elute separately. This produces **2 peaks**.\n    *   Total peaks = 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC (Chiral Column):** This technique is designed to separate all stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n    *   Since there are 5 unique stereoisomers in the mixture, the chiral column will resolve all of them.\n    *   Total peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **5. Final Decision**\n\nThe consistent and correct chemical analysis, agreed upon by the reasoning in all 15 candidate answers and confirmed by this step-by-step breakdown, is:\n*   **Peaks in chiral HPLC: 5**\n*   **Peaks in normal-phase HPLC: 4**\n\nNow, we match this result to the given options:\n*   **A) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**\n*   B) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n*   C) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n*   D) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\n\nThe correct result directly corresponds to option A. While many of the candidate answers presented the correct reasoning, they failed to match it to the correct option letter. Based on the correct scientific analysis, option A is the only valid answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This molecule is chiral, with a single defined stereocenter at the C5 position in the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at the C3 position is reduced to a secondary alcohol by Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH). This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material is already chiral, the creation of a new stereocenter results in the formation of two products. The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected. The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have the same configuration at one stereocenter (C5) but differ at the other (C3). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Reaction I produces **two** distinct products.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral because it has an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols by excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), forming pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material is achiral, all possible stereoisomers are formed.

They constitute a pair of **enantiomers**. They are formed as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has an internal plane of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image ((2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol).

They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the pair of enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers, has different physical properties, and will be separated from the enantiomeric pair. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally different and will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with all stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of **both diastereomers and enantiomers**.\n*   **Analysis:** The combined mixture contains a total of 2 + 3 = **5 unique stereoisomers**.\n    1.
