Goal Identification and Physics Principles\n\nThe main goal is to calculate the minimum detector resolution (`d_res`) needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of a relativistic particle, $X^0$.\n\n*   **Observation Condition**: An individual decay is considered \"observed\" if the particle travels a distance greater than the detector's resolution (`d > d_res`).\n*   **Decay Law**: The decay of particles is a probabilistic process governed by an exponential law. The probability that a particle with a mean decay length `λ` travels a distance `x` or more is:\n    $P(d > x) = e^{-x/λ}$\n*   **Mathematical Formulation**: To observe at least 30% of decays, we must find the resolution `d_res` that satisfies the boundary condition:\n    $e^{-d_{res}/λ} = 0.30$\n    Solving for `d_res` gives:\n    $d_{res} = -λ \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n*   **Relativity**: Since the particle is highly energetic ($E=27$ GeV) compared to its rest mass ($m_0c^2=3.41$ GeV), we must use special relativity to find its mean decay length `λ` in the laboratory frame.\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**Step A: Calculate the particle's momentum (`pc`)**\nThe relativistic energy-momentum relation is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n$pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719}$\n$pc \\approx 26.78$ GeV\n\n**Step B: Calculate the mean decay length in the lab frame (λ)**\nThe formula for the mean decay length is $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$.\n*   Given: $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   Using the speed of light, $c \\approx 2.998 \\times 10^8$ m/s:\n    $\\lambda = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\times (2.998 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    $\\lambda \\approx (7.854) \\times (2.398 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**Step C: Calculate the minimum resolution (`d_res`)**\nUsing the equation from Step 1:\n$d_{res} = -λ \\cdot \\ln(0.30) \\approx -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (-1.204)$\n$d_{res} \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### 3. Comparison with Options and Careful Points\n\nThe calculated result, using a direct interpretation of \"30%\", is **$2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**. Let's examine the options provided in the question:\nA) 2.08\\*1e-9 m\nB) 2.08\\*1e-6 m\nC) 2.08\\*1e-3 m\nD) 2.08\\*1e-1 m\n\nOur calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is numerically closest to option **B) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**. All other options are off by several orders of magnitude.\n\n**Careful Point 1: The \"1/3\" Hypothesis**\nMany of the candidate answers astutely observe that in physics problems, a round number like \"30%\" is often a rounded approximation of a simpler fraction like **1/3**. Let's test this hypothesis:\n*   The condition becomes: $e^{-d_{res}/λ} = 1/3$\n*   This yields: $d_{res} = -λ \\cdot \\ln(1/3) = λ \\cdot \\ln(3)$\n*   Recalculating with this condition:\n    $d_{res} = (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (1.0986) \\approx 2.070 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\nThis result, **$2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, is an almost perfect match for option **B) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m** (less than a 0.5% difference). This strongly suggests that this was the intended path to the solution.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Inconsistency in Candidate Answers**\nWhile most candidate answers perform the calculation correctly, they show a major inconsistency in assigning letters to the multiple-choice options. They correctly derive the numerical value but then label it with an incorrect letter (A, C, D, etc.). However, based on the options listed in the original problem description, the value **$2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m** corresponds to option **B**.\n\nBoth lines of reasoning—the direct calculation and the more precise \"1/3\" hypothesis—unequivocally point to the numerical value $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m as the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the candidate answers.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physical Question\nThe core task is to determine the minimum spatial resolution ($d_{res}$) of a detector required to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of the particle $X^0$.\n\nAn \"observed\" decay implies that the neutral particle $X^0$ travels a distance from its creation point that is large enough for the detector to resolve it as a distinct event from the decay point. Therefore, the particle must travel a distance `x` greater than the resolution `d_res` before it decays.\n\n### 2. The Physics of Decay Probability\nThe decay of unstable particles is a random process governed by an exponential decay law. The probability that a particle will travel a distance greater than `d_res` before decaying is given by:\n\n$P(x > d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}$\n\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the particle's mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n\nThe problem states we need to observe \"at least 30% of the decays\". To find the minimum resolution, we set this probability to the boundary condition:\n\n$e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n\nSolving this equation for $d_{res}$ by taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:\n\n$-d_{res}/\\lambda = \\ln(0.30)$\n$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30) \\approx 1.204 \\cdot \\lambda$\n\n### 3. Calculating the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)\nSince the particle's total energy (27 GeV) is much larger than its rest mass energy (3.41 GeV), it is highly relativistic. We must use the principles of special relativity to find the mean decay length in the lab frame.\n\nA precise way to calculate $\\lambda$ uses the particle's momentum ($p$) and proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$):\n$\\lambda = \\frac{p}{m_0} \\tau_0 = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$\n\nWe first find the particle's momentum-energy ($pc$) using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n\n*   **Step 3a: Calculate Momentum ($pc$)**\n    $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}$\n    $pc = \\sqrt{(27 \\text{ GeV})^2 - (3.41 \\text{ GeV})^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n*   **Step 3b: Calculate Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**\n    Using $c \\approx 2.998 \\times 10^8$ m/s:\n    $\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (2.998 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    $\\lambda \\approx (7.854) \\cdot (2.398 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### 4. Final Calculation and Careful Analysis\n\nNow we can calculate the resolution $d_{res}$:\n\n*   **Calculation 1 (Literal Interpretation):**\n    Using the literal 30% condition:\n    $d_{res} = 1.204 \\cdot \\lambda \\approx 1.204 \\cdot (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n*   **Careful Point - The \"1/3\" Hypothesis:**\n    As pointed out by a majority of the candidate answers, in multiple-choice physics problems, a round number like \"30%\" is often a convenient approximation for a simpler, fundamental fraction. A very common one is $1/3 \\approx 33.3\\%$. Let's test this hypothesis.\n    The condition becomes $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$.\n    This leads to $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(1/3) = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$.\n\n*   **Calculation 2 (Refined Interpretation):**\n    $d_{res} = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3) \\approx (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986) \\approx 2.07 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nLet's compare our results with the given options:\nA) 2.08*1e-9 m\nB) 2.08*1e-3 m\nC) 2.08*1e-1 m\nD) 2.08*1e-6 m\n\nThe literal calculation gives $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, which is closest to option D. The refined calculation gives $2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, which is an almost perfect match for option D (less than 0.5% difference). This gives very strong evidence that the problem was designed with the $1/3$ survival probability in mind. Both interpretations robustly point to option D as the only plausible answer, as all other options differ by orders of magnitude.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\n**Analysis of the Problem and Candidate Answers**\n\nThe goal is to determine the minimum detector resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle $X^0$. A decay is considered \"observed\" if the particle travels a distance greater than the detector's resolution before decaying.\n\n**Step 1: Formulating the Physical Condition**\nThe decay of particles follows an exponential law. The probability that a particle with a mean decay length `λ` travels a distance `x` or more before decaying is:\n$P(travel\\_distance \\ge x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$\n\nThe condition to observe at least 30% of decays for a resolution `d_res` is:\n$P(travel\\_distance \\ge d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n\nBy taking the natural logarithm of both sides and rearranging, we can solve for `d_res`:\n$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\n**Step 2: Calculating the Mean Decay Length (λ)**\nThe mean decay length must be calculated in the laboratory frame, taking into account relativistic effects, since the particle's total energy (27 GeV) is much greater than its rest mass energy (3.41 GeV). The most accurate method uses the particle's momentum.\n\n1.  **Calculate momentum-energy ($pc$)**: Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n2.  **Calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$)**: The formula is $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c \\cdot \\tau_0$.\n    Using the given values:\n    *   $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    *   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n    $\\lambda = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**Step 3: Calculating the Minimum Resolution (d_res)**\nUsing the formula from Step 1:\n$d_{res} = -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\ln(0.30) \\approx -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**Step 4: Comparison with Options and Final Determination**\nThe calculated resolution is approximately **$2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**.\n\nNow we must compare this result with the options provided in the original question:\nA) 2.08\\*1e-3 m\nB) 2.08\\*1e-1 m\nC) 2.08\\*1e-9 m\nD) 2.08\\*1e-6 m\n\nThe only option with the correct order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$) is **D) 2.08\\*1e-6 m**. Our calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is numerically closest to this option.\n\n**A point of careful analysis:** Several candidate answers insightfully note that in physics problems, a round number like \"30%\" might be an approximation for a simpler fraction, such as 1/3. Let's test this hypothesis.\nIf we set the observation probability to 1/3:\n$d_{res} = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$\n$d_{res} = (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986) \\approx 2.070 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nThis result, **$2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, is an almost perfect match for the value in option D, **$2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, with a discrepancy of less than 0.5%. This strongly suggests that this was the intended path to the answer. Both lines of reasoning robustly point to option D as the correct choice.\n\nThe discrepancies in the final letter choices among the candidate answers appear to stem from working with differently ordered lists of options.

Deconstruct the Physics Problem**\nThe question asks for the minimum detector resolution ($d_{res}$) required to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of the particle $X^0$.\n\n*   **Observation Condition:** The particle $X^0$ is neutral and leaves no track. It decays into charged particles $Y^+$ and $Z^-$, which do leave tracks. An \"observed\" decay means the neutral particle must travel a distance from its creation point that is large enough to be resolved from the decay point. This distance must be greater than the detector's resolution, $d_{res}$.\n*   **Probability Law:** Particle decay is a random process. The probability that a particle with a mean decay length $\\lambda$ travels a distance `x` or more before decaying is described by the exponential decay law:\n    $P(\\text{distance} \\ge x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$\n*   **Mathematical Condition:** To observe at least 30% of decays, we require $P(\\text{distance} \\ge d_{res}) \\ge 0.30$. To find the *minimum* required resolution, we solve for the boundary condition:\n    $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n\n**2. Outline the Calculation**\nTo find $d_{res}$, we first need to find the mean decay length in the laboratory frame, $\\lambda$.\n1.  Calculate the particle's relativistic momentum-energy ($pc$) using the energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n2.

Careful Point: A More Refined Interpretation**\n\nAs noted by several of the provided candidate answers, it is a common practice in physics exam questions for a round percentage like \"30%\" to be used as a convenient approximation for a simpler, fundamental fraction.

This provides very strong evidence that this was the intended interpretation for designing the question.\n\nBoth the direct calculation and the more refined analysis point unequivocally to the same option.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the physics problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided answers and identifying crucial points for arriving at the correct solution.\n\n### **Analysis of the Problem**\n\nThe question asks for the minimum detector resolution required to observe the decay of a neutral particle, $X^0$. An \"observed\" decay implies that the particle must travel a distance from its creation point that is greater than the detector's resolution before it decays.\n\n### **Step 1: Establishing the Physical Condition**\n\nThe decay of unstable particles is a statistical process that follows an exponential decay law. The probability, P, that a particle with a mean decay length $\\lambda$ travels a distance `x` or more before decaying is given by:\n\n$P(x \\ge d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}$\n\nThe problem requires that \"at least 30% of the decays\" are observed. To find the minimum resolution ($d_{res}$), we use the boundary condition:\n\n$e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n\nSolving for $d_{res}$ by taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:\n\n$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**\n\nThe particle's energy ($E = 27$ GeV) is significantly greater than its rest mass ($m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV), meaning it is highly relativistic. We must use relativistic kinematics to find its mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n\nThe most precise formula for the mean decay length relates it to the particle's lab-frame momentum ($p$) and its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$):\n\n$\\lambda = \\frac{p}{m_0}\\tau_0 = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$\n\nTo use this, we first calculate the momentum-energy ($pc$) from the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$:\n\n$(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (27 \\text{ GeV})^2 - (3.41 \\text{ GeV})^2$\n$pc = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nNow we can calculate the mean decay length $\\lambda$:\n\n$\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (c \\cdot \\tau_0) = \\left(\\frac{26.78}{3.41}\\right) \\cdot (2.998 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s} \\cdot 8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n$\\lambda \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Minimum Resolution ($d_{res}$)**\n\nUsing the formula from Step 1 with our calculated value for $\\lambda$:\n\n$d_{res} = -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\ln(0.30) \\approx -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204)$\n$d_{res} \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### **Careful Points and Final Decision**\n\n1.  **Direct Calculation vs. Options**: Our direct calculation yields a result of $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Comparing this to the options:\n    A) 2.08\\*1e-1 m\n    B) 2.08\\*1e-3 m\n    C) 2.08\\*1e-6 m\n    D) 2.08\\*1e-9 m\n    The calculated value is numerically closest to option **C) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**. The order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$) is a perfect match, while all other options are off by a factor of 1000 or more.\n\n2.  **The \"1/3 Hypothesis\"**: Many of the candidate answers correctly identified a common feature in physics test questions. The stated percentage \"30%\" is often a rounded value for a simpler fraction used to design the problem. A likely candidate here is $1/3$ (~33.3%). Let's test this hypothesis:\n    The condition becomes $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$.\n    This leads to $d_{res} = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$.\n    $d_{res} = (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\ln(3) \\approx (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986)$\n    $d_{res} \\approx 2.070 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n3.  **Conclusion**: This result, $2.070 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is an almost perfect match for option C, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m (less than a 0.5% difference). This provides extremely strong evidence that the problem was designed with the intention of observing at least $1/3$ of the decays, and \"30%\" was used as a convenient approximation in the problem statement.\n\nBoth the direct calculation and the more refined hypothesis point decisively to the same option.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating careful points derived from the candidate answers.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Physical Problem\nThe question asks for the minimum spatial resolution a detector needs to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of the particle X⁰.\n\n*   **What does \"observe a decay\" mean?** Since the initial particle X⁰ is neutral, it doesn't leave a track. Its charged decay products (Y⁺, Z⁻) do. An observation is possible only if the neutral particle travels a distance from its creation point that is large enough for the detector to resolve it as separate from the decay point. This distance must be greater than the detector's resolution, `d_res`.\n*   **The Probability Condition:** The problem requires observing \"at least 30%\" of decays. This translates into the probability condition that the distance traveled (`x`) must be greater than the resolution (`d_res`) for at least 30% of the particles. So, `P(x > d_res) ≥ 0.30`.\n\n### 2. Identifying the Key Physics Principles\nTo solve this, we need to combine two key areas of physics:\n*   **Special Relativity:** The particle's total energy (E = 27 GeV) is much greater than its rest mass energy (m₀c² = 3.41 GeV), which means it's traveling at a speed very close to the speed of light. Relativistic effects like time dilation are crucial.\n*   **Exponential Decay Law:** The decay of unstable particles is a random process. The probability that a particle survives to travel a distance `x` or more is described by the equation: `P(x) = e^(-x/λ)`, where `λ` is the particle's mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Calculation\n**Step A: Set up the equation for the resolution**\nTo find the minimum resolution, we solve for the boundary case of our probability condition:\n$e^{-d_{res}/λ} = 0.30$\nBy taking the natural logarithm of both sides and rearranging, we get:\n$d_{res} = -λ \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\n**Step B: Calculate the mean decay length (λ)**\nThe mean decay length in the lab frame (`λ`) is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. It is related to its proper lifetime (`τ₀`) but must be calculated using relativistic formulas. The most precise way uses the particle's momentum.\n1.  **Find the particle's momentum (`pc`)**: We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation, `E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²`.\n    *   `(pc)² = E² - (m₀c²)² = (27)² - (3.41)² = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719` GeV²\n    *   `pc = √717.3719 ≈ 26.78` GeV\n2.  **Calculate `λ`**: The formula is `λ = (pc / m₀c²) * cτ₀`.\n    *   `λ = (26.78 GeV / 3.41 GeV) * (2.998 x 10⁸ m/s) * (8 x 10⁻¹⁶ s)`\n    *   `λ ≈ 7.854 * (2.398 x 10⁻⁷ m) ≈ 1.884 x 10⁻⁶` m\n\n**Step C: Calculate the minimum resolution (`d_res`)**\nNow we use the equation from Step A with our calculated value for `λ`.\n*   `ln(0.30) ≈ -1.204`\n*   `d_res = -(1.884 x 10⁻⁶ m) * (-1.204) ≈ 2.268 x 10⁻⁶` m\n\n### 4. Analysis and Careful Points\n*   Our calculated value is **~2.27 x 10⁻⁶ m**.\n*   The options are:\n    A) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n    B) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\n    C) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n    D) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\n*   Our calculated result has the correct order of magnitude (`10⁻⁶ m`) only for option A. All other options are off by factors of 1000 or more.\n*   **Crucial Point of Interpretation:** The calculated value `2.27 x 10⁻⁶ m` differs from option A (`2.08 x 10⁻⁶ m`) by about 9%. As noted by many of the more thorough candidate answers, it is a very common practice in physics exam questions for a round percentage like \"30%\" to be an approximation of a simpler fraction. Let's test the hypothesis that the intended probability was **1/3** (~33.3%).\n    *   If `P(x > d_res) = 1/3`, then `e^(-d_res/λ) = 1/3`.\n    *   Solving for `d_res` gives: `d_res = λ * ln(3)`.\n    *   `d_res = (1.884 x 10⁻⁶ m) * (1.0986) ≈ 2.070 x 10⁻⁶` m.\n\nThis result, **`2.07 x 10⁻⁶ m`**, is an extremely close match to option A, **`2.08 x 10⁻⁶ m`**. The discrepancy is less than 0.5%. This strongly suggests that this interpretation was the intended method to reach the given answer.\n\n### Final Decision\nThe physics calculation consistently points to a resolution on the order of `10⁻⁶` meters. The more refined interpretation, recognizing that \"30%\" is likely a proxy for \"1/3\", yields a result that matches one of the options almost perfectly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nAnswering this question requires combining principles from special relativity and the exponential law of particle decay. Here's a systematic breakdown of the problem.\n\n### 1. Identify the Goal and Key Information\n*   **Goal**: Find the minimum detector resolution ($d_{res}$) required to observe at least 30% of particle decays.\n*   **Observing a decay**: This means the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution before it decays.\n*   **Given values**:\n    *   Total Energy, $E = 27$ GeV\n    *   Rest Mass, $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n    *   Proper Lifetime, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    *   Observation Probability, $P_{obs} \\ge 0.30$\n\n### 2. Formulate the Physics Equations\n*   **Exponential Decay Law**: The probability of a particle surviving to travel a distance $x$ or greater is given by $P(x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda$ is the *mean decay length* in the laboratory frame.\n*   **Observation Condition**: To observe at least 30% of decays, we set the condition for the minimum resolution $d_{res}$:\n    $P(x > d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n    Solving for $d_{res}$:\n    $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\n*   **Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**: The average distance traveled in the lab is not simply $c \\cdot \\tau_0$. We must account for relativistic effects. A precise way to calculate $\\lambda$ is using the particle's lab-frame momentum ($p$) and its rest mass ($m_0$).\n    $\\lambda = \\frac{p}{m_0} \\tau_0 = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$\n*   **Momentum ($pc$)**: We find the momentum using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}$\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Calculation\n**Step 1: Calculate the particle's momentum ($pc$).**\n$pc = \\sqrt{(27 \\text{ GeV})^2 - (3.41 \\text{ GeV})^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$).**\nUsing $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s:\n$\\lambda = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n$\\lambda \\approx 7.854 \\cdot (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the required resolution ($d_{res}$).**\nThe precise code output confirms the following:\n*   Using a literal 30% probability:\n    $d_{res} = \\lambda \\cdot (-\\ln(0.30)) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n*   Using a 1/3 probability (a common interpretation in physics problems for rounded values like 30%):\n    $d_{res} = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3) \\approx 2.07 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### 4. Compare with Options and Final Conclusion\nLet's compare these calculated values with the given options:\n*   A) 2.08*1e-9 m\n*   B) 2.08*1e-1 m\n*   C) 2.08*1e-6 m\n*   D) 2.08*1e-3 m\n\nThe calculated value from the \"1/3 probability\" hypothesis, $2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is an excellent match for option C, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The difference is less than 0.5%. While the literal 30% calculation also points to C as the closest option, the much smaller discrepancy from the \"1/3\" hypothesis makes it the most likely intended solution path for this multiple-choice question.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nAn updated step-by-step analysis incorporating the code execution output.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruction of the Physics Problem\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum spatial resolution of a detector (`d_res`) needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of a highly energetic $X^0$ particle.\n\n*   **Particle Properties**:\n    *   Rest mass energy: $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n    *   Proper lifetime: $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   **Kinematics**:\n    *   Total energy in the lab frame: $E = 27$ GeV\n*   **Observation Condition**:\n    *   To \"observe\" a decay, the neutral particle must travel a distance `x` greater than the detector's resolution (`d_res`) before decaying, leaving a distinguishable track from the creation point.\n    *   The problem requires that this happens for at least 30% of the particles, which means the probability $P(x > d_{res})$ must be equal to 0.30 for the *minimum* required resolution.\n\n### Step 2: Applying the Relevant Physical Principles\n\n1.  **Exponential Decay Law**: The decay of unstable particles over a distance `x` is governed by the probability survival function:\n    $P(x > d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}$\n    Here, $\\lambda$ is the particle's **mean decay length** in the laboratory frame. Setting the probability to 0.30 and solving for `d_res` gives:\n    $-d_{res}/\\lambda = \\ln(0.30)$\n    $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\n2.  **Special Relativity**: Because the particle's total energy (27 GeV) is much greater than its rest energy (3.41 GeV), it is highly relativistic. The mean decay length in the lab frame must be calculated accordingly. The most accurate formula uses the particle's lab-frame momentum (`p`):\n    $\\lambda = \\frac{p}{m_0} \\tau_0 = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$\n    The momentum-energy (`pc`) is found using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n\n### Step 3: Calculation and Code Verification\n\nThe Python code was designed to perform these calculations precisely.\n1.  It first calculated the particle's momentum-energy (`pc`).\n2.  It used this to find the mean decay length ($\\lambda$).\n3.  Finally, it computed the required resolution (`d_res`) under two assumptions.\n\nThe executed code provided the following results:\n*   `Calculated resolution (using 30%): 2.2680e-06 m`\n*   `Calculated resolution (using 1/3): 2.0695e-06 m`\n\n### Step 4: Analysis and Final Decision\n\n1.  **Direct Calculation**: The calculation based on a literal interpretation of \"30%\" gives a required resolution of $d_{res} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n2.  **Hypothesis-based Calculation**: The calculation based on the hypothesis that \"30%\" was a rounded approximation for the fraction $1/3$ gives a resolution of $d_{res} \\approx 2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n3.  **Comparison with Options**: The provided multiple-choice options are:\n    A) 2.08*1e-6 m\n    B) 2.08*1e-3 m\n    C) 2.08*1e-1 m\n    D) 2.08*1e-9 m\n\n    *   Only option A, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, has the correct order of magnitude. All other options are off by factors of thousands.\n    *   The result from the hypothesis-based calculation ($2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is an exceptionally close match to option A, with a difference of less than 0.5%.\n    *   The result from the direct calculation ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is also closest to option A, but with a more significant discrepancy of about 9%.\n\n**Conclusion**: The strong agreement between the calculated value using the $1/3$ assumption ($2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) and the value in option A ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) makes it clear that this was the intended path to the solution. This is a common feature in physics test design. Therefore, the correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem requires us to determine the minimum detector resolution needed to observe the decay of a relativistic particle for at least 30% of its decay events. Here is a comprehensive step-by-step analysis.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Physics Condition**\n- An \"observed\" decay means the particle $X^0$ must travel a distance, $d$, that is greater than the detector's spatial resolution ($d_{res}$) before it decays.\n- The decay of unstable particles is a probabilistic process that follows an exponential decay law. The probability that a particle travels a distance greater than $d_{res}$ is given by the survival function:\n  $$P(d > d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}$$\n  where $\\lambda$ is the particle's mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n- The problem states we need to observe \"at least 30%\" of the decays. To find the minimum resolution, we solve for the boundary condition:\n  $$e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$$\n- Solving for $d_{res}$ by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n  $$-\\frac{d_{res}}{\\lambda} = \\ln(0.30)$$\n  $$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$$\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying. Since the particle is highly relativistic (Total Energy $E=27$ GeV >> Rest Mass Energy $m_0c^2=3.41$ GeV), we must use relativistic kinematics.\n\n- **First, calculate the particle's momentum.** Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$:\n  $$pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}$$\n  $$pc = \\sqrt{(27 \\text{ GeV})^2 - (3.41 \\text{ GeV})^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$$\n- **Next, calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$).** The formula is:\n  $$\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$$\n  where $c\\tau_0$ is the mean decay distance in the particle's rest frame.\n  Given $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s and $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s:\n  $$\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$$\n  $$\\lambda \\approx (7.854) \\cdot (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$$\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Required Resolution ($d_{res}$)**\nNow, we substitute the value of $\\lambda$ back into the equation from Step 1.\nUsing $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$:\n$$d_{res} = -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$$\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Result and Options**\n- The calculated resolution is **$2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**.\n- The given options are:\n    A) 2.08*1e-6 m\n    B) 2.08*1e-9 m\n    C) 2.08*1e-3 m\n    D) 2.08*1e-1 m\n- Comparing our result to the options, the only one with the correct order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$) is A. Our calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is numerically close to option A ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m), with a difference of about 9%.\n\n### **Careful Point: A Common Test Design Strategy**\nIn multiple-choice physics problems, round percentages like \"30%\" are often used as approximations for simpler, more fundamental fractions. Let's test the hypothesis that the problem was designed with a survival probability of **1/3** (~33.3%) instead of exactly 30%.\n\n- If the condition is $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$, then:\n  $$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(1/3) = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$$\n- Using our calculated $\\lambda \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m and $\\ln(3) \\approx 1.0986$:\n  $$d_{res} = (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986) \\approx 2.07 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$$\n\nThis result, **$2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, is an excellent match for option A ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m), with a difference of less than 1%.

Understanding the Physical Condition\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum detector resolution ($d_{res}$) needed to \"observe\" at least 30% of the particle decays. A decay is considered \"observed\" if the neutral particle $X^0$ travels a distance from its creation point that is greater than the detector's resolution. This allows the creation vertex and decay vertex to be distinguished.\n\nThis condition can be expressed using the exponential decay law, which gives the probability that a particle with a mean decay length $\\lambda$ will travel a distance $x$ or greater before decaying:\n$$P(x \\ge d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}$$\n\nThe problem states this probability must be at least 30%. To find the *minimum* resolution, we solve for the boundary condition:\n$$e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$$\nBy taking the natural logarithm of both sides and rearranging, we get:\n$$-d_{res}/\\lambda = \\ln(0.30)$$\n$$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$$\n\n### 2. Calculating the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)\n\nThe particle is highly relativistic, as its total energy ($E = 27$ GeV) is much larger than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV). Therefore, its lifetime and travel distance are significantly affected by time dilation. The mean decay length in the laboratory frame ($\\lambda$) can be precisely calculated using the particle's momentum ($p$).\n\n**Step A: Calculate the particle's momentum.**\nWe use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\nSolving for the momentum-energy term, $pc$:\n$$pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}$$\n$$pc = \\sqrt{(27 \\text{ GeV})^2 - (3.41 \\text{ GeV})^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$$\n\n**Step B: Calculate the mean decay length.**\nThe formula for the mean decay length is $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$, where $\\tau_0$ is the proper lifetime.\n$$ \\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (2.998 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$$\n$$ \\lambda \\approx 7.853 \\cdot (2.3984 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$$\n\n### 3. Calculating the Final Resolution ($d_{res}$)\n\nNow, we substitute the calculated mean decay length $\\lambda$ into our equation from Step 1.\n$$d_{res} = -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$$\nSince $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$:\n$$d_{res} \\approx -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$$\n\n### 4.

Our calculated value is numerically close to option C, with a difference of about 9%.\n\n**Careful point on interpretation:** Several of the candidate answers correctly point out a common feature of multiple-choice physics questions. A round number like \"30%\" is often an approximation for a simpler fraction, in this case, likely $1/3$ (~33.3%).

Both calculation paths firmly establish that C is the only plausible option.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the candidate answers and identifying the most accurate path to the solution.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Physics Problem\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum spatial resolution ($d_{res}$) a detector must have to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of a high-energy particle ($X^0$).\n\n*   **Definition of \"Observe\"**: A decay is considered \"observed\" if the particle travels a distance greater than the detector's resolution ($d_{res}$) before it decays. This ensures the creation and decay points are distinguishable.\n*   **Physical Principle**: The decay of unstable particles is a statistical process that follows an exponential decay law. The probability, `P`, that a particle will travel a distance `x` or more before decaying is given by:\n    $P(x > d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}$\n    where $\\lambda$ is the particle's mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n*   **The Condition**: We need to find the resolution $d_{res}$ that satisfies the boundary condition for observing 30% of the decays:\n    $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n\n### 2. Required Calculation Steps\n\nTo solve for $d_{res}$, we must first calculate the mean decay length $\\lambda$ in the laboratory frame. This requires using the principles of special relativity, as the particle's total energy (27 GeV) is much larger than its rest mass energy (3.41 GeV).\n\n**Step A: Calculate the particle's momentum ($pc$)**\nThe relativistic energy-momentum relation is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n*   $E = 27$ GeV\n*   $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\nSolving for $pc$:\n$pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**Step B: Calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$)**\nThe mean decay length in the lab frame is dilated from the proper lifetime $\\tau_0$ due to relativistic effects. It is most accurately calculated using the formula:\n$\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$\n*   $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n$\\lambda = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**Step C: Solve for the minimum resolution ($d_{res}$)**\nFrom the condition derived in section 1, we solve for $d_{res}$:\n$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n$d_{res} \\approx -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### 3.

It is the only option with the correct order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$ m).\n\nAs many candidate answers insightfully noted, the ~9% difference between the calculated value and the option value can be explained. In physics test problems, round percentages like \"30%\" are often used as an approximation for a simpler fraction like **1/3** (~33.3%). Let's test this hypothesis:\n*   The condition becomes: $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$\n*   Solving for $d_{res}$: $d_{res} = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$\n*   $d_{res} = (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986) \\approx \\bf{2.070 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}}$\n\nThis result is an extremely close match to option D ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m), with a difference of less than 0.5%. This provides very strong evidence that D is the intended answer. The slight remaining difference is negligible and likely due to rounding of the input values in the problem statement itself.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe physics, the calculations, and the interpretation all consistently point to a single answer. The correct numerical value is approximately $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. According to the list of options in the problem statement, this corresponds to choice D. The confusion among candidate answers about the final letter (A, B, C, or D) stemmed from using different and inconsistent option labeling, but the consensus on the numerical result is clear and robust.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the reasoning from the candidate answers and identifying all careful points.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem and Physical Principles\n\nThe question asks for the minimum detector resolution ($d_{res}$) required to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of a particle $X^0$. This involves two key physics principles:\n\n*   **Special Relativity:** The particle's total energy ($E = 27$ GeV) is significantly larger than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV), so its motion and lifetime must be described using special relativity.\n*   **Exponential Decay Law:** The decay of unstable particles is a random process.

The correct numerical value is approximately $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, which corresponds to option D in the provided list.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nAnswering this question requires a step-by-step application of principles from special relativity and particle decay statistics. Based on the consistent methodology presented by the candidate answers, the following consolidated approach represents the most accurate way to solve the problem.\n\n### Analysis of the Problem and Solution Steps\n\n**1. Define the \"Observation Condition\"**\n\nThe question asks for the minimum detector resolution ($d_{res}$) needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. In this context, a decay is \"observed\" if the neutral particle $X^0$ travels a distance greater than the detector's resolution before it decays. This is because the detector can only resolve two separate points (the creation point and the decay point) if they are separated by a distance greater than its resolution.\n\nThis physical requirement translates into a probability statement. The decay of unstable particles is a statistical process that follows an exponential decay law. The probability $P$ that a particle will travel a distance greater than $d_{res}$ before decaying is:\n$$P(x > d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length of the particle in the laboratory's frame of reference.\n\nThe problem requires that this probability be at least 30% (0.30). To find the minimum resolution, we solve for the boundary case:\n$$e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$$\nSolving for $d_{res}$ by taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:\n$$-d_{res}/\\lambda = \\ln(0.30)$$\n$$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$$\n\n**2. Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**\n\nThe mean decay length must be calculated in the laboratory frame, where the particle has a total energy of 27 GeV. This requires using special relativity. The most direct method is to relate the decay length to the particle's momentum.\n\n*   **First, calculate the particle's relativistic momentum ($pc$):**\n    We use the energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    *   Total energy, $E = 27$ GeV\n    *   Rest mass energy, $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n    \n    $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\text{ GeV}^2$\n    $$pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$$\n\n*   **Next, calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$):**\n    The formula for the lab-frame mean decay length is $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$.\n    *   Proper lifetime, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    *   Speed of light, $c \\approx 2.998 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n    \n    $$\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (2.998 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$$\n    $$\\lambda \\approx (7.854) \\cdot (2.398 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$$\n\n**3. Calculate the Final Resolution ($d_{res}$)**\n\nNow, substitute the value of $\\lambda$ into the equation from Step 1.\n\n$$d_{res} = -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\ln(0.30) \\approx -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204)$$\n$$d_{res} \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$$\n\n**4. Analyze the Result and Select the Correct Option (A Careful Point)**\n\nThe calculated value, $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is numerically closest to option **A) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**. All other options are off by several orders of magnitude, making them physically implausible.\n\nHowever, there is a discrepancy of about 9% between the calculated value and the value in option A. As noted by a majority of the more insightful candidate answers, in multiple-choice physics problems, round percentages like \"30%\" are often used as an approximation for a more fundamental fraction. Let's test the hypothesis that the intended probability was actually **1/3** ($\\approx 33.3\\%$).\n\n*   The condition becomes: $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$.\n*   Solving for $d_{res}$: $d_{res} = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$.\n*   Using our calculated $\\lambda$ and $\\ln(3) \\approx 1.0986$:\n    $$d_{res} \\approx (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986) \\approx 2.070 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$$\n\nThis result, **$2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, is an excellent match for option A ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m), with a difference of less than 0.5%. This provides strong evidence that this was the intended method for solving the problem and that \"at least 30%\" was intended to be interpreted as \"for a fraction of 1/3 of particles\".\n\nBoth lines of reasoning—the direct calculation pointing to the correct order of magnitude and numerical vicinity, and the refined calculation providing an almost exact match—conclusively identify option A as the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n**Analysis of the Physics and Calculations**\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum detector resolution ($d_{res}$) required to observe at least 30% of the decays of a highly relativistic particle, $X^0$. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution, incorporating the analysis from the candidate answers.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Observation Condition**\n*   To \"observe\" a decay means the neutral particle $X^0$ travels a distance greater than the detector's resolution ($d_{res}$) before it decays, leaving a distinguishable decay vertex.\n*   The decay of unstable particles is a random process governed by an exponential decay law. The probability `P` that a particle travels a distance `x` or more before decaying is:\n    $P(\\text{distance} \\ge x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$\n    where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n*   The condition is that at least 30% of the decays must be observed. To find the minimum resolution, we set the probability to the boundary value of 30% (or 0.3):\n    $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n*   Solving for the resolution, we get:\n    $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$**)**\nThe particle is highly relativistic (Total Energy 27 GeV >> Rest Mass Energy 3.41 GeV), so we must use relativistic kinematics.\n\n*   **Calculate the particle's momentum-energy ($pc$)**: The most accurate method uses the energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    *   $E = 27$ GeV\n    *   $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n    *   $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n*   **Calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$)**: The formula is $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c \\cdot \\tau_0$.\n    *   $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    *   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n    *   $\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Required Resolution ($d_{res}$**)**\nUsing the formula from Step 1 and the value of $\\lambda$ from Step 2:\n*   $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n*   $d_{res} = -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**Careful Points and Final Decision**\n\n1.  **Direct Comparison**: The calculated value based on the literal interpretation of \"30%\" is $d_{res} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Comparing this with the provided options:\n    *   A) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n    *   B) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\n    *   C) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\n    *   D) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\n\n    The only option with the correct order of magnitude is A. Our calculated value is numerically closest to A.\n\n2.  **The \"1/3\" Hypothesis**: Several candidate answers correctly point out a common feature in physics test questions. A rounded percentage like \"30%\" often represents a simpler fraction. In this case, 1/3 is a very likely candidate ($\\approx 33.3\\%$). Let's test this hypothesis.\n    *   The condition becomes $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$.\n    *   Solving gives $d_{res} = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$.\n    *   $d_{res} = (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\ln(3) \\approx (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986) \\approx 2.070 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$.\n\n    This result, $2.070 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is an extremely close match to option A, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m (less than 0.5% difference). This strongly confirms that this was the intended interpretation for designing the question's options.\n\nBoth lines of reasoning—direct calculation and the more refined \"1/3\" hypothesis—conclusively point to A as the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the reasoning and careful points identified from the candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal and the Physics\n\nThe objective is to find the minimum spatial resolution of a detector ($d_{res}$) that can \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of the $X^0$ particle.\n\n*   **Definition of Observation:** A neutral particle like $X^0$ doesn't leave a track. Its decay is \"observed\" when its charged decay products ($Y^+$, $Z^-$) appear at a point measurably distant from the creation point of the $X^0$. This means the $X^0$ must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution ($d_{res}$) before it decays.\n\n*   **Key Physical Principles:**\n    1.  **Special Relativity:** The particle's total energy (E = 27 GeV) is much larger than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$ = 3.41 GeV), indicating it is highly relativistic. We must use relativistic equations for energy, momentum, and time dilation.\n    2.  **Exponential Decay Law:** The decay of unstable particles is a probabilistic process. The probability `P` that a particle will travel a distance `x` or more before decaying is given by the formula $P(L \\ge x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda$ is the particle's mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Mathematical Condition\n\nBased on the physics above, we can set up the equation. We need to find the resolution $d_{res}$ where the probability of traveling a greater distance is 0.30 (or 30%).\n\n$P(L > d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n\nSolving this equation for $d_{res}$ by taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:\n\n$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)\n\nTo find $d_{res}$, we first need to calculate $\\lambda$. The mean decay length in the lab frame is the average distance the particle travels, and it is most accurately calculated using the particle's momentum.\n\n1.  **Calculate the particle's momentum ($pc$)** using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}$\n    $pc = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n2.  **Calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$)** using the formula $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$.\n    $\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (2.998 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    $\\lambda \\approx (7.854) \\cdot (2.398 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Resolution and Analyze the Result\n\nNow we can calculate the final resolution, $d_{res}$.\n\n$d_{res} = -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\ln(0.30) \\approx -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204)$\n$d_{res} \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nLet's compare this calculated value of **$2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m** with the given options:\nA) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\nB) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\nC) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\nD) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\n\nOur result is clearly closest to option C, as it is the only one with the correct order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$ m). However, there is a ~9% difference between our calculated value and the value in the option.\n\n### Careful Point: Interpreting \"30%\"\n\nAs many of the provided candidate answers astutely noted, in physics multiple-choice questions, a round percentage like \"30%\" is often a convenient approximation for a simpler, more fundamental fraction. Let's test the hypothesis that the question intended a survival probability of **1/3** ($\\approx 33.3\\%$).\n\nUnder this hypothesis, the condition becomes:\n$e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$\n\nSolving for $d_{res}$:\n$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(1/3) = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$\n$d_{res} \\approx (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986) \\approx \\mathbf{2.070 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}}$\n\nThis result, **$2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, is an excellent match for option C, **$2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, with a difference of less than 0.5%.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, incorporating a synthesis of the candidate answers and identifying the crucial points for reaching the correct solution.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the Physics Problem**\n\nThe core task is to determine the minimum detector resolution ($d_{res}$) required to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of the particle $X^0$.\n\n*   **Observation Condition:** An \"observed\" decay means the neutral particle $X^0$ travels a distance from its creation point that is large enough for the detector to resolve it as a distinct event from the decay point. For this to happen, the particle must travel a distance `x` greater than the detector's resolution (`x > d_{res}`) before it decays.\n*   **Physics Principles:** The solution requires combining two key areas of physics:\n    1.  **Special Relativity:** Since the particle's total energy ($E=27$ GeV) is much greater than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2=3.41$ GeV), it is highly relativistic. We must use relativistic formulas to calculate its lifetime and travel distance in the lab frame.\n    2.  **Exponential Decay Law:** Particle decay is a random process. The probability that a particle with a mean decay length `λ` will travel a distance `x` or more before decaying is given by: $P(\\text{distance} \\ge x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identified the necessary calculation steps, which are summarized here.\n\n**Step A: Set up the equation for the resolution.**\nTo find the *minimum* resolution to observe *at least* 30% of decays, we solve for the boundary condition:\n$$e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$$\nBy taking the natural logarithm of both sides and rearranging, we get:\n$$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$$\n\n**Step B: Calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$) in the lab frame.**\nThe most precise way to find $\\lambda$ uses the particle's momentum ($p$), which is calculated from the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n\n1.  **Find the particle's momentum ($pc$)**:\n    *   $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719$ GeV²\n    *   $pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78$ GeV\n\n2.  **Calculate $\\lambda$**: The formula is $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$.\n    *   $\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    *   $\\lambda \\approx (7.854) \\cdot (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n**Step C: Calculate the minimum resolution ($d_{res}$)**\nNow we use the equation from Step A with our calculated value for $\\lambda$.\n*   $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n*   $d_{res} = -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n### **3. Analysis, Careful Points, and Final Decision**\n\n**Careful Point 1: Order of Magnitude Check.**\nOur calculated value is approximately $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Let's compare this to the options given in the question:\nA) 2.08\\*1e-1 m\nB) 2.08\\*1e-9 m\nC) 2.08\\*1e-3 m\nD) 2.08\\*1e-6 m\n\nThe only option with the correct order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$) is **D) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**. All other options are incorrect by many orders of magnitude. This alone makes D the only plausible answer.\n\n**Careful Point 2: The \"30% vs. 1/3\" Hypothesis.**\nThe calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) differs from the value in option D ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) by about 9%. As correctly identified by a majority of the candidate answers, a common practice in physics exam questions is to use a round percentage like \"30%\" as an approximation for a simpler, fundamental fraction. Let's test the hypothesis that the intended survival probability was **1/3** (~33.3%).\n*   The condition becomes $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$.\n*   Solving for $d_{res}$ gives: $d_{res} = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$.\n*   Using our calculated $\\lambda$ and $\\ln(3) \\approx 1.0986$:\n    $d_{res} = (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986) \\approx \\mathbf{2.070 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}}$.\n\nThis result, $2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is an excellent match for option D ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m), with a discrepancy of less than 0.5%. This strongly confirms that D is the intended answer.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Inconsistent Option Labeling.**\nIt is important to note that the candidate answers show significant confusion about which letter (A, B, C, or D) corresponds to the correct numerical value. However, the numerical result itself is consistent across all competent analyses. By referring strictly to the option list provided in the main question prompt, the correct choice is unambiguously identified.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe physics and calculation steps are consistent across all credible analyses. Both a direct calculation and a more refined interpretation (using 1/3 instead of 30%) point conclusively to the numerical value $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"

Goal Identification and Physics Principles\n\nThe main goal is to calculate the minimum detector resolution (`d_res`) needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of a relativistic particle, $X^0$.\n\n*   **Observation Condition**: An individual decay is considered \"observed\" if the particle travels a distance greater than the detector's resolution (`d > d_res`).\n*   **Decay Law**: The decay of particles is a probabilistic process governed by an exponential law. The probability that a particle with a mean decay length `λ` travels a distance `x` or more is:\n    $P(d > x) = e^{-x/λ}$\n*   **Mathematical Formulation**: To observe at least 30% of decays, we must find the resolution `d_res` that satisfies the boundary condition:\n    $e^{-d_{res}/λ} = 0.30$\n    Solving for `d_res` gives:\n    $d_{res} = -λ \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n*   **Relativity**: Since the particle is highly energetic ($E=27$ GeV) compared to its rest mass ($m_0c^2=3.41$ GeV), we must use special relativity to find its mean decay length `λ` in the laboratory frame.\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**Step A: Calculate the particle's momentum (`pc`)**\nThe relativistic energy-momentum relation is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n$pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719}$\n$pc \\approx 26.78$ GeV\n\n**Step B: Calculate the mean decay length in the lab frame (λ)**\nThe formula for the mean decay length is $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$.\n*   Given: $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   Using the speed of light, $c \\approx 2.998 \\times 10^8$ m/s:\n    $\\lambda = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\times (2.998 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    $\\lambda \\approx (7.854) \\times (2.398 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**Step C: Calculate the minimum resolution (`d_res`)**\nUsing the equation from Step 1:\n$d_{res} = -λ \\cdot \\ln(0.30) \\approx -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (-1.204)$\n$d_{res} \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### 3. Comparison with Options and Careful Points\n\nThe calculated result, using a direct interpretation of \"30%\", is **$2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**. Let's examine the options provided in the question:\nA) 2.08\\*1e-9 m\nB) 2.08\\*1e-6 m\nC) 2.08\\*1e-3 m\nD) 2.08\\*1e-1 m\n\nOur calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is numerically closest to option **B) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**. All other options are off by several orders of magnitude.\n\n**Careful Point 1: The \"1/3\" Hypothesis**\nMany of the candidate answers astutely observe that in physics problems, a round number like \"30%\" is often a rounded approximation of a simpler fraction like **1/3**. Let's test this hypothesis:\n*   The condition becomes: $e^{-d_{res}/λ} = 1/3$\n*   This yields: $d_{res} = -λ \\cdot \\ln(1/3) = λ \\cdot \\ln(3)$\n*   Recalculating with this condition:\n    $d_{res} = (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (1.0986) \\approx 2.070 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\nThis result, **$2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, is an almost perfect match for option **B) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m** (less than a 0.5% difference). This strongly suggests that this was the intended path to the solution.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Inconsistency in Candidate Answers**\nWhile most candidate answers perform the calculation correctly, they show a major inconsistency in assigning letters to the multiple-choice options. They correctly derive the numerical value but then label it with an incorrect letter (A, C, D, etc.). However, based on the options listed in the original problem description, the value **$2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m** corresponds to option **B**.\n\nBoth lines of reasoning—the direct calculation and the more precise \"1/3\" hypothesis—unequivocally point to the numerical value $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m as the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the candidate answers.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physical Question\nThe core task is to determine the minimum spatial resolution ($d_{res}$) of a detector required to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of the particle $X^0$.\n\nAn \"observed\" decay implies that the neutral particle $X^0$ travels a distance from its creation point that is large enough for the detector to resolve it as a distinct event from the decay point. Therefore, the particle must travel a distance `x` greater than the resolution `d_res` before it decays.\n\n### 2. The Physics of Decay Probability\nThe decay of unstable particles is a random process governed by an exponential decay law. The probability that a particle will travel a distance greater than `d_res` before decaying is given by:\n\n$P(x > d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}$\n\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the particle's mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n\nThe problem states we need to observe \"at least 30% of the decays\". To find the minimum resolution, we set this probability to the boundary condition:\n\n$e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n\nSolving this equation for $d_{res}$ by taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:\n\n$-d_{res}/\\lambda = \\ln(0.30)$\n$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30) \\approx 1.204 \\cdot \\lambda$\n\n### 3. Calculating the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)\nSince the particle's total energy (27 GeV) is much larger than its rest mass energy (3.41 GeV), it is highly relativistic. We must use the principles of special relativity to find the mean decay length in the lab frame.\n\nA precise way to calculate $\\lambda$ uses the particle's momentum ($p$) and proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$):\n$\\lambda = \\frac{p}{m_0} \\tau_0 = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$\n\nWe first find the particle's momentum-energy ($pc$) using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n\n*   **Step 3a: Calculate Momentum ($pc$)**\n    $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}$\n    $pc = \\sqrt{(27 \\text{ GeV})^2 - (3.41 \\text{ GeV})^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n*   **Step 3b: Calculate Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**\n    Using $c \\approx 2.998 \\times 10^8$ m/s:\n    $\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (2.998 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    $\\lambda \\approx (7.854) \\cdot (2.398 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### 4. Final Calculation and Careful Analysis\n\nNow we can calculate the resolution $d_{res}$:\n\n*   **Calculation 1 (Literal Interpretation):**\n    Using the literal 30% condition:\n    $d_{res} = 1.204 \\cdot \\lambda \\approx 1.204 \\cdot (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n*   **Careful Point - The \"1/3\" Hypothesis:**\n    As pointed out by a majority of the candidate answers, in multiple-choice physics problems, a round number like \"30%\" is often a convenient approximation for a simpler, fundamental fraction. A very common one is $1/3 \\approx 33.3\\%$. Let's test this hypothesis.\n    The condition becomes $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$.\n    This leads to $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(1/3) = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$.\n\n*   **Calculation 2 (Refined Interpretation):**\n    $d_{res} = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3) \\approx (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986) \\approx 2.07 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nLet's compare our results with the given options:\nA) 2.08*1e-9 m\nB) 2.08*1e-3 m\nC) 2.08*1e-1 m\nD) 2.08*1e-6 m\n\nThe literal calculation gives $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, which is closest to option D. The refined calculation gives $2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, which is an almost perfect match for option D (less than 0.5% difference). This gives very strong evidence that the problem was designed with the $1/3$ survival probability in mind. Both interpretations robustly point to option D as the only plausible answer, as all other options differ by orders of magnitude.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\n**Analysis of the Problem and Candidate Answers**\n\nThe goal is to determine the minimum detector resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle $X^0$. A decay is considered \"observed\" if the particle travels a distance greater than the detector's resolution before decaying.\n\n**Step 1: Formulating the Physical Condition**\nThe decay of particles follows an exponential law.

Deconstruct the Physics Problem**\nThe question asks for the minimum detector resolution ($d_{res}$) required to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of the particle $X^0$.\n\n*   **Observation Condition:** The particle $X^0$ is neutral and leaves no track. It decays into charged particles $Y^+$ and $Z^-$, which do leave tracks. An \"observed\" decay means the neutral particle must travel a distance from its creation point that is large enough to be resolved from the decay point. This distance must be greater than the detector's resolution, $d_{res}$.\n*   **Probability Law:** Particle decay is a random process. The probability that a particle with a mean decay length $\\lambda$ travels a distance `x` or more before decaying is described by the exponential decay law:\n    $P(\\text{distance} \\ge x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$\n*   **Mathematical Condition:** To observe at least 30% of decays, we require $P(\\text{distance} \\ge d_{res}) \\ge 0.30$. To find the *minimum* required resolution, we solve for the boundary condition:\n    $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n\n**2.

An \"observed\" decay implies that the particle must travel a distance from its creation point that is greater than the detector's resolution before it decays.\n\n### **Step 1: Establishing the Physical Condition**\n\nThe decay of unstable particles is a statistical process that follows an exponential decay law. The probability, P, that a particle with a mean decay length $\\lambda$ travels a distance `x` or more before decaying is given by:\n\n$P(x \\ge d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}$\n\nThe problem requires that \"at least 30% of the decays\" are observed. To find the minimum resolution ($d_{res}$), we use the boundary condition:\n\n$e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n\nSolving for $d_{res}$ by taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:\n\n$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**\n\nThe particle's energy ($E = 27$ GeV) is significantly greater than its rest mass ($m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV), meaning it is highly relativistic. We must use relativistic kinematics to find its mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n\nThe most precise formula for the mean decay length relates it to the particle's lab-frame momentum ($p$) and its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$):\n\n$\\lambda = \\frac{p}{m_0}\\tau_0 = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$\n\nTo use this, we first calculate the momentum-energy ($pc$) from the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$:\n\n$(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (27 \\text{ GeV})^2 - (3.41 \\text{ GeV})^2$\n$pc = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nNow we can calculate the mean decay length $\\lambda$:\n\n$\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (c \\cdot \\tau_0) = \\left(\\frac{26.78}{3.41}\\right) \\cdot (2.998 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s} \\cdot 8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n$\\lambda \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Minimum Resolution ($d_{res}$)**\n\nUsing the formula from Step 1 with our calculated value for $\\lambda$:\n\n$d_{res} = -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\ln(0.30) \\approx -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204)$\n$d_{res} \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### **Careful Points and Final Decision**\n\n1.  **Direct Calculation vs. Options**: Our direct calculation yields a result of $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Comparing this to the options:\n    A) 2.08\\*1e-1 m\n    B) 2.08\\*1e-3 m\n    C) 2.08\\*1e-6 m\n    D) 2.08\\*1e-9 m\n    The calculated value is numerically closest to option **C) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**. The order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$) is a perfect match, while all other options are off by a factor of 1000 or more.\n\n2.  **The \"1/3 Hypothesis\"**: Many of the candidate answers correctly identified a common feature in physics test questions. The stated percentage \"30%\" is often a rounded value for a simpler fraction used to design the problem. A likely candidate here is $1/3$ (~33.3%). Let's test this hypothesis:\n    The condition becomes $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$.\n    This leads to $d_{res} = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$.\n    $d_{res} = (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\ln(3) \\approx (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986)$\n    $d_{res} \\approx 2.070 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n3.  **Conclusion**: This result, $2.070 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is an almost perfect match for option C, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m (less than a 0.5% difference). This provides extremely strong evidence that the problem was designed with the intention of observing at least $1/3$ of the decays, and \"30%\" was used as a convenient approximation in the problem statement.\n\nBoth the direct calculation and the more refined hypothesis point decisively to the same option.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating careful points derived from the candidate answers.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Physical Problem\nThe question asks for the minimum spatial resolution a detector needs to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of the particle X⁰.\n\n*   **What does \"observe a decay\" mean?** Since the initial particle X⁰ is neutral, it doesn't leave a track. Its charged decay products (Y⁺, Z⁻) do. An observation is possible only if the neutral particle travels a distance from its creation point that is large enough for the detector to resolve it as separate from the decay point. This distance must be greater than the detector's resolution, `d_res`.\n*   **The Probability Condition:** The problem requires observing \"at least 30%\" of decays. This translates into the probability condition that the distance traveled (`x`) must be greater than the resolution (`d_res`) for at least 30% of the particles. So, `P(x > d_res) ≥ 0.30`.\n\n### 2. Identifying the Key Physics Principles\nTo solve this, we need to combine two key areas of physics:\n*   **Special Relativity:** The particle's total energy (E = 27 GeV) is much greater than its rest mass energy (m₀c² = 3.41 GeV), which means it's traveling at a speed very close to the speed of light. Relativistic effects like time dilation are crucial.\n*   **Exponential Decay Law:** The decay of unstable particles is a random process. The probability that a particle survives to travel a distance `x` or more is described by the equation: `P(x) = e^(-x/λ)`, where `λ` is the particle's mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Calculation\n**Step A: Set up the equation for the resolution**\nTo find the minimum resolution, we solve for the boundary case of our probability condition:\n$e^{-d_{res}/λ} = 0.30$\nBy taking the natural logarithm of both sides and rearranging, we get:\n$d_{res} = -λ \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\n**Step B: Calculate the mean decay length (λ)**\nThe mean decay length in the lab frame (`λ`) is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. It is related to its proper lifetime (`τ₀`) but must be calculated using relativistic formulas. The most precise way uses the particle's momentum.\n1.  **Find the particle's momentum (`pc`)**: We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation, `E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²`.\n    *   `(pc)² = E² - (m₀c²)² = (27)² - (3.41)² = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719` GeV²\n    *   `pc = √717.3719 ≈ 26.78` GeV\n2.  **Calculate `λ`**: The formula is `λ = (pc / m₀c²) * cτ₀`.\n    *   `λ = (26.78 GeV / 3.41 GeV) * (2.998 x 10⁸ m/s) * (8 x 10⁻¹⁶ s)`\n    *   `λ ≈ 7.854 * (2.398 x 10⁻⁷ m) ≈ 1.884 x 10⁻⁶` m\n\n**Step C: Calculate the minimum resolution (`d_res`)**\nNow we use the equation from Step A with our calculated value for `λ`.\n*   `ln(0.30) ≈ -1.204`\n*   `d_res = -(1.884 x 10⁻⁶ m) * (-1.204) ≈ 2.268 x 10⁻⁶` m\n\n### 4. Analysis and Careful Points\n*   Our calculated value is **~2.27 x 10⁻⁶ m**.\n*   The options are:\n    A) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n    B) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\n    C) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n    D) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\n*   Our calculated result has the correct order of magnitude (`10⁻⁶ m`) only for option A. All other options are off by factors of 1000 or more.\n*   **Crucial Point of Interpretation:** The calculated value `2.27 x 10⁻⁶ m` differs from option A (`2.08 x 10⁻⁶ m`) by about 9%. As noted by many of the more thorough candidate answers, it is a very common practice in physics exam questions for a round percentage like \"30%\" to be an approximation of a simpler fraction. Let's test the hypothesis that the intended probability was **1/3** (~33.3%).\n    *   If `P(x > d_res) = 1/3`, then `e^(-d_res/λ) = 1/3`.\n    *   Solving for `d_res` gives: `d_res = λ * ln(3)`.\n    *   `d_res = (1.884 x 10⁻⁶ m) * (1.0986) ≈ 2.070 x 10⁻⁶` m.\n\nThis result, **`2.07 x 10⁻⁶ m`**, is an extremely close match to option A, **`2.08 x 10⁻⁶ m`**. The discrepancy is less than 0.5%. This strongly suggests that this interpretation was the intended method to reach the given answer.\n\n### Final Decision\nThe physics calculation consistently points to a resolution on the order of `10⁻⁶` meters. The more refined interpretation, recognizing that \"30%\" is likely a proxy for \"1/3\", yields a result that matches one of the options almost perfectly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nAnswering this question requires combining principles from special relativity and the exponential law of particle decay. Here's a systematic breakdown of the problem.\n\n### 1. Identify the Goal and Key Information\n*   **Goal**: Find the minimum detector resolution ($d_{res}$) required to observe at least 30% of particle decays.\n*   **Observing a decay**: This means the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution before it decays.\n*   **Given values**:\n    *   Total Energy, $E = 27$ GeV\n    *   Rest Mass, $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n    *   Proper Lifetime, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    *   Observation Probability, $P_{obs} \\ge 0.30$\n\n### 2. Formulate the Physics Equations\n*   **Exponential Decay Law**: The probability of a particle surviving to travel a distance $x$ or greater is given by $P(x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda$ is the *mean decay length* in the laboratory frame.\n*   **Observation Condition**: To observe at least 30% of decays, we set the condition for the minimum resolution $d_{res}$:\n    $P(x > d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n    Solving for $d_{res}$:\n    $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\n*   **Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**: The average distance traveled in the lab is not simply $c \\cdot \\tau_0$. We must account for relativistic effects. A precise way to calculate $\\lambda$ is using the particle's lab-frame momentum ($p$) and its rest mass ($m_0$).\n    $\\lambda = \\frac{p}{m_0} \\tau_0 = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$\n*   **Momentum ($pc$)**: We find the momentum using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}$\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Calculation\n**Step 1: Calculate the particle's momentum ($pc$).**\n$pc = \\sqrt{(27 \\text{ GeV})^2 - (3.41 \\text{ GeV})^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$).**\nUsing $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s:\n$\\lambda = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n$\\lambda \\approx 7.854 \\cdot (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the required resolution ($d_{res}$).**\nThe precise code output confirms the following:\n*   Using a literal 30% probability:\n    $d_{res} = \\lambda \\cdot (-\\ln(0.30)) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n*   Using a 1/3 probability (a common interpretation in physics problems for rounded values like 30%):\n    $d_{res} = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3) \\approx 2.07 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### 4. Compare with Options and Final Conclusion\nLet's compare these calculated values with the given options:\n*   A) 2.08*1e-9 m\n*   B) 2.08*1e-1 m\n*   C) 2.08*1e-6 m\n*   D) 2.08*1e-3 m\n\nThe calculated value from the \"1/3 probability\" hypothesis, $2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is an excellent match for option C, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The difference is less than 0.5%. While the literal 30% calculation also points to C as the closest option, the much smaller discrepancy from the \"1/3\" hypothesis makes it the most likely intended solution path for this multiple-choice question.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nAn updated step-by-step analysis incorporating the code execution output.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruction of the Physics Problem\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum spatial resolution of a detector (`d_res`) needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of a highly energetic $X^0$ particle.\n\n*   **Particle Properties**:\n    *   Rest mass energy: $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n    *   Proper lifetime: $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   **Kinematics**:\n    *   Total energy in the lab frame: $E = 27$ GeV\n*   **Observation Condition**:\n    *   To \"observe\" a decay, the neutral particle must travel a distance `x` greater than the detector's resolution (`d_res`) before decaying, leaving a distinguishable track from the creation point.\n    *   The problem requires that this happens for at least 30% of the particles, which means the probability $P(x > d_{res})$ must be equal to 0.30 for the *minimum* required resolution.\n\n### Step 2: Applying the Relevant Physical Principles\n\n1.  **Exponential Decay Law**: The decay of unstable particles over a distance `x` is governed by the probability survival function:\n    $P(x > d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}$\n    Here, $\\lambda$ is the particle's **mean decay length** in the laboratory frame. Setting the probability to 0.30 and solving for `d_res` gives:\n    $-d_{res}/\\lambda = \\ln(0.30)$\n    $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\n2.  **Special Relativity**: Because the particle's total energy (27 GeV) is much greater than its rest energy (3.41 GeV), it is highly relativistic. The mean decay length in the lab frame must be calculated accordingly. The most accurate formula uses the particle's lab-frame momentum (`p`):\n    $\\lambda = \\frac{p}{m_0} \\tau_0 = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$\n    The momentum-energy (`pc`) is found using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n\n### Step 3: Calculation and Code Verification\n\nThe Python code was designed to perform these calculations precisely.\n1.  It first calculated the particle's momentum-energy (`pc`).\n2.  It used this to find the mean decay length ($\\lambda$).\n3.  Finally, it computed the required resolution (`d_res`) under two assumptions.\n\nThe executed code provided the following results:\n*   `Calculated resolution (using 30%): 2.2680e-06 m`\n*   `Calculated resolution (using 1/3): 2.0695e-06 m`\n\n### Step 4: Analysis and Final Decision\n\n1.  **Direct Calculation**: The calculation based on a literal interpretation of \"30%\" gives a required resolution of $d_{res} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n2.  **Hypothesis-based Calculation**: The calculation based on the hypothesis that \"30%\" was a rounded approximation for the fraction $1/3$ gives a resolution of $d_{res} \\approx 2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n3.  **Comparison with Options**: The provided multiple-choice options are:\n    A) 2.08*1e-6 m\n    B) 2.08*1e-3 m\n    C) 2.08*1e-1 m\n    D) 2.08*1e-9 m\n\n    *   Only option A, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, has the correct order of magnitude. All other options are off by factors of thousands.\n    *   The result from the hypothesis-based calculation ($2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is an exceptionally close match to option A, with a difference of less than 0.5%.\n    *   The result from the direct calculation ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is also closest to option A, but with a more significant discrepancy of about 9%.\n\n**Conclusion**: The strong agreement between the calculated value using the $1/3$ assumption ($2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) and the value in option A ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) makes it clear that this was the intended path to the solution. This is a common feature in physics test design. Therefore, the correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem requires us to determine the minimum detector resolution needed to observe the decay of a relativistic particle for at least 30% of its decay events. Here is a comprehensive step-by-step analysis.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Physics Condition**\n- An \"observed\" decay means the particle $X^0$ must travel a distance, $d$, that is greater than the detector's spatial resolution ($d_{res}$) before it decays.\n- The decay of unstable particles is a probabilistic process that follows an exponential decay law. The probability that a particle travels a distance greater than $d_{res}$ is given by the survival function:\n  $$P(d > d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}$$\n  where $\\lambda$ is the particle's mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n- The problem states we need to observe \"at least 30%\" of the decays. To find the minimum resolution, we solve for the boundary condition:\n  $$e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$$\n- Solving for $d_{res}$ by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n  $$-\\frac{d_{res}}{\\lambda} = \\ln(0.30)$$\n  $$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$$\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying. Since the particle is highly relativistic (Total Energy $E=27$ GeV >> Rest Mass Energy $m_0c^2=3.41$ GeV), we must use relativistic kinematics.\n\n- **First, calculate the particle's momentum.** Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$:\n  $$pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}$$\n  $$pc = \\sqrt{(27 \\text{ GeV})^2 - (3.41 \\text{ GeV})^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$$\n- **Next, calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$).** The formula is:\n  $$\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$$\n  where $c\\tau_0$ is the mean decay distance in the particle's rest frame.\n  Given $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s and $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s:\n  $$\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$$\n  $$\\lambda \\approx (7.854) \\cdot (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$$\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Required Resolution ($d_{res}$)**\nNow, we substitute the value of $\\lambda$ back into the equation from Step 1.\nUsing $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$:\n$$d_{res} = -(1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$$\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Result and Options**\n- The calculated resolution is **$2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**.\n- The given options are:\n    A) 2.08*1e-6 m\n    B) 2.08*1e-9 m\n    C) 2.08*1e-3 m\n    D) 2.08*1e-1 m\n- Comparing our result to the options, the only one with the correct order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$) is A. Our calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is numerically close to option A ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m), with a difference of about 9%.\n\n### **Careful Point: A Common Test Design Strategy**\nIn multiple-choice physics problems, round percentages like \"30%\" are often used as approximations for simpler, more fundamental fractions. Let's test the hypothesis that the problem was designed with a survival probability of **1/3** (~33.3%) instead of exactly 30%.\n\n- If the condition is $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$, then:\n  $$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(1/3) = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$$\n- Using our calculated $\\lambda \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m and $\\ln(3) \\approx 1.0986$:\n  $$d_{res} = (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986) \\approx 2.07 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$$\n\nThis result, **$2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, is an excellent match for option A ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m), with a difference of less than 1%.

Understanding the Physical Condition\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum detector resolution ($d_{res}$) needed to \"observe\" at least 30% of the particle decays. A decay is considered \"observed\" if the neutral particle $X^0$ travels a distance from its creation point that is greater than the detector's resolution. This allows the creation vertex and decay vertex to be distinguished.\n\nThis condition can be expressed using the exponential decay law, which gives the probability that a particle with a mean decay length $\\lambda$ will travel a distance $x$ or greater before decaying:\n$$P(x \\ge d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}$$\n\nThe problem states this probability must be at least 30%. To find the *minimum* resolution, we solve for the boundary condition:\n$$e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$$\nBy taking the natural logarithm of both sides and rearranging, we get:\n$$-d_{res}/\\lambda = \\ln(0.30)$$\n$$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$$\n\n### 2. Calculating the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)\n\nThe particle is highly relativistic, as its total energy ($E = 27$ GeV) is much larger than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV). Therefore, its lifetime and travel distance are significantly affected by time dilation. The mean decay length in the laboratory frame ($\\lambda$) can be precisely calculated using the particle's momentum ($p$).\n\n**Step A: Calculate the particle's momentum.**\nWe use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\nSolving for the momentum-energy term, $pc$:\n$$pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}$$\n$$pc = \\sqrt{(27 \\text{ GeV})^2 - (3.41 \\text{ GeV})^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$$\n\n**Step B: Calculate the mean decay length.**\nThe formula for the mean decay length is $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$, where $\\tau_0$ is the proper lifetime.\n$$ \\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (2.998 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$$\n$$ \\lambda \\approx 7.853 \\cdot (2.3984 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$$\n\n### 3. Calculating the Final Resolution ($d_{res}$)\n\nNow, we substitute the calculated mean decay length $\\lambda$ into our equation from Step 1.\n$$d_{res} = -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$$\nSince $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$:\n$$d_{res} \\approx -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$$\n\n### 4.

Our calculated value is numerically close to option C, with a difference of about 9%.\n\n**Careful point on interpretation:** Several of the candidate answers correctly point out a common feature of multiple-choice physics questions. A round number like \"30%\" is often an approximation for a simpler fraction, in this case, likely $1/3$ (~33.3%).

This strongly supports the conclusion that **C** is the intended answer. Both calculation paths firmly establish that C is the only plausible option.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the candidate answers and identifying the most accurate path to the solution.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Physics Problem\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum spatial resolution ($d_{res}$) a detector must have to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of a high-energy particle ($X^0$).\n\n*   **Definition of \"Observe\"**: A decay is considered \"observed\" if the particle travels a distance greater than the detector's resolution ($d_{res}$) before it decays. This ensures the creation and decay points are distinguishable.\n*   **Physical Principle**: The decay of unstable particles is a statistical process that follows an exponential decay law. The probability, `P`, that a particle will travel a distance `x` or more before decaying is given by:\n    $P(x > d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}$\n    where $\\lambda$ is the particle's mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n*   **The Condition**: We need to find the resolution $d_{res}$ that satisfies the boundary condition for observing 30% of the decays:\n    $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n\n### 2. Required Calculation Steps\n\nTo solve for $d_{res}$, we must first calculate the mean decay length $\\lambda$ in the laboratory frame. This requires using the principles of special relativity, as the particle's total energy (27 GeV) is much larger than its rest mass energy (3.41 GeV).\n\n**Step A: Calculate the particle's momentum ($pc$)**\nThe relativistic energy-momentum relation is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n*   $E = 27$ GeV\n*   $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\nSolving for $pc$:\n$pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**Step B: Calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$)**\nThe mean decay length in the lab frame is dilated from the proper lifetime $\\tau_0$ due to relativistic effects. It is most accurately calculated using the formula:\n$\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$\n*   $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n$\\lambda = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**Step C: Solve for the minimum resolution ($d_{res}$)**\nFrom the condition derived in section 1, we solve for $d_{res}$:\n$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n$d_{res} \\approx -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### 3.

It is the only option with the correct order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$ m).\n\nAs many candidate answers insightfully noted, the ~9% difference between the calculated value and the option value can be explained. In physics test problems, round percentages like \"30%\" are often used as an approximation for a simpler fraction like **1/3** (~33.3%). Let's test this hypothesis:\n*   The condition becomes: $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$\n*   Solving for $d_{res}$: $d_{res} = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$\n*   $d_{res} = (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986) \\approx \\bf{2.070 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}}$\n\nThis result is an extremely close match to option D ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m), with a difference of less than 0.5%. This provides very strong evidence that D is the intended answer. The slight remaining difference is negligible and likely due to rounding of the input values in the problem statement itself.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe physics, the calculations, and the interpretation all consistently point to a single answer. The correct numerical value is approximately $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. According to the list of options in the problem statement, this corresponds to choice D. The confusion among candidate answers about the final letter (A, B, C, or D) stemmed from using different and inconsistent option labeling, but the consensus on the numerical result is clear and robust.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the reasoning from the candidate answers and identifying all careful points.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem and Physical Principles\n\nThe question asks for the minimum detector resolution ($d_{res}$) required to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of a particle $X^0$. This involves two key physics principles:\n\n*   **Special Relativity:** The particle's total energy ($E = 27$ GeV) is significantly larger than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV), so its motion and lifetime must be described using special relativity.\n*   **Exponential Decay Law:** The decay of unstable particles is a random process. The probability that a particle survives to travel a distance `x` or more is given by the survival function $P(L \\ge x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n\n### 2. Formulating the Mathematical Condition\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Correctly Interpreting \"Observe\"**: To \"observe\" a decay, the neutral particle must travel a distance from its creation point that is greater than the detector's resolution ($d_{res}$).

The correct numerical value is approximately $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, which corresponds to option D in the provided list.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nAnswering this question requires a step-by-step application of principles from special relativity and particle decay statistics. Based on the consistent methodology presented by the candidate answers, the following consolidated approach represents the most accurate way to solve the problem.\n\n### Analysis of the Problem and Solution Steps\n\n**1. Define the \"Observation Condition\"**\n\nThe question asks for the minimum detector resolution ($d_{res}$) needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. In this context, a decay is \"observed\" if the neutral particle $X^0$ travels a distance greater than the detector's resolution before it decays. This is because the detector can only resolve two separate points (the creation point and the decay point) if they are separated by a distance greater than its resolution.\n\nThis physical requirement translates into a probability statement. The decay of unstable particles is a statistical process that follows an exponential decay law. The probability $P$ that a particle will travel a distance greater than $d_{res}$ before decaying is:\n$$P(x > d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda}$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length of the particle in the laboratory's frame of reference.\n\nThe problem requires that this probability be at least 30% (0.30). To find the minimum resolution, we solve for the boundary case:\n$$e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$$\nSolving for $d_{res}$ by taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:\n$$-d_{res}/\\lambda = \\ln(0.30)$$\n$$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$$\n\n**2. Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**\n\nThe mean decay length must be calculated in the laboratory frame, where the particle has a total energy of 27 GeV. This requires using special relativity. The most direct method is to relate the decay length to the particle's momentum.\n\n*   **First, calculate the particle's relativistic momentum ($pc$):**\n    We use the energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    *   Total energy, $E = 27$ GeV\n    *   Rest mass energy, $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n    \n    $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\text{ GeV}^2$\n    $$pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$$\n\n*   **Next, calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$):**\n    The formula for the lab-frame mean decay length is $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$.\n    *   Proper lifetime, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    *   Speed of light, $c \\approx 2.998 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n    \n    $$\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (2.998 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$$\n    $$\\lambda \\approx (7.854) \\cdot (2.398 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$$\n\n**3. Calculate the Final Resolution ($d_{res}$)**\n\nNow, substitute the value of $\\lambda$ into the equation from Step 1.\n\n$$d_{res} = -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\ln(0.30) \\approx -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204)$$\n$$d_{res} \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$$\n\n**4. Analyze the Result and Select the Correct Option (A Careful Point)**\n\nThe calculated value, $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is numerically closest to option **A) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**. All other options are off by several orders of magnitude, making them physically implausible.\n\nHowever, there is a discrepancy of about 9% between the calculated value and the value in option A. As noted by a majority of the more insightful candidate answers, in multiple-choice physics problems, round percentages like \"30%\" are often used as an approximation for a more fundamental fraction. Let's test the hypothesis that the intended probability was actually **1/3** ($\\approx 33.3\\%$).\n\n*   The condition becomes: $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$.\n*   Solving for $d_{res}$: $d_{res} = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$.\n*   Using our calculated $\\lambda$ and $\\ln(3) \\approx 1.0986$:\n    $$d_{res} \\approx (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986) \\approx 2.070 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$$\n\nThis result, **$2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, is an excellent match for option A ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m), with a difference of less than 0.5%. This provides strong evidence that this was the intended method for solving the problem and that \"at least 30%\" was intended to be interpreted as \"for a fraction of 1/3 of particles\".\n\nBoth lines of reasoning—the direct calculation pointing to the correct order of magnitude and numerical vicinity, and the refined calculation providing an almost exact match—conclusively identify option A as the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n**Analysis of the Physics and Calculations**\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum detector resolution ($d_{res}$) required to observe at least 30% of the decays of a highly relativistic particle, $X^0$. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution, incorporating the analysis from the candidate answers.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Observation Condition**\n*   To \"observe\" a decay means the neutral particle $X^0$ travels a distance greater than the detector's resolution ($d_{res}$) before it decays, leaving a distinguishable decay vertex.\n*   The decay of unstable particles is a random process governed by an exponential decay law. The probability `P` that a particle travels a distance `x` or more before decaying is:\n    $P(\\text{distance} \\ge x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$\n    where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n*   The condition is that at least 30% of the decays must be observed. To find the minimum resolution, we set the probability to the boundary value of 30% (or 0.3):\n    $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n*   Solving for the resolution, we get:\n    $d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$**)**\nThe particle is highly relativistic (Total Energy 27 GeV >> Rest Mass Energy 3.41 GeV), so we must use relativistic kinematics.\n\n*   **Calculate the particle's momentum-energy ($pc$)**: The most accurate method uses the energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    *   $E = 27$ GeV\n    *   $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n    *   $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2} = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n*   **Calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$)**: The formula is $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c \\cdot \\tau_0$.\n    *   $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    *   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n    *   $\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Required Resolution ($d_{res}$**)**\nUsing the formula from Step 1 and the value of $\\lambda$ from Step 2:\n*   $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n*   $d_{res} = -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204) \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**Careful Points and Final Decision**\n\n1.  **Direct Comparison**: The calculated value based on the literal interpretation of \"30%\" is $d_{res} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Comparing this with the provided options:\n    *   A) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n    *   B) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\n    *   C) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\n    *   D) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\n\n    The only option with the correct order of magnitude is A. Our calculated value is numerically closest to A.\n\n2.  **The \"1/3\" Hypothesis**: Several candidate answers correctly point out a common feature in physics test questions. A rounded percentage like \"30%\" often represents a simpler fraction. In this case, 1/3 is a very likely candidate ($\\approx 33.3\\%$). Let's test this hypothesis.\n    *   The condition becomes $e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$.\n    *   Solving gives $d_{res} = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$.\n    *   $d_{res} = (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\ln(3) \\approx (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986) \\approx 2.070 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$.\n\n    This result, $2.070 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is an extremely close match to option A, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m (less than 0.5% difference). This strongly confirms that this was the intended interpretation for designing the question's options.\n\nBoth lines of reasoning—direct calculation and the more refined \"1/3\" hypothesis—conclusively point to A as the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the reasoning and careful points identified from the candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal and the Physics\n\nThe objective is to find the minimum spatial resolution of a detector ($d_{res}$) that can \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of the $X^0$ particle.\n\n*   **Definition of Observation:** A neutral particle like $X^0$ doesn't leave a track. Its decay is \"observed\" when its charged decay products ($Y^+$, $Z^-$) appear at a point measurably distant from the creation point of the $X^0$. This means the $X^0$ must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution ($d_{res}$) before it decays.\n\n*   **Key Physical Principles:**\n    1.  **Special Relativity:** The particle's total energy (E = 27 GeV) is much larger than its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$ = 3.41 GeV), indicating it is highly relativistic. We must use relativistic equations for energy, momentum, and time dilation.\n    2.  **Exponential Decay Law:** The decay of unstable particles is a probabilistic process. The probability `P` that a particle will travel a distance `x` or more before decaying is given by the formula $P(L \\ge x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda$ is the particle's mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Mathematical Condition\n\nBased on the physics above, we can set up the equation. We need to find the resolution $d_{res}$ where the probability of traveling a greater distance is 0.30 (or 30%).\n\n$P(L > d_{res}) = e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n\nSolving this equation for $d_{res}$ by taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:\n\n$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)\n\nTo find $d_{res}$, we first need to calculate $\\lambda$. The mean decay length in the lab frame is the average distance the particle travels, and it is most accurately calculated using the particle's momentum.\n\n1.  **Calculate the particle's momentum ($pc$)** using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n    $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2}$\n    $pc = \\sqrt{(27)^2 - (3.41)^2} = \\sqrt{729 - 11.6281} = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n2.  **Calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$)** using the formula $\\lambda = \\frac{pc}{m_0c^2} \\cdot c\\tau_0$.\n    $\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}\\right) \\cdot (2.998 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    $\\lambda \\approx (7.854) \\cdot (2.398 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Resolution and Analyze the Result\n\nNow we can calculate the final resolution, $d_{res}$.\n\n$d_{res} = -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot \\ln(0.30) \\approx -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (-1.204)$\n$d_{res} \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nLet's compare this calculated value of **$2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m** with the given options:\nA) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\nB) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\nC) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\nD) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\n\nOur result is clearly closest to option C, as it is the only one with the correct order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$ m). However, there is a ~9% difference between our calculated value and the value in the option.\n\n### Careful Point: Interpreting \"30%\"\n\nAs many of the provided candidate answers astutely noted, in physics multiple-choice questions, a round percentage like \"30%\" is often a convenient approximation for a simpler, more fundamental fraction. Let's test the hypothesis that the question intended a survival probability of **1/3** ($\\approx 33.3\\%$).\n\nUnder this hypothesis, the condition becomes:\n$e^{-d_{res}/\\lambda} = 1/3$\n\nSolving for $d_{res}$:\n$d_{res} = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(1/3) = \\lambda \\cdot \\ln(3)$\n$d_{res} \\approx (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\cdot (1.0986) \\approx \\mathbf{2.070 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}}$\n\nThis result, **$2.07 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, is an excellent match for option C, **$2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m**, with a difference of less than 0.5%. This provides very strong evidence that this interpretation was the intended method to arrive at the answer.\n\nBoth the direct calculation and the more refined interpretation point conclusively to the same option.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
