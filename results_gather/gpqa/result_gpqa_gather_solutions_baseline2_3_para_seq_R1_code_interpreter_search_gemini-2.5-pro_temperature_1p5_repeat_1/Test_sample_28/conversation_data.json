Define the Objective**\nThe primary goal is to find the mutation that will *most probably* eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the gene in question. Therefore, the task is to identify the mutation that is most likely to result in a completely non-functional protein (a \"knockout\" or \"null\" mutation).\n\n**2. Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity**\nTo choose the most probable candidate, we must understand how different types of mutations affect protein function. The general hierarchy of severity, from most likely to least likely to cause a complete loss of function, is:\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid-coding codon to a STOP codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA). This halts protein synthesis prematurely, creating a truncated protein that is almost always non-functional, especially when the mutation occurs early in the gene.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three. This alters the reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Removes or adds one or more complete amino acids but keeps the downstream reading frame intact. This can disrupt function but is less certain than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid for another. The effect is variable; it may have no effect, a minor effect, or it could completely inactivate the protein. It is not a guaranteed knockout.\n\n**3. Analyze the DNA Sequences**\nWe must analyze the intact gene and each mutant at the codon level (three-base units), starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Translates to the amino acid sequence: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein we want to disable.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n    *   This sequence contains a change from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It creates a full-length protein with a substituted amino acid, which may or may not be functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC...-3’`\n    *   This sequence also contains a **missense mutation** changing `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine), among other changes. It still produces a full-length protein, making its loss of function uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   This sequence shows a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon. This is an **in-frame deletion**, as 3 bases are removed. It creates a protein that is one amino acid shorter and has one substitution, but the rest of the protein is unchanged. Its loss of function is not guaranteed.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    *   This sequence contains a change from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAA`.\n    *   `TAA` is a **STOP codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   **Effect**: Protein synthesis will terminate after the second amino acid. The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe). A severely truncated product like this is **guaranteed to be non-functional**.\n\n**4. Conclusion and Final Decision**\nThe nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe and definitive mutation among the choices. By introducing a STOP codon at the third position of the coding sequence, it ensures that a functional protein cannot be synthesized. This is the mutation that will most probably and most reliably achieve the goal of eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe options provided are:\nA) Mutant 2\nB) Mutant 3\nC) Mutant 1\nD) Mutant 4\n\nBased on our analysis, Mutant 2 is the correct choice. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer:\n\n**1. Understand the Scientific Goal**\nThe core task is to identify which mutation is most likely to eliminate the function of a gene that produces an anti-nutritional compound. Gene function is realized through the protein it codes for. Therefore, the goal is to find the mutation that most reliably creates a non-functional protein. This is often referred to as a \"knockout\" or \"null\" mutation.\n\n**2. Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Severity**\nThe effect of a mutation depends on how it alters the protein synthesis process. Here's a hierarchy of mutation severity in terms of causing a loss of protein function:\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** This changes an amino acid-coding codon into a stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA). It causes protein synthesis to halt prematurely. An early nonsense mutation results in a severely shortened (truncated) protein that is almost guaranteed to be non-functional.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three. This shifts the entire \"reading frame,\" scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually leading to a premature stop codon. This is also highly likely to cause a loss of function.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** This substitutes one amino acid for another. The effect is uncertain. It might have no effect, or it could be catastrophic, but it's not a guaranteed knockout.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** This removes or adds one or more full codons (multiples of three bases). This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein's sequence intact. This is less severe than a frameshift or early nonsense mutation.\n\n**3. Analyze the Provided Gene Sequences**\nWe must break down the DNA sequence into three-base codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon, to see the impact of each mutation.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Translation: `ATG` (Methionine), `TTT` (Phenylalanine), `CTC` (Leucine).\n    *   The functional protein starts with the amino acid sequence: Met-Phe-Leu...\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n    *   The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It creates a full-length protein with one different amino acid, which may or may not be functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    *   The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAA`.\n    *   `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   Effect: Protein synthesis will stop after the second amino acid. The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe), which is guaranteed to be completely non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC...-3’`\n    *   This mutant has multiple changes, including the same missense mutation as Mutant 1 (`CTC` -> `TAC`). These are **multiple missense mutations**. While more disruptive than one change, a full-length protein is still produced, so a knockout is not guaranteed.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TACGCTACT...-3’`\n    *   Alignment with the intact sequence (`...CTCGCTGGTACT...` vs. `...TACGCTACT...`) shows a change of `CTC` to `TAC` (missense) and a deletion of the codon `GGT`. This is an **in-frame deletion**. It removes one amino acid while changing another, but the reading frame for the rest of the protein remains intact. The effect is less severe than a premature stop codon.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most severe and most certain to achieve the desired goal. By introducing a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the gene (the third codon), it ensures that a functional protein cannot be produced. The resulting truncated product will be completely inactive.\n\n**5. Match to the Correct Option**\nThe analysis confirms that Mutant 2 is the correct answer. The question provides the following options:\nA) Mutant 2\nB) Mutant 3\nC) Mutant 1\nD) Mutant 4\n\nTherefore, the correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Scientific Goal**\nThe core task is to find a mutation that will most probably eliminate an unwanted anti-nutritional compound. The problem states that a protein, encoded by the given gene, is responsible for synthesizing this compound. Therefore, to eliminate the compound, we need to eliminate the function of the protein. The most effective way to do this is to introduce a \"knockout\" or \"null\" mutation that prevents the formation of a functional protein.\n\n**2. Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity**\nDifferent types of mutations have different impacts on the final protein. In terms of reliably causing a complete loss of function, the general order from most severe to least severe is:\n\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** This changes an amino acid-coding codon into a STOP codon (in DNA, these are `TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). This causes protein synthesis to halt prematurely, producing a severely truncated protein fragment that is almost certainly non-functional, especially if it occurs early in the gene.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases that is not a multiple of three. This shifts the entire reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually creating a non-functional protein.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** This changes one amino acid to another. The effect is uncertain; it might have no effect, alter the function, or completely destroy it, but it is not a guaranteed knockout.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** This removes or adds one or more complete amino acids without altering the downstream reading frame. This is less severe than a frameshift or early nonsense mutation.\n\nThe goal is to find the mutation with the highest probability of knocking out the function, making the nonsense mutation the prime candidate to look for.\n\n**3. Analyze the Gene Sequences**\nThe cellular machinery reads the gene's DNA in three-base units called codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT ... -3’`\n    *   Translation: The first three amino acids are `ATG` (Methionine), `TTT` (Phenylalanine), and `CTC` (Leucine). This forms the beginning of the functional protein.\n\nNow, we evaluate each mutant:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT ... -3’`\n    *   The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It produces a full-length protein with one substituted amino acid. The loss of function is not guaranteed.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT ... -3’`\n    *   The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), has been changed to `TAA`.\n    *   `TAA` is a **STOP codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   **Effect:** Protein synthesis will terminate after the second amino acid. The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide fragment. This is guaranteed to be completely non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ... -3’`\n    *   This sequence also contains a change from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine), among other changes further down. This represents **multiple missense mutations**. While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, a full-length protein is still produced, and a loss of function is not as certain as with Mutant 2.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TACGCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   This mutation involves a change from `CTC` to `TAC` (missense) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon. This is a combination of a missense mutation and an **in-frame deletion**. This removes one amino acid from the protein but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. The disruption is less severe than a premature stop codon.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\nThe nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe and definitive mutation among the choices. It introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the coding sequence, ensuring that a functional, full-length protein cannot be synthesized. This is the mutation that will *most probably* eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nAccording to the provided options:\nA) Mutant 4\nB) Mutant 3\nC) Mutant 2\nD) Mutant 1\n\nThe correct answer is Mutant 2, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\n**Step-by-step analysis of the problem:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to find a mutation that is most likely to eliminate the synthesis of an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is produced by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the goal is to find the mutation that will most probably result in a non-functional protein (a \"knockout\" or \"null\" mutation).\n\n2.  **Understand the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity:** To reliably create a non-functional protein, certain mutations are more effective than others. The order of severity, from most likely to least likely to cause a complete loss of function, is:\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid-coding codon into a stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA). This halts protein synthesis prematurely, producing a short, truncated protein that is almost guaranteed to be non-functional, especially if it occurs early in the gene.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion (indel) of a number of bases not divisible by three. This shifts the reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually creating a non-functional protein.\n    *   **In-frame Indel:** An indel of a number of bases that is a multiple of three. This removes or adds one or more amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein's reading frame intact. This alters the protein but is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than the above mutations.\n    *   **Missense Mutation:** Changes a single amino acid. The effect is variable and not guaranteed to disable the protein.\n\n3.  **Analyze the DNA Sequences by Codon:** We must read the DNA sequence in three-base units (codons) starting from the `ATG` start codon to see the effect on the resulting amino acid sequence.\n\n    *   **Intact gene:** `ATG TTT CTC GCT...` -> This translates to Met-Phe-Leu-Ala... This is the functional protein we want to disable.\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** `ATG TTC TAC GCT...`\n        *   Change: The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). (Note: The TTT to TTC change is silent, as both code for Phenylalanine).\n        *   Mutation Type: **Missense mutation**. This produces a full-length protein with a substituted amino acid. This is not a guaranteed knockout.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** `ATG TTC TAA GCT...`\n        *   Change: The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAA`.\n        *   Mutation Type: `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **Nonsense mutation**.\n        *   Effect: Protein synthesis will stop after the second amino acid. The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid fragment (Met-Phe). This is guaranteed to be completely non-functional.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** `ATG TTT TAC GCT...`\n        *   Change: Contains multiple missense mutations (e.g., `CTC` to `TAC`).\n        *   Mutation Type: **Multiple missense mutations**. A full-length protein with altered amino acids is still produced. Its loss of function is less certain than that from a nonsense mutation.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** `ATG TTT TACGCT ACT...`\n        *   Change: Comparison with the intact gene shows the codon `GGT` has been deleted.\n        *   Mutation Type: **In-frame deletion**. It removes one amino acid (Glycine) but does not alter the reading frame for the rest of the protein. This is less severe than a nonsense mutation.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The analysis reveals that every candidate agent correctly identified that Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon (a nonsense mutation). This type of mutation, occurring so early in the gene, is the most certain way to prevent the synthesis of a functional protein. Therefore, it is the mutation most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n5.  **Final Answer Mapping:** The unanimous conclusion from the reasoning of all candidate answers is that **Mutant 2** is the correct choice. According to the options provided in the question:\n    A) Mutant 1\n    B) Mutant 2\n    C) Mutant 4\n    D) Mutant 3\n\n    The correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Objective:** The central task is to identify the mutation that will *most probably* eliminate an unwanted compound. This compound is produced by a protein, which is encoded by the gene in question. Therefore, the goal is to find the mutation most likely to result in a completely non-functional protein, a \"knockout\" or \"null\" mutation.\n\n2.  **Understand Gene Translation and Mutation Impact:** The genetic code is read in three-base units called codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon. The effect of a mutation depends on how it alters the protein sequence. We can rank mutations by the severity of their impact on protein function:\n    *   **Most Severe:** A **nonsense mutation**, which changes a codon for an amino acid into a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This terminates protein synthesis prematurely. If this happens early in the sequence, the resulting protein fragment is almost certainly non-functional.\n    *   **Also Very Severe:** A **frameshift mutation** (insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by 3). This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence.\n    *   **Less Severe:** **Missensense mutations** (which change one amino acid to another) and **in-frame deletions/insertions** (which add or remove entire amino acids). These alter the protein but are less certain to cause a complete loss of function, as a full-length (or near full-length) protein is still produced.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Intact Gene Sequence:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   The first three codons translate to the amino acids: Methionine (Met) - Phenylalanine (Phe) - Leucine (Leu). This is the beginning of the functional protein.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Each Mutant's Sequence:**\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n        The change is from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It changes a single amino acid. The protein is still made to its full length, and its function might be reduced, unchanged, or eliminated. The outcome is uncertain.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n        The change is from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. Protein synthesis will halt after the second amino acid, creating a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (`Met-Phe`). This is guaranteed to be a non-functional product.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT...-3’`\n        The change is from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine), with other changes downstream. These are **multiple missense mutations**. While more disruptive than a single change, a full-length protein is still synthesized, so the effect remains less certain than a premature stop.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TACGCT ACT...-3’`\n        By aligning with the original sequence, we can see the `GGT` codon is deleted. This is an **in-frame deletion**, which removes one amino acid but keeps the downstream reading frame intact. The effect is less severe and less certain than a nonsense mutation.\n\n5.  **Synthesize and Conclude:** The nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most destructive type of mutation presented. By creating a stop codon at the third position in the sequence, it guarantees that a functional protein cannot be synthesized. This is the most reliable way among the given options to eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n6.  **Match to Final Options:** The question lists the options as:\n    *   A) Mutant 2\n    *   B) Mutant 1\n    *   C) Mutant 3\n    *   D) Mutant 4\n\n    Since Mutant 2 is the correct choice, the corresponding answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal**: The primary objective is to find the mutation that is most likely to make the protein produced by the gene non-functional. A non-functional protein will not be able to synthesize the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n2.  **Understand Protein Synthesis and Mutations**: The gene sequence is read starting from the `ATG` start codon in groups of three DNA bases, called codons. Each codon codes for a specific amino acid, except for three special \"stop codons\" (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`) that terminate protein synthesis. The most effective way to \"knock out\" a gene's function is to introduce a mutation that prevents a full, functional protein from being made. The severity of different mutation types is generally as follows:\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation (Most Severe for Knockout):** Changes a normal codon into a stop codon. This halts protein synthesis prematurely, creating a short, non-functional protein fragment. An early nonsense mutation is almost guaranteed to be a knockout.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation (Very Severe):** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three. This shifts the reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually resulting in a non-functional protein.\n    *   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion (Less Severe):** Deletes or inserts a complete codon (3 bases). This removes or adds an amino acid but keeps the rest of the protein's reading frame intact. The function might be altered or lost, but it's not as certain as a nonsense mutation.\n    *   **Missense Mutation (Variable Severity):** Changes one amino acid to another. This may or may not impact the protein's function, depending on the importance of that specific amino acid.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Intact and Mutant Sequences**: Let's break down the DNA sequences into codons and compare them.\n    *   **Intact Gene**: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n        *   This sequence codes for the start of the functional protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n\n    *   **Mutant 1**: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n        *   Change: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n        *   Mutation Type: **Missense**. It creates a full-length protein with a single amino acid substitution. The loss of function is not guaranteed.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4**: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n        *   Change: A comparison with the full intact gene shows a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`) and a deletion of the fifth codon, `GGT`.\n        *   Mutation Type: **In-frame deletion** plus a missense mutation. This removes one amino acid and changes another. The protein is nearly full-length and might still be functional.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3**: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n        *   Change: There are multiple substitutions, such as `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n        *   Mutation Type: **Multiple Missense**. A full-length protein with several changes is made. This is more disruptive than Mutant 1, but loss of function is still less certain than a premature stop.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2**: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n        *   Change: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`.\n        *   Mutation Type: **Nonsense**. The codon `TAA` is a **STOP codon**.\n        *   Effect: Protein synthesis will be terminated at this point. The resulting product will be a tiny peptide of only two amino acids (Met-Phe). This severely truncated product is guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: The nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most catastrophic for protein synthesis. By introducing a stop codon at the very beginning of the sequence (the third codon), it ensures that a functional protein cannot be produced. This is the mutation that will *most probably* eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n5.  **Final Answer Selection**: The correct mutation is found in Mutant 2. Looking at the options provided:\n    A) Mutant 2\n    B) Mutant 1\n    C) Mutant 4\n    D) Mutant 3\n\nThe correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Objective:** The task is to find the mutation that will *most probably* eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. The problem states this compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by a specific gene. Therefore, the most reliable way to achieve the goal is to introduce a mutation that results in a completely non-functional protein (a \"knockout\" or \"null\" mutation).\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity:** To reliably create a non-functional protein, certain mutations are more effective than others. The general order of severity, from most likely to least likely to cause a complete loss of function, is:\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes a normal codon into a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`).

This produces a full-length protein with one different amino acid. Its function is uncertain.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n        *   Change: `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`.\n        *   Mutation Type: **Nonsense**. The codon `TAA` is a **STOP codon**.\n        *   Effect: Protein synthesis will terminate after the second amino acid. The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (`Met-Phe`). This is guaranteed to be completely non-functional.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC...-3’`\n        *   Change: `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), plus other substitutions are present downstream.\n        *   Mutation Type: **Multiple Missense**. A full-length protein with several altered amino acids is still produced. Its inactivation is not as certain as that from a premature stop codon.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TACGCT...-3’`\n        *   Change: A careful comparison reveals the codon `GGT` is deleted.\n        *   Mutation Type: **In-frame deletion**. This removes one amino acid (Glycine) but preserves the downstream reading frame. This is less severe than a premature stop codon.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The consensus of all candidate agents is correct in its reasoning. The nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most severe and definitive mutation among the choices. It introduces a stop codon at the third position of the coding sequence, ensuring that a functional, full-length protein cannot be synthesized. This is the most probable mutation to successfully eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n5.  **Final Answer Mapping:** The question maps the mutants to the options as follows:\n    *   A) Mutant 1\n    *   B) Mutant 2\n    *   C) Mutant 3\n    *   D) Mutant 4\n\nSince the correct choice is Mutant 2, the corresponding answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe core task is to identify which mutation is most likely to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein, which is encoded by the gene in question. Therefore, the goal is to find the mutation that most reliably creates a non-functional (\"knockout\") protein.\n\n**2. Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Severity**\nTo predict the outcome, we must understand the impact of different mutation types on protein synthesis:\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid-coding codon into a stop codon (e.g., `TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). This causes protein synthesis to stop prematurely. A nonsense mutation early in a gene is the most reliable way to produce a severely truncated and non-functional protein.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases that is not a multiple of three. This shifts the entire reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids. This is also very likely to produce a non-functional protein.\n*   **Missensense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. The effect is variable; it might be harmless or it might destroy protein function, but it is not a guaranteed knockout.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Removes or adds a full codon (3 bases). This removes or adds one or more amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein's reading frame intact. This is generally less disruptive than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\nThe question asks what will *most probably* eliminate the compound, which points us to the most severe and predictable mutation type.\n\n**3. Analyze the Gene Sequences**\nThe translation process reads the DNA in three-base codons, starting from `ATG`.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT...-3’`\n    *   The first three codons translate to the amino acid sequence: Methionine - Phenylalanine - Leucine...\n    *   This sequence produces the functional protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n    *   The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   **Type:** This is a **missense mutation**. The outcome is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    *   The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), has been changed to `TAA`.\n    *   **Type:** The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   **Effect:** Protein synthesis will halt after only two amino acids are joined. The resulting product is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide, which is guaranteed to be completely non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC...-3’`\n    *   This also contains a change from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine), along with other changes further down.\n    *   **Type:** Multiple **missense mutations**. While more disruptive than one, this is still less certain to be a knockout than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TACGCTACTT...-3’`\n    *   A careful comparison with the intact sequence shows that the `GGT` codon has been deleted.\n    *   **Type:** This is an **in-frame deletion** (a 3-base deletion). This removes one amino acid. The effect is disruptive but less severe than the nonsense mutation.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe mutation in Mutant 2 is a nonsense mutation that introduces a stop codon at the very beginning of the protein sequence. This is the most catastrophic event for protein synthesis among the given options. It is the most reliable and probable way to ensure a non-functional gene product, thereby eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nTherefore, Mutant 2 is the correct answer. According to the options provided:\nA) Mutant 3\nB) Mutant 1\nC) Mutant 4\nD) Mutant 2\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Goal:** The primary objective is to select the mutation that is *most probably* going to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. The problem states that this compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the gene in question. Therefore, the most reliable way to achieve the goal is to introduce a mutation that makes the protein non-functional (a \"knockout\" or \"null\" mutation).\n\n2.  **Understand the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity:** To reliably create a non-functional protein, some mutations are far more effective than others. The general order of severity for inactivating a protein is:\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes a normal codon for an amino acid into a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis prematurely, producing a truncated (shortened) and almost always non-functional protein. A stop codon early in the sequence is devastating to function.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three. This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n    *   **Missense Mutation / In-frame Deletion:** A missense mutation changes one amino acid to another. An in-frame deletion removes one or more complete amino acids. These mutations alter the protein but do not guarantee a complete loss of function; the protein might still be partially or even fully functional.\n\n3.  **Analyze Each Mutant Sequence:** We will break down the DNA into three-base codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon, and compare each mutant to the intact gene.\n\n    *   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC ... -3’`\n        *   Translation: The protein begins with Methionine (Met) - Phenylalanine (Phe) - Leucine (Leu) ... This is the functional protein we want to disable.\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC ...-3’`\n        *   Change: The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n        *   Type: **Missense mutation**. This results in a full-length protein with a single amino acid substitution. The effect is uncertain.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA ...-3’`\n        *   Change: The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAA`.\n        *   Type: **Nonsense mutation**. The codon `TAA` is a **STOP codon**.\n        *   Effect: Protein synthesis will terminate after the second amino acid. The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid-long peptide (Met-Phe). This severely truncated fragment is guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC ...-3’`\n        *   Change: The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and other changes occur downstream.\n        *   Type: **Multiple Missense mutations**. While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it is still less certain to be a complete knockout than the guaranteed premature stop in Mutant 2.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n        *   Change: When aligned with the intact sequence (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), this mutant has a missense change (`CTC` to `TAC`) and has deleted the `GGT` codon.\n        *   Type: **In-frame deletion** (removing one amino acid) combined with a missense mutation. The reading frame for the rest of the protein is maintained. The effect on function is significant but less definitively catastrophic than an early stop codon.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most severe and definitive mutation among the choices. It introduces a STOP signal at the third position of the coding sequence, ensuring that a functional, full-length protein cannot be synthesized. This is the mutation that will *most probably* eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n5.  **Final Answer Selection:** Based on the analysis, Mutant 2 is the correct answer. The options are:\n    A) Mutant 2\n    B) Mutant 4\n    C) Mutant 3\n    D) Mutant 1\n\n    The correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Goal of the Task**\nThe core objective is to find which mutation will *most probably* eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is produced by a protein encoded by the given gene. Therefore, the goal is to identify the mutation that is most likely to create a non-functional or \"knockout\" protein, thus stopping the compound's synthesis.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Severity**\nTo determine which mutation is most likely to be a knockout, we must understand the effects of different mutation types:\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes a codon that codes for an amino acid into a **stop codon** (e.g., TAA, TAG, TGA). This causes protein synthesis to halt prematurely, producing a truncated (shortened) protein. If this occurs early in the gene, the resulting protein fragment is almost guaranteed to be non-functional. This is a very severe and effective way to knock out a gene.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases that is not a multiple of three. This shifts the entire reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually leading to a premature stop codon by chance. This is also a very severe mutation.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid for another. The effect is variable; it might destroy the protein's function if the amino acid is in a critical location, but it might also have little or no effect. It is not a guaranteed knockout.\n*   **In-frame Deletion:** A deletion of three bases (or a multiple of three). This removes one or more amino acids from the protein chain but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. The effect is less severe than a frameshift or early nonsense mutation.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Each Mutant Sequence**\nWe will analyze the DNA sequence in three-base units (codons) starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Translates to the amino acid sequence: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein we want to disable.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n    *   The third codon, `CTC` (which codes for Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (which codes for Tyrosine).\n    *   **Mutation Type:** This is a **missense mutation**. It creates a full-length protein with a single amino acid substitution. This is not a guaranteed way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    *   The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAA`.\n    *   **Mutation Type:** `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   **Effect:** Protein synthesis will stop after the second amino acid. The result will be a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe), which is **guaranteed to be completely non-functional**.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCTGGT...-3’`\n    *   This sequence contains at least one **missense mutation**, changing `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and other changes downstream. Like Mutant 1, a full-length (but altered) protein is produced, and a loss of function is not guaranteed.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TACGCTACT...-3’`\n    *   When compared to the intact gene, this sequence shows a deletion of the `GGT` codon.\n    *   **Mutation Type:** This is an **in-frame deletion**. It removes one amino acid (Glycine) but does not shift the reading frame. This is less disruptive than a nonsense mutation that halts the entire process.\n\n### **Step 4: Conclude and Select the Best Option**\nThe analysis shows that the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe and definitive among the choices. It introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the coding sequence, ensuring that a functional protein cannot be synthesized. This is the mutation that will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nTherefore, Mutant 2 is the correct answer. The options are:\nA) Mutant 2\nB) Mutant 3\nC) Mutant 1\nD) Mutant 4\n\nThe correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Goal\nThe main objective is to find a mutation that will *most probably* eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the gene in question. Therefore, the most reliable way to achieve this is to find a mutation that creates a non-functional protein, a process often referred to as creating a \"knockout\" or \"null\" allele.\n\n### 2. Understand the Types and Severity of Mutations\nTo choose the most probable mutation for creating a non-functional protein, we must understand the typical impact of different mutation types. The ranking from most likely to least likely to cause a complete loss of function is generally:\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid-coding codon into a stop codon (e.g., TAA, TAG, TGA). This causes protein synthesis to halt prematurely, producing a severely shortened (truncated) protein. If this occurs early in the gene, as is the case here, the resulting fragment is almost guaranteed to be non-functional.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion (indel) of a number of nucleotides not divisible by three. This alters the reading frame for all subsequent codons, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a premature stop codon. This is also highly likely to result in a non-functional protein.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes a single amino acid. The effect is uncertain and can range from no impact to complete loss of function, depending on the importance of that specific amino acid. It is not a guaranteed knockout.\n*   **In-frame Deletion:** A deletion of nucleotides in a multiple of three (e.g., deleting a whole codon). This removes one or more amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein's reading frame intact. While this alters the protein, it is generally less severe than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Intact Gene and the Mutants\nWe will now analyze each sequence by breaking it into three-base codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   This translates to the amino acid sequence: **Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...** This produces the functional protein we want to disable.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC...-3’`\n    *   Change: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   Mutation Type: **Missense**. This produces a full-length protein with a single amino acid change. The outcome is not guaranteed.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC...-3’`\n    *   Change: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   Mutation Type: **Missense**. Similar to Mutant 1, this outcome is not guaranteed.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACTT...-3’`\n    *   Change: Comparison with the intact gene shows the `GGT` codon has been deleted.\n    *   Mutation Type: **In-frame deletion**. This removes one amino acid (Glycine) but keeps the rest of the protein intact. The effect on function is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA...-3’`\n    *   Change: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`.\n    *   Mutation Type: **Nonsense**. The codon **`TAA` is a stop codon.**\n    *   Effect: Protein synthesis will terminate after the second amino acid (Phenylalanine). The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid-long fragment. A protein this severely truncated is guaranteed to be completely non-functional.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nThe nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most severe and definitive mutation among the choices. It introduces a premature stop codon at the third position in the coding sequence, ensuring that a functional, full-length protein cannot be synthesized. This is the mutation that will *most probably* eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n### 5. Match to the Correct Option\nThe question asks us to select the final option letter.\n*   A) Mutant 1\n*   B) Mutant 3\n*   C) Mutant 4\n*   D) Mutant 2\n\nThe correct answer is Mutant 2, which corresponds to option **D**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n**Detailed Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Objective Identification:** The core task is to identify which mutation among the four options is most likely to render the protein non-functional. The gene in question synthesizes an anti-nutritional compound, so a non-functional protein will eliminate this compound.\n\n2.  **Scientific Principle - Hierarchy of Mutation Severity:** To achieve a \"knockout\" (a non-functional gene product), certain types of mutations are more effective than others. The order of severity, from most likely to least likely to cause complete loss of function, is:\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino-acid-coding codon into a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis prematurely, creating a short, truncated protein that is almost guaranteed to be non-functional, especially if the stop codon appears early in the sequence.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of DNA bases that is not a multiple of three. This shifts the entire reading frame, scrambling all downstream amino acids and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n    *   **Missense Mutation / In-frame Deletion:** A missense mutation changes a single amino acid. An in-frame deletion removes one or more complete amino acids but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. These mutations alter the protein but are less likely to cause a complete and certain loss of function compared to a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Gene Sequences:** We must analyze the DNA in three-base units (codons) starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n    *   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT...-3’`\n        *   This translates to the amino acid sequence: Methionine - Phenylalanine - Leucine - Alanine... This is the functional protein we aim to disable.\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n        *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n        *   **Type:** This is a **missense mutation**. It produces a full-length protein with one different amino acid. This is not a guaranteed knockout.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n        *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`.\n        *   **Type:** The codon `TAA` is a **STOP codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n        *   **Effect:** Protein synthesis will halt after the second amino acid. The result will be a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide fragment. This is guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC...GTC...-3’`\n        *   This sequence contains multiple amino acid substitutions.\n        *   **Type:** **Multiple missense mutations**. A full-length protein is still produced, and while the multiple changes make it more likely to be non-functional than Mutant 1, it is still less certain than the guaranteed truncation in Mutant 2.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n        *   Comparison to the intact gene shows the `GGT` codon has been deleted.\n        *   **Type:** This is an **in-frame deletion** (removing a single amino acid). The reading frame is maintained, and the rest of the protein is synthesized. This is less severe than a nonsense mutation.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe and definitive. It introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the protein sequence. This ensures that a functional, full-length protein cannot be synthesized. Therefore, this mutation is the most probable to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n5.  **Matching with Options:**\n    *   The question lists the options as:\n        A) Mutant 1\n        B) Mutant 3\n        C) Mutant 4\n        D) Mutant 2\n    *   Our conclusion is that Mutant 2 is the correct answer. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe user wants a final decision based on the provided answers from other agents. I will first perform my own step-by-step analysis of the problem and then compare it with the candidate answers to reach a final, robust conclusion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Task:** The main goal is to find which mutation will *most probably* eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the gene in question. Therefore, the most reliable way to achieve this is to create a mutation that results in a completely non-functional protein (a \"knockout\" or \"null\" mutation).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity:** To make a protein non-functional, some mutations are more effective than others. The order of severity in terms of causing a guaranteed loss of function is typically:\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes a normal codon into a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis prematurely, creating a short, truncated protein. If this occurs early in the gene, the resulting protein fragment is almost certainly non-functional. This is a very probable way to create a knockout.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three. This shifts the reading frame, scrambling all downstream amino acids and usually creating a non-functional protein.\n    *   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Removes or adds one or more complete amino acids (a number of bases divisible by 3). This alters the protein but is less severe than a frameshift or nonsense mutation, as the rest of the protein sequence is translated correctly.\n    *   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid for another. The effect is variable; it can be harmless, alter function, or completely inactivate the protein. It is not a guaranteed way to create a knockout.\n\n3.  **Break Down the Gene Sequences into Codons:** We must read the DNA in three-base units (codons), starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n    *   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n        *   This translates to the amino acid sequence: **Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...** This is the functional protein we want to disable.\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n        *   Change: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). Note: The change from `TTT` to `TTC` is a silent mutation, as both code for Phenylalanine.\n        *   Type: This is a **missense mutation**. A full-length protein is produced with one amino acid change. Its function is uncertain.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n        *   Change: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`.\n        *   Type: The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n        *   Effect: Protein synthesis will terminate after the second amino acid. The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (`Met-Phe`), which is guaranteed to be completely non-functional. This is the most reliable way to eliminate the protein's function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n        *   Change: This sequence has multiple changes, resulting in **multiple missense mutations** (e.g., Leucine to Tyrosine). A full-length protein is still produced, and its inactivation is not as certain as with a nonsense mutation.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n        *   Change: By comparing the sequence to the intact gene (`...GCT GGT ACT...` vs `...GCT ACT...`), we can see that the codon `GGT` has been deleted.\n        *   Type: This is a 3-base-pair deletion, which is an **in-frame deletion**. It removes one amino acid (Glycine) but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. This is less severe than the nonsense mutation.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most severe and definitive. By introducing a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the coding sequence, it guarantees that a functional protein cannot be synthesized. This is the most probable mutation to achieve the desired goal of eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n5.  **Final Answer Selection:** Based on the analysis, Mutant 2 is the correct answer. Now, we match this to the options provided in the question:\n    A) Mutant 4\n    B) Mutant 1\n    C) **Mutant 2**\n    D) Mutant 3\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe task is to determine which of the given mutations will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound produced by a gene. This is achieved by finding the mutation most likely to render the encoded protein non-functional.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Goal:** The goal is to \"knock out\" the function of the protein encoded by the target gene. The most effective way to do this is to introduce a mutation that prevents the synthesis of a full-length, functional protein.\n\n2.  **Understand Mutation Severity:** Different types of mutations have different impacts on protein function. The hierarchy of severity, in terms of causing a complete loss of function, is generally as follows:\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** Introduces a premature STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis, resulting in a truncated and almost always non-functional protein. A nonsense mutation early in the sequence is the most reliable way to create a null allele.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three. This shifts the reading frame, scrambling the entire downstream amino acid sequence and typically resulting in a non-functional protein.\n    *   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Removes or adds one or more complete amino acids. This can be disruptive but is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n    *   **Missense Mutation:** Substitutes one amino acid for another. The effect is variable; it may have no effect, or it could completely disable the protein, but it is not a guaranteed \"knockout.\"\n\n3.  **Analyze the Intact and Mutant Sequences:** Let's break down the DNA sequences into three-base codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon, and determine the effect of each mutation.\n\n    *   **Intact Gene:**\n        `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n        This translates to the beginning of the functional protein: **Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...**\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:**\n        `5’-ATG TTC TAC...-3’`\n        The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It produces a full-length protein with a single amino acid substitution. The protein may or may not be functional.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:**\n        `5’-ATG TTC TAA...-3’`\n        The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **STOP codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n        *   **Effect**: Protein synthesis will terminate after the second amino acid. The result will be a tiny, two-amino-acid-long fragment (Met-Phe). This is guaranteed to be completely non-functional.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:**\n        `5’-ATG TTT TAC...` (plus other changes)\n        This sequence contains multiple changes, such as `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine). These are **multiple missense mutations**. A full-length protein with several altered amino acids is produced. While more likely to be non-functional than a single missense mutation, it is still not as definitive as a premature stop codon.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:**\n        `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...`\n        Comparing the sequence to the intact one (`...GCT GGT ACT...` vs. `...GCT ACT...`) shows that the `GGT` codon has been deleted. This is an **in-frame deletion** of one amino acid (Glycine), likely combined with a missense mutation at the third codon. The rest of the protein's reading frame is preserved. This is less severe than a premature stop codon that eliminates the vast majority of the protein.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mutation in **Mutant 2** is a nonsense mutation that introduces a premature stop codon at the third position. This is the most severe and definitive mutation among the choices, as it guarantees the production of a severely truncated and non-functional protein. Therefore, this is the mutation that will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nMatching this conclusion with the provided options:\nA) Mutant 2\nB) Mutant 4\nC) Mutant 3\nD) Mutant 1\n\nThe correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Scientific Goal**\nThe main objective is to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. The gene provided is responsible for creating a protein that synthesizes this compound. Therefore, to stop the production of the compound, we need to find the mutation that is most likely to make the protein completely non-functional (a \"knockout\" or \"null\" mutation).\n\n**2. Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity**\nWe must determine which type of mutation will most probably result in a non-functional protein. The general order of severity for inactivating a protein is as follows:\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes a normal codon into a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis prematurely, creating a severely truncated and almost always non-functional protein. This is the most reliable way to knock out a gene's function.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases that is not divisible by three. This shifts the entire reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually creating a non-functional protein.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid for another. The effect is variable; it might disable the protein, or it might have little to no effect. It is not a guaranteed knockout.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Removes or adds one or more complete codons (a multiple of three bases). This alters the protein but is generally less severe than a nonsense or frameshift mutation, as the rest of the protein sequence is read correctly.\n\n**3. Analyze Each Mutant's Genetic Sequence**\nWe will compare each mutant to the intact gene by reading the DNA in three-base codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC ... -3’`\n    *   This translates to the protein sequence starting with: Methionine - Phenylalanine - Leucine ...\n    *   This is the functional protein we want to disable.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC ...-3’`\n    *   Change: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   Mutation Type: **Missense**. It results in a full-length protein with a single amino acid substitution. The effect on function is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA ...-3’`\n    *   Change: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`.\n    *   Mutation Type: **Nonsense**. The codon `TAA` is a **STOP codon**.\n    *   Effect: Protein synthesis will stop after the second amino acid. The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid-long fragment (Met-Phe). This peptide is guaranteed to be completely non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC...-3’`\n    *   Change: This contains a missense mutation changing the third codon `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine). It also has other changes downstream.\n    *   Mutation Type: **Multiple Missense**. A full-length protein is still produced. While disruptive, it is not as certain to cause complete inactivation as a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC...-3’`\n    *   Change: Aligning the sequence with the intact gene shows that the `GGT` codon is deleted. This is a 3-base deletion.\n    *   Mutation Type: **In-frame deletion**. It removes one amino acid from the protein but keeps the downstream reading frame intact. This is less severe than the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most destructive change. By introducing a STOP codon at the very beginning of the gene (the third codon), it ensures that a functional, full-length protein cannot be produced. This is the mutation that will *most probably* eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n**5. Match the Answer to the Options**\nThe correct choice is Mutant 2.

    "Based on the analysis of the provided answers and a thorough review of the scientific principles, here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the final correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Define the Goal**\n\nThe primary objective is to select the mutation that will *most probably* eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the gene in question. Therefore, the most reliable way to achieve this is to find the mutation that results in a completely non-functional protein, a \"knockout\" or \"null\" mutation.\n\n### **Step 2: Understand the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity**\n\nTo create a non-functional protein, some mutations are far more effective than others. We can rank them by their likelihood of causing a complete loss of function:\n\n1.  **Nonsense Mutation (Highest Severity):** This changes an amino acid-coding codon into a **STOP codon** (in DNA, these are `TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This action terminates protein synthesis prematurely. If this happens early in the gene's sequence, the resulting protein fragment is severely shortened and is virtually guaranteed to be non-functional.\n2.  **Frameshift Mutation (High Severity):** This is an insertion or deletion of a number of bases that is not a multiple of three. It shifts the entire \"reading frame,\" scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n3.  **In-frame Deletion/Insertion (Moderate Severity):** This removes or adds one or more complete amino acids but keeps the downstream reading frame intact. While disruptive, it's less certain to cause a complete loss of function than a nonsense mutation.\n4.  **Missense Mutation (Variable Severity):** This changes one amino acid to another. The effect is uncertain; it might have no impact, alter the function slightly, or completely inactivate the protein, but it is not a guaranteed knockout.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Mutant Sequences**\n\nWe must break down the DNA into three-base codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon, and compare each mutant to the intact gene.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC ... -3’`\n    *   This translates to the start of the functional protein: **Met - Phe - Leu ...**\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC ... -3’`\n    *   Change: `CTC` (Leucine) -> `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   Type: **Missense mutation**. A full-length protein is still produced. Its loss of function is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTTT ACG CTA CTT...-3’`\n    *   Change: Comparing to the intact gene (`...GCT GGT ACT...`), the `GGT` codon has been deleted.\n    *   Type: **In-frame deletion**. One amino acid is removed, but the rest of the protein sequence is preserved. This is less severe than a premature stop.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTTT ACG CTG GTG TCA...-3’`\n    *   Change: Contains several substitutions, resulting in **multiple missense mutations**. A full-length, though altered, protein is still produced. This is less certain to cause a knockout than a premature stop.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT ... -3’`\n    *   Change: `CTC` (Leucine) -> `TAA`.\n    *   Type: **Nonsense mutation**. The codon `TAA` is a **STOP codon**.\n    *   **Effect:** Protein synthesis will stop after just two amino acids. The resulting product is a tiny Met-Phe peptide fragment, which is **guaranteed to be non-functional**.\n\n### **Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nThe nonsense mutation found in **Mutant 2** is the most severe and definitive mutation among the choices. It introduces a STOP signal at the third position of the coding sequence, ensuring that a functional, full-length protein cannot be synthesized. This is the mutation that will *most probably* eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Answer Selection**\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identified Mutant 2 as the most effective mutation. The final step is to match this conclusion to the specific options provided in the question:\n\nA) Mutant 3\nB) Mutant 4\nC) Mutant 2\nD) Mutant 1\n\nThe correct answer, **Mutant 2**, corresponds to option **C**.\n\n<<<C>>>"

Therefore, the task is to identify the mutation that is most likely to result in a completely non-functional protein (a \"knockout\" or \"null\" mutation).\n\n**2. Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity**\nTo choose the most probable candidate, we must understand how different types of mutations affect protein function. The general hierarchy of severity, from most likely to least likely to cause a complete loss of function, is:\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid-coding codon to a STOP codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA). This halts protein synthesis prematurely, creating a truncated protein that is almost always non-functional, especially when the mutation occurs early in the gene.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three. This alters the reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Removes or adds one or more complete amino acids but keeps the downstream reading frame intact. This can disrupt function but is less certain than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid for another. The effect is variable; it may have no effect, a minor effect, or it could completely inactivate the protein. It is not a guaranteed knockout.\n\n**3. Analyze the DNA Sequences**\nWe must analyze the intact gene and each mutant at the codon level (three-base units), starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Translates to the amino acid sequence: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein we want to disable.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n    *   This sequence contains a change from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It creates a full-length protein with a substituted amino acid, which may or may not be functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC...-3’`\n    *   This sequence also contains a **missense mutation** changing `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine), among other changes. It still produces a full-length protein, making its loss of function uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   This sequence shows a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon. This is an **in-frame deletion**, as 3 bases are removed. It creates a protein that is one amino acid shorter and has one substitution, but the rest of the protein is unchanged. Its loss of function is not guaranteed.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    *   This sequence contains a change from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAA`.\n    *   `TAA` is a **STOP codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   **Effect**: Protein synthesis will terminate after the second amino acid. The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe). A severely truncated product like this is **guaranteed to be non-functional**.\n\n**4. Conclusion and Final Decision**\nThe nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe and definitive mutation among the choices. By introducing a STOP codon at the third position of the coding sequence, it ensures that a functional protein cannot be synthesized. This is the mutation that will most probably and most reliably achieve the goal of eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe options provided are:\nA) Mutant 2\nB) Mutant 3\nC) Mutant 1\nD) Mutant 4\n\nBased on our analysis, Mutant 2 is the correct choice. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer:\n\n**1. Understand the Scientific Goal**\nThe core task is to identify which mutation is most likely to eliminate the function of a gene that produces an anti-nutritional compound. Gene function is realized through the protein it codes for. Therefore, the goal is to find the mutation that most reliably creates a non-functional protein. This is often referred to as a \"knockout\" or \"null\" mutation.\n\n**2. Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Severity**\nThe effect of a mutation depends on how it alters the protein synthesis process. Here's a hierarchy of mutation severity in terms of causing a loss of protein function:\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** This changes an amino acid-coding codon into a stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA). It causes protein synthesis to halt prematurely. An early nonsense mutation results in a severely shortened (truncated) protein that is almost guaranteed to be non-functional.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three. This shifts the entire \"reading frame,\" scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually leading to a premature stop codon. This is also highly likely to cause a loss of function.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** This substitutes one amino acid for another. The effect is uncertain. It might have no effect, or it could be catastrophic, but it's not a guaranteed knockout.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** This removes or adds one or more full codons (multiples of three bases). This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein's sequence intact. This is less severe than a frameshift or early nonsense mutation.\n\n**3. Analyze the Provided Gene Sequences**\nWe must break down the DNA sequence into three-base codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon, to see the impact of each mutation.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Translation: `ATG` (Methionine), `TTT` (Phenylalanine), `CTC` (Leucine).\n    *   The functional protein starts with the amino acid sequence: Met-Phe-Leu...\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n    *   The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It creates a full-length protein with one different amino acid, which may or may not be functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    *   The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAA`.\n    *   `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   Effect: Protein synthesis will stop after the second amino acid. The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe), which is guaranteed to be completely non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC...-3’`\n    *   This mutant has multiple changes, including the same missense mutation as Mutant 1 (`CTC` -> `TAC`). These are **multiple missense mutations**. While more disruptive than one change, a full-length protein is still produced, so a knockout is not guaranteed.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TACGCTACT...-3’`\n    *   Alignment with the intact sequence (`...CTCGCTGGTACT...` vs. `...TACGCTACT...`) shows a change of `CTC` to `TAC` (missense) and a deletion of the codon `GGT`. This is an **in-frame deletion**. It removes one amino acid while changing another, but the reading frame for the rest of the protein remains intact. The effect is less severe than a premature stop codon.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most severe and most certain to achieve the desired goal. By introducing a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the gene (the third codon), it ensures that a functional protein cannot be produced. The resulting truncated product will be completely inactive.\n\n**5. Match to the Correct Option**\nThe analysis confirms that Mutant 2 is the correct answer.

Understand the Scientific Goal**\nThe core task is to find a mutation that will most probably eliminate an unwanted anti-nutritional compound. The problem states that a protein, encoded by the given gene, is responsible for synthesizing this compound. Therefore, to eliminate the compound, we need to eliminate the function of the protein. The most effective way to do this is to introduce a \"knockout\" or \"null\" mutation that prevents the formation of a functional protein.\n\n**2. Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity**\nDifferent types of mutations have different impacts on the final protein. In terms of reliably causing a complete loss of function, the general order from most severe to least severe is:\n\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** This changes an amino acid-coding codon into a STOP codon (in DNA, these are `TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). This causes protein synthesis to halt prematurely, producing a severely truncated protein fragment that is almost certainly non-functional, especially if it occurs early in the gene.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases that is not a multiple of three. This shifts the entire reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually creating a non-functional protein.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** This changes one amino acid to another. The effect is uncertain; it might have no effect, alter the function, or completely destroy it, but it is not a guaranteed knockout.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** This removes or adds one or more complete amino acids without altering the downstream reading frame. This is less severe than a frameshift or early nonsense mutation.\n\nThe goal is to find the mutation with the highest probability of knocking out the function, making the nonsense mutation the prime candidate to look for.\n\n**3. Analyze the Gene Sequences**\nThe cellular machinery reads the gene's DNA in three-base units called codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT ... -3’`\n    *   Translation: The first three amino acids are `ATG` (Methionine), `TTT` (Phenylalanine), and `CTC` (Leucine). This forms the beginning of the functional protein.\n\nNow, we evaluate each mutant:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT ... -3’`\n    *   The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It produces a full-length protein with one substituted amino acid. The loss of function is not guaranteed.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT ... -3’`\n    *   The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), has been changed to `TAA`.\n    *   `TAA` is a **STOP codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   **Effect:** Protein synthesis will terminate after the second amino acid. The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide fragment. This is guaranteed to be completely non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ... -3’`\n    *   This sequence also contains a change from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine), among other changes further down. This represents **multiple missense mutations**. While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, a full-length protein is still produced, and a loss of function is not as certain as with Mutant 2.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TACGCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   This mutation involves a change from `CTC` to `TAC` (missense) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon. This is a combination of a missense mutation and an **in-frame deletion**. This removes one amino acid from the protein but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. The disruption is less severe than a premature stop codon.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\nThe nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe and definitive mutation among the choices. It introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the coding sequence, ensuring that a functional, full-length protein cannot be synthesized. This is the mutation that will *most probably* eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nAccording to the provided options:\nA) Mutant 4\nB) Mutant 3\nC) Mutant 2\nD) Mutant 1\n\nThe correct answer is Mutant 2, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\n**Step-by-step analysis of the problem:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to find a mutation that is most likely to eliminate the synthesis of an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is produced by a protein encoded by the target gene. Therefore, the goal is to find the mutation that will most probably result in a non-functional protein (a \"knockout\" or \"null\" mutation).\n\n2.  **Understand the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity:** To reliably create a non-functional protein, certain mutations are more effective than others. The order of severity, from most likely to least likely to cause a complete loss of function, is:\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid-coding codon into a stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA). This halts protein synthesis prematurely, producing a short, truncated protein that is almost guaranteed to be non-functional, especially if it occurs early in the gene.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion (indel) of a number of bases not divisible by three. This shifts the reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually creating a non-functional protein.\n    *   **In-frame Indel:** An indel of a number of bases that is a multiple of three. This removes or adds one or more amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein's reading frame intact. This alters the protein but is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than the above mutations.\n    *   **Missense Mutation:** Changes a single amino acid. The effect is variable and not guaranteed to disable the protein.\n\n3.  **Analyze the DNA Sequences by Codon:** We must read the DNA sequence in three-base units (codons) starting from the `ATG` start codon to see the effect on the resulting amino acid sequence.\n\n    *   **Intact gene:** `ATG TTT CTC GCT...` -> This translates to Met-Phe-Leu-Ala... This is the functional protein we want to disable.\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** `ATG TTC TAC GCT...`\n        *   Change: The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). (Note: The TTT to TTC change is silent, as both code for Phenylalanine).\n        *   Mutation Type: **Missense mutation**. This produces a full-length protein with a substituted amino acid. This is not a guaranteed knockout.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** `ATG TTC TAA GCT...`\n        *   Change: The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAA`.\n        *   Mutation Type: `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **Nonsense mutation**.\n        *   Effect: Protein synthesis will stop after the second amino acid. The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid fragment (Met-Phe). This is guaranteed to be completely non-functional.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** `ATG TTT TAC GCT...`\n        *   Change: Contains multiple missense mutations (e.g., `CTC` to `TAC`).\n        *   Mutation Type: **Multiple missense mutations**. A full-length protein with altered amino acids is still produced. Its loss of function is less certain than that from a nonsense mutation.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** `ATG TTT TACGCT ACT...`\n        *   Change: Comparison with the intact gene shows the codon `GGT` has been deleted.\n        *   Mutation Type: **In-frame deletion**. It removes one amino acid (Glycine) but does not alter the reading frame for the rest of the protein. This is less severe than a nonsense mutation.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The analysis reveals that every candidate agent correctly identified that Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon (a nonsense mutation). This type of mutation, occurring so early in the gene, is the most certain way to prevent the synthesis of a functional protein. Therefore, it is the mutation most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n5.  **Final Answer Mapping:** The unanimous conclusion from the reasoning of all candidate answers is that **Mutant 2** is the correct choice.

This compound is produced by a protein, which is encoded by the gene in question. Therefore, the goal is to find the mutation most likely to result in a completely non-functional protein, a \"knockout\" or \"null\" mutation.\n\n2.  **Understand Gene Translation and Mutation Impact:** The genetic code is read in three-base units called codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon. The effect of a mutation depends on how it alters the protein sequence. We can rank mutations by the severity of their impact on protein function:\n    *   **Most Severe:** A **nonsense mutation**, which changes a codon for an amino acid into a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This terminates protein synthesis prematurely. If this happens early in the sequence, the resulting protein fragment is almost certainly non-functional.\n    *   **Also Very Severe:** A **frameshift mutation** (insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by 3). This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence.\n    *   **Less Severe:** **Missensense mutations** (which change one amino acid to another) and **in-frame deletions/insertions** (which add or remove entire amino acids). These alter the protein but are less certain to cause a complete loss of function, as a full-length (or near full-length) protein is still produced.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Intact Gene Sequence:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   The first three codons translate to the amino acids: Methionine (Met) - Phenylalanine (Phe) - Leucine (Leu). This is the beginning of the functional protein.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Each Mutant's Sequence:**\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n        The change is from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It changes a single amino acid. The protein is still made to its full length, and its function might be reduced, unchanged, or eliminated. The outcome is uncertain.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n        The change is from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. Protein synthesis will halt after the second amino acid, creating a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (`Met-Phe`). This is guaranteed to be a non-functional product.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT...-3’`\n        The change is from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine), with other changes downstream. These are **multiple missense mutations**. While more disruptive than a single change, a full-length protein is still synthesized, so the effect remains less certain than a premature stop.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TACGCT ACT...-3’`\n        By aligning with the original sequence, we can see the `GGT` codon is deleted. This is an **in-frame deletion**, which removes one amino acid but keeps the downstream reading frame intact. The effect is less severe and less certain than a nonsense mutation.\n\n5.  **Synthesize and Conclude:** The nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most destructive type of mutation presented. By creating a stop codon at the third position in the sequence, it guarantees that a functional protein cannot be synthesized. This is the most reliable way among the given options to eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n6.  **Match to Final Options:** The question lists the options as:\n    *   A) Mutant 2\n    *   B) Mutant 1\n    *   C) Mutant 3\n    *   D) Mutant 4\n\n    Since Mutant 2 is the correct choice, the corresponding answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal**: The primary objective is to find the mutation that is most likely to make the protein produced by the gene non-functional. A non-functional protein will not be able to synthesize the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n2.  **Understand Protein Synthesis and Mutations**: The gene sequence is read starting from the `ATG` start codon in groups of three DNA bases, called codons. Each codon codes for a specific amino acid, except for three special \"stop codons\" (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`) that terminate protein synthesis. The most effective way to \"knock out\" a gene's function is to introduce a mutation that prevents a full, functional protein from being made. The severity of different mutation types is generally as follows:\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation (Most Severe for Knockout):** Changes a normal codon into a stop codon. This halts protein synthesis prematurely, creating a short, non-functional protein fragment. An early nonsense mutation is almost guaranteed to be a knockout.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation (Very Severe):** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three. This shifts the reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually resulting in a non-functional protein.\n    *   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion (Less Severe):** Deletes or inserts a complete codon (3 bases). This removes or adds an amino acid but keeps the rest of the protein's reading frame intact. The function might be altered or lost, but it's not as certain as a nonsense mutation.\n    *   **Missense Mutation (Variable Severity):** Changes one amino acid to another. This may or may not impact the protein's function, depending on the importance of that specific amino acid.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Intact and Mutant Sequences**: Let's break down the DNA sequences into codons and compare them.\n    *   **Intact Gene**: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n        *   This sequence codes for the start of the functional protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n\n    *   **Mutant 1**: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n        *   Change: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n        *   Mutation Type: **Missense**. It creates a full-length protein with a single amino acid substitution. The loss of function is not guaranteed.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4**: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n        *   Change: A comparison with the full intact gene shows a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`) and a deletion of the fifth codon, `GGT`.\n        *   Mutation Type: **In-frame deletion** plus a missense mutation. This removes one amino acid and changes another. The protein is nearly full-length and might still be functional.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3**: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n        *   Change: There are multiple substitutions, such as `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n        *   Mutation Type: **Multiple Missense**. A full-length protein with several changes is made. This is more disruptive than Mutant 1, but loss of function is still less certain than a premature stop.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2**: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n        *   Change: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`.\n        *   Mutation Type: **Nonsense**. The codon `TAA` is a **STOP codon**.\n        *   Effect: Protein synthesis will be terminated at this point. The resulting product will be a tiny peptide of only two amino acids (Met-Phe). This severely truncated product is guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: The nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most catastrophic for protein synthesis. By introducing a stop codon at the very beginning of the sequence (the third codon), it ensures that a functional protein cannot be produced. This is the mutation that will *most probably* eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n5.  **Final Answer Selection**: The correct mutation is found in Mutant 2. Looking at the options provided:\n    A) Mutant 2\n    B) Mutant 1\n    C) Mutant 4\n    D) Mutant 3\n\nThe correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Objective:** The task is to find the mutation that will *most probably* eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. The problem states this compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by a specific gene. Therefore, the most reliable way to achieve the goal is to introduce a mutation that results in a completely non-functional protein (a \"knockout\" or \"null\" mutation).\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity:** To reliably create a non-functional protein, certain mutations are more effective than others. The general order of severity, from most likely to least likely to cause a complete loss of function, is:\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes a normal codon into a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis prematurely. An early nonsense mutation is the most certain way to produce a non-functional, truncated protein.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three. This shifts the reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually creating a non-functional protein.\n    *   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Removes or adds one or more complete amino acids but keeps the downstream reading frame intact. This alters the protein but is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n    *   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid for another. The effect is highly variable and not a guaranteed knockout.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Gene Sequences by Codon:** We must analyze the DNA sequences in three-base units (codons) starting from the `ATG` start codon to understand their effect on the protein sequence.\n\n    *   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n        *   Protein Translation: **Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...** (This is the functional protein we want to disable).\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n        *   Change: `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n        *   Mutation Type: **Missense**. This produces a full-length protein with one different amino acid. Its function is uncertain.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n        *   Change: `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`.\n        *   Mutation Type: **Nonsense**. The codon `TAA` is a **STOP codon**.\n        *   Effect: Protein synthesis will terminate after the second amino acid. The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (`Met-Phe`). This is guaranteed to be completely non-functional.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC...-3’`\n        *   Change: `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), plus other substitutions are present downstream.\n        *   Mutation Type: **Multiple Missense**. A full-length protein with several altered amino acids is still produced. Its inactivation is not as certain as that from a premature stop codon.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TACGCT...-3’`\n        *   Change: A careful comparison reveals the codon `GGT` is deleted.\n        *   Mutation Type: **In-frame deletion**. This removes one amino acid (Glycine) but preserves the downstream reading frame. This is less severe than a premature stop codon.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The consensus of all candidate agents is correct in its reasoning. The nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most severe and definitive mutation among the choices. It introduces a stop codon at the third position of the coding sequence, ensuring that a functional, full-length protein cannot be synthesized. This is the most probable mutation to successfully eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n5.  **Final Answer Mapping:** The question maps the mutants to the options as follows:\n    *   A) Mutant 1\n    *   B) Mutant 2\n    *   C) Mutant 3\n    *   D) Mutant 4\n\nSince the correct choice is Mutant 2, the corresponding answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe core task is to identify which mutation is most likely to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein, which is encoded by the gene in question. Therefore, the goal is to find the mutation that most reliably creates a non-functional (\"knockout\") protein.\n\n**2. Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Severity**\nTo predict the outcome, we must understand the impact of different mutation types on protein synthesis:\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid-coding codon into a stop codon (e.g., `TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). This causes protein synthesis to stop prematurely. A nonsense mutation early in a gene is the most reliable way to produce a severely truncated and non-functional protein.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases that is not a multiple of three. This shifts the entire reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids. This is also very likely to produce a non-functional protein.\n*   **Missensense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid to another. The effect is variable; it might be harmless or it might destroy protein function, but it is not a guaranteed knockout.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Removes or adds a full codon (3 bases). This removes or adds one or more amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein's reading frame intact. This is generally less disruptive than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\nThe question asks what will *most probably* eliminate the compound, which points us to the most severe and predictable mutation type.\n\n**3. Analyze the Gene Sequences**\nThe translation process reads the DNA in three-base codons, starting from `ATG`.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT...-3’`\n    *   The first three codons translate to the amino acid sequence: Methionine - Phenylalanine - Leucine...\n    *   This sequence produces the functional protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n    *   The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   **Type:** This is a **missense mutation**. The outcome is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    *   The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), has been changed to `TAA`.\n    *   **Type:** The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   **Effect:** Protein synthesis will halt after only two amino acids are joined. The resulting product is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide, which is guaranteed to be completely non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC...-3’`\n    *   This also contains a change from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine), along with other changes further down.\n    *   **Type:** Multiple **missense mutations**. While more disruptive than one, this is still less certain to be a knockout than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TACGCTACTT...-3’`\n    *   A careful comparison with the intact sequence shows that the `GGT` codon has been deleted.\n    *   **Type:** This is an **in-frame deletion** (a 3-base deletion). This removes one amino acid. The effect is disruptive but less severe than the nonsense mutation.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe mutation in Mutant 2 is a nonsense mutation that introduces a stop codon at the very beginning of the protein sequence. This is the most catastrophic event for protein synthesis among the given options. It is the most reliable and probable way to ensure a non-functional gene product, thereby eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nTherefore, Mutant 2 is the correct answer. According to the options provided:\nA) Mutant 3\nB) Mutant 1\nC) Mutant 4\nD) Mutant 2\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Goal:** The primary objective is to select the mutation that is *most probably* going to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. The problem states that this compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the gene in question. Therefore, the most reliable way to achieve the goal is to introduce a mutation that makes the protein non-functional (a \"knockout\" or \"null\" mutation).\n\n2.  **Understand the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity:** To reliably create a non-functional protein, some mutations are far more effective than others. The general order of severity for inactivating a protein is:\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes a normal codon for an amino acid into a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis prematurely, producing a truncated (shortened) and almost always non-functional protein. A stop codon early in the sequence is devastating to function.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three. This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n    *   **Missense Mutation / In-frame Deletion:** A missense mutation changes one amino acid to another. An in-frame deletion removes one or more complete amino acids. These mutations alter the protein but do not guarantee a complete loss of function; the protein might still be partially or even fully functional.\n\n3.  **Analyze Each Mutant Sequence:** We will break down the DNA into three-base codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon, and compare each mutant to the intact gene.\n\n    *   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC ... -3’`\n        *   Translation: The protein begins with Methionine (Met) - Phenylalanine (Phe) - Leucine (Leu) ... This is the functional protein we want to disable.\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC ...-3’`\n        *   Change: The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n        *   Type: **Missense mutation**. This results in a full-length protein with a single amino acid substitution. The effect is uncertain.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA ...-3’`\n        *   Change: The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAA`.\n        *   Type: **Nonsense mutation**. The codon `TAA` is a **STOP codon**.\n        *   Effect: Protein synthesis will terminate after the second amino acid. The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid-long peptide (Met-Phe). This severely truncated fragment is guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC ...-3’`\n        *   Change: The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and other changes occur downstream.\n        *   Type: **Multiple Missense mutations**. While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it is still less certain to be a complete knockout than the guaranteed premature stop in Mutant 2.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n        *   Change: When aligned with the intact sequence (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), this mutant has a missense change (`CTC` to `TAC`) and has deleted the `GGT` codon.\n        *   Type: **In-frame deletion** (removing one amino acid) combined with a missense mutation. The reading frame for the rest of the protein is maintained. The effect on function is significant but less definitively catastrophic than an early stop codon.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most severe and definitive mutation among the choices. It introduces a STOP signal at the third position of the coding sequence, ensuring that a functional, full-length protein cannot be synthesized. This is the mutation that will *most probably* eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n5.  **Final Answer Selection:** Based on the analysis, Mutant 2 is the correct answer. The options are:\n    A) Mutant 2\n    B) Mutant 4\n    C) Mutant 3\n    D) Mutant 1\n\n    The correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Goal of the Task**\nThe core objective is to find which mutation will *most probably* eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is produced by a protein encoded by the given gene. Therefore, the goal is to identify the mutation that is most likely to create a non-functional or \"knockout\" protein, thus stopping the compound's synthesis.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Types of Mutations and Their Severity**\nTo determine which mutation is most likely to be a knockout, we must understand the effects of different mutation types:\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes a codon that codes for an amino acid into a **stop codon** (e.g., TAA, TAG, TGA). This causes protein synthesis to halt prematurely, producing a truncated (shortened) protein. If this occurs early in the gene, the resulting protein fragment is almost guaranteed to be non-functional. This is a very severe and effective way to knock out a gene.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases that is not a multiple of three. This shifts the entire reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually leading to a premature stop codon by chance. This is also a very severe mutation.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid for another. The effect is variable; it might destroy the protein's function if the amino acid is in a critical location, but it might also have little or no effect. It is not a guaranteed knockout.\n*   **In-frame Deletion:** A deletion of three bases (or a multiple of three). This removes one or more amino acids from the protein chain but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. The effect is less severe than a frameshift or early nonsense mutation.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Each Mutant Sequence**\nWe will analyze the DNA sequence in three-base units (codons) starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Translates to the amino acid sequence: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This is the functional protein we want to disable.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n    *   The third codon, `CTC` (which codes for Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (which codes for Tyrosine).\n    *   **Mutation Type:** This is a **missense mutation**. It creates a full-length protein with a single amino acid substitution. This is not a guaranteed way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    *   The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAA`.\n    *   **Mutation Type:** `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   **Effect:** Protein synthesis will stop after the second amino acid. The result will be a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe), which is **guaranteed to be completely non-functional**.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCTGGT...-3’`\n    *   This sequence contains at least one **missense mutation**, changing `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and other changes downstream. Like Mutant 1, a full-length (but altered) protein is produced, and a loss of function is not guaranteed.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TACGCTACT...-3’`\n    *   When compared to the intact gene, this sequence shows a deletion of the `GGT` codon.\n    *   **Mutation Type:** This is an **in-frame deletion**. It removes one amino acid (Glycine) but does not shift the reading frame. This is less disruptive than a nonsense mutation that halts the entire process.\n\n### **Step 4: Conclude and Select the Best Option**\nThe analysis shows that the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe and definitive among the choices. It introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the coding sequence, ensuring that a functional protein cannot be synthesized. This is the mutation that will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nTherefore, Mutant 2 is the correct answer. The options are:\nA) Mutant 2\nB) Mutant 3\nC) Mutant 1\nD) Mutant 4\n\nThe correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Goal\nThe main objective is to find a mutation that will *most probably* eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the gene in question. Therefore, the most reliable way to achieve this is to find a mutation that creates a non-functional protein, a process often referred to as creating a \"knockout\" or \"null\" allele.\n\n### 2. Understand the Types and Severity of Mutations\nTo choose the most probable mutation for creating a non-functional protein, we must understand the typical impact of different mutation types. The ranking from most likely to least likely to cause a complete loss of function is generally:\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid-coding codon into a stop codon (e.g., TAA, TAG, TGA). This causes protein synthesis to halt prematurely, producing a severely shortened (truncated) protein. If this occurs early in the gene, as is the case here, the resulting fragment is almost guaranteed to be non-functional.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion (indel) of a number of nucleotides not divisible by three. This alters the reading frame for all subsequent codons, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a premature stop codon. This is also highly likely to result in a non-functional protein.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes a single amino acid. The effect is uncertain and can range from no impact to complete loss of function, depending on the importance of that specific amino acid. It is not a guaranteed knockout.\n*   **In-frame Deletion:** A deletion of nucleotides in a multiple of three (e.g., deleting a whole codon). This removes one or more amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein's reading frame intact. While this alters the protein, it is generally less severe than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n### 3. Analyze the Intact Gene and the Mutants\nWe will now analyze each sequence by breaking it into three-base codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   This translates to the amino acid sequence: **Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...** This produces the functional protein we want to disable.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC...-3’`\n    *   Change: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   Mutation Type: **Missense**. This produces a full-length protein with a single amino acid change. The outcome is not guaranteed.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC...-3’`\n    *   Change: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   Mutation Type: **Missense**. Similar to Mutant 1, this outcome is not guaranteed.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACTT...-3’`\n    *   Change: Comparison with the intact gene shows the `GGT` codon has been deleted.\n    *   Mutation Type: **In-frame deletion**. This removes one amino acid (Glycine) but keeps the rest of the protein intact. The effect on function is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA...-3’`\n    *   Change: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`.\n    *   Mutation Type: **Nonsense**. The codon **`TAA` is a stop codon.**\n    *   Effect: Protein synthesis will terminate after the second amino acid (Phenylalanine). The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid-long fragment. A protein this severely truncated is guaranteed to be completely non-functional.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nThe nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most severe and definitive mutation among the choices. It introduces a premature stop codon at the third position in the coding sequence, ensuring that a functional, full-length protein cannot be synthesized. This is the mutation that will *most probably* eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n### 5. Match to the Correct Option\nThe question asks us to select the final option letter.\n*   A) Mutant 1\n*   B) Mutant 3\n*   C) Mutant 4\n*   D) Mutant 2\n\nThe correct answer is Mutant 2, which corresponds to option **D**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n**Detailed Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Objective Identification:** The core task is to identify which mutation among the four options is most likely to render the protein non-functional. The gene in question synthesizes an anti-nutritional compound, so a non-functional protein will eliminate this compound.\n\n2.  **Scientific Principle - Hierarchy of Mutation Severity:** To achieve a \"knockout\" (a non-functional gene product), certain types of mutations are more effective than others. The order of severity, from most likely to least likely to cause complete loss of function, is:\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino-acid-coding codon into a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis prematurely, creating a short, truncated protein that is almost guaranteed to be non-functional, especially if the stop codon appears early in the sequence.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of DNA bases that is not a multiple of three. This shifts the entire reading frame, scrambling all downstream amino acids and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n    *   **Missense Mutation / In-frame Deletion:** A missense mutation changes a single amino acid. An in-frame deletion removes one or more complete amino acids but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. These mutations alter the protein but are less likely to cause a complete and certain loss of function compared to a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Gene Sequences:** We must analyze the DNA in three-base units (codons) starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n    *   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT...-3’`\n        *   This translates to the amino acid sequence: Methionine - Phenylalanine - Leucine - Alanine... This is the functional protein we aim to disable.\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n        *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n        *   **Type:** This is a **missense mutation**. It produces a full-length protein with one different amino acid. This is not a guaranteed knockout.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n        *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`.\n        *   **Type:** The codon `TAA` is a **STOP codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n        *   **Effect:** Protein synthesis will halt after the second amino acid. The result will be a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide fragment. This is guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC...GTC...-3’`\n        *   This sequence contains multiple amino acid substitutions.\n        *   **Type:** **Multiple missense mutations**. A full-length protein is still produced, and while the multiple changes make it more likely to be non-functional than Mutant 1, it is still less certain than the guaranteed truncation in Mutant 2.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n        *   Comparison to the intact gene shows the `GGT` codon has been deleted.\n        *   **Type:** This is an **in-frame deletion** (removing a single amino acid). The reading frame is maintained, and the rest of the protein is synthesized. This is less severe than a nonsense mutation.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe and definitive. It introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the protein sequence. This ensures that a functional, full-length protein cannot be synthesized. Therefore, this mutation is the most probable to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n5.  **Matching with Options:**\n    *   The question lists the options as:\n        A) Mutant 1\n        B) Mutant 3\n        C) Mutant 4\n        D) Mutant 2\n    *   Our conclusion is that Mutant 2 is the correct answer. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe user wants a final decision based on the provided answers from other agents. I will first perform my own step-by-step analysis of the problem and then compare it with the candidate answers to reach a final, robust conclusion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Task:** The main goal is to find which mutation will *most probably* eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by the gene in question. Therefore, the most reliable way to achieve this is to create a mutation that results in a completely non-functional protein (a \"knockout\" or \"null\" mutation).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity:** To make a protein non-functional, some mutations are more effective than others. The order of severity in terms of causing a guaranteed loss of function is typically:\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes a normal codon into a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis prematurely, creating a short, truncated protein. If this occurs early in the gene, the resulting protein fragment is almost certainly non-functional. This is a very probable way to create a knockout.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three. This shifts the reading frame, scrambling all downstream amino acids and usually creating a non-functional protein.\n    *   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Removes or adds one or more complete amino acids (a number of bases divisible by 3). This alters the protein but is less severe than a frameshift or nonsense mutation, as the rest of the protein sequence is translated correctly.\n    *   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid for another. The effect is variable; it can be harmless, alter function, or completely inactivate the protein. It is not a guaranteed way to create a knockout.\n\n3.  **Break Down the Gene Sequences into Codons:** We must read the DNA in three-base units (codons), starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n    *   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n        *   This translates to the amino acid sequence: **Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...** This is the functional protein we want to disable.\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n        *   Change: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). Note: The change from `TTT` to `TTC` is a silent mutation, as both code for Phenylalanine.\n        *   Type: This is a **missense mutation**. A full-length protein is produced with one amino acid change. Its function is uncertain.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n        *   Change: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`.\n        *   Type: The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n        *   Effect: Protein synthesis will terminate after the second amino acid. The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (`Met-Phe`), which is guaranteed to be completely non-functional. This is the most reliable way to eliminate the protein's function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n        *   Change: This sequence has multiple changes, resulting in **multiple missense mutations** (e.g., Leucine to Tyrosine). A full-length protein is still produced, and its inactivation is not as certain as with a nonsense mutation.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n        *   Change: By comparing the sequence to the intact gene (`...GCT GGT ACT...` vs `...GCT ACT...`), we can see that the codon `GGT` has been deleted.\n        *   Type: This is a 3-base-pair deletion, which is an **in-frame deletion**. It removes one amino acid (Glycine) but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. This is less severe than the nonsense mutation.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most severe and definitive. By introducing a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the coding sequence, it guarantees that a functional protein cannot be synthesized. This is the most probable mutation to achieve the desired goal of eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n5.  **Final Answer Selection:** Based on the analysis, Mutant 2 is the correct answer. Now, we match this to the options provided in the question:\n    A) Mutant 4\n    B) Mutant 1\n    C) **Mutant 2**\n    D) Mutant 3\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe task is to determine which of the given mutations will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound produced by a gene. This is achieved by finding the mutation most likely to render the encoded protein non-functional.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Goal:** The goal is to \"knock out\" the function of the protein encoded by the target gene. The most effective way to do this is to introduce a mutation that prevents the synthesis of a full-length, functional protein.\n\n2.  **Understand Mutation Severity:** Different types of mutations have different impacts on protein function. The hierarchy of severity, in terms of causing a complete loss of function, is generally as follows:\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** Introduces a premature STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis, resulting in a truncated and almost always non-functional protein. A nonsense mutation early in the sequence is the most reliable way to create a null allele.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three. This shifts the reading frame, scrambling the entire downstream amino acid sequence and typically resulting in a non-functional protein.\n    *   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Removes or adds one or more complete amino acids. This can be disruptive but is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n    *   **Missense Mutation:** Substitutes one amino acid for another. The effect is variable; it may have no effect, or it could completely disable the protein, but it is not a guaranteed \"knockout.\"\n\n3.  **Analyze the Intact and Mutant Sequences:** Let's break down the DNA sequences into three-base codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon, and determine the effect of each mutation.\n\n    *   **Intact Gene:**\n        `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n        This translates to the beginning of the functional protein: **Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...**\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:**\n        `5’-ATG TTC TAC...-3’`\n        The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It produces a full-length protein with a single amino acid substitution. The protein may or may not be functional.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:**\n        `5’-ATG TTC TAA...-3’`\n        The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **STOP codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n        *   **Effect**: Protein synthesis will terminate after the second amino acid. The result will be a tiny, two-amino-acid-long fragment (Met-Phe). This is guaranteed to be completely non-functional.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:**\n        `5’-ATG TTT TAC...` (plus other changes)\n        This sequence contains multiple changes, such as `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine). These are **multiple missense mutations**. A full-length protein with several altered amino acids is produced. While more likely to be non-functional than a single missense mutation, it is still not as definitive as a premature stop codon.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:**\n        `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...`\n        Comparing the sequence to the intact one (`...GCT GGT ACT...` vs. `...GCT ACT...`) shows that the `GGT` codon has been deleted. This is an **in-frame deletion** of one amino acid (Glycine), likely combined with a missense mutation at the third codon. The rest of the protein's reading frame is preserved. This is less severe than a premature stop codon that eliminates the vast majority of the protein.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mutation in **Mutant 2** is a nonsense mutation that introduces a premature stop codon at the third position. This is the most severe and definitive mutation among the choices, as it guarantees the production of a severely truncated and non-functional protein. Therefore, this is the mutation that will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nMatching this conclusion with the provided options:\nA) Mutant 2\nB) Mutant 4\nC) Mutant 3\nD) Mutant 1\n\nThe correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Scientific Goal**\nThe main objective is to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. The gene provided is responsible for creating a protein that synthesizes this compound. Therefore, to stop the production of the compound, we need to find the mutation that is most likely to make the protein completely non-functional (a \"knockout\" or \"null\" mutation).\n\n**2. Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity**\nWe must determine which type of mutation will most probably result in a non-functional protein. The general order of severity for inactivating a protein is as follows:\n*   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes a normal codon into a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis prematurely, creating a severely truncated and almost always non-functional protein. This is the most reliable way to knock out a gene's function.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases that is not divisible by three. This shifts the entire reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually creating a non-functional protein.\n*   **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid for another. The effect is variable; it might disable the protein, or it might have little to no effect. It is not a guaranteed knockout.\n*   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Removes or adds one or more complete codons (a multiple of three bases). This alters the protein but is generally less severe than a nonsense or frameshift mutation, as the rest of the protein sequence is read correctly.\n\n**3. Analyze Each Mutant's Genetic Sequence**\nWe will compare each mutant to the intact gene by reading the DNA in three-base codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC ... -3’`\n    *   This translates to the protein sequence starting with: Methionine - Phenylalanine - Leucine ...\n    *   This is the functional protein we want to disable.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC ...-3’`\n    *   Change: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   Mutation Type: **Missense**. It results in a full-length protein with a single amino acid substitution. The effect on function is uncertain.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA ...-3’`\n    *   Change: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`.\n    *   Mutation Type: **Nonsense**. The codon `TAA` is a **STOP codon**.\n    *   Effect: Protein synthesis will stop after the second amino acid. The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid-long fragment (Met-Phe). This peptide is guaranteed to be completely non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC...-3’`\n    *   Change: This contains a missense mutation changing the third codon `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine). It also has other changes downstream.\n    *   Mutation Type: **Multiple Missense**. A full-length protein is still produced. While disruptive, it is not as certain to cause complete inactivation as a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC...-3’`\n    *   Change: Aligning the sequence with the intact gene shows that the `GGT` codon is deleted. This is a 3-base deletion.\n    *   Mutation Type: **In-frame deletion**. It removes one amino acid from the protein but keeps the downstream reading frame intact. This is less severe than the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most destructive change. By introducing a STOP codon at the very beginning of the gene (the third codon), it ensures that a functional, full-length protein cannot be produced. This is the mutation that will *most probably* eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n**5. Match the Answer to the Options**\nThe correct choice is Mutant 2.
