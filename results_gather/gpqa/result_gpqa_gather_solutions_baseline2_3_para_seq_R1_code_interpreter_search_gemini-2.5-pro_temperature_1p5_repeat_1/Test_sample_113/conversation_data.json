A ketone's carbonyl group (C=O) is converted to a carbon with both a hydroxyl (-OH) group and a nitrile (-CN) group.\n*   **Mechanism**: The reaction involves two key steps.\n    1.  The cyanide ion (CN⁻), a strong nucleophile from NaCN, attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms a negatively charged alkoxide intermediate.\n    2.  This alkoxide intermediate must be protonated to form the final stable product with a neutral hydroxyl group.\n*   **Role of Reagent A**: Reagent A must provide a proton (H⁺) to complete the reaction.\n*   **Evaluating Options for A**:\n    *   `H₃O⁺` (hydronium ion) represents an aqueous acidic solution, which is the standard source of protons for this type of protonation step.

The cyanide ion (`CN⁻`) from `NaCN` acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbon of the carbonyl group in butan-2-one.\n    2.  This forms a negatively charged tetrahedral intermediate called an alkoxide (`CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃`).\n    3.

A ketone is converted into a molecule containing both a hydroxyl (-OH) and a nitrile (-CN) group on the same carbon.\n*   **Mechanism:** The reaction has two key steps. First, the nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one, creating a negatively charged alkoxide intermediate. Second, this intermediate must be protonated to form the stable, neutral hydroxyl group in the final product.\n*   **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent A's function is to be the proton source. Comparing the options, `H₃O⁺` represents an acidic aqueous solution and is the standard reagent used to provide protons for this step. `NaHSO₃` is incorrect as it participates in a different type of addition reaction.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Reagent A must be **H₃O⁺**.\n\n### Analysis of Reaction 2\n*   **Reaction:** `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`\n*   **Process:** This reaction shows the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is known as **nitrile hydrolysis**.\n*   **Mechanism:** The hydrolysis of a nitrile requires water and a strong catalyst (either a strong acid or a strong base), usually with heat.\n*   **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B serves as the catalyst. We must compare the given options, `HCl` and `CH₃COOH`. `HCl` is a strong acid and is a highly effective catalyst for this transformation. `CH₃COOH` is a weak acid and is generally not potent enough to catalyze the complete hydrolysis of a nitrile efficiently.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Reagent B must be the strong acid, **HCl**.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe correct pair of reagents is:\n*   A = **H₃O⁺**\n*   B = **HCl**\n\nMatching this result with the provided options:\nA) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH\nB) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH\nC) A = H3O+, B = HCl\nD) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reagents for the given chemical reactions.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile`\n*   **Type:** This reaction is a **cyanohydrin formation**. It starts with a ketone (butan-2-one) and forms a product that has both a hydroxyl (-OH) and a nitrile (-CN) group on the same carbon.\n*   **Mechanism:** The reaction occurs in two key steps:\n    1.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The cyanide ion (`CN⁻`), provided by the salt `NaCN`, is a strong nucleophile. It attacks the partially positive carbon atom of the ketone's carbonyl group (C=O).\n    2.  **Protonation:** This attack forms a negatively charged intermediate called an alkoxide. To form the final, stable product, this alkoxide must be protonated by an acid to create the neutral hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   **Identifying Reagent A:** The role of reagent `A` is to be the proton source for this final protonation step.\n    *   `H₃O⁺` (hydronium ion) represents an acidic aqueous solution. It is the standard and correct choice for a proton source in this context.\n    *   `NaHSO₃` (sodium bisulfite) is a distractor. It undergoes a different reaction with ketones (bisulfite addition) and is not the correct reagent to complete cyanohydrin formation.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Reagent **A** must be **H₃O⁺**.\n\n### **Analysis of Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`\n*   **Type:** This reaction shows the conversion of a nitrile group (`-C≡N`) into a carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`). This is known as the **hydrolysis of a nitrile**.\n*   **Conditions:** The hydrolysis of a nitrile is a robust reaction that requires water (`H₂O`) and a strong catalyst, typically with heating.

Recognizing the specific conditions required for each reaction type is crucial.\n4.  **Consistency:** The provided candidate answers almost unanimously agree on the chemical reasoning (`A = H₃O⁺`, `B = HCl`).
