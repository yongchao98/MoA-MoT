Identify the Reaction Type and Mechanism**\n*   **Reactants**: 1-bromobenzene-2-d (an aryl halide with a deuterium label) and sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (a very strong base).\n*   **Mechanism**: These reaction conditions are classic for an **elimination-addition reaction**, which proceeds through a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination – Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) acts as a base. It abstracts an acidic hydrogen (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom. The starting material has two chemically distinct ortho positions:\n*   **Position C6**: Bears a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2**: Bears a deuterium atom (D).\n\nSince the question asks for all *possible* organic products, we must consider both elimination pathways, even though one is kinetically favored.\n\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction)**: The amide ion removes the proton from C6. This is followed by the loss of the bromide ion from C1, creating a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains in place. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**. (This pathway is faster due to the kinetic isotope effect, as C-H bonds are weaker than C-D bonds).\n\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction)**: The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. This is followed by the loss of the bromide ion from C1, creating a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is removed from the ring. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\nTherefore, two different benzyne intermediates are formed in the reaction mixture.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition – Nucleophilic Attack on the Intermediates**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile, attacking the reactive triple bond of the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A)**: This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The nucleophile (NH₂⁻) can attack either of the two carbons in the triple bond, leading to two distinct products:\n    1.  Attack at C1 gives **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  Attack at C6 gives **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from Benzyne (from Pathway B)**: This intermediate is symmetrical. Nucleophilic attack at either carbon of the triple bond, followed by protonation, leads to a single, identical product:\n    3.  **Aniline** (non-deuterated).\n\n**4. Final Count of Products**\nBy considering all possible pathways, we have identified three structurally distinct organic products:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuteroaniline\n3.  3-deuteroaniline\n\nTherefore, the total number of possible organic products is **3**.\n\n**Matching to Options**\nThe question asks for the number of possible organic products, which we have determined to be 3. The given options are:\nA) 2\nB) 3\nC) 4\nD) 1\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants and Reaction Mechanism**\n*   **Substrate**: 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is an aryl halide with a deuterium (d) atom, an isotope of hydrogen, at a position ortho to the bromine atom.\n*   **Reagents**: Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an extremely strong base.\n*   **Mechanism**: These reaction conditions are classic for an **elimination-addition reaction**, which proceeds through a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\nThe strong amide ion (NH₂⁻) acts as a base, abstracting an acidic proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the bromine leaving group. The starting material has two distinct ortho positions:\n*   **Position C6**: This has a regular hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2**: This has a deuterium atom (d).\n\nSince the question asks for all *possible* organic products, we must consider both deprotonation events. This leads to two separate pathways and two distinct intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction)**: The base removes the proton from C6. Subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 forms a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains in place. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n*   **Pathway B (d-abstraction)**: The base removes the deuteron from C2. Subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 forms a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is removed from the molecule in this process. The resulting intermediate is standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (Pathway A)**: This intermediate is unsymmetrical. Nucleophilic attack can occur at either C1 or C6 of the triple bond, leading to two different products after protonation.\n    *   Attack at C1 gives **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   Attack at C6 gives **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   Pathway A produces **two** distinct products.\n\n*   **Product from Benzyne (Pathway B)**: This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium. Attack at either carbon of the triple bond, followed by protonation, yields a single product.\n    *   This gives **aniline**.\n    *   Pathway B produces **one** distinct product.\n\n**4. Conclusion: Counting the Total Possible Products**\nBy combining the unique products from all possible pathways, we find three structurally distinct organic products:\n1.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n2.  2-deuteroaniline (from Pathway A)\n3.  3-deuteroaniline (from Pathway A)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of **3** possible organic products in this reaction. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Reaction Type**\nThe question describes the reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia. The reagents and substrate are classic indicators of an **elimination-addition reaction**, which proceeds through a highly reactive intermediate known as **benzyne**. All the candidate answers correctly identify this fundamental mechanism.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe reaction begins with the strong base, the amide ion (NH₂⁻), abstracting a proton or deuteron from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom. A critical point is that the starting material has two non-identical ortho positions:\n*   **Position C6:** Has a standard hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** Has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nSince the question asks for all *possible* products, both abstraction pathways must be considered.\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** Abstraction of H from C6, followed by the loss of the bromide ion, forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains in place. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** Abstraction of D from C2, followed by the loss of the bromide ion, forms a benzyyene intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is lost from the molecule in this pathway. The resulting intermediate is standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\nTherefore, the first step produces a mixture of two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Intermediates**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile, attacking the reactive triple bond of the benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (Pathway A):** This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The nucleophile can attack either carbon of the triple bond, leading to two distinct products after protonation by the solvent.\n    *   Attack at C1 gives **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   Attack at C6 gives **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   This pathway generates **two** products.\n\n*   **Products from benzyne (Pathway B):** This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium. Nucleophilic attack at either carbon of the triple bond, followed by protonation, leads to a single, identical product.\n    *   The product is **aniline**.\n    *   This pathway generates **one** product.\n\n**4.

These conditions are characteristic of a reaction that proceeds via an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a highly reactive **benzyne** intermediate. All the candidate answers correctly identified this mechanism.\n\n2.  **Formation of Benzyne Intermediates (Elimination Step):**\n    *   The strong base, the amide ion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton (or deuteron, D⁺) from a position *ortho* to the bromine leaving group.\n    *   The starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, has two distinct ortho positions: C6 (which has a hydrogen atom, H) and C2 (which has a deuterium atom, D).\n    *   Because the question asks for all *possible* organic products, both abstraction pathways must be considered.\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6.** The base removes the proton from C6. This is followed by the loss of the bromide ion from C1, creating a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 is unaffected. This produces the intermediate **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2.** The base removes the deuteron from C2. This is followed by the loss of the bromide ion from C1, creating a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium is removed from the ring in this pathway. This produces the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n    *   **Key point:** Two different benzyne intermediates are formed.\n\n3.  **Formation of Final Products (Addition Step):**\n    *   The amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile and attacks the reactive triple bond of the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n    *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (Pathway A):** This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The nucleophile can attack either of the two carbons in the triple bond (C1 or C6), leading to two different products after protonation.\n        *   Attack at C1 yields **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   Attack at C6 yields **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   **Product from benzyne (Pathway B):** This intermediate is symmetrical. Nucleophilic attack at either carbon of the triple bond leads to a single product after protonation: **aniline** (which has no deuterium).\n\n4.  **Counting the Total Products:**\n    By summing the unique products from all possible reaction pathways, we have:\n    1.

The analysis of the candidate answers shows that while their chemical reasoning was consistently correct in deriving the number 3, there was widespread confusion in selecting the corresponding letter, highlighting the importance of this final step.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe question asks for the total number of possible organic products when 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with sodium amide (NaNH₂) in condensed ammonia (NH₃). This requires a detailed analysis of the elimination-addition (benzyne) reaction mechanism.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Reaction Identification:** The reactants are an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) and a very strong base (NaNH₂). These conditions are characteristic of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds via a benzyne intermediate. The key to this problem is identifying all possible pathways.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination and Formation of Benzyne Intermediates.**\n    The reaction is initiated by the amide ion (NH₂⁻) acting as a base. It abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the bromine atom, followed by the loss of the bromide ion. The starting material has two distinct ortho positions:\n    *   **Position C6:** Contains a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   **Position C2:** Contains a deuterium atom (d).\n\n    This leads to two competing, but possible, elimination pathways:\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The base removes the proton from C6. Subsequent elimination of Br⁻ forms a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 is unaffected. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The base removes the deuteron from C2. Although this is slower than H-abstraction due to the kinetic isotope effect, it is a possible pathway. Subsequent elimination of Br⁻ forms a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium is removed in this step, and the intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n    Therefore, two different benzyne intermediates are formed in the reaction.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates.**\n    The amide ion (NH₂⁻) now acts as a nucleophile, attacking the reactive triple bond of the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n    *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):** This intermediate is unsymmetrical. Nucleophilic attack can occur at either of the two carbons of the triple bond (C1 or C6), leading to two distinct products:\n        1.  Attack at C1 yields **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        2.  Attack at C6 yields **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):** This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium. Attack at either carbon of the triple bond, followed by protonation, leads to only one product:\n        3.  **Aniline**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion: Total Number of Products.**\n    By combining all possible products from all viable pathways, we identify three structurally distinct organic molecules:\n    1.  Aniline\n    2.  2-deuteroaniline\n    3.  3-deuteroaniline\n\n    There are a total of **3** possible organic products.

The reagent is sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃).\n    *   **Reaction Type**: Sodium amide is an extremely strong base. When it reacts with an aryl halide that does not have strongly deactivating groups for a standard SₙAr reaction, it proceeds via an **elimination-addition mechanism**, which involves a highly reactive **benzyne** intermediate. This conclusion is unanimously supported by all the candidate answers.\n\n2.  **Step 1: The Elimination Process (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The amide ion (NH₂⁻) acts as a base and abstracts an acidic proton (or deuteron, in this case) from a position *ortho* to the bromine leaving group.\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** The starting material has two non-equivalent ortho positions:\n        *   The C6 position, which holds a standard hydrogen atom (H).\n        *   The C2 position, which holds a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   This distinction is crucial. Since H and D are different, there are two possible elimination pathways, leading to two different benzyne intermediates.\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction)**: The amide ion removes H⁺ from C6. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1 creates a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 is unaffected. The intermediate formed is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction)**: The amide ion removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. Subsequent elimination of Br⁻ from C1 creates a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is lost in this process. The intermediate formed is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n    *   Since the question asks for all *possible* organic products, both pathways must be considered.\n\n3.  **Step 2: The Addition Process (Nucleophilic Attack on the Intermediates)**\n    The amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** The symmetry of the benzyne intermediates determines how many products are formed from each.\n    *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (Pathway A):** This intermediate is unsymmetrical. Nucleophilic attack can occur at two different positions (C1 or C6), leading to two distinct products after protonation.\n        *   Attack at C1 gives **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   Attack at C6 gives **3-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   This pathway generates **two** products.\n    *   **Product from Benzyne (Pathway B):** This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium. Nucleophilic attack can occur at C1 or C2, but both pathways lead to the same single product after protonation.\n        *   The product is **aniline**.\n        *   This pathway generates **one** product.\n\n4.  **Conclusion: Counting the Total Products**\n    By combining the unique products from all possible pathways, we find three structurally distinct organic products:\n    1.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n    2.  2-deuteroaniline (from Pathway A)\n    3.  3-deuteroaniline (from Pathway A)\n\nTherefore, a total of 3 different organic products are possible in this reaction. This corresponds to option C. The reasoning presented in the candidate answers is uniformly correct in arriving at the number 3, even if the final letter choice is sometimes mistaken.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers to arrive at a definitive conclusion.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Mechanism**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is an aromatic ring with a bromine leaving group at C1 and a deuterium isotope at an ortho position (C2). The other ortho position (C6) has a standard hydrogen atom.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). These are the classic conditions for an elimination-addition reaction via a **benzyne** intermediate. The amide ion (NH₂⁻) acts as both a strong base and a nucleophile.\n*   **Consensus:** All candidate answers correctly identify the reaction as proceeding through a benzyve mechanism.\n\n**2. Step 1: The Elimination Process (Formation of Intermediates)**\nThe first step is the abstraction of a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the bromine. Because there are two non-equivalent ortho positions, two different elimination pathways are possible.\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The base (NH₂⁻) removes the hydrogen (H) from C6. Subsequent elimination of bromide from C1 forms a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains in the molecule. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The base (NH₂⁻) removes the deuteron (D) from C2. Although this is kinetically slower due to the kinetic isotope effect (C-D bonds are stronger than C-H bonds), it is still a possible pathway. Subsequent elimination of bromide from C1 forms a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium is removed in this process, leading to a standard, non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n**Careful Point:** The question asks for all *possible* organic products, so both pathways must be considered, regardless of their relative rates. All candidate answers correctly reason that two different benzyne intermediates are formed.\n\n**3. Step 2: The Addition Process (Formation of Products)**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the reactive triple bond of each benzyne intermediate.\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (Pathway A):** This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The nucleophile can attack either carbon of the triple bond.\n    *   Attack at C1 yields **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   Attack at C6 yields **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   This pathway generates **two** distinct products.\n*   **Product from benzyne (Pathway B):** This intermediate is symmetrical. Attack at either carbon of the triple bond, followed by protonation, leads to a single, identical product.\n    *   This pathway generates **one** product: **aniline**.\n\n**Careful Point:** It is crucial to correctly identify the number of unique products from each intermediate. The unsymmetrical nature of the deuterated benzyne leads to two products, while the symmetrical nature of the standard benzyne leads to one.\n\n**4. Final Count of Possible Products**\nCombining the outcomes of all possible pathways, we find a total of three structurally unique organic products:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuteroaniline\n3.  3-deuteroaniline\n\nTherefore, the total number of possible organic products is **3**.\n\n**Conclusion based on Candidate Analysis:**\nThe reasoning provided by all 15 candidate answers is remarkably consistent and scientifically sound. Every candidate's detailed analysis correctly concludes that 3 distinct products are formed. The disagreements in the final letter choices (e.g., A, B, C, D) appear to stem from clerical errors or variations in the multiple-choice option labels provided to each agent, not from flaws in the chemical logic.

The reaction proceeds through a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**. This was a point of universal agreement among all candidate analyses.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination and Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n*   **Careful Point**: The first step is the abstraction of a hydrogen (or its isotope, deuterium) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom. The starting material has two non-equivalent ortho positions: C6 (with a hydrogen atom, H) and C2 (with a deuterium atom, D).\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction)**: The base removes H⁺ from C6.

This is followed by the loss of the bromide ion from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected. This produces the **3-deuterobenzyne** intermediate. Due to the kinetic isotope effect (C-H bonds break more easily than C-D bonds), this is the major pathway, but not the only one.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction)**: The amide ion removes D⁺ from C2.

Identify the Reactants and Reaction Mechanism**\n*   **Substrate**: 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is an aryl halide with a deuterium (d) atom, an isotope of hydrogen, at a position ortho to the bromine atom.\n*   **Reagents**: Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an extremely strong base.\n*   **Mechanism**: These reaction conditions are classic for an **elimination-addition reaction**, which proceeds through a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\nThe strong amide ion (NH₂⁻) acts as a base, abstracting an acidic proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the bromine leaving group. The starting material has two distinct ortho positions:\n*   **Position C6**: This has a regular hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2**: This has a deuterium atom (d).\n\nSince the question asks for all *possible* organic products, we must consider both deprotonation events. This leads to two separate pathways and two distinct intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction)**: The base removes the proton from C6. Subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 forms a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains in place. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n*   **Pathway B (d-abstraction)**: The base removes the deuteron from C2. Subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 forms a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is removed from the molecule in this process. The resulting intermediate is standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (Pathway A)**: This intermediate is unsymmetrical. Nucleophilic attack can occur at either C1 or C6 of the triple bond, leading to two different products after protonation.\n    *   Attack at C1 gives **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   Attack at C6 gives **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   Pathway A produces **two** distinct products.\n\n*   **Product from Benzyne (Pathway B)**: This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium. Attack at either carbon of the triple bond, followed by protonation, yields a single product.\n    *   This gives **aniline**.\n    *   Pathway B produces **one** distinct product.\n\n**4. Conclusion: Counting the Total Possible Products**\nBy combining the unique products from all possible pathways, we find three structurally distinct organic products:\n1.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n2.  2-deuteroaniline (from Pathway A)\n3.  3-deuteroaniline (from Pathway A)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of **3** possible organic products in this reaction.

Understand the Reaction Type**\nThe question describes the reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia. The reagents and substrate are classic indicators of an **elimination-addition reaction**, which proceeds through a highly reactive intermediate known as **benzyne**. All the candidate answers correctly identify this fundamental mechanism.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe reaction begins with the strong base, the amide ion (NH₂⁻), abstracting a proton or deuteron from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom. A critical point is that the starting material has two non-identical ortho positions:\n*   **Position C6:** Has a standard hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** Has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nSince the question asks for all *possible* products, both abstraction pathways must be considered.\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** Abstraction of H from C6, followed by the loss of the bromide ion, forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains in place. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** Abstraction of D from C2, followed by the loss of the bromide ion, forms a benzyyene intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is lost from the molecule in this pathway. The resulting intermediate is standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\nTherefore, the first step produces a mixture of two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Intermediates**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile, attacking the reactive triple bond of the benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (Pathway A):** This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The nucleophile can attack either carbon of the triple bond, leading to two distinct products after protonation by the solvent.\n    *   Attack at C1 gives **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   Attack at C6 gives **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   This pathway generates **two** products.\n\n*   **Products from benzyne (Pathway B):** This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium. Nucleophilic attack at either carbon of the triple bond, followed by protonation, leads to a single, identical product.\n    *   The product is **aniline**.\n    *   This pathway generates **one** product.\n\n**4.

These conditions are characteristic of a reaction that proceeds via an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a highly reactive **benzyne** intermediate. All the candidate answers correctly identified this mechanism.\n\n2.  **Formation of Benzyne Intermediates (Elimination Step):**\n    *   The strong base, the amide ion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton (or deuteron, D⁺) from a position *ortho* to the bromine leaving group.\n    *   The starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, has two distinct ortho positions: C6 (which has a hydrogen atom, H) and C2 (which has a deuterium atom, D).\n    *   Because the question asks for all *possible* organic products, both abstraction pathways must be considered.\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6.** The base removes the proton from C6. This is followed by the loss of the bromide ion from C1, creating a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 is unaffected. This produces the intermediate **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2.** The base removes the deuteron from C2. This is followed by the loss of the bromide ion from C1, creating a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium is removed from the ring in this pathway. This produces the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n    *   **Key point:** Two different benzyne intermediates are formed.\n\n3.  **Formation of Final Products (Addition Step):**\n    *   The amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile and attacks the reactive triple bond of the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n    *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (Pathway A):** This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The nucleophile can attack either of the two carbons in the triple bond (C1 or C6), leading to two different products after protonation.\n        *   Attack at C1 yields **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   Attack at C6 yields **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   **Product from benzyne (Pathway B):** This intermediate is symmetrical. Nucleophilic attack at either carbon of the triple bond leads to a single product after protonation: **aniline** (which has no deuterium).\n\n4.  **Counting the Total Products:**\n    By summing the unique products from all possible reaction pathways, we have:\n    1.  Aniline\n    2.  2-deuteroaniline\n    3.  3-deuteroaniline\n\n    Therefore, there are a total of **3** distinct possible organic products.\n\n5.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n    The numerical answer is 3.

This requires a detailed analysis of the elimination-addition (benzyne) reaction mechanism.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Reaction Identification:** The reactants are an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) and a very strong base (NaNH₂). These conditions are characteristic of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds via a benzyne intermediate. The key to this problem is identifying all possible pathways.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination and Formation of Benzyne Intermediates.**\n    The reaction is initiated by the amide ion (NH₂⁻) acting as a base. It abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the bromine atom, followed by the loss of the bromide ion. The starting material has two distinct ortho positions:\n    *   **Position C6:** Contains a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   **Position C2:** Contains a deuterium atom (d).\n\n    This leads to two competing, but possible, elimination pathways:\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The base removes the proton from C6. Subsequent elimination of Br⁻ forms a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 is unaffected. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The base removes the deuteron from C2. Although this is slower than H-abstraction due to the kinetic isotope effect, it is a possible pathway. Subsequent elimination of Br⁻ forms a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium is removed in this step, and the intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n    Therefore, two different benzyne intermediates are formed in the reaction.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates.**\n    The amide ion (NH₂⁻) now acts as a nucleophile, attacking the reactive triple bond of the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n    *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):** This intermediate is unsymmetrical. Nucleophilic attack can occur at either of the two carbons of the triple bond (C1 or C6), leading to two distinct products:\n        1.  Attack at C1 yields **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        2.

The reagent is sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃).\n    *   **Reaction Type**: Sodium amide is an extremely strong base. When it reacts with an aryl halide that does not have strongly deactivating groups for a standard SₙAr reaction, it proceeds via an **elimination-addition mechanism**, which involves a highly reactive **benzyne** intermediate. This conclusion is unanimously supported by all the candidate answers.\n\n2.  **Step 1: The Elimination Process (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The amide ion (NH₂⁻) acts as a base and abstracts an acidic proton (or deuteron, in this case) from a position *ortho* to the bromine leaving group.\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** The starting material has two non-equivalent ortho positions:\n        *   The C6 position, which holds a standard hydrogen atom (H).\n        *   The C2 position, which holds a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   This distinction is crucial. Since H and D are different, there are two possible elimination pathways, leading to two different benzyne intermediates.\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction)**: The amide ion removes H⁺ from C6. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1 creates a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 is unaffected. The intermediate formed is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction)**: The amide ion removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. Subsequent elimination of Br⁻ from C1 creates a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is lost in this process. The intermediate formed is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n    *   Since the question asks for all *possible* organic products, both pathways must be considered.\n\n3.  **Step 2: The Addition Process (Nucleophilic Attack on the Intermediates)**\n    The amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** The symmetry of the benzyne intermediates determines how many products are formed from each.\n    *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (Pathway A):** This intermediate is unsymmetrical. Nucleophilic attack can occur at two different positions (C1 or C6), leading to two distinct products after protonation.\n        *   Attack at C1 gives **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   Attack at C6 gives **3-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   This pathway generates **two** products.\n    *   **Product from Benzyne (Pathway B):** This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium.

Aniline (from Pathway B)\n    2.  2-deuteroaniline (from Pathway A)\n    3.  3-deuteroaniline (from Pathway A)\n\nTherefore, a total of 3 different organic products are possible in this reaction.

Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Mechanism**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is an aromatic ring with a bromine leaving group at C1 and a deuterium isotope at an ortho position (C2). The other ortho position (C6) has a standard hydrogen atom.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). These are the classic conditions for an elimination-addition reaction via a **benzyne** intermediate. The amide ion (NH₂⁻) acts as both a strong base and a nucleophile.\n*   **Consensus:** All candidate answers correctly identify the reaction as proceeding through a benzyve mechanism.\n\n**2. Step 1: The Elimination Process (Formation of Intermediates)**\nThe first step is the abstraction of a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the bromine. Because there are two non-equivalent ortho positions, two different elimination pathways are possible.\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The base (NH₂⁻) removes the hydrogen (H) from C6. Subsequent elimination of bromide from C1 forms a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains in the molecule. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The base (NH₂⁻) removes the deuteron (D) from C2. Although this is kinetically slower due to the kinetic isotope effect (C-D bonds are stronger than C-H bonds), it is still a possible pathway. Subsequent elimination of bromide from C1 forms a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium is removed in this process, leading to a standard, non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n**Careful Point:** The question asks for all *possible* organic products, so both pathways must be considered, regardless of their relative rates. All candidate answers correctly reason that two different benzyne intermediates are formed.\n\n**3. Step 2: The Addition Process (Formation of Products)**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the reactive triple bond of each benzyne intermediate.\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (Pathway A):** This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The nucleophile can attack either carbon of the triple bond.\n    *   Attack at C1 yields **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   Attack at C6 yields **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   This pathway generates **two** distinct products.\n*   **Product from benzyne (Pathway B):** This intermediate is symmetrical. Attack at either carbon of the triple bond, followed by protonation, leads to a single, identical product.\n    *   This pathway generates **one** product: **aniline**.\n\n**Careful Point:** It is crucial to correctly identify the number of unique products from each intermediate. The unsymmetrical nature of the deuterated benzyne leads to two products, while the symmetrical nature of the standard benzyne leads to one.\n\n**4. Final Count of Possible Products**\nCombining the outcomes of all possible pathways, we find a total of three structurally unique organic products:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuteroaniline\n3.  3-deuteroaniline\n\nTherefore, the total number of possible organic products is **3**.\n\n**Conclusion based on Candidate Analysis:**\nThe reasoning provided by all 15 candidate answers is remarkably consistent and scientifically sound. Every candidate's detailed analysis correctly concludes that 3 distinct products are formed.

These conditions are characteristic of an **elimination-addition reaction**, which proceeds through a highly reactive **benzyne** intermediate. The question asks for all *possible* organic products, so all viable pathways must be considered.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The amide ion (NH₂⁻) is a strong base that abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the bromine atom. The starting material has two chemically distinct ortho positions:\n    *   **Position C6**: Has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   **Position C2**: Has a deuterium atom (D).\n\n    This leads to two competing elimination pathways, forming two different benzyne intermediates:\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction)**: The base removes H from C6. Subsequent elimination of Br⁻ from C1 creates a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 is unaffected. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction)**: The base removes D from C2. Subsequent elimination of Br⁻ from C1 creates a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is removed from the molecule in this step. The resulting intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyne intermediates.\n    *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A)**: This intermediate is unsymmetrical. Nucleophilic attack can occur at either of the two carbons of the triple bond.\n        *   Attack at C1 yields **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   Attack at C6 yields **3-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   This pathway produces **two** distinct organic products.\n    *   **Products from Benzyne (from Pathway B)**: This intermediate is symmetrical. Attack at either carbon of the triple bond leads to the same product after protonation.\n        *   The single product is **aniline**.\n        *   This pathway produces **one** distinct organic product.\n\n### Conclusion and Final Tally\n\nBy summing the unique products from all possible reaction pathways, we have:\n1.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n2.  2-deuteroaniline (from Pathway A)\n3.  3-deuteroaniline (from Pathway A)\n\nTherefore, a total of **3** distinct organic products are possible in this reaction. This corresponds to option **A**.\n\nThe reasoning provided by all candidate agents is uniformly correct and leads to the conclusion of 3 products.

All candidate answers correctly identify this fundamental mechanism.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination and Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\n*   **Key Point**: The amide ion (NH₂⁻) acts as a base and abstracts a proton from a position *ortho* to the bromine atom.\n*   **Crucial Detail**: The starting material has two non-equivalent ortho positions:\n    *   **Position C6**, which has a standard hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   **Position C2**, which has a deuterium atom (d).\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction)**: Removal of the proton from C6, followed by elimination of Br⁻, results in a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 is untouched. The intermediate formed is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n*   **Pathway B (d-abstraction)**: Removal of the deuteron from C2, followed by elimination of Br⁻, results in a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium is removed in this process. The intermediate formed is standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n*   **Conclusion for Step 1**: Because the question asks for all *possible* organic products, both pathways must be considered. This leads to the formation of **two different benzyne intermediates**.\n\n**3.

Nucleophilic attack at either carbon of the triple bond results in the same product after protonation.\n    *   The single product formed is **aniline**.\n    *   Therefore, this pathway produces **one** distinct product.\n\n**4.

Identifying the Reactants and Reaction Mechanism:**\n*   **Reactants**: The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is an aryl halide with a deuterium isotope label at one of the *ortho* positions relative to the bromine. The reagent is sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia, which is an extremely strong base.\n*   **Mechanism**: These reaction conditions are classic for an **elimination-addition reaction**, which proceeds through a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**. All candidate answers correctly identify this mechanism.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe reaction is initiated by the amide ion (NH₂⁻), which acts as a base and abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* to the bromine leaving group.\n*   The substrate has two different ortho positions: C6 (with a hydrogen, H) and C2 (with a deuterium, D).\n*   Because the question asks for all *possible* products, both potential abstraction pathways must be considered.\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction)**: The amide ion removes H⁺ from C6. This is followed by the loss of the bromide ion from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected. This produces the **3-deuterobenzyne** intermediate. Due to the kinetic isotope effect (C-H bonds break more easily than C-D bonds), this is the major pathway, but not the only one.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction)**: The amide ion removes D⁺ from C2. This is followed by the loss of the bromide ion from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is lost from the molecule. This produces the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate.\n*   **Conclusion of Step 1**: Two different benzyne intermediates are formed. All provided answers are in agreement on this point.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition - Nucleophilic Attack on the Intermediates**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) also acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (Pathway A)**: This intermediate is unsymmetrical. Nucleophilic attack can occur at two different sites, leading to two distinct products.\n    1.  Attack at C1 yields **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  Attack at C6 yields **3-deuteroaniline**.\n*   **Products from benzyne (Pathway B)**: This intermediate is symmetrical and has no deuterium. Nucleophilic attack at either carbon of the triple bond leads to the same single product.\n    3.  Attack at either C1 or C2 yields **aniline**.\n*   **Conclusion of Step 2**: The addition step produces three structurally unique molecules in total. All candidate answers that perform a full analysis reach this same conclusion.\n\n**4. Final Tally of Possible Products**\nBy combining all possible outcomes from all possible pathways, the reaction can produce three distinct organic molecules:\n1.

While many candidate answers contained the correct reasoning, several made errors in selecting the final letter. The chemical analysis, however, is undisputed among them.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n### Analysis of the Chemical Reaction\n\nThe problem asks for the number of possible organic products from the reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reaction Mechanism**\nThe reactants are an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) and a very strong base (NaNH₂). These conditions are characteristic of an **elimination-addition reaction**, which proceeds through a highly reactive **benzyne** intermediate. All candidate answers correctly identify this fundamental mechanism.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates (Elimination)**\nThe reaction is initiated when the strong base, the amide ion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton or deuteron from a position *ortho* to the bromine leaving group.\n*   The starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, has two distinct ortho positions:\n    1.  **Position C6:** Contains a standard hydrogen atom (H).\n    2.  **Position C2:** Contains a deuterium atom (D).\n*   Since the question asks for all *possible* products, both elimination pathways must be considered.\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** When the base removes the H from C6, followed by the loss of Br⁻, a benzyne intermediate is formed with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 is not involved in this step and remains on the ring. The intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** When the base removes the D from C2, followed by the loss of Br⁻, a benzyne intermediate is formed with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this pathway, the deuterium is eliminated from the molecule. The intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\nTherefore, two different benzyne intermediates are formed in the reaction mixture. This conclusion is unanimously supported by the reasoning in all provided answers.\n\n**Step 3: Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates (Addition)**\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻), now acting as a nucleophile, attacks the triple bond of the benzyne intermediates. The resulting anion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (Pathway A):**\n    *   This intermediate is unsymmetrical. Nucleophilic attack by NH₂⁻ can occur at the two different carbons of the triple bond (C1 or C6), leading to two distinct products:\n        1.  Attack at C1 yields **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        2.  Attack at C6 yields **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   This pathway generates two unique products.\n*   **Product from benzyne (Pathway B):**\n    *   This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium. Attack by NH₂⁻ at either carbon of the triple bond results in the same single product after protonation.\n        3.  The product is **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n    *   This pathway generates one unique product.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nBy combining the results from all possible reaction pathways, we find three structurally distinct organic products:\n1.
