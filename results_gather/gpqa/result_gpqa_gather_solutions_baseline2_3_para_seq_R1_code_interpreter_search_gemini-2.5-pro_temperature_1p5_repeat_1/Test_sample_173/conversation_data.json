The discrepancy in the final lettered choices stems from different option lists being presented to each agent. The core physics and mathematics are sound across all solutions. Here is a definitive, step-by-step solution based on that consensus.\n\n**1. Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n*   **Initial Rest-Mass Energy:** `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Total Final Rest-Mass Energy:** The problem states the sum of the final rest masses is 99% of the initial mass. Thus, `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * E_initial = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Individual Fragment Energies:** We have two relationships for the fragment rest-mass energies (`E_rest1`, `E_rest2`):\n    1.  `E_rest1 = 2 * E_rest2` (since `m₁ = 2m₂`).\n    2.  `E_rest1 + E_rest2 = 297 GeV`.\n*   Substitute (1) into (2): `2*E_rest2 + E_rest2 = 297 GeV`, which simplifies to `3*E_rest2 = 297 GeV`.\n*   Solving gives the rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment: `E_rest2 = 99 GeV`.\n*   And for the more massive fragment: `E_rest1 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-Value)**\n*   By the principle of conservation of energy, the energy \"lost\" from the rest mass is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments (`Q`).\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - (E_rest1 + E_rest2)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   The total kinetic energy shared by the fragments is 3 GeV.\n\n**3. Calculate the Kinetic Energy `T₁` using the Classical Approximation**\n*   Since the initial nucleus was at rest, by the conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`).\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is therefore `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁`.\n*   Given `m₁ = 2m₂`, the ratio is `1/2`. This means `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   Substituting this into the total kinetic energy equation (`T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`):\n    `T₁_classical + 2*T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `3*T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Correct Relativistic Kinetic Energy `T₁`**\n*   The conservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂|`) still holds.\n*   The relativistic relationship between kinetic energy, rest-mass energy, and momentum is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since the momentum is the same for both fragments, we can set their squared values equal:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   Substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`. All values are in GeV.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides of the equation cancel out.\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Solving for `T₁`:\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁_correct = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**5. Find the Final Difference**\n*   The question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n*   `Difference = T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n\n**6. Convert to MeV**\n*   The final answer must be in MeV. Using the conversion `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n*   `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe calculated difference is 5 MeV. According to the options provided in the question:\nA) 2 MeV.\nB) 5 MeV.\nC) 20 MeV.\nD) 10 MeV.\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis involving both classical and relativistic mechanics. All candidate answers follow the same logical procedure, which is a strong indicator of the correct methodology. Let's verify the steps and the numerical result.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments\n\n1.  **Initial State:** The rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus is `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n2.  **Final State Sum:** The nucleus splits into two fragments, `m₁` and `m₂`. Their combined rest-mass energy is 99% of the initial energy:\n    `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n3.  **Mass Ratio:** We are told one fragment is twice as massive. Let `m₁` be the more massive fragment, so `m₁ = 2m₂`. This translates to their rest-mass energies: `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n4.  **Solving for Individual Energies:** We have a system of two equations:\n    *   `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    *   `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²) `\n    Substituting the second equation into the first gives `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which simplifies to `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (`m₂`): `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m₁`): `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    This calculation is consistent and correct across all provided answers.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nThe energy lost from rest mass is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\nThe total kinetic energy shared by the fragments is 3 GeV. This is also consistently calculated correctly.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate T₁ using the Classical Approximation\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must fly apart with momenta of equal magnitude (`p`) and opposite directions.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies that kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass (`T ∝ 1/m`) when momentum is constant.\n*   **Energy Ratio:** `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`. Therefore, `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   **Solving for T₁_classical:** Using the total kinetic energy `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`, we substitute to get `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV`, which gives `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\nThis result is also unanimously correct in the candidate answers.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate T₁ using the Correct (Relativistic) Formula\n\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The energy-momentum relation is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   **Equating Momenta:** Since `p` is the same for both fragments, we can equate the expressions for `(pc)²`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** We substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁` (from Step 2). All energies are in GeV.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Combine the `T₁` terms:\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n*   `T₁_relativistic = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\nThis relativistic calculation is also consistent and correct across all provided solutions.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Difference and Convert Units\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct value and the classical approximation.\n*   Difference = `T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n\nThe final answer needs to be in MeV. We use the conversion `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n*   Difference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mathematical and physical derivation is robust and consistently leads to a difference of 5 MeV across all candidate solutions that show their work. The discrepancies in the final letter choices among the candidate answers are due to different option mappings. For the options provided in this specific problem context:\n\nA) 20 MeV.\nB) 10 MeV.\nC) 2 MeV.\nD) 5 MeV.\n\nThe calculated result of 5 MeV corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a systematic, step-by-step breakdown of the solution based on the physics principles involved.\n\n**1. Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fission Fragments**\n\n*   **Initial State:** The rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus is `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final State Rest-Mass Energy:** The sum of the rest masses of the two fragments (`m₁` and `m₂`) is 99% of the initial mass. This means the sum of their rest-mass energies is 99% of the initial rest-mass energy.\n    *   `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Mass Ratio:** The more massive fragment (`m₁`) is twice the mass of the other (`m₂`), so `m₁ = 2m₂`. This translates directly to their rest-mass energies: `m₁c² = 2 * (m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving for Individual Energies:** We now solve the system of two equations:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2 * (m₂c²)`\n    Substitute the second equation into the first:\n    `2 * (m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    `3 * (m₂c²) = 297 GeV`\n    `m₂c² = 99 GeV` (Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment).\n    From this, the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m₁`) is:\n    `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-Value)**\n\nThe energy lost in rest mass is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments. This is known as the Q-value.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\nSo, the total kinetic energy shared between the two fragments is 3 GeV.\n\n**3. Calculate the Kinetic Energy `T₁` using the Classical Approximation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total final momentum must be zero. This means the fragments fly apart with momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies that for a given momentum `p`, the kinetic energy is inversely proportional to the mass.\n*   **Energy Ratio:** We can find the ratio of the fragments' kinetic energies:\n    `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁`.\n    Since `m₁ = 2m₂`, the ratio `m₂ / m₁` is 1/2.\n    `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = 1/2`, which means `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   **Solving for `T₁_classical`:** We use the total kinetic energy `T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`:\n    `T₁_classical + (2 * T₁_classical) = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Kinetic Energy `T₁` using the Correct (Relativistic) Formula**\n\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The momentum `p` is still the same for both fragments. The relativistic relationship connecting kinetic energy `T`, rest-mass energy `mc²`, and momentum is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   **Equating Momenta:** Since `|p₁| = |p₂|`, we can equate `(p*c)²` for each fragment:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving for `T₁`:** Substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and the energy conservation relation `T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    Expand both sides (all energies in GeV):\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    The `T₁²` term appears on both sides and can be cancelled:\n    `396T₁ = 9 - 6T₁ + 594 - 198T₁`\n    Group the terms:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\nThis is the correct, relativistic value for `T₁`.\n\n**5. Find the Difference and Convert to MeV**\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct `T₁` and the classically calculated `T₁`.\n*   Difference = `T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\nFinally, convert this value to MeV, knowing that `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n*   Difference = `0.005 GeV * (1000 MeV / GeV) = 5 MeV`.\n\nMatching this calculated result to the provided options:\nA) 20 MeV.\nB) 10 MeV.\nC) 2 MeV.\nD) 5 MeV.\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, verifying the calculations from the provided answers and identifying any points of contention.\n\n### 1. Verification of the Calculation\nThe core of the problem involves a series of calculations. A review of all candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the methodology and numerical results at each step.\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments.**\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: `E_initial = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Total final rest-mass energy: `E_final_rest = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n    *   The rest-mass energies of the fragments (`E1_rest` for the massive one, `E2_rest` for the lighter one) are related by `E1_rest = 2 * E2_rest`.\n    *   Solving the system `E1_rest + E2_rest = 297 GeV` and `E1_rest = 2 * E2_rest` gives:\n        *   `E2_rest = 99 GeV`\n        *   `E1_rest = 198 GeV`\n    *   This step is correctly performed by all agents.\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value).**\n    *   The energy lost in rest mass is converted to kinetic energy: `Q = E_initial - E_final_rest`.\n    *   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n    *   This step is also universally correct in all provided solutions.\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T1_classical`).**\n    *   From conservation of momentum, `|p1| = |p2|`.\n    *   In classical mechanics, `T = p^2 / (2m)`, so kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass.\n    *   `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 1/2`.\n    *   Combined with `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`, this gives `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n    *   This result is consistently and correctly calculated.\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the correct relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T1_relativistic`).**\n    *   The relativistic momentum relation is `(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2T(mc^2)`.\n    *   Equating the momenta of the two fragments and solving the resulting equation (`T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`) gives:\n    *   `T1_relativistic = 1.005 GeV`.\n    *   This result is also consistently and correctly calculated by all agents.\n\n*   **Step 5: Find the difference.**\n    *   Difference = `T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n    *   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n\n*   **Step 6: Convert the difference to MeV.**\n    *   `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n    *   Difference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### 2.

The difference between the correct (relativistic) kinetic energy and the classically approximated value is **5 MeV**. Based on the options presented in the question:\nA) 2 MeV.\nB) 20 MeV.\nC) 5 MeV.\nD) 10 MeV.\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the physics problem and the methods presented by the candidate agents, the correct solution is derived as follows.\n\n### **1. Calculation of Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n\nFirst, we must determine the rest-mass energies of the two fragments resulting from the fission.\n*   **Initial Rest-Mass Energy (`E_initial`):** The parent nucleus is at rest with `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Total Final Rest-Mass Energy (`E_final_rest`):** The sum of the rest-masses of the two fragments (`m₁` and `m₂`) is 99% of the initial mass. Therefore, their combined rest-mass energy is:\n    `E_final_rest = (m₁ + m₂)c² = 0.99 * Mc² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Individual Fragment Energies:** We are given that the more massive fragment (`m₁`) is twice the mass of the other (`m₁ = 2m₂`). This relationship also applies to their rest-mass energies (`E_rest₁ = 2 * E_rest₂`). We can solve this system of equations:\n    1.  `E_rest₁ + E_rest₂ = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `E_rest₁ = 2 * E_rest₂`\n*   Substituting the second equation into the first:\n    `(2 * E_rest₂) + E_rest₂ = 297 GeV`\n    `3 * E_rest₂ = 297 GeV`\n    `E_rest₂ = 99 GeV` (rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment)\n    `E_rest₁ = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV` (rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment)\n\n### **2. Calculation of Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy \"lost\" from rest mass is converted into the kinetic energy (`Q`) of the fragments.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### **3. Calculation of T₁ (Classical Approximation)**\n\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, by the law of conservation of momentum, the two fragments must fly apart with momenta of equal magnitude (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`) and opposite direction.\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is therefore `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`. This gives `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`.\n    `T₁_classical + 2 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   So, `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n### **4. Calculation of T₁ (Correct Relativistic Value)**\n\nWe still use the conservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂|`), but with the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since `p₁` and `p₂` are equal, we can set `(p₁c)²` equal to `(p₂c)²`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`\n*   Substitute the known values (with all energies in GeV): `m₁c² = 198`, `m₂c² = 99`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Expand and simplify the equation:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms cancel out from both sides:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Solve for the correct kinetic energy, `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### **5. Final Difference**\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n*   `Difference = T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   To get the final answer in MeV, we use the conversion `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n    `Difference = 0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nComparing this result to the provided options:\nA) 2 MeV.\nB) 20 MeV.\nC) 10 MeV.\nD) 5 MeV.\n\nThe calculated value of 5 MeV matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis problem requires calculating the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T1`) using both relativistic and classical physics, and then finding the difference.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n*   **Initial Rest-Mass Energy:** `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Sum of Final Rest-Mass Energies:** The fragments' combined mass is 99% of the initial mass. Thus, the sum of their rest-mass energies is `E_final_rest = (m₁ + m₂)c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Mass Ratio:** The more massive fragment (`m₁`) is twice the mass of the other (`m₂`), so `m₁ = 2m₂`. This also applies to their rest-mass energies: `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving for Individual Energies:** We have a system of two equations:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²) `\n    Substitute (2) into (1): `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`.\n    This gives `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`, so `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n    The rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment is `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\nThe energy released is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies, which is converted to kinetic energy.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, conservation of momentum requires the two fragments to have momenta of equal magnitude (`p`) and opposite direction.\n*   Classical kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   This implies that kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass: `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`, or `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting the ratio: `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV` => `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate T1 using the Correct (Relativistic) Formula**\nWe still use the conservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`). The relativistic relation between momentum, kinetic energy, and rest-mass energy is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since the momentum values are equal, `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`\n*   Substitute the known values (all in GeV): `m₁c² = 198`, `m₂c² = 99`, and from the Q-value, `T₂ = 3 - T₁`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Expand and simplify:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms cancel out from both sides:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Solve for T₁:\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`. This is the correct relativistic kinetic energy.\n\n### **Step 5: Calculate the Difference and Convert Units**\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\n*   Difference = `T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\nThe question asks for the answer in MeV. Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV:\n*   Difference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nMatching this result to the given options:\nA) 10 MeV.\nB) 20 MeV.\nC) 5 MeV.\nD) 2 MeV.\n\nThe calculated difference is 5 MeV, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the physics problem.\n\n**1. Initial State and Final State Parameters**\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus is at rest. Its rest-mass energy, `E_initial = Mc²`, is 300 GeV. Its initial momentum is zero.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments. Let's call their rest masses `m₁` and `m₂`.\n*   **Mass Relationship:** One fragment is twice as massive as the other. We'll define `m₁` as the more massive fragment, so `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n*   **Sum of Final Rest Masses:** The sum of the fragments' rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n\n**2. Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\nIt is most convenient to work with rest-mass energies (`E_rest = mc²`).\n*   The sum of the rest-mass energies of the fragments is:\n    `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * (Mc²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   The mass relationship `m₁ = 2m₂` translates directly to the rest-mass energies: `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n*   We now solve this system of two equations:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n*   Substitute the second equation into the first:\n    `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`\n    `m₂c² = 99 GeV` (Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment).\n*   From this, we find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment:\n    `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\nBy the law of conservation of energy, the \"lost\" rest-mass energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   `Q = Total Kinetic Energy = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\nThe total kinetic energy shared between the fragments is 3 GeV.\n\n**4. Calculate `T₁` using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest (`p_initial = 0`), the fragments must fly apart with momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies `p² = 2mT`.\n*   Equating the expressions for `p²`: `2m₁T₁_classical = 2m₂T₂_classical`, which gives the ratio `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁`.\n*   Since `m₁ = 2m₂`, the ratio is `1/2`. Therefore, `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   We use the total kinetic energy: `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substitute the ratio: `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV`, which gives `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   So, the classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**5. Calculate `T₁` using the Correct (Relativistic) Formulas**\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The relationship between momentum, kinetic energy (`T`), and rest-mass energy (`mc²`) is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   **Equating Momenta:** Since `|p₁| = |p₂|`, their `(pc)²` terms are also equal:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving for `T₁`:** Substitute the known values (all in GeV): `T₂ = 3 - T₁`, `m₁c² = 198`, and `m₂c² = 99`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Expand the equation:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel each other out.\n    `396T₁ = 9 - 6T₁ + 594 - 198T₁`\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Isolate `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n*   So, the correct relativistic kinetic energy is `T₁_relativistic = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**6. Find the Difference and Convert to MeV**\nThe final step is to find the difference between the correct value and the classical approximation.\n*   Difference = `T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\nFinally, convert this difference to MeV, using the conversion `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n*   Difference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 20 MeV.\nB) 10 MeV.\nC) 2 MeV.\nD) 5 MeV.\n\nThe calculated difference is 5 MeV, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, synthesized from the consistent reasoning of the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **1. Identify Initial and Final State Parameters**\n*   **Initial State**: A nucleus at rest, meaning its initial momentum is zero. Its rest-mass energy is `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final State**: The nucleus fissions into two fragments, `m₁` (the more massive) and `m₂` (the less massive).\n*   **Fragment Mass Relation**: One fragment is twice as massive as the other. All candidate solutions correctly interpret this as `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n*   **Final Mass Sum**: The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n\n### **2. Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\nIt is most convenient to work in units of rest-mass energy (`mc²`).\n1.  From the mass relation, we have `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n2.  From the final mass sum, the total rest-mass energy of the fragments is `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * (Mc²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n3.  We now solve this system of two equations by substituting the first into the second:\n    `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`\n    This gives the rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment: `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n4.  And the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m₁`): `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\nBy the conservation of energy, the \"lost\" rest-mass energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - (m₁c² + m₂c²) `\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\nThis total kinetic energy of 3 GeV is shared between the two fragments.\n\n### **4. Calculate `T₁` using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n*   **Conservation of Momentum**: Because the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must fly apart with momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy**: The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies that `p²` is equal for both fragments: `2m₁T₁_classical = 2m₂T₂_classical`.\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies**: From the momentum equality, we find the ratio of kinetic energies is inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses: `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`. Thus, `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   **Solving for `T₁_classical`**: We use the total kinetic energy:\n    `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n### **5. Calculate `T₁` using the Correct (Relativistic) Formula**\n*   **Relativistic Momentum**: We still use the conservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂|`). The relativistic relationship between kinetic energy `T`, rest-mass energy `mc²`, and momentum `p` is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   **Equating Momenta**: Since `p` is the same for both fragments, we can equate the expressions for `(pc)²`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving for `T₁`**: We substitute the known values (with all energies in GeV): `T₂ = 3 - T₁`, `m₁c² = 198`, and `m₂c² = 99`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides of the equation cancel out:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Combine the terms with `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`. This is the correct relativistic kinetic energy.\n\n### **6. Find the Difference and Convert to Final Units**\n*   The difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\n    Difference = `T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n    Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   The question asks for the answer in MeV. We use the conversion `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n    Difference = `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe calculation robustly yields a difference of **5 MeV**. Comparing this numerical result to the options provided in the question:\nA) 10 MeV\nB) 2 MeV\nC) 5 MeV\nD) 20 MeV\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, verifying the calculations and logic presented by the candidate agents.\n\n### **1. Calculation of Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n\n*   **Initial State:** The initial nucleus has a rest-mass energy `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final State Rest Energy:** The nucleus splits into two fragments, `m₁` and `m₂`. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass. Therefore, the sum of their rest-mass energies is:\n    `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * (Mc²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Individual Fragment Energies:** We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other (`m₁ = 2m₂`). This ratio also applies to their rest-mass energies (`m₁c² = 2m₂c²`). We can now solve the system of equations:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n*   Substituting the second equation into the first:\n    `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`\n    This gives the rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment: `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n*   The rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment is `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\nThis step is performed correctly and consistently by all candidate answers.\n\n### **2. Calculation of Total Kinetic Energy (Q-Value)**\n\nThe energy lost from rest mass is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments. This is known as the Q-value.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\nThis value is also consistently and correctly calculated by all agents. The fragments share a total kinetic energy of 3 GeV.\n\n### **3. Calculation of T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the two fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`).\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies that kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass.\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:** `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p²/2m₁) / (p²/2m₂) = m₂/m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   This gives us `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`, we can substitute to find `T₁_classical`:\n    `T₁_classical + 2(T₁_classical) = 3 GeV`\n    `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\nThis result is correct and agreed upon by all agents.\n\n### **4. Calculation of T₁ using the Correct (Relativistic) Formula**\n\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The momenta are still equal (`|p₁| = |p₂|`). The relativistic relationship between momentum, kinetic energy, and rest-mass energy is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   **Equating Momenta:** We set the `(pc)²` expressions for both fragments equal to each other:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`\n*   We substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and the energy conservation relation `T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Expanding the equation:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out. We can now solve for `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\nThis relativistic value is correct and consistently derived in all provided solutions.\n\n### **5. Calculation of the Final Difference**\n\nThe final step is to find the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation.\n*   `Difference = T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n\n### **6. Conversion to MeV**\n\nThe question asks for the answer in MeV. We use the conversion factor `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n*   `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculation is robustly confirmed across all provided analyses.

Step-by-Step Verification**\n\n**Step A: Determine Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n*   The initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus is `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   The sum of the rest-mass energies of the two fragments (`m₁` and `m₂`) is 99% of the initial value: `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   We are given the mass relationship `m₁ = 2m₂`, which means the rest-mass energy relationship is `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n*   We can solve this system of two equations:\n    1. `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2. `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n*   Substituting (2) into (1) gives `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which simplifies to `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n*   This yields the rest-mass energies:\n    *   Lighter fragment: `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n    *   More massive fragment: `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**Step B: Calculate Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)**\n*   By conservation of energy, the energy released (Q-value) is the initial rest-mass energy minus the final rest-mass energy. This energy becomes the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**Step C: Calculate T₁ using the Classical Approximation**\n*   Since the nucleus was initially at rest, the law of conservation of momentum requires the two fragments to have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   The ratio of the kinetic energies is therefore inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses: `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   This gives `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   We know `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = Q = 3 GeV`. Substituting the ratio: `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   This gives `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`, so `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**Step D: Calculate T₁ using the Correct (Relativistic) Formula**\n*   The relativistic relationship between momentum, kinetic energy (`T`), and rest-mass energy (`mc²`) is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since the momentum magnitude `p` is the same for both fragments, we can equate `(pc)²`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   Substitute the known values (in GeV): `m₁c²=198`, `m₂c²=99`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Solving for `T₁`:\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`. This is the correct relativistic kinetic energy.\n\n**Step E: Calculate the Difference and Convert Units**\n*   The difference is `T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical`.\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   To get the answer in MeV, we use the conversion `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n    Difference = `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### **3. Final Conclusion**\nThe calculation consistently and robustly yields a difference of **5 MeV**. The options provided in the prompt are:\nA) 2 MeV.\nB) 5 MeV.\nC) 20 MeV.\nD) 10 MeV.\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nAn analysis of the fifteen provided answers shows a strong consensus on the calculation methodology. All agents who showed their detailed work arrived at the same numerical result, with discrepancies only arising from the final mapping of that number to a lettered choice, likely due to variations in the options presented to each agent.\n\nHere is a step-by-step verification of the calculation, which is consistent with the reasoning provided by the candidate answers.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n*   Initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus is `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the two fragments (`m₁` and `m₂`) is 99% of the initial mass. Thus, the sum of their rest-mass energies is `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let `m₁` be the more massive one, so `m₁ = 2m₂`. This translates to `m₁c² = 2 * m₂c²`.\n*   We solve the system of two equations:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2 * m₂c²`\n*   Substituting the second equation into the first yields `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which simplifies to `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n*   This gives the rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment as `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n*   The rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment is `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\nThe Q-value is the energy released during fission, which is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments (`T₁ + T₂`).\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Kinetic Energy of the More Massive Fragment (T1) using Classical Approximation**\n*   Since the initial nucleus was at rest, conservation of momentum requires the two fragments to have equal and opposite momenta (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`).\n*   The classical formula for kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   The ratio of the kinetic energies is therefore `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`. This gives `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   Substituting this into the total kinetic energy equation: `T₁_classical + 2*T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   This simplifies to `3*T₁_classical = 3 GeV`, so `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Correct Kinetic Energy (T1) using Relativistic Formulas**\n*   The momenta are still equal (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`).\n*   The relativistic relationship between momentum, kinetic energy (`T`), and rest-mass energy (`mc²`) is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since the `(pc)²` terms are equal for both fragments, we can set up the equation:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   Substitute the known values (in GeV): `m₁c² = 198`, `m₂c² = 99`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms cancel out from both sides. We then solve for `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`. This is the correct relativistic kinetic energy.\n\n**Step 5: Find the Difference**\n*   The difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\n    `Difference = T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n\n**Step 6: Convert to MeV and Select the Final Answer**\n*   To get the result in MeV, we use the conversion `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n    `Difference = 0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n*   The calculated difference is 5 MeV. Matching this value to the options provided in the question:\n    A) 20 MeV.\n    B) 10 MeV.\n    C) 5 MeV.\n    D) 2 MeV.\n*   The correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the underlying physics and the calculation steps. The discrepancies in the final letter choices appear to stem from variations in the option lists provided to each agent. A definitive solution can be reached by independently verifying the calculation and comparing the result to the options provided in this specific prompt.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Determine Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n*   **Initial Rest-Mass Energy:** The nucleus is at rest, `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final Rest-Mass Energy Sum:** The fragments' rest masses sum to 99% of the initial mass. Therefore, their combined rest-mass energy is `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Individual Fragment Energies:** We have two conditions:\n    1.  The mass relationship: `m₁ = 2m₂`, which implies `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n    2.  The sum of their rest-mass energies: `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`.\n*   Solving this system of equations by substituting the first into the second:\n    `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`\n    `m₂c² = 99 GeV` (Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment).\n    `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV` (Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment).\n\n**2. Calculate Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)**\nThe energy released in the fission (Q-value) is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies, which is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate `T₁` using the Classical Approximation (`T₁_classical`)**\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, by conservation of momentum, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`).\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is therefore inversely proportional to the mass ratio: `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1 / 2`.\n*   This means `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting for T₂: `T₁_classical + 2*T₁_classical = 3 GeV` => `3*T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   So, `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate `T₁` using the Correct Relativistic Formula (`T₁_correct`)**\nWe again use the conservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`). The relativistic relationship between kinetic energy (`T`), rest-mass energy (`mc²`), and momentum (`p`) is given by `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since the momenta are equal: `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   Substitute the known values (`m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`):\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Expand the equation:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms cancel out. Simplify the remaining terms:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Solve for `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁_correct = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**5. Find the Difference and Convert to MeV**\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n*   Difference = `T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   Convert this to MeV using the conversion `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n    Difference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe calculated difference is 5 MeV.

Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\n*   The initial rest-mass energy of the parent nucleus is `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   The nucleus splits into a more massive fragment (m₁) and a less massive one (m₂).\n*   **Mass Relationship:** We are given `m₁ = 2m₂`. This translates directly to their rest-mass energies: `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Final Mass Sum:** The sum of the fragments' rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`. In terms of energy, this is `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * (Mc²)`.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Sum of final rest-mass energies = `0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n    *   We now solve the system of equations:\n        1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n        2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n    *   Substituting equation (2) into (1): `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV` -> `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n    *   This gives the rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment: `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n    *   And for the more massive fragment: `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\n*   The Q-value is the energy released from the loss of rest mass, which is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   The two fragments share a total of 3 GeV of kinetic energy.\n\n**3. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments fly apart with momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies that `p² = 2mT`.\n*   Since `p²` is the same for both fragments, we can write `2m₁T₁,classical = 2m₂T₂,classical`.\n*   This gives the ratio `T₁,classical / T₂,classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`. Therefore, `T₂,classical = 2 * T₁,classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: `T₁,classical + T₂,classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting the ratio: `T₁,classical + 2T₁,classical = 3 GeV` -> `3T₁,classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   So, the classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is `T₁,classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate T₁ using the Correct (Relativistic) Formula**\n\n*   We again use the fact that the momenta are equal (`p₁ = p₂`).\n*   The relativistic relationship between momentum, kinetic energy (`T`), and rest-mass energy (`mc²`) is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Equating the momenta for both fragments: `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   Substitute the known values (all in GeV): `T₂ = 3 - T₁`, `m₁c² = 198`, and `m₂c² = 99`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Expand and simplify:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Solve for `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n*   The correct (relativistic) kinetic energy is `T₁,correct = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**5.

    "Based on an analysis of the provided solutions, there is a clear and strong consensus on the physical principles, mathematical steps, and the final numerical result. The only discrepancies arise from different option mappings (A, B, C, D). The following step-by-step breakdown verifies the correct calculation.\n\n### **Systematic Analysis**\n\n**1. Given Information & Initial Setup**\n*   Initial rest-mass energy of nucleus: `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`\n*   The nucleus is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero.\n*   It splits into two fragments, `m₁` and `m₂`. We'll define `m₁` as the more massive fragment.\n*   Mass ratio: `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n*   Sum of final rest-mass energies: `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * Mc² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculation of Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\nThis involves solving a simple system of two equations.\n1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)` (from the mass ratio)\n\nSubstitute (2) into (1):\n`2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n`3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`\n`m₂c² = 99 GeV` (Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment)\n\nAnd therefore:\n`m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV` (Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment)\n\n**3. Calculation of Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\nBy the conservation of energy, the difference in rest-mass energy is converted into kinetic energy.\n*   `Q = Total Kinetic Energy = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n**4. Calculation of `T₁` using Classical Approximation**\n*   **Careful Point:** Conservation of momentum requires the fragments to have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction, i.e., `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`. This holds true for both classical and relativistic cases.\n*   The classical formula for kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is therefore `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   So, `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   Substituting into the total kinetic energy equation:\n    `T₁_classical + (2 * T₁_classical) = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**5. Calculation of Correct Relativistic `T₁`**\n*   We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since `p` is the same for both fragments, we can equate their `(pc)²` terms:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`\n*   **Careful Point:** All energies must be in consistent units. Using GeV throughout is best. We substitute `T₂ = 3 - T₁`, `m₁c² = 198`, and `m₂c² = 99`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   **Careful Point:** The `T₁²` terms on both sides of the equation conveniently cancel out, simplifying the problem from a quadratic to a linear equation.\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Now, solve for `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**6. Find the Difference and Final Conversion**\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n*   Difference = `T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\nFinally, convert this value from GeV to MeV, knowing that `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n*   Difference = `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe calculated difference is **5 MeV**.

The discrepancy in the final lettered choices stems from different option lists being presented to each agent. The core physics and mathematics are sound across all solutions. Here is a definitive, step-by-step solution based on that consensus.\n\n**1. Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n*   **Initial Rest-Mass Energy:** `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Total Final Rest-Mass Energy:** The problem states the sum of the final rest masses is 99% of the initial mass. Thus, `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * E_initial = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Individual Fragment Energies:** We have two relationships for the fragment rest-mass energies (`E_rest1`, `E_rest2`):\n    1.  `E_rest1 = 2 * E_rest2` (since `m₁ = 2m₂`).\n    2.  `E_rest1 + E_rest2 = 297 GeV`.\n*   Substitute (1) into (2): `2*E_rest2 + E_rest2 = 297 GeV`, which simplifies to `3*E_rest2 = 297 GeV`.\n*   Solving gives the rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment: `E_rest2 = 99 GeV`.\n*   And for the more massive fragment: `E_rest1 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**2.

Calculate the Kinetic Energy `T₁` using the Classical Approximation**\n*   Since the initial nucleus was at rest, by the conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`).\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is therefore `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁`.\n*   Given `m₁ = 2m₂`, the ratio is `1/2`. This means `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   Substituting this into the total kinetic energy equation (`T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`):\n    `T₁_classical + 2*T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `3*T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Correct Relativistic Kinetic Energy `T₁`**\n*   The conservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂|`) still holds.\n*   The relativistic relationship between kinetic energy, rest-mass energy, and momentum is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since the momentum is the same for both fragments, we can set their squared values equal:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   Substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`. All values are in GeV.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides of the equation cancel out.\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Solving for `T₁`:\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁_correct = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**5. Find the Final Difference**\n*   The question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n*   `Difference = T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n\n**6. Convert to MeV**\n*   The final answer must be in MeV. Using the conversion `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n*   `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThe calculated difference is 5 MeV. According to the options provided in the question:\nA) 2 MeV.\nB) 5 MeV.\nC) 20 MeV.\nD) 10 MeV.\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis involving both classical and relativistic mechanics. All candidate answers follow the same logical procedure, which is a strong indicator of the correct methodology. Let's verify the steps and the numerical result.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments\n\n1.  **Initial State:** The rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus is `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n2.  **Final State Sum:** The nucleus splits into two fragments, `m₁` and `m₂`. Their combined rest-mass energy is 99% of the initial energy:\n    `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n3.  **Mass Ratio:** We are told one fragment is twice as massive. Let `m₁` be the more massive fragment, so `m₁ = 2m₂`. This translates to their rest-mass energies: `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n4.  **Solving for Individual Energies:** We have a system of two equations:\n    *   `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    *   `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²) `\n    Substituting the second equation into the first gives `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which simplifies to `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (`m₂`): `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m₁`): `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    This calculation is consistent and correct across all provided answers.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nThe energy lost from rest mass is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\nThe total kinetic energy shared by the fragments is 3 GeV. This is also consistently calculated correctly.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate T₁ using the Classical Approximation\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must fly apart with momenta of equal magnitude (`p`) and opposite directions.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies that kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass (`T ∝ 1/m`) when momentum is constant.\n*   **Energy Ratio:** `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`. Therefore, `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   **Solving for T₁_classical:** Using the total kinetic energy `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`, we substitute to get `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV`, which gives `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n    *   `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\nThis result is also unanimously correct in the candidate answers.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate T₁ using the Correct (Relativistic) Formula\n\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The energy-momentum relation is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   **Equating Momenta:** Since `p` is the same for both fragments, we can equate the expressions for `(pc)²`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving for T₁:** We substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁` (from Step 2). All energies are in GeV.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Combine the `T₁` terms:\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n*   `T₁_relativistic = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\nThis relativistic calculation is also consistent and correct across all provided solutions.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Difference and Convert Units\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct value and the classical approximation.\n*   Difference = `T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n\nThe final answer needs to be in MeV. We use the conversion `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n*   Difference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mathematical and physical derivation is robust and consistently leads to a difference of 5 MeV across all candidate solutions that show their work. The discrepancies in the final letter choices among the candidate answers are due to different option mappings. For the options provided in this specific problem context:\n\nA) 20 MeV.\nB) 10 MeV.\nC) 2 MeV.\nD) 5 MeV.\n\nThe calculated result of 5 MeV corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a systematic, step-by-step breakdown of the solution based on the physics principles involved.\n\n**1. Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fission Fragments**\n\n*   **Initial State:** The rest-mass energy of the initial nucleus is `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final State Rest-Mass Energy:** The sum of the rest masses of the two fragments (`m₁` and `m₂`) is 99% of the initial mass. This means the sum of their rest-mass energies is 99% of the initial rest-mass energy.\n    *   `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Mass Ratio:** The more massive fragment (`m₁`) is twice the mass of the other (`m₂`), so `m₁ = 2m₂`. This translates directly to their rest-mass energies: `m₁c² = 2 * (m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving for Individual Energies:** We now solve the system of two equations:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2 * (m₂c²)`\n    Substitute the second equation into the first:\n    `2 * (m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    `3 * (m₂c²) = 297 GeV`\n    `m₂c² = 99 GeV` (Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment).\n    From this, the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m₁`) is:\n    `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-Value)**\n\nThe energy lost in rest mass is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments. This is known as the Q-value.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\nSo, the total kinetic energy shared between the two fragments is 3 GeV.\n\n**3. Calculate the Kinetic Energy `T₁` using the Classical Approximation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total final momentum must be zero. This means the fragments fly apart with momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies that for a given momentum `p`, the kinetic energy is inversely proportional to the mass.\n*   **Energy Ratio:** We can find the ratio of the fragments' kinetic energies:\n    `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁`.\n    Since `m₁ = 2m₂`, the ratio `m₂ / m₁` is 1/2.\n    `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = 1/2`, which means `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   **Solving for `T₁_classical`:** We use the total kinetic energy `T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`:\n    `T₁_classical + (2 * T₁_classical) = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Kinetic Energy `T₁` using the Correct (Relativistic) Formula**\n\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The momentum `p` is still the same for both fragments. The relativistic relationship connecting kinetic energy `T`, rest-mass energy `mc²`, and momentum is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   **Equating Momenta:** Since `|p₁| = |p₂|`, we can equate `(p*c)²` for each fragment:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving for `T₁`:** Substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and the energy conservation relation `T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    Expand both sides (all energies in GeV):\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n    The `T₁²` term appears on both sides and can be cancelled:\n    `396T₁ = 9 - 6T₁ + 594 - 198T₁`\n    Group the terms:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\nThis is the correct, relativistic value for `T₁`.\n\n**5. Find the Difference and Convert to MeV**\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct `T₁` and the classically calculated `T₁`.\n*   Difference = `T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\nFinally, convert this value to MeV, knowing that `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n*   Difference = `0.005 GeV * (1000 MeV / GeV) = 5 MeV`.\n\nMatching this calculated result to the provided options:\nA) 20 MeV.\nB) 10 MeV.\nC) 2 MeV.\nD) 5 MeV.\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, verifying the calculations from the provided answers and identifying any points of contention.\n\n### 1. Verification of the Calculation\nThe core of the problem involves a series of calculations. A review of all candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the methodology and numerical results at each step.\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments.**\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: `E_initial = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Total final rest-mass energy: `E_final_rest = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n    *   The rest-mass energies of the fragments (`E1_rest` for the massive one, `E2_rest` for the lighter one) are related by `E1_rest = 2 * E2_rest`.\n    *   Solving the system `E1_rest + E2_rest = 297 GeV` and `E1_rest = 2 * E2_rest` gives:\n        *   `E2_rest = 99 GeV`\n        *   `E1_rest = 198 GeV`\n    *   This step is correctly performed by all agents.\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value).**\n    *   The energy lost in rest mass is converted to kinetic energy: `Q = E_initial - E_final_rest`.\n    *   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n    *   This step is also universally correct in all provided solutions.\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T1_classical`).**\n    *   From conservation of momentum, `|p1| = |p2|`.\n    *   In classical mechanics, `T = p^2 / (2m)`, so kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass.\n    *   `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 1/2`.\n    *   Combined with `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`, this gives `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n    *   This result is consistently and correctly calculated.\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the correct relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T1_relativistic`).**\n    *   The relativistic momentum relation is `(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2T(mc^2)`.\n    *   Equating the momenta of the two fragments and solving the resulting equation (`T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`) gives:\n    *   `T1_relativistic = 1.005 GeV`.\n    *   This result is also consistently and correctly calculated by all agents.\n\n*   **Step 5: Find the difference.**\n    *   Difference = `T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n    *   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n\n*   **Step 6: Convert the difference to MeV.**\n    *   `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n    *   Difference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### 2.

The difference between the correct (relativistic) kinetic energy and the classically approximated value is **5 MeV**. Based on the options presented in the question:\nA) 2 MeV.\nB) 20 MeV.\nC) 5 MeV.\nD) 10 MeV.\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the physics problem and the methods presented by the candidate agents, the correct solution is derived as follows.\n\n### **1. Calculation of Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n\nFirst, we must determine the rest-mass energies of the two fragments resulting from the fission.\n*   **Initial Rest-Mass Energy (`E_initial`):** The parent nucleus is at rest with `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Total Final Rest-Mass Energy (`E_final_rest`):** The sum of the rest-masses of the two fragments (`m₁` and `m₂`) is 99% of the initial mass. Therefore, their combined rest-mass energy is:\n    `E_final_rest = (m₁ + m₂)c² = 0.99 * Mc² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Individual Fragment Energies:** We are given that the more massive fragment (`m₁`) is twice the mass of the other (`m₁ = 2m₂`). This relationship also applies to their rest-mass energies (`E_rest₁ = 2 * E_rest₂`). We can solve this system of equations:\n    1.  `E_rest₁ + E_rest₂ = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `E_rest₁ = 2 * E_rest₂`\n*   Substituting the second equation into the first:\n    `(2 * E_rest₂) + E_rest₂ = 297 GeV`\n    `3 * E_rest₂ = 297 GeV`\n    `E_rest₂ = 99 GeV` (rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment)\n    `E_rest₁ = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV` (rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment)\n\n### **2. Calculation of Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy \"lost\" from rest mass is converted into the kinetic energy (`Q`) of the fragments.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### **3. Calculation of T₁ (Classical Approximation)**\n\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, by the law of conservation of momentum, the two fragments must fly apart with momenta of equal magnitude (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`) and opposite direction.\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is therefore `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`. This gives `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`.\n    `T₁_classical + 2 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   So, `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n### **4. Calculation of T₁ (Correct Relativistic Value)**\n\nWe still use the conservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂|`), but with the relativistic energy-momentum relation: `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since `p₁` and `p₂` are equal, we can set `(p₁c)²` equal to `(p₂c)²`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`\n*   Substitute the known values (with all energies in GeV): `m₁c² = 198`, `m₂c² = 99`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Expand and simplify the equation:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms cancel out from both sides:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Solve for the correct kinetic energy, `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### **5. Final Difference**\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n*   `Difference = T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   To get the final answer in MeV, we use the conversion `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n    `Difference = 0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nComparing this result to the provided options:\nA) 2 MeV.\nB) 20 MeV.\nC) 10 MeV.\nD) 5 MeV.\n\nThe calculated value of 5 MeV matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis problem requires calculating the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T1`) using both relativistic and classical physics, and then finding the difference.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n*   **Initial Rest-Mass Energy:** `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Sum of Final Rest-Mass Energies:** The fragments' combined mass is 99% of the initial mass. Thus, the sum of their rest-mass energies is `E_final_rest = (m₁ + m₂)c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Mass Ratio:** The more massive fragment (`m₁`) is twice the mass of the other (`m₂`), so `m₁ = 2m₂`. This also applies to their rest-mass energies: `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving for Individual Energies:** We have a system of two equations:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²) `\n    Substitute (2) into (1): `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`.\n    This gives `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`, so `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n    The rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment is `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\nThe energy released is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies, which is converted to kinetic energy.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, conservation of momentum requires the two fragments to have momenta of equal magnitude (`p`) and opposite direction.\n*   Classical kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   This implies that kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass: `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`, or `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting the ratio: `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV` => `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate T1 using the Correct (Relativistic) Formula**\nWe still use the conservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`). The relativistic relation between momentum, kinetic energy, and rest-mass energy is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since the momentum values are equal, `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`\n*   Substitute the known values (all in GeV): `m₁c² = 198`, `m₂c² = 99`, and from the Q-value, `T₂ = 3 - T₁`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Expand and simplify:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms cancel out from both sides:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Solve for T₁:\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`. This is the correct relativistic kinetic energy.\n\n### **Step 5: Calculate the Difference and Convert Units**\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\n*   Difference = `T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\nThe question asks for the answer in MeV. Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV:\n*   Difference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nMatching this result to the given options:\nA) 10 MeV.\nB) 20 MeV.\nC) 5 MeV.\nD) 2 MeV.\n\nThe calculated difference is 5 MeV, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the physics problem.\n\n**1. Initial State and Final State Parameters**\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus is at rest. Its rest-mass energy, `E_initial = Mc²`, is 300 GeV. Its initial momentum is zero.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments. Let's call their rest masses `m₁` and `m₂`.\n*   **Mass Relationship:** One fragment is twice as massive as the other. We'll define `m₁` as the more massive fragment, so `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n*   **Sum of Final Rest Masses:** The sum of the fragments' rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n\n**2. Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\nIt is most convenient to work with rest-mass energies (`E_rest = mc²`).\n*   The sum of the rest-mass energies of the fragments is:\n    `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * (Mc²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   The mass relationship `m₁ = 2m₂` translates directly to the rest-mass energies: `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n*   We now solve this system of two equations:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n*   Substitute the second equation into the first:\n    `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`\n    `m₂c² = 99 GeV` (Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment).\n*   From this, we find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment:\n    `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\nBy the law of conservation of energy, the \"lost\" rest-mass energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   `Q = Total Kinetic Energy = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\nThe total kinetic energy shared between the fragments is 3 GeV.\n\n**4. Calculate `T₁` using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest (`p_initial = 0`), the fragments must fly apart with momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies `p² = 2mT`.\n*   Equating the expressions for `p²`: `2m₁T₁_classical = 2m₂T₂_classical`, which gives the ratio `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁`.\n*   Since `m₁ = 2m₂`, the ratio is `1/2`. Therefore, `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   We use the total kinetic energy: `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substitute the ratio: `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV`, which gives `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   So, the classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**5. Calculate `T₁` using the Correct (Relativistic) Formulas**\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The relationship between momentum, kinetic energy (`T`), and rest-mass energy (`mc²`) is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   **Equating Momenta:** Since `|p₁| = |p₂|`, their `(pc)²` terms are also equal:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving for `T₁`:** Substitute the known values (all in GeV): `T₂ = 3 - T₁`, `m₁c² = 198`, and `m₂c² = 99`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Expand the equation:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel each other out.\n    `396T₁ = 9 - 6T₁ + 594 - 198T₁`\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Isolate `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n*   So, the correct relativistic kinetic energy is `T₁_relativistic = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**6. Find the Difference and Convert to MeV**\nThe final step is to find the difference between the correct value and the classical approximation.\n*   Difference = `T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\nFinally, convert this difference to MeV, using the conversion `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n*   Difference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 20 MeV.\nB) 10 MeV.\nC) 2 MeV.\nD) 5 MeV.\n\nThe calculated difference is 5 MeV, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, synthesized from the consistent reasoning of the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **1. Identify Initial and Final State Parameters**\n*   **Initial State**: A nucleus at rest, meaning its initial momentum is zero. Its rest-mass energy is `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final State**: The nucleus fissions into two fragments, `m₁` (the more massive) and `m₂` (the less massive).\n*   **Fragment Mass Relation**: One fragment is twice as massive as the other. All candidate solutions correctly interpret this as `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n*   **Final Mass Sum**: The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n\n### **2. Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\nIt is most convenient to work in units of rest-mass energy (`mc²`).\n1.  From the mass relation, we have `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n2.  From the final mass sum, the total rest-mass energy of the fragments is `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * (Mc²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n3.  We now solve this system of two equations by substituting the first into the second:\n    `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`\n    This gives the rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment: `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n4.  And the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m₁`): `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\nBy the conservation of energy, the \"lost\" rest-mass energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - (m₁c² + m₂c²) `\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\nThis total kinetic energy of 3 GeV is shared between the two fragments.\n\n### **4. Calculate `T₁` using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n*   **Conservation of Momentum**: Because the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must fly apart with momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy**: The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies that `p²` is equal for both fragments: `2m₁T₁_classical = 2m₂T₂_classical`.\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies**: From the momentum equality, we find the ratio of kinetic energies is inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses: `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`. Thus, `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   **Solving for `T₁_classical`**: We use the total kinetic energy:\n    `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n### **5. Calculate `T₁` using the Correct (Relativistic) Formula**\n*   **Relativistic Momentum**: We still use the conservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂|`). The relativistic relationship between kinetic energy `T`, rest-mass energy `mc²`, and momentum `p` is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   **Equating Momenta**: Since `p` is the same for both fragments, we can equate the expressions for `(pc)²`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Solving for `T₁`**: We substitute the known values (with all energies in GeV): `T₂ = 3 - T₁`, `m₁c² = 198`, and `m₂c² = 99`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides of the equation cancel out:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Combine the terms with `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`. This is the correct relativistic kinetic energy.\n\n### **6. Find the Difference and Convert to Final Units**\n*   The difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\n    Difference = `T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n    Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   The question asks for the answer in MeV. We use the conversion `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n    Difference = `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe calculation robustly yields a difference of **5 MeV**.

Calculation of Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n\n*   **Initial State:** The initial nucleus has a rest-mass energy `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final State Rest Energy:** The nucleus splits into two fragments, `m₁` and `m₂`. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass. Therefore, the sum of their rest-mass energies is:\n    `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * (Mc²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Individual Fragment Energies:** We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other (`m₁ = 2m₂`). This ratio also applies to their rest-mass energies (`m₁c² = 2m₂c²`). We can now solve the system of equations:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n*   Substituting the second equation into the first:\n    `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`\n    This gives the rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment: `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n*   The rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment is `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\nThis step is performed correctly and consistently by all candidate answers.\n\n### **2. Calculation of Total Kinetic Energy (Q-Value)**\n\nThe energy lost from rest mass is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments. This is known as the Q-value.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\nThis value is also consistently and correctly calculated by all agents. The fragments share a total kinetic energy of 3 GeV.\n\n### **3. Calculation of T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the two fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`).\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies that kinetic energy is inversely proportional to mass.\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:** `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p²/2m₁) / (p²/2m₂) = m₂/m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   This gives us `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`, we can substitute to find `T₁_classical`:\n    `T₁_classical + 2(T₁_classical) = 3 GeV`\n    `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\nThis result is correct and agreed upon by all agents.\n\n### **4. Calculation of T₁ using the Correct (Relativistic) Formula**\n\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The momenta are still equal (`|p₁| = |p₂|`). The relativistic relationship between momentum, kinetic energy, and rest-mass energy is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   **Equating Momenta:** We set the `(pc)²` expressions for both fragments equal to each other:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`\n*   We substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and the energy conservation relation `T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Expanding the equation:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out. We can now solve for `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\nThis relativistic value is correct and consistently derived in all provided solutions.\n\n### **5. Calculation of the Final Difference**\n\nThe final step is to find the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation.\n*   `Difference = T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n\n### **6. Conversion to MeV**\n\nThe question asks for the answer in MeV. We use the conversion factor `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n*   `Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculation is robustly confirmed across all provided analyses.

Analysis of Candidate Solutions**\nAll candidate answers that show their detailed work follow the same physical principles and mathematical steps. They consistently calculate that the difference between the correct (relativistic) kinetic energy and the classical approximation is **5 MeV**. The only discrepancy between the answers is the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D), which indicates they were likely presented with differently ordered lists of options. Since the calculation is universally agreed upon, the task is to verify this calculation and select the correct option from the list provided in the question.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Verification**\n\n**Step A: Determine Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n*   The initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus is `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   The sum of the rest-mass energies of the two fragments (`m₁` and `m₂`) is 99% of the initial value: `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   We are given the mass relationship `m₁ = 2m₂`, which means the rest-mass energy relationship is `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n*   We can solve this system of two equations:\n    1. `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2. `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n*   Substituting (2) into (1) gives `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which simplifies to `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n*   This yields the rest-mass energies:\n    *   Lighter fragment: `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n    *   More massive fragment: `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**Step B: Calculate Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)**\n*   By conservation of energy, the energy released (Q-value) is the initial rest-mass energy minus the final rest-mass energy. This energy becomes the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**Step C: Calculate T₁ using the Classical Approximation**\n*   Since the nucleus was initially at rest, the law of conservation of momentum requires the two fragments to have momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   The ratio of the kinetic energies is therefore inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses: `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n*   This gives `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   We know `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = Q = 3 GeV`. Substituting the ratio: `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   This gives `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`, so `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**Step D: Calculate T₁ using the Correct (Relativistic) Formula**\n*   The relativistic relationship between momentum, kinetic energy (`T`), and rest-mass energy (`mc²`) is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since the momentum magnitude `p` is the same for both fragments, we can equate `(pc)²`:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   Substitute the known values (in GeV): `m₁c²=198`, `m₂c²=99`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Solving for `T₁`:\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`. This is the correct relativistic kinetic energy.\n\n**Step E: Calculate the Difference and Convert Units**\n*   The difference is `T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical`.\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n*   To get the answer in MeV, we use the conversion `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n    Difference = `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n### **3.

All agents who showed their detailed work arrived at the same numerical result, with discrepancies only arising from the final mapping of that number to a lettered choice, likely due to variations in the options presented to each agent.\n\nHere is a step-by-step verification of the calculation, which is consistent with the reasoning provided by the candidate answers.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n*   Initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus is `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the two fragments (`m₁` and `m₂`) is 99% of the initial mass. Thus, the sum of their rest-mass energies is `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let `m₁` be the more massive one, so `m₁ = 2m₂`. This translates to `m₁c² = 2 * m₂c²`.\n*   We solve the system of two equations:\n    1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    2.  `m₁c² = 2 * m₂c²`\n*   Substituting the second equation into the first yields `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`, which simplifies to `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n*   This gives the rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment as `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n*   The rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment is `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\nThe Q-value is the energy released during fission, which is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments (`T₁ + T₂`).\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Kinetic Energy of the More Massive Fragment (T1) using Classical Approximation**\n*   Since the initial nucleus was at rest, conservation of momentum requires the two fragments to have equal and opposite momenta (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`).\n*   The classical formula for kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   The ratio of the kinetic energies is therefore `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`. This gives `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   Substituting this into the total kinetic energy equation: `T₁_classical + 2*T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   This simplifies to `3*T₁_classical = 3 GeV`, so `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Correct Kinetic Energy (T1) using Relativistic Formulas**\n*   The momenta are still equal (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`).\n*   The relativistic relationship between momentum, kinetic energy (`T`), and rest-mass energy (`mc²`) is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since the `(pc)²` terms are equal for both fragments, we can set up the equation:\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   Substitute the known values (in GeV): `m₁c² = 198`, `m₂c² = 99`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms cancel out from both sides. We then solve for `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`. This is the correct relativistic kinetic energy.\n\n**Step 5: Find the Difference**\n*   The difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\n    `Difference = T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n\n**Step 6: Convert to MeV and Select the Final Answer**\n*   To get the result in MeV, we use the conversion `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n    `Difference = 0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n*   The calculated difference is 5 MeV. Matching this value to the options provided in the question:\n    A) 20 MeV.\n    B) 10 MeV.\n    C) 5 MeV.\n    D) 2 MeV.\n*   The correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the underlying physics and the calculation steps.

Determine Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n*   **Initial Rest-Mass Energy:** The nucleus is at rest, `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final Rest-Mass Energy Sum:** The fragments' rest masses sum to 99% of the initial mass. Therefore, their combined rest-mass energy is `E_final_rest = m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   **Individual Fragment Energies:** We have two conditions:\n    1.  The mass relationship: `m₁ = 2m₂`, which implies `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n    2.  The sum of their rest-mass energies: `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`.\n*   Solving this system of equations by substituting the first into the second:\n    `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`\n    `m₂c² = 99 GeV` (Rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment).\n    `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV` (Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment).\n\n**2. Calculate Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)**\nThe energy released in the fission (Q-value) is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies, which is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - E_final_rest = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate `T₁` using the Classical Approximation (`T₁_classical`)**\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, by conservation of momentum, the fragments must have momenta of equal magnitude (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`).\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   The ratio of kinetic energies is therefore inversely proportional to the mass ratio: `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1 / 2`.\n*   This means `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting for T₂: `T₁_classical + 2*T₁_classical = 3 GeV` => `3*T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   So, `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate `T₁` using the Correct Relativistic Formula (`T₁_correct`)**\nWe again use the conservation of momentum (`|p₁| = |p₂| = p`). The relativistic relationship between kinetic energy (`T`), rest-mass energy (`mc²`), and momentum (`p`) is given by `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Since the momenta are equal: `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   Substitute the known values (`m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 - T₁`):\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Expand the equation:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms cancel out. Simplify the remaining terms:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Solve for `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁_correct = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**5.

Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\n*   The initial rest-mass energy of the parent nucleus is `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   The nucleus splits into a more massive fragment (m₁) and a less massive one (m₂).\n*   **Mass Relationship:** We are given `m₁ = 2m₂`. This translates directly to their rest-mass energies: `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n*   **Final Mass Sum:** The sum of the fragments' rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`. In terms of energy, this is `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * (Mc²)`.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Sum of final rest-mass energies = `0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n    *   We now solve the system of equations:\n        1.  `m₁c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n        2.  `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`\n    *   Substituting equation (2) into (1): `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV` -> `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`.\n    *   This gives the rest-mass energy of the lighter fragment: `m₂c² = 99 GeV`.\n    *   And for the more massive fragment: `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\n*   The Q-value is the energy released from the loss of rest mass, which is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   The two fragments share a total of 3 GeV of kinetic energy.\n\n**3. Calculate T₁ using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments fly apart with momenta of equal magnitude and opposite direction: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** `T = p² / (2m)`. This implies that `p² = 2mT`.\n*   Since `p²` is the same for both fragments, we can write `2m₁T₁,classical = 2m₂T₂,classical`.\n*   This gives the ratio `T₁,classical / T₂,classical = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`. Therefore, `T₂,classical = 2 * T₁,classical`.\n*   Using the total kinetic energy: `T₁,classical + T₂,classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substituting the ratio: `T₁,classical + 2T₁,classical = 3 GeV` -> `3T₁,classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   So, the classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is `T₁,classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate T₁ using the Correct (Relativistic) Formula**\n\n*   We again use the fact that the momenta are equal (`p₁ = p₂`).\n*   The relativistic relationship between momentum, kinetic energy (`T`), and rest-mass energy (`mc²`) is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n*   Equating the momenta for both fragments: `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   Substitute the known values (all in GeV): `T₂ = 3 - T₁`, `m₁c² = 198`, and `m₂c² = 99`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Expand and simplify:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Solve for `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n*   The correct (relativistic) kinetic energy is `T₁,correct = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**5. Calculate the Difference**\n\n*   The difference between the correct and classical values is:\n    `Difference = T₁,correct - T₁,classical`\n    `Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n\n**6.
