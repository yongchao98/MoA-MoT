    "The expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) of a moving point charge are known as the Li√©nard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations and account for the finite speed of light, meaning the field observed at a point and time (t) was generated by the charge at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time (tr).\n\nThe correct formulas are:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)}$ and $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o q \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)}$\n\nRearranging the denominator by multiplying the numerator and denominator by c gives:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions match option B. The term in the denominator, $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$, is a crucial modification to the static potentials and arises from the relativistic effects of the moving charge. Specifically, it accounts for the change in the apparent volume of the charge distribution due to its motion relative to the observer.\n\n*   **Option A** is incorrect because it uses a plus sign in the denominator. This would correspond to the \"advanced\" potentials, which describe a field that exists before it was generated, a solution that is typically dismissed on grounds of causality.\n*   **Options C and D** are incorrect because they start with the formula for the static potential, $V = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}$, which is only valid for a stationary charge. The potential for a moving charge must account for the effects of its velocity, which significantly alters the expression.\n\n<<<B>>>"
