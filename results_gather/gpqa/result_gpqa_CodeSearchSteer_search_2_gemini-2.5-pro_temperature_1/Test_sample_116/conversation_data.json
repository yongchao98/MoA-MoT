    "### Analysis of the Organic Moieties for Optical Isomerism:\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality, as seen in some substituted biphenyls.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This compound is a substituted biphenyl. Biphenyls can exhibit a type of chirality called atropisomerism when rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is restricted. This restriction is caused by bulky substituents in the ortho-positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). In this molecule, all four ortho-positions are occupied by large groups (nitro and dimethyl carboxylate groups). This significant steric hindrance prevents the two rings from becoming coplanar, and the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. This makes the molecule chiral and thus capable of showing optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This molecule, also known as methyl lactate, has a central carbon atom (the second carbon) that is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methyl ester group (-COOCH3). Since this carbon has four different substituents, it is a chiral center. Molecules with a single chiral center are optically active. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The chemical name for benzophenone is diphenylmethanone. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. To be a chiral center, a carbon atom must be bonded to four different groups. Since this carbon is sp2 hybridized and bonded to only three groups (one oxygen and two phenyls), it is not a chiral center. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond, and its overall structure is planar. It possesses a center of inversion and a plane of symmetry, which makes it achiral. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nBased on this analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate (1) and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2) are the compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<C>>>"
