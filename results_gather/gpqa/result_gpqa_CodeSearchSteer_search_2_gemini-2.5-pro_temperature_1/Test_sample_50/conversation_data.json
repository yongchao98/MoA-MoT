    "The problem asks for the calculation of the net potential energy of a system composed of a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` (where `d > R`). This is a classic problem in electrostatics that is typically solved using the method of images.\n\n### Method of Images\n\nTo solve this, we can replace the grounded conducting sphere with an \"image charge\" `q'`. This image charge, when placed at a specific location inside the sphere, will replicate the electric field outside the sphere exactly. For a point charge `q` at distance `d` from the center of a grounded sphere of radius `R`, the image charge is:\n\n*   **Magnitude `q'`**: `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n*   **Position `b`**: Located at a distance `b = R^2 / d` from the center, along the line connecting the center and the charge `q`.\n\nThe sphere itself is grounded, meaning its potential is zero. Therefore, its contribution to the potential energy, which would be `(1/2) * Q_sphere * V_sphere`, is zero.\n\n### Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance to its final position at distance `d`. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charge on the sphere. The field of the induced charge is identical to the field of the image charge `q'`.\n\nThe potential at the location of charge `q` due to the image charge `q'` is:\n\n`V_image = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n\nThe distance between `q` (at `d`) and `q'` (at `b = R^2/d`) is `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n\nSo, the potential created by the image charge at the location of the real charge `q` is:\n\n`V_image = k * [ - (R/d) * q ] / [ (d^2 - R^2)/d ]`\n`V_image = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nA common mistake is to assume the potential energy is simply `U = q * V_image`. However, this is incorrect because the induced charge (and thus the image charge) is not a fixed source; it is created by the presence of `q`. The work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity is given by `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`. This factor of 1/2 accounts for the fact that the source of the potential (the induced charge) is itself dependent on the charge being moved.\n\nTherefore, the net potential energy of the system is:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_image`\n`U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis can also be derived by integrating the force on the charge `q` as it is brought from infinity. The force on `q` at a distance `x` from the center is the force from its image `q' = -qR/x` at `x' = R^2/x`. The integral of this force gives the same result.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\n\n*   A) `U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)`\n*   B) `U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)`\n*   C) `U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)`\n*   D) `U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)`\n\nOur derived expression `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)` matches option A perfectly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
