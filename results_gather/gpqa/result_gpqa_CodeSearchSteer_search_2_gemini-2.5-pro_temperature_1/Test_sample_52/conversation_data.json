    "Based on the provided spectroscopic data, the chemical formula of the unknown compound is determined as follows:\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum:** The presence of an ester group (-COO-) is confirmed.\n\n2.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents, having the base formula C6H4. The fact that the 1H NMR spectrum shows only two signals for the aromatic protons strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern.\n\n3.  **1H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **No –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of information that rules out many possibilities, such as an ethyl ester or a propyl group.\n    *   **Two –CH3 signals:** There are two distinct methyl groups in the molecule.\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals:** The presence of vinyl protons indicates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). The splitting patterns provide the structure of this group. A doublet of quartets for one vinyl-H indicates it is coupled to another vinyl-H (creating the doublet) and a methyl group (creating the quartet). A doublet for the other vinyl-H indicates it is coupled to only the first vinyl-H. This pattern uniquely identifies a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3).\n    *   **Assembling the structure:** One substituent is the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3), which accounts for the vinyl signals and one of the -CH3 signals. The second substituent is an ester. To account for the second -CH3 signal without introducing any -CH2- groups, it must be a methyl ester (-COOCH3).\n\n4.  **Molecular Formula Calculation:** The identified structure is methyl p-propenylbenzoate. Let's calculate its molecular formula:\n    *   Aromatic ring (C6H4): 6 Carbons, 4 Hydrogens\n    *   Propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): 3 Carbons, 5 Hydrogens\n    *   Methyl ester group (-COOCH3): 2 Carbons, 3 Hydrogens, 2 Oxygens\n    *   **Total Carbons:** 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n    *   **Total Hydrogens:** 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n    *   **Total Oxygens:** 2\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**. This matches option C. Other isomers with the formula C11H12O2, such as ethyl cinnamate or cinnamyl acetate, can be ruled out because their NMR spectra would not match the given data (e.g., cinnamyl acetate has a -CH2- group and ethyl cinnamate has both a -CH2- group and a monosubstituted aromatic ring).\n\n<<<C>>>"
