    "To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with parallax, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Assume a uniform star distribution.** This means the number of stars per unit volume, known as the number density (ρ), is constant everywhere in space.\n\n2.  **Relate the number of stars to distance.** Consider a thin spherical shell of space with a radius *d* and a small thickness *dd*. The volume of this shell (*dV*) is its surface area (4πd²) multiplied by its thickness (*dd*).\n    *   dV = 4πd² * dd\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of stars in the shell.** With a constant star density (ρ), the number of stars (*dN*) in this volume is the density multiplied by the volume.\n    *   dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd\n\n4.  **Introduce parallax.** Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (*d*). The relationship is given by:\n    *   d = 1/plx\n\n5.  **Express the change in distance in terms of the change in parallax.** We need to find how the shell's thickness (*dd*) relates to a small interval of parallax (*d(plx)*). We can find this by taking the derivative of the distance equation with respect to parallax.\n    *   dd/d(plx) = -1/plx²\n    *   Ignoring the negative sign, which only indicates that distance and parallax are inversely related, we get: dd = (1/plx²) * d(plx)\n\n6.  **Substitute the parallax relations back into the star count equation.** Now, replace *d* with *1/plx* and *dd* with *(1/plx²) * d(plx)* in the equation for *dN*.\n    *   dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)\n\n7.  **Simplify the expression.**\n    *   dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)\n\n8.  **Find the number of stars per unit parallax.** The quantity we are looking for is the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is *dN/d(plx)*.\n    *   dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴\n\nSince 4, π, and ρ are all constants, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to 1/plx⁴. This means that as parallax decreases (i.e., as we look at stars farther away), the number of stars within a given parallax interval increases very rapidly.\n\n<<<B>>>"
