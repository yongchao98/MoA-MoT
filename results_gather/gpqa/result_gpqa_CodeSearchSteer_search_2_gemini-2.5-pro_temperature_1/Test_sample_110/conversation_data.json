    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the major products, A and B.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\nThis is a Michael addition reaction. The t-BuOK (potassium tert-butoxide) is a strong, sterically hindered base that will deprotonate the ketone to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n\n1.  **Formation of the Enolate (Michael Donor):** The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. To form an enolate, an α-hydrogen (a hydrogen on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) must be removed.\n    *   The carbon at position 2 is a quaternary carbon, substituted with both an ethyl and a methyl group, so it has no α-hydrogens.\n    *   The carbon at position 6 has one methyl group and one α-hydrogen.\n    *   Due to the absence of α-hydrogens at position 2, the base can only abstract the proton from position 6. This enolate is the Michael donor.\n\n2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate formed at C-6 will attack the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (the Michael acceptor) in a conjugate addition.\n\n3.  **Product Structure (A):** The reaction forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C-6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n4.  **IUPAC Naming of Product A:** To name the resulting molecule as a propanoate derivative (as given in the options), the ethyl propanoate chain is considered the parent chain. The cyclohexanone ring is treated as a substituent on this chain.\n    *   The parent chain is `ethyl propanoate`.\n    *   The cyclohexyl ring is attached to carbon 3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   For naming the substituent ring, the point of attachment (the original C-6) is numbered as C-1. This carbon has a methyl group.\n    *   The ketone group (original C-1) is now at position 2 of the substituent ring.\n    *   The original C-2, which has both an ethyl and a methyl group, is now at position 3 of the substituent ring.\n    *   Combining these pieces, the substituent is named `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Therefore, the full IUPAC name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\nThis is also a Michael addition reaction. The base (KOH) deprotonates the nitroalkane, which then acts as the nucleophile.\n\n1.  **Formation of the Nitronate (Michael Donor):** KOH, a strong base, removes an acidic α-hydrogen from 1-nitropropane (`CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂`) to form a stabilized carbanion known as a nitronate ion.\n\n2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The nucleophilic carbon of the nitronate ion attacks the β-carbon of the (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH=CH-CN`), which is the Michael acceptor. The attack occurs at the carbon bearing the methyl group.\n\n3.  **Product Structure (B):** A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. The resulting intermediate is then protonated by water to give the final product.\n\n4.  **IUPAC Naming of Product B:**\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the molecule is named as a derivative of a nitrile. The nitrile carbon is C-1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile group is six carbons long, making it a hexanenitrile.\n    *   Numbering the chain from the nitrile: `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)-CH(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group on C-3 and a nitro group on C-4.\n    *   Therefore, the IUPAC name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) Incorrect A, Correct B\n*   B) Incorrect A, Incorrect B\n*   C) Correct A, Correct B\n*   D) Correct A, Incorrect B\n\nThe correct choice is the one that accurately identifies both products.\n\n<<<C>>>"
