    "The experiment described tracks the fate of an oral antigen (rotavirus proteins) to the Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs in the intestine. The isolation of a *proliferating* cell population within these Peyer's patches indicates an active immune response is occurring, specifically within structures known as germinal centers. The key finding is the *high variability* observed in the *variable heavy chain gene* of these proliferating B cells. This points directly to the process of somatic hypermutation.\n\nHere is a breakdown of why the other options are incorrect:\n*   **A) VDJ recombination:** This is the initial process that assembles the variable region genes in developing B cells in the bone marrow (a primary lymphoid organ), *before* they encounter an antigen. The experiment observes a response to an antigen in a secondary lymphoid organ, not initial B cell development.\n*   **B) Class switching recombination:** This process changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain, which alters the antibody's effector function (e.g., switching from IgM to IgA). It does not affect the variable region, and therefore would not account for the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain gene sequence.\n*   **D) Complement activation:** This is part of the innate immune system and involves a cascade of proteins that help to clear pathogens. It does not involve any genetic changes in B cells.\n\n**Somatic hypermutation (SHM)** is a cellular mechanism that occurs in activated, proliferating B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs like the Peyer's patches. This process deliberately introduces point mutations into the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes. The purpose of SHM is to generate B cell receptors with varied affinities for the antigen. B cells with higher-affinity receptors are then selected to survive and differentiate, leading to a more effective antibody response, a process known as affinity maturation. The observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene is the classic signature of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
