    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the number of 1H NMR signals for the final product.\n\n### **Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Starting Material:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Hell-Vollhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction, which causes the alpha-halogenation of a carboxylic acid. The alpha-carbon of acetic acid is brominated.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n### **Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid, BrCH₂COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid is converted into an ethyl ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n### **Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate, BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (S₂2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n### **Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate, NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH₂)₅Br).\n*   **Reaction:**\n    1.  Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the alpha-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate. This carbon is acidic because it is positioned between two electron-withdrawing groups (a cyano group and a carbonyl group). This forms a stable enolate anion: [NC-CH-COOCH₂CH₃]⁻.\n    2.  The enolate anion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the electrophilic carbons attached to a bromine atom in 1,5-dibromopentane.\n    3.  Since 1,5-dibromopentane has two bromine atoms and the reaction uses an excess of base to generate the enolate, two molecules of the ethyl cyanoacetate enolate react with one molecule of 1,5-dibromopentane, one at each end.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is formed by linking two ethyl cyanoacetate units with a pentane chain.\n    (CH₃CH₂OOC)(CN)CH–(CH₂)₅–CH(CN)(COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n### **Analysis of ¹H NMR Signals for Product 4**\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is (EtOOC)(CN)CH–CH₂–CH₂–CH₂–CH₂–CH₂–CH(CN)(COOEt). This molecule has two chiral centers, at the carbons bearing the cyano and ester groups. The formation of the second chiral center occurs in the presence of the first, leading to the formation of diastereomers:\n*   A chiral pair of enantiomers: (R,R) and (S,S). These two will have identical NMR spectra.\n*   An achiral meso compound: (R,S).\n\nStatistically, the reaction will produce a mixture of these diastereomers in a 1:2:1 ratio of (R,R) : (R,S) : (S,S). This means the meso-(R,S) form is the major product. The question asks for the number of observable signals in the spectrum of the product, which is most reasonably interpreted as asking for the number of signals for the major component.\n\nLet's analyze the symmetry and count the signals for the **meso-(R,S) isomer**:\n\n*   **Symmetry:** A meso compound is achiral and possesses an internal plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion. For this molecule, we can identify a plane of symmetry that contains the central CH₂ group of the pentane chain and bisects the rest of the molecule. The two halves are mirror images.\n*   **Signal Counting:** Protons or groups that are reflected into each other by the plane of symmetry are chemically equivalent. We must also consider diastereotopicity.\n\nLet's label the different types of protons:\n(CH₃ᵃCH₂ᵇOOC)(CN)CHᶜ–CH₂ᵈ–CH₂ᵉ–CH₂ᶠ–CH₂ᵉ–CH₂ᵈ–CHᶜ(CN)(COOCH₂ᵇCH₃ᵃ)\n\n1.  **Protons a (CH₃):** The two methyl groups are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. They give **1 signal**.\n2.  **Protons b (O-CH₂):** The two ethyl methylene groups are equivalent. However, each is adjacent to a chiral center (Cᶜ), making the two protons within each methylene group diastereotopic. This results in **2 signals**.\n3.  **Protons c (methine CH):** The two methine protons are equivalent by symmetry. They give **1 signal**.\n4.  **Protons d (bridge CH₂):** The two CH₂ groups adjacent to the methine carbons are equivalent. The protons within each group are diastereotopic because they are adjacent to a chiral center. This gives **2 signals**.\n5.  **Protons e (bridge CH₂):** The next two CH₂ groups in the chain are also equivalent by symmetry. The protons within each group are diastereotopic because they are in an achiral molecule that contains stereocenters. This results in **2 signals**.\n6.  **Protons f (central bridge CH₂):** This single CH₂ group lies on the plane of symmetry. The two protons of this group are in different environments relative to the rest of the molecule and are not interchangeable. They are diastereotopic. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nAdding them up: 1 (a) + 2 (b) + 1 (c) + 2 (d) + 2 (e) + 2 (f) = **10 distinct hydrogen signals**.\n\nTherefore, the ¹H NMR spectrum of the major product (the meso isomer) will show 10 distinct signals.\n\n<<<D>>>"
