    "This is a multi-step organic chemistry problem that requires identifying the reactants, predicting the products of a Diels-Alder reaction, and then using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, specifically a 2D NOESY experiment, to determine the stereochemistry of the major product.\n\n1.  **Reactant Identification**: A *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride's ¹H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and its ¹³C NMR shows two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene) and 165 ppm (carbonyl). This spectroscopic data is characteristic of maleic anhydride. The high symmetry of maleic anhydride results in the two alkene protons being chemically equivalent, as are the two alkene carbons and the two carbonyl carbons.\n\n2.  **Reaction Identification**: Maleic anhydride (a dienophile) reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (a diene). This is a classic Diels-Alder reaction, a type of [4+2] cycloaddition. The reaction is stereospecific and typically yields two diastereomeric products: a major *endo* product and a minor *exo* product. The formation of the *endo* product is kinetically favored due to secondary orbital overlap in the transition state.\n\n3.  **Product Structure and Stereochemistry**: The reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative. The major product is the *endo* adduct. In this context, *endo* refers to the stereoisomer where the anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) of the bicyclic system as the one-carbon bridge (the C7 methylene group). The minor, or *exo*, product has the anhydride ring on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7 bridge.\n\n4.  **NMR Analysis (NOESY)**: A 2D NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) experiment shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), regardless of their bonding connectivity. The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product but absent in the minor one. We must identify which protons are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\n    *   **Proton Assignments**:\n        *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet)**: These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride portion of the bicyclic system.\n        *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet)**: These are the two equivalent methyl groups attached to the double bond (vinylic methyls).\n        *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet)**: These are the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n        *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet)**: This is one of the two protons on the C7 methylene bridge, likely the one *syn* to the double bond. It appears as a doublet due to coupling with the other bridge proton.\n\n    *   **Spatial Relationships**:\n        *   In the **major (*endo*) product**, the anhydride ring is *syn* to the C7 bridge. This geometry brings the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm) close to the *syn*-proton of the C7 bridge (~1.5 ppm).\n        *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, the anhydride ring is *anti* to the C7 bridge. In this arrangement, the anhydride protons are far from the C7 bridge protons. Instead, they are brought into proximity with the methyl groups on the double bond (~1.7 ppm).\n\n    *   **Conclusion**: The NOESY cross-peak that is present in the major (*endo*) product and absent in the minor (*exo*) product is the one connecting the anhydride protons and the C7 bridge proton. This corresponds to the resonances at ~3.5 ppm and ~1.5 ppm.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct option is the one that connects the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm and the 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm.\n\n<<<D>>>"
