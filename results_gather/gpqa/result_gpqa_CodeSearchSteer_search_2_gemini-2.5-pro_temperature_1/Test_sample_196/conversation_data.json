    "### Analysis of Compound X\n\n1.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   A very broad absorption in the range of **3400–2500 cm-1** is characteristic of the O-H stretching of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The strong peak at **1720 cm-1** corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Peaks at **1610 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1** are indicative of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet in this downfield region is a classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly suggests a para (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm is from the protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield signal at 7.2 ppm is from the protons adjacent to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Signals:**\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH3) next to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH3) next to a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons is consistent with a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to two different proton environments.\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton in the benzylic region is a methine group (-CH-) attached to the benzene ring.\n    *   **Assembling the Structure:** The alkyl signals correspond to a *sec*-butyl group [-CH(CH3)CH2CH3]. The methine proton is the one attached to the ring, and the remaining signals fit the rest of the sec-butyl structure.\n    *   **Conclusion from NMR and IR:** Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option (A).\n\n### Reaction and Final Product\n\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n*   **Reaction:** This combination is a powerful reducing agent used to completely reduce various oxygen-containing functional groups. Specifically, it reduces carboxylic acids (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH3). The reaction is known to convert carboxylic acids to their corresponding alkanes.\n*   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid will be reduced to a methyl group. The aromatic ring and the sec-butyl substituent will remain unchanged.\n    *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   Product: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the spectral analysis, Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI reduces the carboxylic acid group to a methyl group. Therefore, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
