    "The solution to this multistep synthesis problem requires a careful, step-by-step identification of each compound and a thorough understanding of the stereochemical principles of the Diels-Alder reaction.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identification of Compound A:**\n    Compound A exhibits two signals in its proton NMR spectrum: a triplet for 6 protons (6H) and a quartet for 4 protons (4H). This 3:2 proton ratio, along with the triplet-quartet splitting pattern, is the classic signature of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The fact that there are only two signals for a total of 10 protons (6H + 4H) implies a highly symmetrical molecule. The structure that fits this description is n-butane (CH₃CH₂CH₂CH₃). In n-butane, the two methyl (CH₃) groups are chemically equivalent (6H) and are adjacent to a methylene (CH₂) group, resulting in a triplet. The two methylene groups are also equivalent (4H) and are adjacent to a methyl group, which would split their signal into a quartet. (Note: While they also couple to each other, \"quartet\" is a common simplification in problems of this nature). Thus, **Compound A is n-butane**.\n\n2.  **Formation of Compound B:**\n    Compound A (n-butane) undergoes monobromination. This is a free-radical halogenation reaction. Bromination can occur at a primary carbon (C1) to form 1-bromobutane or at a secondary carbon (C2) to form 2-bromobutane. Since bromination is selective for the more substituted carbon, the major product will be **Compound B: 2-bromobutane**.\n\n3.  **Formation of Compound C:**\n    Compound B (2-bromobutane) reacts with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH). This is a strong base, and the reaction conditions favor an E2 elimination. Elimination of HBr from 2-bromobutane can form two possible alkenes: but-1-ene (from removing a proton from C1) or but-2-ene (from removing a proton from C3). According to Zaitsev's rule, the more substituted alkene is the major product. But-2-ene is a disubstituted alkene, while but-1-ene is monosubstituted. The problem states that Compound C has two geometrical isomers, which confirms its identity. But-2-ene exists as cis and trans isomers, whereas but-1-ene does not. Therefore, **Compound C is but-2-ene** (CH₃-CH=CH-CH₃).\n\n4.  **Formation of Compound D (Diels-Alder Reaction):**\n    This is a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction between a diene and a dienophile.\n    *   **Dienophile:** The *cis-isomer* of Compound C, which is **(Z)-but-2-ene** (cis-but-2-ene).\n    *   **Diene:** **(1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol**.\n\n    The reaction creates a new six-membered ring. The product will be named as a derivative of cyclohexene. Based on the reactants, the substituents on the ring will be an -OH group and three -CH₃ groups, leading to a **4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-en-1-ol** structure.\n\n### Stereochemistry of the Diels-Alder Reaction\n\nThe stereochemistry of the product (Compound D) is determined by the specific configurations of the reactants and the rules of the Diels-Alder reaction:\n\n1.  **Dienophile Stereochemistry:** The reaction is stereospecific with respect to the dienophile. Since the dienophile is *cis*-but-2-ene, the two methyl groups (which will be at positions C5 and C6 of the product) must be **cis** to each other in the final product.\n\n2.  **Diene Stereochemistry:** The stereochemistry of the diene's terminal substituents is also retained. For an (E,E)-diene, the two \"outward-pointing\" groups in the required s-cis conformation end up on the same face of the new ring. In (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol, the \"outward\" substituents are the -OH group (at C1) and the -CH₃ group (at C4). Therefore, the -OH at C1 and the -CH₃ at C4 will be **cis** to each other in the product.\n\n3.  **Endo/Exo Selectivity (Relative Stereochemistry):** The kinetic product of a Diels-Alder reaction is typically the *endo* product. This rule determines the relative orientation of the substituents from the diene versus those from the dienophile. For the *endo* approach, the \"outward-pointing\" groups of the diene (-OH and -CH₃) end up **trans** to the substituents of the dienophile (the two methyl groups).\n\n### Determining the Final Structure\n\nLet's combine these stereochemical rules to define the structure of Compound D. We'll use \"up\" and \"down\" to describe the positions of the substituents on the cyclohexene ring.\n\n*   From rule 2, the -OH at C1 and the -CH₃ at C4 are **cis**. Let's assign both as **down**.\n*   From rule 3 (endo rule), the methyl groups from the dienophile (at C5 and C6) must be **trans** to the outward groups of the diene (-OH and -CH₃). Since the -OH and -CH₃ are down, the methyl groups at C5 and C6 must be **up**.\n*   This result is consistent with rule 1, as both methyl groups at C5 and C6 are **up**, meaning they are **cis** to each other.\n\nSo, the final stereochemistry is:\n*   -OH at C1: **down**\n*   -CH₃ at C4: **down**\n*   -CH₃ at C5: **up**\n*   -CH₃ at C6: **up**\n\nNow, we match this configuration to the options provided, using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (R/S) notation. The numbering starts with C1 bearing the -OH group.\n\n*   **C1:** H (up), -OH (down), C2 (sp²), C6 (up). This gives an **S** configuration.\n*   **C4:** H (up), -CH₃ (down), C3 (sp²), C5 (up). This gives an **R** configuration.\n*   **C5:** H (down), -CH₃ (up), C4 (down), C6 (up). This gives an **S** configuration.\n*   **C6:** H (down), -CH₃ (up), C1 (down), C5 (up). This gives an **S** configuration.\n\nThe resulting molecule is **(1S,4R,5S,6S)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol**. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
