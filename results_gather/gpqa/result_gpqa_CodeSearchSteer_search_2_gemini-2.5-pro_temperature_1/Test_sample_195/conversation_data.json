    "To determine the maximum speed ($v_{max}$) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator, we can use the principle of conservation of energy. The relativistic harmonic oscillator is an energy-conserving system.\n\nThe total energy ($E$) of the system is the sum of its relativistic kinetic energy and its potential energy. The total relativistic energy of a particle is given by $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $m$ is the rest mass, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$. This total energy includes the rest energy $mc^2$ and the kinetic energy $K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$.\n\nThe potential energy of a harmonic oscillator is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, where $k$ is the spring constant and $x$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position.\n\nThe total conserved energy of the relativistic harmonic oscillator system is the sum of the particle's total relativistic energy and the potential energy:\n$E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\nWe can evaluate the total energy at two specific points in the oscillator's motion:\n\n1.  **At maximum amplitude ($x = A$)**: The velocity of the mass is momentarily zero ($v=0$). At this point, the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ is 1. The total energy is purely the sum of the rest energy and the maximum potential energy.\n    $E_{total} = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n2.  **At the equilibrium position ($x = 0$)**: The potential energy is zero, and the speed is at its maximum ($v = v_{max}$).\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max} mc^2 + 0 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\nBy the principle of conservation of energy, the total energy at these two points must be equal:\n$mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\nTo solve for $v_{max}$, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nFirst, divide by $mc^2$:\n$1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\nNext, invert both sides:\n$\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}}$\n\nSquare both sides:\n$\\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2} = 1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$\n\nIsolate the term with $v_{max}$:\n$\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\nFinally, solve for $v_{max}$:\n$v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
