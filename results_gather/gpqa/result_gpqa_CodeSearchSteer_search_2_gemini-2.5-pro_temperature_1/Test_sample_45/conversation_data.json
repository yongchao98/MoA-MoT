    "The reaction in question is the self-metathesis of racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene using an achiral Grubbs catalyst. This reaction involves the coupling of two alkene molecules with the elimination of ethene.\n\n1.  **Reactant:** The starting material is a racemic mixture, meaning it contains equal amounts of (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene.\n\n2.  **Reaction:** The general reaction is:\n    2 × CH₂(CH)-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃ → [CH₃CH₂CH(CH₃)]-CH=CH-[CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃] + CH₂=CH₂ (ethene)\n    The main product (excluding ethene) is **3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene**.\n\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** We need to consider the stereochemical outcomes. The product molecule has two chiral centers (at C3 and C6) and a double bond (at C4) that can exhibit E/Z (cis/trans) isomerism. The stereochemistry of the product depends on which enantiomers of the reactant combine.\n\n    *   **(R) + (R) coupling:** Reaction between two molecules of (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene produces (3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. This can exist as two different geometric isomers (diastereomers):\n        *   (E)-(3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n        *   (Z)-(3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene\n\n    *   **(S) + (S) coupling:** Reaction between two molecules of (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene produces the enantiomers of the (R,R) products:\n        *   (E)-(3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (enantiomer of the E, R,R isomer)\n        *   (Z)-(3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (enantiomer of the Z, R,R isomer)\n\n    *   **(R) + (S) cross-coupling:** Reaction between an (R) and an (S) molecule produces (3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. This also exists as E and Z isomers:\n        *   **(E)-(3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene:** This molecule has a center of symmetry and is an achiral **meso** compound.\n        *   **(Z)-(3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene:** This molecule is chiral. Since the catalyst is achiral, it will be produced as a **racemic mixture** along with its enantiomer, (Z)-(3S, 6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene.\n\n4.  **Counting the Products:** Let's count the total number of distinct stereoisomers formed.\n    *   From the homo-couplings (R+R and S+S), we get two pairs of enantiomers (E and Z). This totals **4** products.\n    *   From the cross-coupling (R+S), we get one meso compound (the E-isomer) and one pair of enantiomers (the Z-isomer). This totals **3** products.\n\nThe total number of chemically distinct stereoisomers formed is 4 + 3 = 7. However, 7 is not an option. This suggests the question may be asking for the number of diastereomerically distinct products, where a racemic pair is counted as a single entity.\n\nLet's count the diastereomeric products:\n1.  The racemic mixture of (E)-(3R,6R) and (E)-(3S,6S).\n2.  The racemic mixture of (Z)-(3R,6R) and (Z)-(3S,6S).\n3.  The meso compound (E)-(3R,6S).\n4.  The racemic mixture of (Z)-(3R,6S) and (Z)-(3S,6R).\n\nThese four \"products\" (three racemates and one meso compound) are all diastereomers of each other and are, in principle, separable by techniques like chromatography. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider that there are 4 possible products.\n\n<<<B>>>"
