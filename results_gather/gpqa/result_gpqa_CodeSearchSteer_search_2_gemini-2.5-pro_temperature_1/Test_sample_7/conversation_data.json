  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n\nA) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nB) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1\nC) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\nD) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>",

    "*   **Analysis of Single Mutants:**\n    *   The wild-type has 100% resistance.\n    *   The `g2` mutant shows 0% resistance. The complete loss of resistance indicates that the G2 gene product is essential for the resistance pathway.\n    *   The `g1` (75% resistance) and `g3` (50% resistance) mutants show a partial loss of resistance, meaning G1 and G3 both contribute to the phenotype, but are not individually essential.\n\n*   **Analysis of Double Mutants and Gene Interactions:**\n    *   **Epistasis:** The term epistasis describes a situation where the effect of one gene's mutation is masked by the mutation of another gene.\n        *   The `g1g2` double mutant has 0% resistance, which is the same phenotype as the `g2` single mutant. This means the `g2` mutation masks the `g1` mutation's effect. Therefore, G2 is epistatic to G1.\n        *   Similarly, the `g2g3` double mutant has 0% resistance, the same as the `g2` single mutant. This means the `g2` mutation also masks the `g3` mutation. Therefore, G2 is epistatic to G3.\n        *   When one gene is epistatic to several other genes in a pathway, it usually means it acts upstream of them. Since we know one gene is a transcription factor (an upstream regulator), G2 is the most likely candidate. It likely activates the expression of G1 and G3.\n\n    *   **Interaction between G1 and G3:**\n        *   The `g1` mutant has a 25% loss of resistance (100% - 75%).\n        *   The `g3` mutant has a 50% loss of resistance (100% - 50%).\n        *   If the genes acted independently, we might expect the double mutant `g1g3` to have a resistance of 100% - 25% - 50% = 25%.\n        *   However, the `g1g3` double mutant has only 10% resistance. The resulting phenotype is much more severe than the additive effects of the single mutations. This synergistic effect is a classic sign of **gene redundancy**. G1 and G3 likely have partially overlapping functions in the pathway downstream of G2. When only one is lost, the other can partially compensate, but when both are lost, the function is almost completely abolished.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** G2 being a TF is likely correct. There is no evidence for pleiotropy (one gene affecting multiple traits). G1 is not epistatic to G3, as the double mutant phenotype (10%) is different from the g1 phenotype (75%).\n    *   **B) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1:** G1 is not the transcription factor; the evidence points to G2.\n    *   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:** G2 being a TF is likely correct. We cannot conclude anything about promoters from this data. G3 is not epistatic to G1, as the double mutant phenotype (10%) is different from the g3 phenotype (50%).\n    *   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** This option correctly identifies G2 as the likely transcription factor (based on its epistasis over G1 and G3) and correctly identifies the relationship between G1 and G3 as gene redundancy (based on the synergistic effect in the double mutant). Although the claim \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" is not supported by the data (a common issue in such problems where a choice must be made), the other two statements in this option are the most accurate conclusions from the experiment.\n\nBased on the strong evidence for G2 being an upstream regulator (transcription factor) and the clear synergistic interaction indicating redundancy between G1 and G3, option D is the best description of the results.\n\n<<<D>>>"
