    "Here is a step-by-by-step resolution of the physics problem.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Concepts\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to combine concepts from special relativity and particle physics.\n\n*   **Proper Lifetime (τ₀):** This is the lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame (8 x 10⁻¹⁶ s).\n*   **Time Dilation:** Because the particle X⁰ is moving at a very high speed in the bubble chamber (the lab frame), its lifetime will appear longer to an observer in the lab. This elongated lifetime (τ) is given by τ = γτ₀.\n*   **Lorentz Factor (γ):** This factor describes the magnitude of time dilation and is determined by the particle's energy (E) and rest mass (m₀). The formula is E = γm₀c², which simplifies to γ = E/m₀ when using units of GeV for energy and mass.\n*   **Decay Length (d):** This is the distance the particle travels in the lab frame before it decays. It's calculated as d = vτ, where v is the particle's velocity. Since the particle is highly relativistic, its velocity `v` will be very close to the speed of light, `c`.\n*   **Mean Decay Length (<d>):** Particle decay is a random process. The mean distance a group of identical particles will travel before decaying is <d> = vτ ≈ cγτ₀.\n*   **Observing a Decay:** To \"observe\" the decay, the track of the particle X⁰ must be long enough to be resolved by the detector. This means the particle's decay length `d` must be greater than the detector's minimum resolution `L`.\n*   **Probability of Observation:** The question requires finding the minimum resolution `L` needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. This translates to finding the length `L` such that the probability of the decay length being greater than `L` is 30% (P(d > L) = 0.30). The probability that a particle survives to travel a distance `x` is given by an exponential decay law: P(d > x) = e^(-x/<d>).\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\n\nThe Lorentz factor is the ratio of the total energy to the rest mass energy.\n*   E = 27 GeV\n*   m₀ = 3.41 GeV\n\nγ = E / m₀ = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.9179\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Mean Decay Length (<d>)**\n\nThe mean decay length in the lab frame is the distance the particle travels on average before decaying.\n*   <d> = v * τ = v * (γτ₀)\n*   The velocity `v` can be calculated from γ: v = c * √(1 - 1/γ²).\n*   v = c * √(1 - 1/7.9179²) ≈ c * √(1 - 0.01595) ≈ 0.992 * c.\n*   Since `v` is very close to `c` (the speed of light), we can approximate <d> ≈ cγτ₀.\n*   <d> ≈ (2.998 x 10⁸ m/s) * 7.9179 * (8 x 10⁻¹⁶ s)\n*   <d> ≈ 1.90 x 10⁻⁶ m\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Minimum Resolution (L)**\n\nWe need to find the resolution `L` such that 30% of particles travel a distance greater than `L` before decaying.\n*   The probability is given by P(d > L) = e^(-L/<d>).\n*   We set this probability to 0.30: e^(-L/<d>) = 0.30\n*   To solve for L, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    -L/<d> = ln(0.30)\n*   L = -<d> * ln(0.30)\n*   Using the value of <d> calculated above and ln(0.30) ≈ -1.204:\n    L ≈ -(1.90 x 10⁻⁶ m) * (-1.204)\n    L ≈ 2.288 x 10⁻⁶ m\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated minimum resolution is approximately 2.29 x 10⁻⁶ meters. Comparing this result with the given options:\n\n*   A) 2.08 x 1e-9 m\n*   B) 2.08 x 1e-1 m\n*   C) 2.08 x 1e-3 m\n*   D) 2.08 x 1e-6 m\n\nOption D is the closest answer to our calculated value. The small discrepancy (around 9%) might arise from slightly different values for the speed of light or constants used in the problem's original formulation, or slight inaccuracies in the provided problem data. However, based on the standard formulas and constants, 2.29 x 10⁻⁶ m is the correct derivation, making 2.08 x 10⁻⁶ m the intended answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
