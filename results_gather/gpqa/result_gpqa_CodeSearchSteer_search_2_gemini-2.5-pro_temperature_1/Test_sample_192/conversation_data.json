    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of stars, their parallax, and their distance.\n\n1.  **Parallax and Distance:** Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (r). The relationship is given by the formula `plx = 1/r`. This means that stars with smaller parallax angles are farther away.\n\n2.  **Interpreting the Given Information:** The problem states that in a specific region of the sky, \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx⁵\". In astronomical contexts like star counts, \"the number of stars\" typically refers to the cumulative number of stars observed up to a certain limit. In this case, it would be the cumulative number of stars (N) with a parallax greater than a certain value, which corresponds to stars closer than a certain distance r. Therefore, we can write the given relationship as:\n    `N ~ 1/plx⁵`\n\n3.  **Number of Stars as a Function of Distance:** We can substitute the parallax-distance relationship (`plx = 1/r`) into the given formula to express the cumulative number of stars (N) as a function of distance (r):\n    `N ~ 1 / (1/r)⁵`\n    By simplifying the expression, we find:\n    `N ~ r⁵`\n    This means the total number of stars observed out to a distance `r` is proportional to the fifth power of the distance.\n\n4.  **Number of Stars per Unit Distance:** The question asks how the number of stars changes *per unit range of distance*. This is equivalent to finding the density of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance r, which is the derivative of the cumulative number of stars `N` with respect to the distance `r` (dN/dr).\n\n    Given `N(r) = k * r⁵` (where k is a constant of proportionality), we can differentiate N with respect to r:\n    `dN/dr = d/dr (k * r⁵)`\n    `dN/dr = 5 * k * r⁴`\n\n    Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to r⁴:\n    `dN/dr ~ r⁴`\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
