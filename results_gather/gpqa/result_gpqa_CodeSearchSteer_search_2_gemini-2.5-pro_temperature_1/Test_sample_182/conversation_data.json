    "The problem asks for the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is treated with red phosphorus and an excess of hydriodic acid (HI).\n\n### Step 1: Determine the structure and formula of the starting material.\nThe starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene**: A six-membered ring with a double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n*   **-carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group is at position 1.\n*   **2-formyl**: A -CHO group is at position 2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A -CH=CH₂ group is at position 5.\n\nLet's determine its molecular formula:\n*   Carbons (C): 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in -CH=CH₂ = 10 carbons (C₁₀).\n*   Oxygens (O): 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = 3 oxygens (O₃).\n*   Hydrogens (H): Let's count them on the structure.\n    *   Ring H's: H at C1, H at C2, H at C3, H at C4, H at C5, 2H at C6 = 7 H.\n    *   -COOH H: 1 H.\n    *   -CHO H: 1 H.\n    *   -CH=CH₂ H's: 3 H.\n    *   Total H = 7 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12 hydrogens (H₁₂).\nThe molecular formula of the starting material is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the reaction and identify the product.\nThe reagent used is red phosphorus (P) and excess hydriodic acid (HI). This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce various functional groups completely to their corresponding alkanes.\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The aldehyde group (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   Carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C), like those in the cyclohexene ring and the vinyl group, are also reduced to single bonds (alkanes).\n\nApplying these transformations to the starting material:\n*   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The carboxylic acid at C1 becomes a methyl group.\n*   The formyl group at C2 becomes a methyl group.\n*   The vinyl group at C5 becomes an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n\nThe final product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-ethylcyclohexane. This is a saturated cycloalkane with substituents.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the molecular formula of the product.\nThe reaction is a reduction, meaning oxygen atoms are removed and hydrogen atoms are added. The carbon skeleton remains the same (10 carbon atoms). The product is a saturated hydrocarbon with one ring.\n\nThe general formula for an acyclic alkane is CₙH₂ₙ₊₂. For a C₁₀ acyclic alkane, the formula would be C₁₀H₂₂. The presence of a single ring reduces the hydrogen count by two. Therefore, the molecular formula for a C₁₀ cycloalkane is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\nThe product, 1,2-dimethyl-4-ethylcyclohexane, is a cycloalkane containing a total of 10 carbon atoms, so its formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), or degree of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula for IHD for a hydrocarbon (CₐHₑ) is:\n\nIHD = a - (b/2) + 1\n\nFor the product with the formula C₁₀H₂₀:\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\nThis result is consistent with the structure of the product, which is a cyclohexane ring (one ring) with no double or triple bonds. The single ring accounts for an IHD of 1.\n\n<<<B>>>"
