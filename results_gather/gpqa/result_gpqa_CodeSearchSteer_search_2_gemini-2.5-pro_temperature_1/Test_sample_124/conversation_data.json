    "The problem describes a three-dimensional isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator. The energy eigenvalues for such a system are given by the formula:\n\nE_n = (n + 3/2)ħω\n\nwhere:\n*   `n` is the principal quantum number (n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...).\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck's constant.\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of the oscillator.\n\nThe quantum number `n` is the sum of the quantum numbers for each of the three independent one-dimensional oscillators, n = n_x + n_y + n_z.\n\nThe different energy states are:\n*   **Ground State (n=0):** This is the lowest energy level.\n*   **First Excited State (n=1):** The next energy level up from the ground state.\n*   **Second Excited State (n=2):** The state with energy higher than the first excited state.\n*   **Third Excited State (n=3):** This is the state the question asks for.\n\nTo find the energy of the third excited state, we set n = 3 in the energy formula:\n\nE_3 = (3 + 3/2)ħω = (9/2)ħω\n\nThe number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given energy level is known as the degeneracy of that level. For the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the degeneracy of the n-th energy level is given by the formula:\n\ng_n = (n + 1)(n + 2) / 2\n\nTo find the degeneracy of the third excited state (n=3), we substitute n=3 into this formula:\n\ng_3 = (3 + 1)(3 + 2) / 2\ng_3 = (4)(5) / 2\ng_3 = 20 / 2\ng_3 = 10\n\nThis means there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions that share the energy eigenvalue of (9/2)ħω.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the third excited state is (9/2)ħω, and the degeneracy is 10. Comparing this with the given options, option C matches these results.\n\n<<<C>>>"
