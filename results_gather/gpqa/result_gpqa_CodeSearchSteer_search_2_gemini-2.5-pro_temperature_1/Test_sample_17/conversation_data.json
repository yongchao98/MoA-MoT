    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2.\n\n### Understanding the Notation\n\nThe notation `[X/Y]` represents the logarithmic abundance ratio of two elements, X and Y, in a star compared to the Sun. It is defined as:\n\n`[X/Y] = log10( (nX/nY)_star ) - log10( (nX/nY)_sun )`\n\nWhere `nX` and `nY` are the number densities of elements X and Y.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Silicon Abundance for Star 1\n\nWe can find the silicon-to-hydrogen abundance ratio for Star 1, `[Si/H]_1`, by combining the given abundances:\n\n`[Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1`\n\nGiven:\n*   `[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex`\n*   `[Fe/H]_1 = 0.0 dex`\n\nTherefore:\n`[Si/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0.0 = 0.3 dex`\n\nThis means that the ratio of silicon to hydrogen in Star 1 is `10^0.3` times the same ratio in the Sun.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Silicon Abundance for Star 2\n\nSimilarly, we can find the silicon-to-hydrogen abundance ratio for Star 2, `[Si/H]_2`. We are given `[Mg/Si]_2` and `[Mg/H]_2`. We can relate these using the following identity:\n\n`[Si/H]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 + [Si/Mg]_2`\n\nWe also know that `[Si/Mg]_2 = -[Mg/Si]_2`.\n\nGiven:\n*   `[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex`\n*   `[Mg/H]_2 = 0.0 dex`\n\nTherefore:\n`[Si/H]_2 = 0.0 + (-0.3) = -0.3 dex`\n\nThis signifies that the ratio of silicon to hydrogen in Star 2 is `10^-0.3` times the same ratio in the Sun.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Ratio of Silicon Abundances\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of the two stars. In the context of stellar abundances, this refers to the ratio of their number densities relative to hydrogen, which is `(nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2`.\n\nLet's denote this ratio as `R`.\n\n`R = (nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2`\n\nWe can express the abundance of each star relative to the Sun:\n*   `(nSi/nH)_1 = (nSi/nH)_sun * 10^[Si/H]_1`\n*   `(nSi/nH)_2 = (nSi/nH)_sun * 10^[Si/H]_2`\n\nNow, we can compute the ratio `R`:\n\n`R = ( (nSi/nH)_sun * 10^0.3 ) / ( (nSi/nH)_sun * 10^-0.3 )`\n\nThe solar abundance term `(nSi/nH)_sun` cancels out:\n\n`R = 10^0.3 / 10^-0.3 = 10^(0.3 - (-0.3)) = 10^0.6`\n\nCalculating the final value:\n\n`R â‰ˆ 3.981`\n\nThis value is approximately 3.9. The masses of the stars and the specific solar abundance values for Fe and Mg are not needed to determine the final ratio.\n\n<<<C>>>"
