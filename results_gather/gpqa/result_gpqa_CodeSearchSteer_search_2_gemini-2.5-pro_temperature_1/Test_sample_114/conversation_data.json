    "The search results confirm the fundamental principles I used.\n*   **Electron-positron annihilation:** An electron and a positron collide and annihilate, creating energetic photons.\n*   **Conservation Laws:** The process must obey the conservation of energy and momentum. This is the core of my calculation.\n*   **Two-Photon Creation:** In the most common case, two photons are created. Creating a single photon is forbidden by momentum conservation (unless a third body like a nucleus is involved).\n*   **Angle of Emission:** In the center-of-momentum frame (where the net momentum is zero), the photons are emitted in opposite directions (180 degrees apart). However, if the initial system has a net momentum, the angle will deviate from 180 degrees. This matches the premise of the problem, where the different Lorentz factors result in a non-zero initial momentum.\n*   **Energy of Photons:** In the zero-momentum frame, each photon has an energy equal to the rest energy of the electron (0.511 MeV). In a frame with net momentum, the photon energies can be higher and are not necessarily equal unless the geometry of the emission is symmetric with respect to the momentum vector, which is the case here as stated in the problem (one upper-right, one lower-right, same energy).\n\nThe calculation method seems robust and is based on the well-established principles of conservation of energy and momentum in relativistic mechanics, which are confirmed by the search results. The steps taken are:\n1.  Calculate the total initial energy from the Lorentz factors of the electron and positron.\n2.  Use energy conservation to find the energy of each of the two final photons (since they are equal).\n3.  Calculate the initial momentum of the electron and positron from their respective Lorentz factors.\n4.  Sum the initial momenta to get the total initial momentum of the system.\n5.  Set up expressions for the final momentum components of the two photons in terms of their (equal) energy and their emission angles.\n6.  Use momentum conservation (equating initial and final momentum components) to solve for the emission angle.\n7.  Calculate the total angle between the two photons.\n\nThis detailed, step-by-step process is the correct way to solve this type of relativistic collision problem. My initial calculation yielded ~138 degrees, which corresponds to option B. I have re-verified each step of the calculation and the underlying physics principles with the search results. I am confident in the result.\n\nFinal calculation check:\n*   γ_e = 4, γ_p = 2\n*   E_total = (4+2) * m_e * c^2 = 6 m_e * c^2\n*   E_γ = E_total / 2 = 3 m_e * c^2\n*   p_e = m_e * c * sqrt(γ_e^2 - 1) = m_e * c * sqrt(15)\n*   p_p = -m_e * c * sqrt(γ_p^2 - 1) = -m_e * c * sqrt(3)  (moving left)\n*   p_total_x = m_e * c * (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))\n*   p_total_y = 0\n*   Final state: two photons, each with energy E_γ = 3 m_e * c^2, and momentum p_γ = E_γ / c = 3 m_e * c.\n*   From y-momentum conservation: p_γ * sin(θ) - p_γ * sin(φ) = 0 => θ = φ. The angles to the horizontal are equal.\n*   From x-momentum conservation: p_total_x = p_γ * cos(θ) + p_γ * cos(φ) = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ)\n*   m_e * c * (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) = 2 * (3 m_e * c) * cos(θ)\n*   cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6\n*   cos(θ) ≈ (3.87298 - 1.73205) / 6 ≈ 0.35682\n*   θ = arccos(0.35682) ≈ 69.09°\n*   Total angle = 2θ ≈ 138.18°\n\nThe result consistently points to 138 degrees.\n\nFinal Answer will be B.\nThe problem requires applying the laws of conservation of energy and momentum in the context of special relativity.\n\n1.  **Initial State Analysis:**\n    *   Let m_e be the rest mass of an electron (and positron).\n    *   The energy of a particle is given by E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The momentum of a particle is given by p = γmv. The velocity v can be related to γ by v/c = √(1 - 1/γ²). This gives p = γm(c√(1 - 1/γ²)) = mc√(γ² - 1).\n\n    *   **Electron:**\n        *   Lorentz factor, γ_e = 4\n        *   Energy, E_e = 4 * m_e * c²\n        *   Momentum, p_e = m_e * c * √(4² - 1) = m_e * c * √15 (moving to the right, so positive)\n\n    *   **Positron:**\n        *   Lorentz factor, γ_p = 2\n        *   Energy, E_p = 2 * m_e * c²\n        *   Momentum, p_p = m_e * c * √(2² - 1) = m_e * c * √3 (moving to the left, so negative)\n\n2.  **Applying Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   The total initial energy is the sum of the electron's and positron's energies:\n        E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4m_e * c² + 2m_e * c² = 6m_e*c²\n    *   After annihilation, two photons are produced. The problem states they have the same energy, let's call it E_γ.\n        E_final = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ\n    *   By conservation of energy, E_initial = E_final:\n        6m_e * c² = 2E_γ  =>  E_γ = 3m_e * c²\n    *   The energy of each photon is 3m_e * c².\n\n3.  **Applying Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   Momentum is a vector. We consider components along the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) axes.\n    *   **Initial Momentum:**\n        *   The particles move only along the horizontal axis.\n        *   P_initial_x = p_e + p_p = m_e * c * √15 + (-m_e * c * √3) = m_e * c * (√15 - √3)\n        *   P_initial_y = 0\n\n    *   **Final Momentum:**\n        *   The two photons have equal energy E_γ, and the magnitude of a photon's momentum is p = E/c. So, each photon has a momentum of magnitude p_γ = E_γ/c = 3m_e * c.\n        *   One photon goes upper-right at an angle θ to the horizontal, and the other goes lower-right at an angle -φ to the horizontal.\n        *   P_final_x = p_γ * cos(θ) + p_γ * cos(-φ)\n        *   P_final_y = p_γ * sin(θ) + p_γ * sin(-φ) = p_γ * (sin(θ) - sin(φ))\n\n    *   **Equating Components:**\n        *   **y-component:** P_initial_y = P_final_y\n            0 = p_γ * (sin(θ) - sin(φ))  =>  sin(θ) = sin(φ). Since one angle is positive and the other is negative, this means the magnitudes of the angles are equal: θ = φ.\n        *   **x-component:** P_initial_x = P_final_x\n            m_e * c * (√15 - √3) = p_γ * cos(θ) + p_γ * cos(θ) = 2p_γ * cos(θ)\n\n4.  **Solving for the Angle:**\n    *   Substitute the values we found for p_γ:\n        m_e * c * (√15 - √3) = 2 * (3m_e * c) * cos(θ)\n    *   Simplify the equation by dividing both sides by m_e * c:\n        (√15 - √3) = 6 * cos(θ)\n    *   Solve for cos(θ):\n        cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6\n    *   Now, we calculate the numerical value:\n        √15 ≈ 3.873\n        √3 ≈ 1.732\n        cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 = 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568\n    *   Find the angle θ by taking the inverse cosine:\n        θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°\n\n5.  **Finding the Total Angle:**\n    *   The question asks for the angle *between the directions of the photons*. This is the sum of the two angles with the horizontal axis: Total Angle = θ + φ.\n    *   Since we found that θ = φ, the total angle is 2θ.\n    *   Total Angle ≈ 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°\n\nThis value is very close to 138.\n\n<<<B>>>"
