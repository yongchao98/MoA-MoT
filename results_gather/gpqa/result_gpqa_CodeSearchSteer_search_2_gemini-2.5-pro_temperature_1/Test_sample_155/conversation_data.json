    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions and the subsequent chromatographic separation.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reactions**\n\nThe overall reaction sequence involves the epoxidation of an alkene with mCPBA, followed by acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide with water. This two-step process results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the starting alkene, meaning the two hydroxyl (-OH) groups are added to opposite faces of the original double bond. The stereochemical outcome depends on the stereochemistry of the starting alkene.\n\n**Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene)**\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** The reaction of (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to both carbons of the double bond from the same face. Since the starting alkene is achiral, the attack can occur from the top or bottom face with equal probability, producing a racemic mixture of trans-epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Acid-catalyzed Hydrolysis:** The subsequent ring-opening by water is an *anti*-attack.\n    *   Attack on the (4R,5R)-epoxide leads to the formation of (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack on the (4S,5S)-epoxide also leads to the formation of (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    This product has two stereocenters but possesses a plane of symmetry, making it a **meso compound**.\n\nA general rule for stereochemistry is that an *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene yields a meso product. Therefore, Reaction 1 produces a single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene)**\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** The *syn*-addition of mCPBA to the *cis*-alkene produces a single *cis*-epoxide ((4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane), which is a meso compound.\n2.  **Acid-catalyzed Hydrolysis:** The *anti*-attack of water on this meso-epoxide opens the ring.\n    *   Attack at one carbon center results in the (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol enantiomer.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon center results in the (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol enantiomer.\n    Since both attacks are equally likely, the reaction produces a **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\nA general rule for stereochemistry is that an *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene yields a racemic mixture. Therefore, Reaction 2 produces two products that are enantiomers of each other.\n\n### **Analysis of the Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe meso compound is a diastereomer of the two enantiomers.\n\n### **Chromatographic Analysis**\n\n**1. Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n*   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   Diastereomers (like the meso compound and the enantiomers) have different physical properties and will be separated, eluting at different times.\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated. They will co-elute, appearing as a single peak.\n*   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **two peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair.\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC:**\n*   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n*   It can separate all three stereoisomers in the mixture because the meso compound is a diastereomer of the other two, and the chiral column will resolve the two enantiomers from each other.\n*   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **three distinct peaks**: one for the meso compound, one for the (4R,5R) enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S) enantiomer.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<B>>>"
