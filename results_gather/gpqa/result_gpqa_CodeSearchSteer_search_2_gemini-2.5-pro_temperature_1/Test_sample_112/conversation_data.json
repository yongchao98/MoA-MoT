    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the correct chemical formula:\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum\n\n*   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is hydrogen-bonded. While alcohols also show O-H stretches, they are typically centered around 3300-3600 cm⁻¹ and the extreme broadness around 3000 cm⁻¹ is more indicative of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. For carboxylic acids, this peak is typically observed between 1700-1725 cm⁻¹. The presence of both this peak and the broad O-H peak strongly suggests a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the compound is an alkene.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C). The presence of a carboxylic acid requires two oxygen atoms.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens (protons attached directly to the carbons of a C=C double bond) typically resonate in the 4.5-7.0 ppm range. This confirms the presence of an alkene functional group, which was also indicated by the FTIR data.\n\n**Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** This confirms the presence of a C=C double bond in the molecule.\n\n### 3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid, corresponding to the loss of the [COOH]⁺ fragment. This provides further strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n\n**Conclusion from Mass Spectrometry:** The compound is a carboxylic acid.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Molecular Formulas\n\nBased on the combined spectral data, the unknown compound must be an unsaturated carboxylic acid. This means it must contain two oxygen atoms and have at least two degrees of unsaturation (one for the C=O in the acid and one for the C=C in the alkene).\n\nLet's calculate the Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) for each option:\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n\n*   **A) C6H10O:** Contains only one oxygen, which is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid. Ruled out.\n*   **B) C6H12O2:** Contains two oxygens. DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. A DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O of the carboxylic acid, implying the rest of the molecule is saturated. This contradicts the FTIR and ¹H NMR data showing a C=C bond. Ruled out.\n*   **C) C6H12O:** Contains only one oxygen. Ruled out.\n*   **D) C6H10O2:** Contains two oxygens. DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. A DoU of 2 perfectly accommodates both the C=O of the carboxylic acid and the C=C of the alkene. This formula is fully consistent with all the provided spectroscopic evidence.\n\n**Final Conclusion:** All evidence points to the compound being an unsaturated carboxylic acid with the formula C6H10O2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
