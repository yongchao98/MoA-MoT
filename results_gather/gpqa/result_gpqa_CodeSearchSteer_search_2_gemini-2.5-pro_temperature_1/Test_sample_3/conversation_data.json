    "In a universe where magnetic monopoles exist, two of Maxwell's equations would be modified to become more symmetrical with their counterparts for electric charges.\n\nThe two affected equations are:\n*   **Gauss's Law for Magnetism:** In our universe, this law states that the divergence of the magnetic field (∇·B) is zero, which mathematically means there are no magnetic monopoles. If monopoles existed, this law would be modified to show that the divergence of the magnetic field is proportional to the magnetic charge density (ρm), similar to how the divergence of the electric field relates to electric charge density.\n*   **Faraday's Law of Induction:** This law describes how a changing magnetic field creates a circulating electric field (related to ∇×E, the curl of E). If magnetic monopoles exist and can move, they would constitute a \"magnetic current\" (Jm). This magnetic current would act as an additional source for the circulating electric field, modifying the equation to include a magnetic current term, just as the Ampère-Maxwell law includes an electric current term as a source for the magnetic field.\n\nTherefore, the equations related to the divergence of the magnetic field and the circulation (or curl) of the electric field would be different.\n\n<<<D>>>"
