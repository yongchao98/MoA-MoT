    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided data to determine the most likely explanation:\n\n1.  **Analyze the NMR Data:** The Â¹H NMR spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. These peaks have similar chemical shifts and their combined integral is 1H, which is what would be expected for one proton. This indicates the presence of two different, but very similar, chemical environments for this proton, and that these two forms of the molecule exist in a roughly 1:1 ratio. The fact that two peaks are observed means the exchange between these two forms is slow on the NMR timescale.\n\n2.  **Analyze the LC-MS Data:** The LC-MS analysis separates the crude material into two distinct peaks of equal intensity. Both peaks show the same mass spectrum, which corresponds to the expected product. This confirms the presence of two species that have the same mass but different physical properties that allow them to be separated by liquid chromatography. Crucially, this separation is maintained at an *elevated temperature*.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n        *   **NMR:** They are chemically distinct and would be expected to produce different signals in an NMR spectrum. A 1:1 mixture would show duplicate peaks with equal integrals for protons near the differing stereocenter, which matches the observation.\n        *   **LC-MS:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereomers can be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography. They are stable molecules, so they would remain as separate peaks even at elevated temperatures. This perfectly aligns with all the provided data. Such a mixture often arises in peptide synthesis if one of the amino acid starting materials is racemic (a D/L mixture) while the others are chiral (e.g., all L).\n\n    *   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would be a chemically different molecule and, therefore, would have a different mass. The MS data shows both peaks have the same mass as the target molecule, which rules out this explanation.\n\n    *   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This term is chemically ambiguous. If it implies that an extra amino acid was added, the mass would be different, which is ruled out by the MS data. A more plausible interpretation is the presence of **rotational isomers (rotamers)**, specifically *cis-trans* isomers around an amide bond.\n        *   **NMR:** Slow interconversion between *cis* and *trans* isomers is a common phenomenon in peptides (especially involving proline) and would lead to two sets of NMR signals at room temperature. This is consistent with the NMR data.\n        *   **LC-MS:** While rotamers can sometimes be separated by LC at low temperatures, the energy barrier for their interconversion is relatively low. At the *elevated temperature* used for the LC-MS analysis, the rotation around the amide bond would speed up, causing the two isomers to interconvert rapidly. On the timescale of an LC separation, they would behave as a single species and elute as one single, potentially broadened, peak. The observation of two *clearly defined* peaks at high temperature contradicts the rotamer hypothesis.\n\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, they are indistinguishable and produce an identical, single set of peaks. Likewise, they cannot be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography. This option is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC-MS data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe observation of two stable, separable peaks of equal mass at elevated LC temperature is the key piece of evidence. This strongly points to the presence of diastereomers, which are distinct and stable molecules. The NMR data, showing a 1:1 mixture of two species that are chemically very similar, fully supports this conclusion.\n\n<<<A>>>"
