    "To determine which exoplanet has the highest density, we must analyze each option based on the principles of planetary science. Density is mass divided by volume. For a spherical planet, this means density is heavily influenced by both its mass and its radius.\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is our baseline, the planet Earth. Earth's average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** This planet's density is explicitly given as about 5.5 g/cm³, which is very close to, but slightly less than, Earth's.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** For a planet with the same composition, less mass means less gravitational compression. This self-compression significantly increases a planet's density. Therefore, a planet with half of Earth's mass would be less compressed and thus less dense than Earth.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** A planet with the same building blocks as Earth but five times the mass will experience much stronger self-gravity. This intense gravity compresses the materials, including the iron core and silicate mantle, to a much greater degree. This gravitational compression results in a significantly higher overall density. Theoretical models show that as a rocky planet's mass increases, its density also increases, assuming the composition remains the same. A super-Earth with 5 times the mass of our planet would be considerably denser.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the options:\n*   Planet (a) has a density of ~5.51 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (b) has a density of ~5.50 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (d) would be less dense than Planet (a).\n*   Planet (c) would be significantly denser than Planet (a) due to gravitational compression.\n\nTherefore, the planet with five times Earth's mass and the same composition will have the highest density.\n\n<<<D>>>"
