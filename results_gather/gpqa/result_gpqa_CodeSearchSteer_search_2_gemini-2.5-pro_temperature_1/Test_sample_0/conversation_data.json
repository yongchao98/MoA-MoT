    "To clearly resolve the two quantum energy levels, the difference in their energies, |E2 - E1|, must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties in their individual energies. This energy uncertainty is known as the natural linewidth and is determined by the lifetime of the state through the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\nThe relationship between the lifetime of a state (τ) and the uncertainty in its energy (ΔE) is given by the formula:\nΔE ⋅ τ ≥ ħ/2\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\nFor practical purposes, the minimum energy uncertainty (or linewidth, Γ) can be approximated as:\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy uncertainty for each state:\n\n1.  **For the first state (E1):**\n    *   Lifetime τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE1 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n2.  **For the second state (E2):**\n    *   Lifetime τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE2 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nTo be clearly distinguished, the energy difference between the levels must be greater than the sum of their linewidths. The shorter-lived state has a much larger energy uncertainty, which dominates this requirement. The minimum energy difference required is at least on the order of the larger uncertainty, ΔE1.\n\nThe total linewidth is the sum of the individual uncertainties:\nΔE_total = ΔE1 + ΔE2 ≈ (6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.658 x 10⁻⁷ eV) ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nNow, we compare this required energy difference with the given options:\n*   **A) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This value is significantly larger than the calculated minimum required difference of 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   **B) 10⁻⁸ eV:** This is smaller than the required difference.\n*   **C) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This is much smaller than the required difference.\n*   **D) 10⁻⁹ eV:** This is also smaller than the required difference.\n\nOnly an energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is large enough to ensure that the two energy levels can be clearly resolved, as it is well above the natural linewidths of both states.\n\n<<<A>>>"
