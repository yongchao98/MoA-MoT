    "When 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated, it undergoes a thermal reaction known as a-sigmatropic rearrangement, or more specifically, a Cope rearrangement. This type of reaction is characteristic of 1,5-dienes.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n1.  **Identify the Starting Material:** The initial molecule is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. Its structure consists of a nine-carbon chain (nonane) with double bonds starting at carbons 2 and 6, and a butyl group attached to carbon 5.\n\n    ```\n             CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃ (Butyl group)\n             |\n    CH₃-CH=CH-CH₂-CH-CH=CH-CH₂-CH₃\n     ¹   ²   ³   ⁴  ⁵   ⁶   ⁷   ⁸   ⁹\n    ```\n\n2.  **Identify the Reacting System:** The molecule contains a 1,5-diene system, which is the segment from carbon 2 to carbon 7 (`C²=C³-C⁴-C⁵-C⁶=C⁷`). This is the part of the molecule that will rearrange.\n\n3.  **Apply the Cope Rearrangement:** The Cope rearrangement involves the breaking of the sigma bond between atoms 3 and 4 of the 1,5-diene system (the C⁴-C⁵ bond in this molecule) and the formation of a new sigma bond between atoms 1 and 6 (the C² and C⁷ atoms). Simultaneously, the double bonds shift their positions.\n\n    *   The C⁴-C⁵ bond breaks.\n    *   A new C²-C⁷ bond forms.\n    *   The double bond at C²=C³ moves to C³=C⁴.\n    *   The double bond at C⁶=C⁷ moves to C⁵=C⁶.\n\n4.  **Determine the Product Structure:** The rearrangement results in a new molecule with a different carbon skeleton. The new connectivity can be represented as:\n\n    ```\n         CH₃  CH₂CH₃\n          |    |\n    CH₂=CH-CH - CH - CH=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃\n    ```\n\n5.  **Name the Product:** To name the resulting molecule, we apply IUPAC nomenclature rules:\n    *   **Find the longest carbon chain** that contains both double bonds. This chain starts from the `CH₂=` group and extends through the butyl group's chain, totaling 10 carbon atoms. Thus, the parent name is a **decadiene**.\n    *   **Number the chain** to give the double bonds the lowest possible locants. Numbering from the `CH₂=` end gives the double bonds positions 1 and 5 (**deca-1,5-diene**).\n    *   **Identify and locate the substituents.** There is a methyl group on carbon 3 and an ethyl group on carbon 4.\n    *   **Assemble the name.** Listing the substituents alphabetically, the final IUPAC name is **4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene**.\n\nComparing this name to the given options, it matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
