    "To determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful analysis of the directing effects of the substituents is necessary. The target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring: an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2). All three are positioned meta to each other (1,3,5-substitution).\n\nHere's an evaluation of the steps and the options provided:\n\n**Understanding Substituent Effects:**\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl group):** This is a deactivating group and a meta-director in electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n*   **-Br (bromo group):** This is a weakly deactivating group but an ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro group):** This is a strongly deactivating group and a meta-director.\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Reaction Constraint:** Friedel-Crafts acylation (and alkylation) does not work on aromatic rings that are moderately or strongly deactivated, such as those bearing a nitro group (-NO2). It also fails on rings with an amino group (-NH2), as the amine reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst.\n\n**Analysis of Possible Synthetic Routes:**\n\n1.  **Starting with Acylation (Friedel-Crafts):** This is the most logical first step because attempting to perform a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a nitrated ring would fail.\n    *   **Step 1: Benzene → Acetophenone.** `(CH3COCl/AlCl3)` This introduces the acetyl group, which is a meta-director.\n\n2.  **Introducing the Second Substituent:**\n    *   **Path A (Nitration first):** `Acetophenone → 3-Nitroacetophenone` `(HNO3/H2SO4)`. The meta-directing acetyl group guides the nitro group to the 3-position. This is a standard and effective reaction.\n    *   **Path B (Bromination first):** `Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone` `(Br2/FeBr3)`. The meta-directing acetyl group guides the bromine atom to the 3-position. This is also an effective reaction.\n\n3.  **Introducing the Third Substituent:**\n    *   **Following Path A:** `3-Nitroacetophenone → 1-(3-Bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one` `(Br2/FeBr3)`. In 3-nitroacetophenone, both the acetyl and nitro groups are meta-directors. The acetyl group (at C1) directs to C5. The nitro group (at C3) also directs to C5. Since both groups direct the incoming bromine to the same position (C5), this route leads to the desired 1,3,5-product with high yield.\n    *   **Following Path B:** `3-Bromoacetophenone → ???` `(HNO3/H2SO4)`. In 3-bromoacetophenone, the acetyl group (meta-director) directs nitration to the C5 position. However, the bromo group (ortho-, para-director) directs nitration to the C2, C4, and C6 positions. The directing effects are in conflict. Experimental evidence shows that nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone primarily yields 3-bromo-4-nitroacetophenone, not the desired 1,3,5-isomer.\n\nThe chemically sound, high-yield pathway is Acylation → Nitration → Bromination.\n\n**Evaluating the Given Options:**\n\n*   **A)** This sequence fails at step (iii). Friedel-Crafts acylation cannot be performed on aniline (product of step ii).\n*   **B)** This sequence is illogical because it involves removing the functional group in step (iv) to revert to benzene.\n*   **C)** This sequence fails at step (iii). Friedel-Crafts acylation is attempted on 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene, which is a strongly deactivated ring and will not work.\n*   **D)** This sequence follows the path: Acylation → Bromination → Nitration. The first two steps correctly establish the 1,3-relationship between the acetyl and bromo groups. However, the final step (nitration) does not produce the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one in high yield; it produces other isomers.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nNone of the provided options describe the correct, high-yield synthesis. The scientifically correct sequence is Acylation → Nitration → Bromination. However, if forced to choose the \"best\" option among the flawed choices, Option D is the most plausible. Its initial two steps are correct, and it avoids the fundamental impossibilities of the other options (like performing a Friedel-Crafts reaction on a deactivated ring or an amine). The flaw in Option D is in the regioselectivity of the final step, which contradicts the \"high-yield\" requirement of the question. Given the constraints of a multiple-choice question, it is the only sequence that begins logically and is not entirely impossible.\n\n<<<D>>>"
