    "To determine the pH of the final solution, we must first calculate the moles of the acidic and basic species and then determine which one is in excess after all reactions are complete.\n\n**1. Calculate initial moles of each component:**\n\n*   **CH3COOH (Weak Acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.050 moles\n\n*   **HCl (Strong Acid):**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 moles\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, moles of H⁺ = 0.080 moles.\n\n*   **Ba(OH)2 (Strong Base):**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 moles\n    *   Since Ba(OH)₂ dissociates to produce two OH⁻ ions, moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 moles = 0.180 moles.\n\n**2. Neutralization Reactions:**\n\nFirst, the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) will react with the strong base (OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂).\n\n*   Initial moles H⁺ = 0.080 mol\n*   Initial moles OH⁻ = 0.180 mol\n*   The H⁺ ions will be completely consumed.\n*   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 moles\n\nNext, the remaining strong base (OH⁻) will react with the weak acid (CH₃COOH).\n\n*   Initial moles CH₃COOH = 0.050 mol\n*   Moles of OH⁻ available = 0.100 mol\n*   The CH₃COOH will be completely consumed.\n*   Moles of excess OH⁻ = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 moles\n\n**3. Calculate Final Concentration and pH:**\n\nThe final solution contains 0.050 moles of excess OH⁻ ions. The pH of the solution will be determined by this excess strong base. The contribution from the conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻) formed is negligible in the presence of a strong base.\n\n*   **Total Volume:** 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n*   **Final [OH⁻]:** Moles / Volume = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L = 0.04167 M\n*   **Calculate pOH:** pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n*   **Calculate pH:** pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe final pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<C>>>"
