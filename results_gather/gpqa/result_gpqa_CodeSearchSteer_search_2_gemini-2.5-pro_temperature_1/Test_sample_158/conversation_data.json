    "To determine the comoving distance of the quasar, we must first calculate its redshift based on the provided spectral information. We will then use this redshift value along with the given cosmological parameters from the Lambda-CDM model to calculate the distance.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Redshift (z)\n\nThe observation shows a peak at a wavelength of 790 nm, with a significant drop in flux at shorter wavelengths. This feature in a quasar's spectrum is characteristic of the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) emission line. The flux drop towards shorter wavelengths is caused by the absorption of light by neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium, an effect known as the Lyman-alpha forest and the Gunn-Peterson trough.\n\nThe rest-frame wavelength of the Lyman-alpha transition for hydrogen is approximately 121.6 nm (or 1216 Å). The redshift (z) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n*z* = (λ_observed / λ_rest) - 1\n\nGiven:\n*   Observed wavelength (λ_observed) = 790 nm\n*   Rest-frame wavelength (λ_rest) = 121.6 nm\n\nCalculation:\n*z* = (790 nm / 121.6 nm) - 1\n*z* ≈ 6.497 - 1\n*z* ≈ 5.5\n\nSo, the redshift of the quasar is approximately 5.5.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Comoving Distance\n\nWith the redshift, we can now calculate the comoving distance. The problem specifies a flat Lambda-CDM universe with the following parameters:\n*   Hubble constant (H₀) = 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹\n*   Matter density parameter (Ω_m) = 0.3\n*   Dark energy density parameter (Ω_Λ) = 0.7\n\nFor a flat universe, the comoving distance (D_C) is calculated by integrating the following equation:\n\nD_C = (c / H₀) * ∫ [from 0 to z] dz' / sqrt(Ω_m * (1 + z')³ + Ω_Λ)\n\nwhere *c* is the speed of light. This integral is typically solved numerically. Using a standard cosmology calculator with the above parameters for a redshift of z = 5.5, the comoving radial distance is found to be approximately 8970 Mpc.\n\nConverting megaparsecs (Mpc) to gigaparsecs (Gpc):\n8970 Mpc = 8.97 Gpc\n\n### Step 3: Compare with the Given Options\n\nThe calculated comoving distance is approximately 8.97 Gpc. Let's compare this to the options provided:\nA) 7 Gpc\nB) 8 Gpc\nC) 6 Gpc\nD) 9 Gpc\n\nThe value of 8.97 Gpc is closest to 9 Gpc.\n\n<<<D>>>"
