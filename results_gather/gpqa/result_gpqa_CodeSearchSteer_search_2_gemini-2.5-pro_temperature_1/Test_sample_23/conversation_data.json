    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z.**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   The mass percentage of hydrogen in a cycloalkane (general formula CnH2n) is:\n        Mass % H = (Total mass of H / Total mass of compound) * 100\n        Mass % H = (2n * AtomicMassH) / (n * AtomicMassC + 2n * AtomicMassH)\n        Using integer masses (H=1, C=12): Mass % H = (2n) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7.\n    *   1/7 ≈ 0.142857, which corresponds to 14.28%.\n    *   The mass percentage of hydrogen for an alkane (CnH2n+2) does not yield this value.\n    *   Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n    *   The problem states that Z is a constituent of mixture Y and is widely used as a solvent. Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a very common cycloalkane solvent. Let's hypothesize that n=6 and Z is cyclohexane.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hydrogenation Reactions.**\n    *   Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y under severe conditions gives only substance Z (CnH2n).\n    *   This implies that all components of mixture X (let's call them A and B) and mixture Y (Z and another liquid, Z') have the same carbon skeleton, or skeletons that can be converted to Z's skeleton under the reaction conditions.\n    *   Let's assume the simplest case: all compounds (A, B, Z, Z') are based on a 6-carbon ring (n=6).\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture Y.**\n    *   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, Z and Z'.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components do not have C=C or C≡C bonds that readily react with bromine.\n    *   Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), which is saturated and does not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Z' must also not decolorize bromine water. A common substance that fits this description, besides saturated alkanes, is an aromatic compound like benzene (C6H6). Benzene does not react with bromine water under normal conditions.\n    *   Let's hypothesize that Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (Z) and benzene (Z').\n    *   Let's check if hydrogenating this mixture Y gives only Z. Hydrogenation of cyclohexane yields cyclohexane. Hydrogenation of benzene yields cyclohexane. So, hydrogenation of {cyclohexane, benzene} yields only cyclohexane. This hypothesis is consistent with the problem statement.\n\n4.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction.**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n    *   There are no conjugated multiple bonds in A or B.\n    *   Hydrogenation of X gives only Z (cyclohexane), so A and B must be unsaturated C6 hydrocarbons with a six-membered ring.\n    *   The reaction is: Mixture X (A + B) → Mixture Y (Cyclohexane + Benzene).\n    *   Since the mixtures are equimolar, the stoichiometry is A + B → C6H12 + C6H6.\n    *   This reaction is described as a disproportionation. In catalytic hydrocarbon chemistry, this often refers to a hydrogen transfer reaction. Let's see if this works. One molecule must be reduced (gain hydrogen) and one must be oxidized (lose hydrogen).\n        *   Reduction: A or B → C6H12 (gains H)\n        *   Oxidation: A or B → C6H6 (loses H)\n    *   The reaction conserves atoms. Let's check the hydrogen balance:\n        Total H in products = H(C6H12) + H(C6H6) = 12 + 6 = 18 atoms.\n        Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (A + B) must also be 18.\n\n5.  **Identify Liquids A and B.**\n    *   We need to find two non-conjugated, unsaturated C6 cyclic hydrocarbons, A and B, whose total hydrogen count is 18.\n    *   Let A be cyclohexene, C6H10. It is unsaturated and non-conjugated.\n    *   This means B must have 18 - 10 = 8 hydrogen atoms. The formula for B is C6H8.\n    *   A C6H8 cyclic hydrocarbon with no conjugated bonds would be 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n    *   So, let's propose Mixture X = {cyclohexene (C6H10), 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)}.\n    *   Let's check the disproportionation reaction:\n        C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) + C6H10 (cyclohexene) → C6H6 (benzene) + C6H12 (cyclohexane)\n    *   In this reaction, 1,4-cyclohexadiene is oxidized to benzene by losing 2 hydrogen atoms. Cyclohexene is reduced to cyclohexane by gaining 2 hydrogen atoms. This is a valid hydrogen transfer (disproportionation) reaction.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion.**\n    *   All conditions of the problem are met with this model:\n        *   X = {Cyclohexene (C6H10), 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)}\n        *   Y = {Benzene (C6H6), Cyclohexane (C6H12)}\n        *   Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12)\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in Cyclohexene) + (H atoms in 1,4-Cyclohexadiene) = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
