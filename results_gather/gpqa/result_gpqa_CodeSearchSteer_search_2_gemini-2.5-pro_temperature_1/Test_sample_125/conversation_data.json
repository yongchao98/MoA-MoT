    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of peaks in each chromatogram.\n\n### Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a ketone. It has one existing chiral center at carbon 5, with the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at carbon 3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol using lithium aluminum hydride (LAH). This reduction creates a new chiral center at carbon 3.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material is chiral, the two faces of the carbonyl group are not equivalent. The hydride can attack from either face, leading to the formation of two different products. These products, (3S,5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R,5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers of each other. Diastereomers have different physical properties.\n\n**Outcome of Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols using sodium borohydride (NaBH₄). This creates two new chiral centers at carbons 2 and 4.\n*   **Products:** The reduction can result in three possible stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol:\n    *   (2R,4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (which is a meso compound and identical to the 2S,4R form).\n*   The (2R,4R) and (2S,4S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers. Since the reaction starts with an achiral molecule and uses an achiral reagent, this pair is formed as a racemic mixture (a 50:50 mixture). The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n**Outcome of Reaction II:** Three stereoisomeric products are formed: a racemic mixture of two enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3S,5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R,5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R,4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n### Chromatographic Separation\n\n#### Normal-Phase HPLC\nA normal-phase HPLC column is achiral and separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers**, having identical physical properties in an achiral environment, will not be separated and will elute as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and polarities, so they will be separated.\n*   **Meso compounds** are diastereomers of chiral isomers and will also be separated.\n\nLet's analyze the peaks from our mixture:\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I, (3S,5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R,5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, will separate into **two peaks**.\n*   The enantiomeric pair from Reaction II, (2R,4R)- and (2S,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will co-elute as **one peak**.\n*   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol from Reaction II is a diastereomer to the other products from Reaction II and will form a **separate peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally different molecules with different polarities and will not co-elute.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks in the normal-phase HPLC is 2 (from Reaction I) + 1 (from the enantiomeric pair in Reaction II) + 1 (from the meso compound in Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### Chiral HPLC\nAn HPLC with a chiral stationary phase is designed to separate enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers.\n*   The column will interact differently with each of the five unique stereoisomers in the mixture, allowing for their separation.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be resolved.\n*   The enantiomeric pair from Reaction II will be separated into two distinct peaks.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II will be separated from the other isomers.\n\nAssuming the chiral column is effective, it will resolve all five stereoisomers present in the final mixture.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks in the chiral HPLC is **5 peaks**.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe analysis predicts 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<D>>>"
