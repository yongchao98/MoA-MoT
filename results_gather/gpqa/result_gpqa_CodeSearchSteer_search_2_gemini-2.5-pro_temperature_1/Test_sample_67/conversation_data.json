    "The physical phenomenon described is known as Larmor precession. When a magnetic moment is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque that causes it to precess around the direction of the magnetic field. The frequency of this precession is called the Larmor frequency.\n\nInitially, the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the spin expectation value points along +Z. When the field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the magnetic moment, and thus the spin, begins to precess around the new field direction (+Y).\n\nAs the spin vector precesses around the Y-axis, its projection onto the Z-axis will oscillate. The angular frequency of this oscillation is the Larmor frequency, which is given by the formula:\n\nω = γB\n\nHere:\n*   ω is the angular frequency of oscillation.\n*   γ (gamma) is the gyromagnetic ratio of the particle.\n*   B is the magnitude of the magnetic field.\n\nThis result can be derived formally using the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, but it is a standard result in quantum mechanics and magnetic resonance. The expectation value of the z-component of the spin, `<Sz(t)>`, will oscillate as cos(γBt), meaning the frequency of oscillation is indeed γB. This frequency is independent of the initial orientation of the spin.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment is γB.\n\n<<<D>>>"
