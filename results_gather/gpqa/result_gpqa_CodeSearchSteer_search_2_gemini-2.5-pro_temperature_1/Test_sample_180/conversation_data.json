    "Let's break down the sources of solar neutrinos in the specified energy bands under the hypothetical scenario.\n\n### Neutrino Sources and Energy Bands\n\nFirst, we need to identify which nuclear reactions produce neutrinos in the energy bands of interest. The main sources are the Proton-Proton (pp) chain and the CNO cycle.\n\n*   **Band 1 (700-800 keV or 0.7-0.8 MeV):**\n    *   **⁸B (Boron-8) decay:** This is part of the pp-III branch. It produces neutrinos with a continuous energy spectrum up to about 15 MeV. It normally contributes to this band.\n    *   **CNO cycle:** The decays of ¹³N and ¹⁵O in the CNO cycle produce neutrinos with continuous spectra up to 1.20 MeV and 1.73 MeV, respectively. They both contribute to this energy band.\n\n*   **Band 2 (800-900 keV or 0.8-0.9 MeV):**\n    *   **⁷Be (Beryllium-7) electron capture:** This is part of the pp-II branch. It produces a very strong, distinct \"line\" of neutrinos at a specific energy of 861 keV (0.862 MeV). This source is a dominant contributor to this band.\n    *   **⁸B (Boron-8) decay:** As part of the pp-III branch, its continuous spectrum also passes through this band.\n    *   **CNO cycle:** The ¹³N and ¹⁵O neutrinos also contribute here.\n\n### The Hypothetical Change\n\nThe problem states that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped. The key reaction in the pp-III branch that produces high-energy neutrinos is the decay of ⁸B. Therefore, under this hypothetical scenario, the flux of ⁸B neutrinos drops to zero. All other reactions, including the entire pp-II branch (which produces the ⁷Be neutrinos) and the CNO cycle, remain as they were.\n\n### Calculating the Flux Ratio After the Change\n\nAfter the pp-III branch stops, we must re-evaluate the neutrino sources in each band:\n\n*   **Flux (Band 1: 700-800 keV):** The only remaining contributors are the neutrinos from the CNO cycle. The flux from ⁸B is now gone.\n*   **Flux (Band 2: 800-900 keV):** The contributors are the powerful 861 keV line from ⁷Be and the continuous spectrum from the CNO cycle. The flux from ⁸B is gone.\n\nNow, let's compare the magnitude of these remaining fluxes. We can refer to solar neutrino spectrum plots, which show the flux (number of neutrinos per cm², per second, per MeV) against neutrino energy.\n\n1.  In **Band 2 (800-900 keV)**, the flux is overwhelmingly dominated by the ⁷Be neutrino line at 861 keV. The contribution from the continuous CNO spectrum in this narrow 100 keV window is many orders of magnitude smaller and can be considered negligible in comparison.\n\n2.  In **Band 1 (700-800 keV)**, the flux consists solely of neutrinos from the CNO cycle. The CNO cycle accounts for only about 1% of the Sun's total energy output, and its neutrino flux is correspondingly much lower than the major pp-chain fluxes.\n\nTherefore, the ratio we need to calculate is approximately:\n\n**Flux (Band 1) / Flux (Band 2) ≈ [Flux from CNO cycle] / [Flux from ⁷Be line]**\n\nA look at the standard solar model data reveals the enormous difference between these two fluxes. The total flux of the ⁷Be line is about 5 x 10⁹ neutrinos/cm²/s, whereas the total flux for all CNO neutrinos is roughly an order of magnitude smaller, at around 7 x 10⁸ neutrinos/cm²/s. Furthermore, this CNO flux is spread over a wide energy range (up to 1.73 MeV), so the portion falling within the narrow 100 keV window of Band 1 is significantly smaller. In contrast, the entire ⁷Be line flux is concentrated in Band 2.\n\nThis results in the flux in Band 2 being vastly larger than the flux in Band 1. The ratio of Flux(Band 1) / Flux(Band 2) will be a very small number.\n\nTo get a more precise estimate:\n*   The CNO neutrino flux density around 0.7-0.8 MeV is roughly 10⁴ to 10⁵ cm⁻²s⁻¹MeV⁻¹.\n*   The ⁷Be line flux is a discrete line, not a continuum, but its total flux of ~5x10⁹ cm⁻²s⁻¹ is entirely contained in Band 2.\n\nThe flux in Band 1 is very small, while the flux in Band 2 is very large. This makes their ratio a very small number, significantly less than 1. Reviewing the options, 0.01 (10⁻²) is the most plausible value representing this large disparity.\n\n<<<A>>>"
