    "The search results confirm the fundamental principles needed to solve this problem.\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity (L) of a star is proportional to its radius (R) squared and its surface temperature (T) to the fourth power. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. This confirms that L ∝ R²T⁴.\n\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law**: The wavelength at which a black body is brightest (λ_max) is inversely proportional to its absolute temperature (T). The formula is λ_max = b/T, where b is Wien's constant.\n\nBased on these principles, the reasoning is as follows:\n\n*   The problem states that the two stars radiate as black bodies.\n*   The luminosity of a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4πR²σT⁴.\n*   To find the ratio of the luminosities (L₁/L₂), we can set up the equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n*   We are given that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star_2, so R₁/R₂ = 1.5.\n*   We are also told that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same (λ_max₁ = λ_max₂).\n*   According to Wien's Displacement Law, λ_max = b/T. If the peak wavelengths are the same, their surface temperatures must also be the same (T₁ = T₂), which means T₁/T₂ = 1.\n*   The information about the stars' masses and radial velocities is not relevant to the calculation of luminosity based on radius and temperature as defined by the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n*   Substituting the known values into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * (1)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * 1\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25\n\nThis matches option D.\n\nFinal check of the question and my logic. The question is direct, the physics principles are standard for this type of problem, and the calculation is straightforward. The extra information (mass, radial velocity) seems designed to be a distractor. The core of the problem lies in correctly applying the Stefan-Boltzmann and Wien's laws. The result is exactly 2.25.\n\nThe luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of 2.25.\n\nFinal answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
