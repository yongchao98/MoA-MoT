    "To determine the relationship between λ1 (the mean free path of gas molecules) and λ2 (the mean free path of electrons scattering with those gas molecules), we need to compare their respective collision cross-sections. The mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section (σ), following the general relationship λ ≈ 1/(nσ), where 'n' is the number density of the target particles.\n\n1.  **λ1: Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules:** This is determined by gas molecules colliding with each other. These interactions are governed by short-range van der Waals forces. The effective size for this collision is the kinetic diameter of the molecule. This gives a collision cross-section, let's call it σ₁.\n\n2.  **λ2: Mean Free Path of Electrons:** This is determined by the 1000 kV electrons from the beam scattering off the same gas molecules. An electron is a charged particle, and its interaction with a neutral gas molecule is governed by the long-range electromagnetic (Coulomb) force. The electron interacts with the electric fields of the molecule's nucleus and its own electron cloud.\n\n**The Key Difference:** The nature of the interaction force is crucial.\n*   **Molecule-Molecule Interaction (σ₁):** Two neutral molecules must come very close to each other for the short-range van der Waals forces to cause a collision. The cross-section is related to the physical size of the molecules.\n*   **Electron-Molecule Interaction (σ₂):** Because the electron interacts via the long-range electromagnetic force, it can be deflected (which constitutes a scattering event) even when passing the gas molecule at a considerable distance. This creates a larger effective target area.\n\nA research paper comparing collision types explicitly states that the interaction potential between a charged particle (like an electron) and a neutral particle is longer-range than neutral-neutral interactions, and therefore, electron-atom/molecule collision cross-sections tend to be larger.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   The collision cross-section for an electron scattering off a gas molecule (σ₂) is larger than the kinetic cross-section for two gas molecules colliding with each other (σ₁).\n*   Since the mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section (λ ∝ 1/σ), a larger cross-section results in a shorter mean free path.\n*   Therefore, because σ₂ > σ₁, it follows that λ₂ < λ₁.\n\n<<<C>>>"
