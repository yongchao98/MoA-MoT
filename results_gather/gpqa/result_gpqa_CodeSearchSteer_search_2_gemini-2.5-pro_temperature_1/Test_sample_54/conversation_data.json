    "Based on the analysis of the provided 1H NMR data, the unknown compound is identified as **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n### **Analysis of the 1H NMR Data:**\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, singlet):** This signal corresponds to the three protons of a methyl group (CH₃) that is not adjacent to any protons, which is characteristic of an acetyl group (CH₃-C=O). All the given options are acetates and would show this peak.\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, doublet):** This signal represents a methyl group coupled to a single proton. The chemical shift is appropriate for a methyl group attached to a double bond (an allylic methyl group).\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, doublet of quartets):** This vinylic proton (a proton on a C=C double bond) is coupled to one other proton (giving the doublet) and to a group of three protons (giving the quartet). This matches a proton on a double bond that is adjacent to both another vinylic proton and a methyl group.\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, doublet, J = 16.0 Hz):** This signal is for the second vinylic proton, which is coupled to only one other proton. The crucial piece of information is the coupling constant (J value) of 16.0 Hz. Coupling constants for vinylic protons in a *trans* configuration are typically large, in the range of 11-18 Hz. In contrast, *cis* vinylic protons show smaller coupling constants, generally between 6-15 Hz. The observed J value of 16.0 Hz strongly indicates a *trans* relationship between the two double-bond protons.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe fragments identified are an acetate group and a trans-propenyl group (CH₃-CH=CH-). Assembling these parts gives the structure of trans-propenyl acetate. A butenyl acetate would have a different number of carbons and a more complex splitting pattern. The large coupling constant (16.0 Hz) rules out the cis isomers.\n\nTherefore, the data corresponds to Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
