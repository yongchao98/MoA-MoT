    "### Evaluating the Detectability of Stars with ESPRESSO\n\nTo determine how many of the listed stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph on a Very Large Telescope (VLT), we must first establish the instrument's capabilities and the properties of each star. A star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel is achieved during a one-hour exposure. ESPRESSO can be coupled with one of the 8.2-meter Unit Telescopes (UTs) at the Paranal Observatory in Chile.\n\nBased on performance documentation, in a one-hour (3600s) exposure in its high-resolution (HR) mode, ESPRESSO can achieve a signal-to-noise ratio of 10 for stars as faint as V magnitude 17.1. Another source states that for the HR42 binning mode, the limiting magnitude to transition from photon-noise limited to detector-noise limited is around V magnitude 18. For this analysis, we will conservatively use V=17.1 as the limiting magnitude for achieving an S/N of 10 in one hour.\n\nThe location of the Paranal Observatory is in the southern hemisphere (latitude approximately -24.6°), which affects the visibility of celestial objects.\n\nHere's an analysis of each star:\n\n**a) Canopus:**\n*   **Apparent V magnitude:** Canopus is the second brightest star in the night sky, with an apparent visual magnitude of approximately -0.74.\n*   **Observability:** Its declination is about -52° 41', making it easily observable from Paranal in the southern hemisphere.\n*   **Detectability:** With a magnitude of -0.74, it is significantly brighter than the V=17.1 limit. Therefore, **Canopus is detectable**.\n\n**b) Polaris:**\n*   **Apparent V magnitude:** Polaris has an apparent magnitude of about 1.98.\n*   **Observability:** Polaris is the North Star, with a declination of approximately +89° 15'. Due to its far northern declination, it is not visible from the Paranal Observatory in Chile.\n*   **Detectability:** Since it cannot be observed from Paranal, **Polaris is not detectable**.\n\n**c) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 10 pc distance from us.**\n*   **Observability:** A declination of 0° makes it perfectly observable from Paranal.\n*   **Apparent V magnitude (m):** Using the distance modulus formula, m = M - 5 + 5*log10(d), where M is the absolute magnitude (15) and d is the distance in parsecs (10).\n    *   m = 15 - 5 + 5*log10(10) = 10 + 5*1 = 15.\n*   **Detectability:** An apparent magnitude of 15 is brighter than the V=17.1 limit. Therefore, **this star is detectable**.\n\n**d) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 200 pc distance from us.**\n*   **Observability:** A declination of 0° makes it observable.\n*   **Apparent V magnitude (m):** M = 15, d = 200 pc.\n    *   m = 15 - 5 + 5*log10(200) = 10 + 5*(2.301) ≈ 10 + 11.5 = 21.5.\n*   **Detectability:** An apparent magnitude of 21.5 is much fainter than the V=17.1 limit. Therefore, **this star is not detectable**.\n\n**e) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us.**\n*   **Observability:** A declination of 0° makes it observable.\n*   **Apparent V magnitude (m):** M = 15, d = 5 pc.\n    *   m = 15 - 5 + 5*log10(5) = 10 + 5*(0.699) ≈ 10 + 3.5 = 13.5.\n*   **Detectability:** An apparent magnitude of 13.5 is brighter than the V=17.1 limit. Therefore, **this star is detectable**.\n\n**f) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 50 pc distance from us.**\n*   **Observability:** A declination of 0° makes it observable.\n*   **Apparent V magnitude (m):** M = 15, d = 50 pc.\n    *   m = 15 - 5 + 5*log10(50) = 10 + 5*(1.699) ≈ 10 + 8.5 = 18.5.\n*   **Detectability:** An apparent magnitude of 18.5 is fainter than the V=17.1 limit. Therefore, **this star is not detectable**.\n\nIn summary, the detectable stars are:\n1.  Canopus\n2.  Star (c) with V = 15\n3.  Star (e) with V = 13.5\n\nA total of **3** stars from the list would be detectable.\n\n<<<D>>>"
