    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting.\n\n1.  **Transit Probability Formula:** The geometric probability of a planet transiting its star, for a circular orbit, is given by the ratio of the star's radius (R_s) to the planet's semi-major axis (a).\n    *   P_transit = R_s / a\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** To find the semi-major axis (a), we use Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion. The law relates the orbital period (P) to the semi-major axis (a), the star's mass (M_s), and the planet's mass (M_p).\n    *   P² = [4π² / (G * (M_s + M_p))] * a³\n    *   Since the planets are \"Earth-like,\" their masses (M_p) are negligible compared to their host stars' masses (M_s). We can simplify the equation to:\n    *   P² ≈ (4π² / (G * M_s)) * a³\n\n3.  **Solving for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** We can rearrange Kepler's Third Law to solve for 'a'.\n    *   a³ ≈ (G * M_s * P²) / 4π²\n    *   a ∝ (M_s * P²)^(1/3)\n\n4.  **Combined Probability Expression:** Now, substitute the expression for 'a' back into the transit probability formula.\n    *   P_transit ∝ R_s / (M_s * P²)^(1/3)\n\n5.  **Applying the Given Information:** Let's denote the parameters for Planet_1 with subscript 1 and for Planet_2 with subscript 2.\n    *   Orbital Period: P₂ = 3 * P₁\n    *   Stellar Mass: M_s1 = 2 * M_s2\n    *   Stellar Radius: R_s1 = R_s2\n\n6.  **Calculating the Ratio of Probabilities:** We want to find the ratio of the transit probability of Planet_1 to that of Planet_2 (P_transit1 / P_transit2).\n\n    *   P_transit1 / P_transit2 = [R_s1 / (M_s1 * P₁²)^(1/3)] / [R_s2 / (M_s2 * P₂²)^(1/3)]\n\n    *   Substitute the known relationships:\n        *   P_transit1 / P_transit2 = [R_s2 / ((2 * M_s2) * P₁²)^(1/3)] / [R_s2 / (M_s2 * (3 * P₁)²)^(1/3)]\n\n    *   The stellar radius (R_s2) cancels out from the numerator and denominator:\n        *   P_transit1 / P_transit2 = [(M_s2 * 9 * P₁²)^(1/3)] / [(2 * M_s2 * P₁²)^(1/3)]\n\n    *   The terms M_s2 and P₁² also cancel out:\n        *   P_transit1 / P_transit2 = (9/2)^(1/3)\n        *   P_transit1 / P_transit2 = (4.5)^(1/3)\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   P_transit1 / P_transit2 ≈ 1.65096\n\nThis result shows that the probability of Planet_1 transiting is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1.\n\nBased on this calculation, the correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
