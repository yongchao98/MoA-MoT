    "The calculation to find the threshold energy (Eγ) for a high-energy gamma-ray to annihilate with a low-energy Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon (E_CMB) and produce an electron-positron pair is based on the principles of special relativity.\n\nThe fundamental reaction is:\nγ + γ → e⁺ + e⁻\n\nTo determine the minimum energy required for this process, we analyze the collision at the threshold condition. This occurs when the resulting electron (e⁻) and positron (e⁺) are created with no kinetic energy in the center-of-mass frame of the two initial photons.\n\nThe key steps in the calculation are as follows:\n\n1.  **Invariant Mass**: In relativistic physics, the square of the total four-momentum is a Lorentz invariant, meaning it is the same in all inertial reference frames (like the lab frame and the center-of-mass frame).\n2.  **Center-of-Mass Frame**: At the threshold of the reaction, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame is equal to the sum of the rest mass energies of the created particles. Since an electron and a positron are produced, this is `2 * m_e * c²`, where `m_e` is the rest mass of an electron and `c` is the speed of light.\n3.  **Lab Frame**: The threshold energy for the incoming gamma-ray is lowest when it collides head-on with the CMB photon.\n4.  **Threshold Condition**: By equating the invariant mass in both frames, we arrive at the threshold condition for a head-on collision:\n    `Eγ = (m_e * c²)² / E_CMB`\n\nNow, we can substitute the given and known values into this equation:\n\n*   The rest mass energy of an electron (`m_e * c²`) is approximately 0.511 MeV (Mega-electron Volts), which is equal to 0.511 x 10⁶ eV.\n*   The average energy of a CMB photon (`E_CMB`) is given in the problem as 10⁻³ eV.\n\nPerforming the calculation:\n\n*   `Eγ = (0.511 * 10⁶ eV)² / (10⁻³ eV)`\n*   `Eγ = (0.2611 * 10¹² eV²) / (10⁻³ eV)`\n*   `Eγ = 2.611 * 10¹⁴ eV`\n\nThe question asks for the answer in Giga-electron Volts (GeV), so we convert our result:\n*   Since 1 GeV = 10⁹ eV,\n*   `Eγ = (2.611 * 10¹⁴ eV) / (10⁹ eV/GeV)`\n*   `Eγ = 2.611 * 10⁵ GeV`\n\nThis result indicates that gamma rays with energies around 2.6 x 10⁵ GeV will have their lifetimes significantly limited by interaction with the CMB, as the universe becomes opaque to them above this energy threshold. This value corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
