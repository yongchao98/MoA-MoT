    "The detection of Lyman-alpha (Lyα) absorption lines from the ground is fundamentally limited by the Earth's atmosphere, which blocks ultraviolet (UV) radiation. To estimate the minimum redshift for these observations, we must consider the wavelength at which the atmosphere becomes transparent and the amount of redshift required to shift the Lyα line into this observable window.\n\n### Key Factors:\n\n*   **Lyman-alpha Wavelength:** The Lyα transition of neutral hydrogen has a rest wavelength (λ₀) of approximately 1216 Å. This is deep in the UV part of the spectrum.\n*   **Atmospheric Cutoff:** Earth's atmosphere absorbs most radiation with wavelengths shorter than those in the optical range. For ground-based telescopes, the atmosphere only becomes reasonably transparent at wavelengths longer than about 3200-3300 Å (320-330 nm). Below this, absorption by ozone and other molecules is too high for effective observation.\n*   **Redshift Calculation:** The redshift (z) relates the rest wavelength (λ₀) and the observed wavelength (λ_obs) through the formula:\n    `1 + z = λ_obs / λ₀`\n\n### Estimation:\n\nTo find the lower limit on the redshift, we must calculate the `z` required to shift the 1216 Å line to the minimum observable wavelength, which we can take as approximately 3300 Å.\n\n1.  **Rest Wavelength (λ₀):** 1216 Å\n2.  **Minimum Observed Wavelength (λ_obs):** ~3300 Å\n3.  **Calculation:**\n    *   `1 + z = 3300 Å / 1216 Å`\n    *   `1 + z ≈ 2.71`\n    *   `z ≈ 1.71`\n\nThis calculation suggests a minimum theoretical redshift of about 1.7. However, for practical detection with good signal quality, astronomers often need to observe at wavelengths where atmospheric transmission is more favorable, pushing the required redshift slightly higher. For instance, a redshift of 1.9 would shift the Lyα line to:\n\n*   `λ_obs = 1216 Å * (1 + 1.9) = 1216 Å * 2.9 = 3526.4 Å`\n\nThis wavelength is well within the near-UV window accessible by modern ground-based spectrographs, making `z ≈ 1.9` a more practical lower limit for reliable surveys. In contrast, a redshift of 1.2 would only shift the line to ~2675 Å, which is still deep in the UV and completely blocked by the atmosphere.\n\nTherefore, considering the options provided, 1.9 represents the most plausible lower limit for the detection of these objects with optical ground-based telescopes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
