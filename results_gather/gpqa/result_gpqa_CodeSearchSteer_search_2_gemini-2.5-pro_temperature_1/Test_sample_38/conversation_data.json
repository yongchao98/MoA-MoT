    "To determine the numerical value of \"a\", we must use the normalization condition from quantum mechanics. This principle states that the total probability of finding the particle somewhere in space is 1 (or 100%). The probability is found by integrating the square of the magnitude of the wave function, |Ψ(x)|², over the entire region where the particle can exist.\n\nThe given wave function is:\nΨ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\nThe problem states that the particles are only found in the interval between x=1 and x=3. Therefore, the integral of the probability density over this interval must be equal to 1.\n\nFirst, we need to find the probability density function, |Ψ(x)|². For a complex function Ψ = Re + i*Im, the square of its magnitude is |Ψ|² = Re² + Im².\nIn this case:\nRe(x) = a / sqrt(1 + x)\nIm(x) = -0.5\n\nSo, the probability density is:\n|Ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (-0.5)²\n|Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\nNext, we set up the normalization integral over the interval:\n∫ [from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\nWe can split this into two separate integrals:\n∫ [from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x)) dx + ∫ [from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx = 1\n\nNow, we solve each integral:\n1.  For the first integral:\n    a² * ∫ [from 1 to 3] (1 / (1 + x)) dx\n    The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x).\n    So, a² * [ln(1 + x)] evaluated from 1 to 3 is:\n    a² * (ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1)) = a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) = a² * ln(4/2) = a² * ln(2)\n\n2.  For the second integral:\n    ∫ [from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx = [0.25x] evaluated from 1 to 3 is:\n    0.25 * (3 - 1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5\n\nNow, we substitute these results back into the equation:\na² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n\nFinally, we solve for \"a\":\na² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\nUsing the value ln(2) ≈ 0.693:\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.693 ≈ 0.7215\na ≈ sqrt(0.7215)\na ≈ 0.849\n\nThis value is closest to 0.85.\n\n<<<A>>>"
