    "### Calculation of Relative Speed\n\nTo find the relative speed between the two astronauts, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Let the velocity of the first astronaut (mass 2m) be \\(v_1 = 0.6c\\) and the velocity of the second astronaut (mass 3m) be \\(v_2 = 0.5c\\), both measured from a stationary reference frame. The relative velocity \\(v_{rel}\\) of the first astronaut with respect to the second is given by:\n\n*   **Formula:** \\(v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}\\)\n\n*   **Substitution:** \\(v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}\\)\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   \\(v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3}\\)\n    *   \\(v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}\\)\n    *   \\(v_{rel} \\approx 0.142857c\\)\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n### Calculation of Total Energy\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The formula for the total relativistic energy of a particle is \\(E = \\gamma mc^2\\), where \\(\\gamma\\) is the Lorentz factor, given by \\(\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\\).\n\n**Astronaut 1:**\n*   Mass (\\(m_1\\)): 2m\n*   Velocity (\\(v_1\\)): 0.6c\n*   Lorentz factor (\\(\\gamma_1\\)):\n    *   \\(\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25\\)\n*   Energy (\\(E_1\\)):\n    *   \\(E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m) \\times c^2 = 2.5 mc^2\\)\n\n**Astronaut 2:**\n*   Mass (\\(m_2\\)): 3m\n*   Velocity (\\(v_2\\)): 0.5c\n*   Lorentz factor (\\(\\gamma_2\\)):\n    *   \\(\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx \\frac{1}{0.866} \\approx 1.1547\\)\n*   Energy (\\(E_2\\)):\n    *   \\(E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 \\approx 1.1547 \\times (3m) \\times c^2 \\approx 3.4641 mc^2\\)\n\n**Total System Energy:**\n*   \\(E_{total} = E_1 + E_2\\)\n*   \\(E_{total} = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2 = 5.9641 mc^2\\)\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy of the system is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately **0.14c**, and the total energy of the system is approximately **5.96 mc²**. These values correspond to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
