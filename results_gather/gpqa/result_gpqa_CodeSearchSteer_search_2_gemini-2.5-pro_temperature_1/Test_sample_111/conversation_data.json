    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Normalize the State Vector |alpha>\n\nThe given state is proportional to `(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>`. First, we must normalize it. A state `|ψ>` is normalized if the inner product `<ψ|ψ>` equals 1.\n\nLet `|alpha> = C * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`.\nThe corresponding bra vector is `<alpha| = C* * [(1-i)<up| + (2+i)<down|]`.\n\nThe normalization condition is `<alpha|alpha> = 1`:\n`|C|^2 * [(1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i)] = 1`\n`|C|^2 * [(1 - i^2) + (4 - i^2)] = 1`\n`|C|^2 * [(1 + 1) + (4 + 1)] = 1`\n`|C|^2 * [2 + 5] = 1`\n`|C|^2 * 7 = 1`\n`C = 1/sqrt(7)`\n\nSo, the normalized state vector is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\n\nIn matrix form, where `|up> = [1, 0]^T` and `|down> = [0, 1]^T`, the state is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [ (1+i), (2-i) ]^T`\n\n### 2. Define the Operator A and Find Its Eigenstates and Eigenvalues\n\nThe operator A has matrix elements `Aij = hbar/2` if `i ≠ j` and 0 otherwise. This gives the 2x2 matrix:\n`A = (hbar/2) * [ [0, 1], [1, 0] ]`\nThis operator is proportional to the Pauli-X spin matrix (`σ_x`).\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (`λ`), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`:\n`det( [ [-λ, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -λ] ] ) = (-λ)(-λ) - (hbar/2)(hbar/2) = 0`\n`λ^2 - (hbar^2)/4 = 0`\n`λ = ± hbar/2`\n\nThe eigenvalues are `λ_1 = +hbar/2` and `λ_2 = -hbar/2`.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors (eigenstates).\n*   **For λ_1 = +hbar/2**:\n    `(A - λ_1*I)v_1 = 0`\n    `[ [-hbar/2, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -hbar/2] ] * [x, y]^T = 0`\n    This gives the equation `-x + y = 0`, so `x = y`. The eigenvector is proportional to `[1, 1]^T`.\n    The normalized eigenstate `|+>` is `(1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 1]^T = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> + |down>)`.\n\n*   **For λ_2 = -hbar/2**:\n    `(A - λ_2*I)v_2 = 0`\n    `[ [hbar/2, hbar/2], [hbar/2, hbar/2] ] * [x, y]^T = 0`\n    This gives the equation `x + y = 0`, so `x = -y`. The eigenvector is proportional to `[1, -1]^T`.\n    The normalized eigenstate `|->` is `(1/sqrt(2)) * [1, -1]^T = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> - |down>)`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Measurement Probabilities\n\nThe probability of measuring an eigenvalue `λ_i` is given by the modulus squared of the inner product of the corresponding eigenstate `|v_i>` with the state `|alpha>`. `P(λ_i) = |<v_i|alpha>|^2`.\n\n*   **Probability of measuring λ_1 = +hbar/2 (state |+>)**:\n    `<+|alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 1] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [ (1+i), (2-i) ]^T`\n    `<+|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [ (1+i) + (2-i) ] = 3 / sqrt(14)`\n    `P(+) = |3 / sqrt(14)|^2 = 9 / 14 ≈ 0.643`\n\n*   **Probability of measuring λ_2 = -hbar/2 (state |->)**:\n    `<-|alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, -1] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [ (1+i), (2-i) ]^T`\n    `<-|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [ (1+i) - (2-i) ] = (1/sqrt(14)) * (-1 + 2i)`\n    `P(-) = |(-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14)|^2 = ((-1)^2 + 2^2) / 14 = (1 + 4) / 14 = 5 / 14 ≈ 0.357`\n\nThe two probabilities are approximately **0.64** and **0.36**.\n\n### 4. Find the Average Value of the Operator\n\nThe average or expectation value of an operator `A` is given by `<A> = <alpha|A|alpha>`. It can also be calculated by summing the eigenvalues multiplied by their respective probabilities.\n\n`<A> = P(+) * λ_1 + P(-) * λ_2`\n`<A> = (9/14) * (hbar/2) + (5/14) * (-hbar/2)`\n`<A> = (hbar/28) * (9 - 5)`\n`<A> = (hbar/28) * 4`\n`<A> = hbar / 7`\n\nThe results are: probabilities of approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and an average value of `hbar / 7`. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
