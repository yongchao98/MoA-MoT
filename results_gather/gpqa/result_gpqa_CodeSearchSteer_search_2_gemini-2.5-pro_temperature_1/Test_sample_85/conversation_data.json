    "To determine the correct starting materials, we must analyze the two reactions, paying close attention to the reagents and their known selectivities.\n\n### Reaction Analysis\n\nThe general structure of the starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an ester group (-COO-isobutyl). The product in both reactions is a lactone (a cyclic ester), 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This lactone is formed by reducing one of the two carbonyl groups to a primary alcohol, which then cyclizes by reacting with the remaining carbonyl group. The stereochemistry at the chiral center (C4 of the product, which was C3 in the starting material) is a key detail.\n\n**Reaction A:**\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄)\n*   **Product:** (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Selectivity:** LiBH₄ is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid group first reacts with LiBH₄ in an acid-base reaction to form a lithium carboxylate salt. This salt is resonance-stabilized and much less reactive towards reduction than the ester group. Therefore, LiBH₄ will reduce the isobutyl ester to a primary alcohol.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The isobutyl ester of compound **A** is reduced to a primary alcohol, forming an intermediate hydroxy acid.\n    2.  Under acidic workup (H⁺), this hydroxy acid undergoes intramolecular cyclization (lactonization) to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the ester and the subsequent lactonization do not affect the stereocenter at C3. Thus, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product. Since the product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Reaction B:**\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃)\n*   **Product:** (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Selectivity:** Borane (often used as a complex, like BH₃·THF) is well-known for its high selectivity in reducing carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The carboxylic acid of compound **B** is selectively reduced to a primary alcohol, forming an intermediate hydroxy ester.\n    2.  Under acidic workup (H⁺), this hydroxy ester undergoes intramolecular transesterification to yield the lactone and isobutanol as a byproduct.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the chiral center at C3 is not involved in the reaction. Therefore, the stereochemistry is preserved. Since the product is (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the chemo-selectivity of the reducing agents and the retention of stereochemistry:\n*   Starting material **A** must have the (R) configuration.\n*   Starting material **B** must have the (S) configuration.\n\nThis corresponds to the following selection:\n**A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n**B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n<<<D>>>"
