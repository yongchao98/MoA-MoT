    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method:** The RV method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. The gravitational pull of the planet causes the star to \"wobble\" around the system's center of mass. This wobble changes the star's velocity along our line of sight, causing a shift in its spectral lines.\n\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Stellar Velocity:** The observed wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r) according to the Doppler effect formula: Δλ/λ₀ = v_r/c. The maximum observed wavelength shift (given in the problem as 5 and 7 miliangstroms) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, which is called the radial velocity semi-amplitude, denoted by *K*.\n    Therefore, *K* is directly proportional to the maximum wavelength shift (Δλ_max).\n    *   For planet #1: K₁ ∝ Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ\n    *   For planet #2: K₂ ∝ Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ\n\n3.  **Find the Ratio of Velocities:** We can find the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes for the two stars:\n    K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n\n4.  **Relate Stellar Velocity (K) to Orbital Period (T):** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity semi-amplitude *K* is related to the system's parameters. A simplified and widely used formula, especially when the planet's mass (M_p) is much smaller than the star's mass (M_star), shows that *K* is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period (T):\n    K ∝ 1 / T^(1/3) or K ∝ T^(-1/3)\n\n    This relationship holds true because the problem states that the other key parameters—the mass of the stars (M_star1 = M_star2) and the mass of the planets (M_p1 ≈ M_p2)—are the same for both systems. We also assume the orbital inclinations are comparable.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Periods:** Now we can relate the ratio of velocities to the ratio of periods:\n    K₂ / K₁ = (T₂ / T₁)^(-1/3) = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)\n\n    We already found that K₂ / K₁ = 1.4, so:\n    1.4 = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)\n\n    To solve for the period ratio (T₂ / T₁), we first cube both sides of the equation:\n    (1.4)³ = T₁ / T₂\n    2.744 = T₁ / T₂\n\n    The question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio T₂ / T₁. We find this by taking the reciprocal:\n    T₂ / T₁ = 1 / 2.744\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    T₂ / T₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\n    This value is approximately 0.36. This result makes physical sense: the larger wavelength shift for star #2 implies a larger stellar velocity, which is caused by a planet in a closer and therefore faster orbit, corresponding to a shorter orbital period.\n\nComparing our result to the given options:\nA) ~ 1.96\nB) ~ 0.36\nC) ~ 0.85\nD) ~ 1.40\n\nThe calculated ratio of ~0.36 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
