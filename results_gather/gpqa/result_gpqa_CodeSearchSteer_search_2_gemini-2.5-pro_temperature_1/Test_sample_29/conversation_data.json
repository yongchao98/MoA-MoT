    "To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we must first find the color of the light it *emits*. The color we perceive is the one that is transmitted or reflected, not the one that is absorbed. The absorbed color is complementary to the observed color.\n\n1.  **Calculate the wavelength of the emitted light:** The energy of the emitted light is given as 2.3393 eV. The relationship between energy (E) and wavelength (λ) is given by the formula E = hc/λ, where 'h' is Planck's constant and 'c' is the speed of light. A simplified version of this formula for converting energy in electronvolts (eV) to wavelength in nanometers (nm) is:\n    λ (nm) ≈ 1240 / E (eV)\n\n    Plugging in the given energy:\n    λ ≈ 1240 / 2.3393 eV\n    λ ≈ 530 nm\n\n2.  **Identify the color of the emitted light:** A wavelength of approximately 530 nm corresponds to the green portion of the visible light spectrum. Therefore, the textile dye emits green light.\n\n3.  **Determine the absorbed color:** The color that a substance absorbs is the complementary color of the one it emits or transmits. According to the color wheel, the complementary color of green is red. A substance that appears green absorbs light in the red portion of the spectrum.\n\nTherefore, the organic compound absorbs red light.\n\n<<<C>>>"
