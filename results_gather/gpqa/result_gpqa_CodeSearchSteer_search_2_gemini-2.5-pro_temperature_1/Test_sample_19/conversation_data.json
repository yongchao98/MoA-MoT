    "The impulse approximation in many-body nuclear calculations is a simplifying assumption that treats the interaction of a probe with a nucleus as a collection of interactions with individual, free nucleons. This approximation is underpinned by several key assumptions.\n\nThe core tenets of the impulse approximation are:\n\n*   **Single Nucleon Interaction:** The incoming probe or interaction current is assumed to interact with only one nucleon at a time. This is often referred to as the \"dilution assumption\". This directly corresponds to the first statement. The nuclear current is treated as a sum of single-nucleon currents.\n*   **Nuclear Transparency:** The nucleus is considered to be \"transparent\" to the probe, meaning the probe interacts with a single nucleon as if that nucleon were isolated. This implies that the incident particle's wave is not significantly altered by the surrounding nuclear medium before interacting with the target nucleon. This matches the second statement.\n*   **Neglect of Binding Forces:** During the brief moment of the interaction, the forces that bind the nucleon within the nucleus are considered negligible. The interaction is treated as if the nucleon were a free particle, not subject to the nuclear potential. This is precisely the fourth statement.\n\nThe third statement, concerning the non-relativistic nature of quarks within the nucleon, is not a foundational assumption of the impulse approximation itself. The impulse approximation operates at the level of nucleons, largely treating them as fundamental particles for the purpose of the interaction, without delving into their internal quark-gluon structure.\n\nTherefore, the three assumptions that jointly imply the \"impulse\" approximation are that the interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons, the nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon, and the interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\n\n<<<B>>>"
