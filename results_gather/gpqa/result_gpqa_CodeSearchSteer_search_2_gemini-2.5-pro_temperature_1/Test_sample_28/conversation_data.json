    "To determine which mutation will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to analyze how each change in the DNA sequence affects the resulting protein. The goal is to find the mutation that is most likely to create a non-functional protein.\n\n### Analysis of the Gene and Mutations:\n\nThe intact gene sequence begins with `5’-ATG TTT CTC...-3’`. Translation starts at the `ATG` codon. Let's analyze the effect of each mutation:\n\n*   **Intact Gene Translation:**\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Met)\n    *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (Phe)\n    *   `CTC` -> Leucine (Leu)\n    *   The protein starts with Met-Phe-Leu...\n\n*   **Mutant 1: `5’-ATGTTCTACGCT...-3’`**\n    *   This sequence has two changes compared to the intact gene: `TTT` becomes `TTC`, and `CTC` becomes `TAC`.\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Met)\n    *   `TTC` -> Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a *silent mutation* because both `TTT` and `TTC` code for the same amino acid.\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Tyr). This is a *missense mutation* because it changes the amino acid from Leucine to Tyrosine. A missense mutation alters the protein but may or may not eliminate its function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2: `5’-ATGTTCTAAGCT...-3’`**\n    *   This sequence also has changes: `TTT` becomes `TTC`, and `CTC` becomes `TAA`.\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Met)\n    *   `TTC` -> Phenylalanine (Phe). (Silent mutation)\n    *   `TAA` -> **STOP**. This is a *nonsense mutation* because it introduces a premature stop codon. This type of mutation leads to the production of a shortened, incomplete, and likely non-functional protein. Terminating the protein after only two amino acids makes it almost certain that the enzyme will lose its function.\n\n*   **Mutant 3: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTT...-3’`**\n    *   This sequence has multiple changes: `CTC` becomes `TAC`, and `ACT` becomes `GTC`, among others.\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Met)\n    *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (Phe)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Tyr) (Missense mutation: Leu -> Tyr)\n    *   `GCT` -> Alanine (Ala)\n    *   `GGT` -> Glycine (Gly)\n    *   `GTC` -> Valine (Val) (Missense mutation: Thr -> Val)\n    *   This mutant has multiple missense mutations, which change several amino acids. While this could alter or reduce the protein's function, it is less certain to eliminate it completely compared to a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCT...-3’`**\n    *   This sequence has a missense mutation (`CTC` -> `TAC`) and a deletion of the three bases `GGT`.\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Met)\n    *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (Phe)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Tyr) (Missense mutation: Leu -> Tyr)\n    *   The `GGT` codon, which codes for Glycine, is deleted.\n    *   Because exactly three nucleotides are removed, the reading frame is preserved. This is called an *in-frame deletion*. The resulting protein will be missing one amino acid (Glycine) and have one substitution (Leu -> Tyr). While this can affect protein function, it is not as severe as a frameshift or nonsense mutation.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nComparing the four mutants, Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the protein-coding sequence. Nonsense mutations are one of the most effective ways to cause a complete loss of protein function, as they result in a severely truncated protein. The other mutations result in amino acid substitutions or a small in-frame deletion, which are less likely to completely abolish the protein's activity. Therefore, Mutant 2 is the most probable to eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<C>>>"
