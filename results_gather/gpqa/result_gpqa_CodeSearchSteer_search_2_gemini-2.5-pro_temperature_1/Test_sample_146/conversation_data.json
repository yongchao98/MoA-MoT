    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the velocity of particle A.\n\n1.  **Identify the physical principles:** The process is governed by the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n2.  **Define the initial and final states:**\n    *   **Initial State:** We have a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The antiproton is described as \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible. This allows us to consider the annihilation as occurring essentially \"at rest.\" In the center-of-mass frame of the system, the total initial momentum is zero. The total initial energy ($E_i$) is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and antiproton.\n    *   **Final State:** The annihilation produces four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. Let's assume $A^+$ and $A^-$ are antiparticles of each other with the same rest mass, $m_A$.\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial momentum is zero, the total momentum of the four final particles must also be zero. This means they will fly off in directions such that their vector momenta cancel out.\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   The total initial energy is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and antiproton. The mass of an antiproton is the same as the mass of a proton ($m_p$). Therefore, $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 m_p c^2$.\n    *   The total final energy ($E_f$) is the sum of the total energies of the four resulting particles. Since momentum is conserved, the energy will be distributed equally among the four identical particles. The total energy of a single particle A is given by the relativistic formula $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$. So, the total final energy is $E_f = 4 E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n    *   Equating the initial and final energies:\n        $E_i = E_f$\n        $2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n5.  **Solve for the velocity:**\n    *   First, we can simplify the energy conservation equation:\n        $m_p c^2 = 2 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n    *   Now, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n    *   We are given $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n    *   The rest energy of a proton, $m_p c^2$, is approximately 938.3 MeV.\n    *   Substitute these values into the equation for $\\gamma$:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{938.3 \\, \\text{MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\, \\text{MeV}} = \\frac{938.3}{600} \\approx 1.564$\n    *   Now, use the definition of the Lorentz factor to solve for the velocity ($v$). Let $\\beta = v/c$:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n        $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n        $1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   Substitute the calculated value of $\\gamma$:\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.564)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.446}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4088}$\n        $\\beta = \\sqrt{0.5912} \\approx 0.7689$\n    *   Therefore, the velocity of particle A is $v = \\beta c \\approx 0.77c$.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
