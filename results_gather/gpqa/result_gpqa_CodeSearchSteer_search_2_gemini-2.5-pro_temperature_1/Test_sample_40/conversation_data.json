    "The user is asking for the speed of light in a moving medium relative to a stationary observer. This is a direct application of the relativistic velocity addition formula.\n\n1.  **Frame of the glass (S'):** In this frame, the glass is at rest. The speed of light is `u' = c/n`. Since `c=1`, `u' = 1/n`.\n2.  **Frame of the laboratory (S):** In this frame, the observer is at rest. The glass is moving with velocity `v` in the same direction as the light beam.\n3.  **Relativistic Velocity Addition:** The formula to find the velocity `u` in the laboratory frame (S) is given by:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'v / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitution:** Substitute the known values (`u' = 1/n`, `v`, and `c = 1`) into the formula:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n) * v / 1^2)`\n\n5.  **Simplification:**\n    *   `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n    *   To clear the fractions in the numerator and denominator, multiply both by `n`:\n    *   `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    *   `u = (1 + nv) / (n + v)`\n\n6.  **Comparison with Options:**\n    *   A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n    *   B) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n    *   C) 1\n    *   D) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n\nThe calculated speed `u` matches option D. This result is a known consequence of special relativity and is related to the Fizeau experiment, which measured the speed of light in moving water.\n\nFinal check of the steps and logic confirms the result. The application of the relativistic velocity addition formula is the correct approach for this problem. The speed of light in a medium is relative to the medium itself (`c/n`), and when the medium is moving, the observer in the laboratory must use velocity addition to find the observed speed.\n\nThe final derived expression is `(1+n*v)/(n+v)`.\n\nFinal Answer is D.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Let's define the reference frames:\n\n*   **The laboratory frame (S):** This is the observer's frame of reference, which is considered stationary.\n*   **The glass's rest frame (S'):** This is the frame of reference moving along with the glass.\n\nNow, let's identify the velocities:\n\n*   The velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the laboratory (frame S) is **v**.\n*   The speed of the light beam within the glass, as measured in the glass's rest frame (S'), is **u' = c/n**. Since the problem states to take the speed of light in a vacuum `c=1`, this becomes **u' = 1/n**.\n*   We want to find the speed of the light beam relative to the observer in the laboratory (frame S), which we will call **u**.\n\nThe relativistic velocity addition formula for velocities in the same direction is:\n\nu = (u' + v) / (1 + u'v / c²)\n\nNow, we substitute the values into the formula, using c=1:\n\nu = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n) * v / 1²)\n\nLet's simplify this expression:\n\n1.  First, simplify the denominator:\n    u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)\n\n2.  To eliminate the fractions within the main fraction, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by **n**:\n    u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)\n\n3.  Distribute the **n** in both the numerator and the denominator:\n    u = (n * (1/n) + n * v) / (n * 1 + n * (v/n))\n    u = (1 + nv) / (n + v)\n\nThis result corresponds to option D. This effect, where the speed of light in a moving medium is not a simple sum of the speeds, was famously observed in the Fizeau experiment and is a direct consequence of Einstein's theory of special relativity.\n\n<<<D>>>"
