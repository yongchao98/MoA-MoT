    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the total number of atoms in salts A and B.\n\n**1. Analysis of Gaseous Products**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water. The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water (H₂O) produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂). The fact that its weight did not change indicates that no CO₂ was produced during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper oxide (CuO). The weight increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Since oxygen gas is diatomic (O₂), the moles of O₂ gas are 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After the removal of water and oxygen, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n    *   Given the starting materials are salts, this inert gas is most likely nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nFrom the products, we can calculate the total moles of each element present in the original 7.20 g mixture:\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.2 mol = 0.4 mol H\n*   **Oxygen (O):** (moles of H₂O) + 2 × (moles of O₂) = 0.2 mol + 2 × 0.025 mol = 0.25 mol O\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.1 mol = 0.2 mol N\n\nThe total mass of the products is (3.60 g H₂O) + (0.80 g O₂) + (0.1 mol × 28.02 g/mol N₂) = 7.20 g, which matches the initial mass of the salts.\n\n**3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states that the initial substance is an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B, and that only gases are formed upon heating. The absence of a solid residue suggests the salts do not contain metal cations. The most plausible cation is the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺). The anions must be composed of nitrogen and oxygen.\n\nLet's look at the molar ratio of the elements in the mixture: N : H : O = 0.2 : 0.4 : 0.25. To get a simple integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.05, which is half the moles of N₂), which gives N₄H₈O₅.\n\nSince we have an equimolar (1:1) mixture of two salts, A and B, the combined formula (A + B) must be N₄H₈O₅. The presence of 8 hydrogen atoms suggests two ammonium (NH₄⁺) cations in total, one for each salt. The remaining atoms, N₂O₅, must form the two anions. The most common nitrogen-oxygen anions are nitrite (NO₂⁻) and nitrate (NO₃⁻).\n*   Anion 1: NO₂⁻\n*   Anion 2: NO₃⁻\n\nCombining these with the ammonium cation gives the two salts:\n*   **Salt A:** Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)\n*   **Salt B:** Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)\n\nLet's check the combined formula: NH₄NO₂ + NH₄NO₃ = N₂H₄O₂ + N₂H₄O₃ = N₄H₈O₅. This matches our derived composition. The decomposition of ammonium nitrite produces nitrogen and water (NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O). The decomposition of ammonium nitrate at around 200°C can produce nitrous oxide and water (NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O) or, at slightly higher temperatures, nitrogen, oxygen, and water (2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O). Both decomposition pathways for ammonium nitrate are consistent with the experimental data, as any N₂O produced would also react with the hot copper to yield N₂ and CuO.\n\n**4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each identified salt.\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):** 1 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 1 Nitrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):** 1 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 1 Nitrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = 8 (in Salt A) + 9 (in Salt B) = 17 atoms.\n\n<<<A>>>"
