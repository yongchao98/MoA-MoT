  "question": "The reaction of an electron pair donor, nucleophile (Nu) with an electron pair acceptor is called nucleophilic substitution reaction. An sp3-hybridized electrophile needs to have a leaving group to proceed with the reaction. Substitution reactions have the following two types. One is SN1 and the other is the SN2 reaction. In contrast to the substitution reaction, the elimination reaction involves the removal of a pair or groups of atoms from a molecule.

    "In an aqueous solution, which is a polar protic solvent, several factors influence the reactivity of nucleophiles. These include charge, basicity, steric hindrance, resonance, and polarizability.\n\n1.  **Ethanethiolate (5)**: This is a thiolate anion (RS⁻). Sulfur is in the same group as oxygen but is larger and more polarizable. In protic solvents like water, nucleophilicity increases down a periodic group. The larger electron cloud of sulfur is less tightly held and less affected by the hydrogen-bonding solvent cage compared to oxygen nucleophiles. Therefore, ethanethiolate is the most reactive nucleophile in this group.\n\n2.  **Hydroxide (2)**: This is a strong, negatively charged oxygen nucleophile. It is small and a strong base.\n\n3.  **4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1)**: This is an alkoxide ion (RO⁻). Alkoxides are typically stronger bases than hydroxide due to the electron-donating nature of the alkyl group, which increases electron density on the oxygen atom. This would suggest higher nucleophilicity. However, the 4-methylcyclohexyl group is sterically bulky, which can hinder its ability to attack an electrophile. In comparison to the small hydroxide ion, the steric hindrance of the bulky alkoxide makes it less reactive. Thus, hydroxide is a better nucleophile in this context.\n\n4.  **Propionate (3)**: This is a carboxylate anion (RCOO⁻). The negative charge on the propionate ion is delocalized across two oxygen atoms due to resonance. This resonance stabilization significantly reduces the electron density on any single oxygen atom, making it a much weaker nucleophile than hydroxide or alkoxides, where the charge is localized on a single oxygen.\n\n5.  **Methanol (4)**: This is a neutral molecule. Negatively charged nucleophiles are always more reactive than their neutral counterparts. Therefore, methanol is the poorest nucleophile in this list.\n\nBased on this analysis, the order from most reactive to poorest reactive is: Ethanethiolate > Hydroxide > 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate > Propionate > Methanol.\n\nThis corresponds to the sequence 5, 2, 1, 3, and 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
