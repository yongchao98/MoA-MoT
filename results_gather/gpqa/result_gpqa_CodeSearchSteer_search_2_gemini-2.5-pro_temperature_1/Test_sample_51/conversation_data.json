    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe core of the problem is to find the factor by which the ratio of atomic populations in two different energy levels changes when the star's effective temperature drops. The question asks for the ratio of this population ratio without spots to the population ratio with spots.\n\n**2. Identify the Relevant Physics**\n\nSince the stellar photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the population of atoms in different energy levels is described by the **Boltzmann equation**:\n\nN₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\nWhere:\n*   N₁ and N₂ are the number of atoms in the lower energy level (level 1) and higher energy level (level 2), respectively.\n*   g₁ and g₂ are the statistical weights of the levels (which we can assume are constant).\n*   ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels (E₂ - E₁).\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K).\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n**3. Define the Ratio and Interpret the Problem's Clue**\n\nThe problem states that \"the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2) ... decreases when the star has spots\". Spots cause the effective temperature to decrease from T_nospots = 6000 K to T_spots = 5500 K.\n\nLet's analyze the two possible definitions for the ratio:\n\n*   **If the ratio is R = N₁/N₂ (lower/higher):** The equation would be R = (g₁/g₂) * exp(ΔE / (kT)). As temperature T decreases, 1/T increases, and the exponential term *increases*. This would mean the ratio *increases* when the star cools, which contradicts the problem statement.\n*   **If the ratio is R = N₂/N₁ (higher/lower):** The equation is R = (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (kT)). As temperature T decreases, 1/T increases, the term -ΔE/(kT) becomes less negative (it increases toward zero if we think of it on a number line, but since it's a negative exponent, the value of exp() decreases). Thus, the ratio R *decreases* as the star cools.\n\nThis second definition matches the observation described in the problem. Therefore, the ratio in question is **R = N₂ / N₁**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE)**\n\nThe energy difference between the levels corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given wavelength (λ = 1448 Å).\n\nΔE = h * c / λ\n\nA convenient formula for this calculation is:\nΔE (in eV) = 12398 / λ (in Å)\nΔE = 12398 / 1448 ≈ 8.562 eV\n\n**5. Set up the Factor Calculation**\n\nThe question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes \"when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots\". This means we need to calculate the ratio of the ratios:\n\nFactor = R_nospots / R_spots\n\nLet's write out the expressions for the ratios at the two temperatures:\n*   R_nospots (at T₁ = 6000 K) = (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))\n*   R_spots (at T₂ = 5500 K) = (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\nNow, we can find the factor:\nFactor = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂)) ]\nFactor = exp[ (-ΔE / k) * (1/T₁ - 1/T₂) ]\nFactor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) ]\n\n**6. Perform the Final Calculation**\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the constant term ΔE / k:\nΔE / k = 8.562 eV / (8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K) ≈ 99360 K\n\nNow, substitute this and the temperatures into the factor equation:\nFactor = exp[ 99360 * (1/5500 - 1/6000) ]\nFactor = exp[ 99360 * ( (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) ) ]\nFactor = exp[ 99360 * (500 / 33,000,000) ]\nFactor = exp[ 99360 / 66000 ]\nFactor = exp(1.5054)\nFactor ≈ 4.506\n\nThis value is approximately 4.5.\n\nThe extraneous information about the star's radius, mass, and the percentage of spot coverage is used to set up a plausible astrophysical scenario where the effective temperature changes, but it is not needed for the final calculation, which relies on the two given effective temperatures.\n\n<<<A>>>"
