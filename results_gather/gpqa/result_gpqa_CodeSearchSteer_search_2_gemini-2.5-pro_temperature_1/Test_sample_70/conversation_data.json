    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Understand the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital distance.**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star. This temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's distance (a) from the star. The relationship can be expressed as:\n\n    T_eq ∝ (1/a)^(1/2)\n\n    This means that as a planet's distance from its star increases, its equilibrium temperature decreases.\n\n2.  **Relate orbital distance to orbital period using Kepler's Third Law.**\n    Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a), which is the average distance from the star. This law is expressed as:\n\n    P² ∝ a³\n\n    From this, we can determine the relationship between the semi-major axis and the period:\n\n    a ∝ P^(2/3)\n\n3.  **Combine the relationships to find the link between temperature and period.**\n    By substituting the relationship from Kepler's Third Law into the temperature equation, we can find how the equilibrium temperature depends on the orbital period:\n\n    T_eq ∝ (1 / P^(2/3))^(1/2)\n    T_eq ∝ 1 / P^(1/3) or T_eq ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n    This shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n4.  **Calculate the temperature ratio using the given period ratios.**\n    We need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 to that of Planet_2 (T_eq4 / T_eq2). Using the relationship derived above:\n\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P4 / P2)^(-1/3) = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)\n\n    The problem states that the orbital periods of the planets are in a ratio of 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5. Therefore, we can set the period of Planet_2 (P2) as 2 and the period of Planet_4 (P4) as 3.5.\n\n    P2 / P4 = 2 / 3.5 = 4 / 7\n\n    Now, substitute this value back into the temperature ratio equation:\n\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (4 / 7)^(1/3)\n\n5.  **Compute the final value.**\n    Calculating the cube root of (4/7):\n\n    4 / 7 ≈ 0.5714\n    (0.5714)^(1/3) ≈ 0.8298\n\n    Rounding this to two decimal places gives approximately 0.83. This corresponds to option D.\n\nThe information about the TTV discovery method and the planets being in orbital resonance provides context for why their periods have such a simple ratio but is not directly needed for the calculation. The fact that they have the same albedo is crucial as it allows the albedo term to cancel out when comparing the temperatures.\n\n<<<D>>>"
