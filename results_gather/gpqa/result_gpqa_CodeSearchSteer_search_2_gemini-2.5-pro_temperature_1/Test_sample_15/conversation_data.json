    "A compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral, meaning it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This usually occurs when a molecule contains a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) and does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion that would make it a meso compound.\n\nHere is an analysis of each compound:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** This molecule has a carbon-carbon double bond. The plane of the double bond acts as a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione:** The name itself specifies a single, complex stereoisomer with designated chiral centers (3aR, 7aS). Such a complex, specifically defined enantiomer is not superimposable on its mirror image and lacks internal symmetry. Thus, it is chiral and optically active.\n\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This molecule has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, due to the (2R,3S) configuration, it possesses an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral and optically inactive.\n\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid:** This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The (2R,3R) configuration means it is not superimposable on its mirror image, (2S,3S), and it lacks a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is a chiral molecule and will exhibit optical activity.\n\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:** The name indicates the 'R' configuration at carbon 1, which is a chiral center. Carbon 1 is bonded to a hydroxyl group, a hydrogen atom, and two different carbon pathways within the ring (-CH=CH- and -CH2-CH2-). As a specific enantiomer is named, it is optically active.\n\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol:** The 's' notation is related to the 'cis' configuration, meaning the three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This molecule has multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane can pass through one hydroxyl group and its carbon, bisecting the opposite C-C bond. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:** The structure is Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2. There are no chiral centers in this molecule. Carbon 3 is bonded to a hydrogen, two identical methyl groups, and the rest of the carbon chain. Because it has two identical substituents, it is not a chiral center. The molecule is achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\nIn summary, the three compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nTherefore, a total of 3 compounds will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<C>>>"
