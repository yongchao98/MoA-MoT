    "To determine which theory does not require regularization at high energies, we must examine the fundamental structure of each option. Regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to handle infinities that arise in calculations, particularly from loop diagrams which correspond to high-energy (or short-distance) phenomena.\n\n*   **A) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** This is the quantum field theory of the strong nuclear force. Like other quantum field theories, its calculations for particle interactions result in infinities that must be managed through regularization and renormalization. Lattice QCD, for example, uses a discretized space-time lattice as a form of regularization.\n\n*   **B) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** This is the quantum field theory of electromagnetism. It was one of the first theories where the problem of infinities in calculations became apparent. The successful development of regularization and renormalization techniques was crucial for QED to make extremely precise predictions, such as the Lamb shift.\n\n*   **D) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory, while not a quantum field theory, has its own high-energy problem. The concept of a point-like electron leads to an infinite self-energy. This issue requires a form of regularization, for instance, by assuming the particle is not a true point but has a small, finite size.\n\n*   **C) Superstring Theory:** A primary motivation for superstring theory is to resolve the deep incompatibilities between general relativity and quantum mechanics, particularly the problem of non-renormalizable infinities in a quantum theory of gravity. Superstring theory postulates that fundamental particles are not point-like but are instead one-dimensional \"strings.\" This extended nature is believed to smooth out the interactions at very short distances, thus avoiding the ultraviolet (high-energy) divergences that plague standard quantum field theories. As a result, superstring theory is thought to be UV-finite, meaning it does not require high-energy regularization.\n\nBased on this, Superstring Theory is the framework that is specifically proposed to be finite at high energies without the need for regularization.\n\n<<<C>>>"
