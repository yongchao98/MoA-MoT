    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the chemical riddle to determine the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K. The melting point of water (H₂O) at normal pressure is 273.15 K (0 °C), while the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C). This strongly suggests that **B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The gas W released has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's examine potential candidates:\n    *   Hydrogen deuteride (HD): 2 protons, 1 neutron.\n    *   Deuterium gas (D₂): A deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    This perfectly matches the description, so **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X and Liquid Y:** Substance X contains a heavier isotope, which we've identified as deuterium (D). It is a reagent used in organic chemistry, with a very close analog. This points to common deuterated reducing agents like Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄) or Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄). Their analogs are LiAlH₄ and NaBH₄. For substance X to react and release deuterium gas (D₂), it must react with a deuterium source. The violent reaction described points to **Liquid Y being heavy water (D₂O)**. The reaction would be:\n    `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4 D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4 D₂ (W)`\n\n4.  **Identify Precipitate G:** The reaction produces a precipitate G, which upon heating, releases B (D₂O). In the reaction above, the products are lithium deuteroxide (LiOD) and aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃). Aluminum hydroxide is known to be a precipitate. When heated, aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)₃) decomposes to aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) and water (H₂O). By analogy, aluminum deuteroxide, **Al(OD)₃**, would be the precipitate **G**, which decomposes upon heating to release heavy water, **D₂O (B)**.\n\n5.  **Confirm the Identity of Substance X:** The riddle states that the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 oxygen atoms.\n    *   **Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄)** is a strong reducing agent that reduces both the ketone and the carboxylic acid groups of a keto acid (R-CO-COOH) to a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH), which contains two oxygen atoms. Therefore, LiAlD₄ would behave similarly.\n    *   **Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄)** is a milder reducing agent and typically reduces ketones but not carboxylic acids. The product would be a hydroxy acid (R-CH(OH)-COOH), which contains three oxygen atoms.\n    Therefore, **Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:** The final step is to calculate the sum of the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in LiAlD₄.\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen. There are 4 atoms of its heavier isotope, Deuterium. The mass of one deuterium atom is approximately 2 amu.\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum. There is 1 atom of Aluminum. The mass of an aluminum atom is approximately 27 amu.\n    *   **Mass of the lightest element's atoms:** 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   **Mass of the heaviest element's atoms:** 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n    *   **Cumulative Atomic Mass:** 8 + 27 = 35 amu.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<C>>>"
