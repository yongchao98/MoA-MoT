    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1. Define the initial and final states\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   An atomic nucleus of mass `M` is at rest.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Initial momentum `P_initial = 0`.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   Two fragments with rest-masses `m₁` and `m₂`.\n    *   The more massive fragment is `m₁`, so `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n    *   The sum of their rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments\n\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  `m₁ = 2m₂`\n2.  `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n`3m₂ = 0.99M`\n`m₂ = 0.33M`\n\nNow find `m₁`:\n`m₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`\n\nNext, we calculate their rest-mass energies in GeV:\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1 (`m₁c²`): `0.66 * (Mc²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2 (`m₂c²`): `0.33 * (Mc²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value)\n\nBy the principle of conservation of energy, the initial rest-mass energy is converted into the rest-mass energy of the fragments plus their kinetic energies (`T₁` and `T₂`).\n\n`Mc² = (m₁c² + T₁) + (m₂c² + T₂)`\n`Mc² = (m₁c² + m₂c²) + (T₁ + T₂)`\n\nThe total kinetic energy released (`Q`) is:\n`Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nSo, the sum of the kinetic energies of the two fragments is `T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 4. Calculate T₁ using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation\n\nThe initial nucleus was at rest, so by conservation of momentum, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of their momentum be `p`.\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T` is related to momentum `p` by `T = p² / (2m)`.\n\n*   `T₁_classical = p² / (2m₁)`\n*   `T₂_classical = p² / (2m₂)`\n\nTaking the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n`T₁_classical / T₂_classical = (p² / (2m₁)) / (p² / (2m₂)) = m₂ / m₁`\n\nSince `m₁ = 2m₂`, the ratio `m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\n`T₁_classical / T₂_classical = 1/2`  => `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`\n\nNow use the total kinetic energy:\n`T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T₁_classical + 2 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T₁_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n### 5. Calculate the correct (relativistic) T₁\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the relationship between total energy (`E`), momentum (`p`), and rest-mass (`m`) is `E² = (pc)² + (m c²)²`. Since total energy `E = T + mc²`, we can write:\n\n`(T + mc²)² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`\n`T² + 2T(mc²) + (mc²)² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`\n`(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`\n\nSince the momenta are equal (`p₁ = p₂ = p`), we have:\n`(pc)² = T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`\n\nWe know:\n*   `m₁c² = 198 GeV`\n*   `m₂c² = 99 GeV`\n*   `T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁`\n\nSubstitute these values into the equation:\n`T₁² + 2 * T₁ * (198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2 * (3 - T₁) * (99)`\n`T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n`T₁² + 396T₁ = T₁² - 204T₁ + 603`\n\nCancel the `T₁²` term from both sides:\n`396T₁ = -204T₁ + 603`\n`396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n`600T₁ = 603`\n`T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\nSo, the correct relativistic kinetic energy is `T₁_correct = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### 6. Find the difference\n\nThe difference between the correct value and the classical approximation is:\n`Difference = T₁_correct - T₁_classical`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nThe question asks for the answer in MeV. Since `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThe difference between the correct T1 value and the T1 value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>"
