    "To determine the probability of obtaining 0 for the measurement of observable P and then -1 for the observable Q, we must follow the principles of quantum mechanics regarding sequential measurements.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1.  **Normalize the Initial State:**\n    First, the initial state vector of the system, `|ψ⟩`, given as `(-1, 2, 1)`, must be normalized.\n    The squared norm is: `||ψ||² = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`.\n    The normalized state vector, `|ψ_norm⟩`, is:\n    `|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]`\n\n2.  **First Measurement: Probability of obtaining 0 for P:**\n    The probability of measuring an eigenvalue is given by the square of the absolute value of the inner product of the corresponding normalized eigenvector and the normalized state vector of the system.\n    *   **Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P:** The eigenvalues `λ` are found by solving `det(P - λI) = 0`.\n        `det([[ -λ, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, -λ, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, -λ]]) = -λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = -λ³ + λ = 0`\n        This gives the eigenvalues `λ = 0, 1, -1`.\n    *   **Find the normalized eigenvector for the eigenvalue 0:** We need to solve `P|p_0⟩ = 0|p_0⟩`.\n        `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [x, y, z]ᵀ = [0, 0, 0]ᵀ`\n        This yields `y = 0` and `x = -z`. An unnormalized eigenvector is `[-1, 0, 1]ᵀ`.\n        Normalizing this eigenvector: `||p_0||² = (-1)² + 0² + 1² = 2`. The normalized eigenvector `|p_0_norm⟩` is `(1/√2) * [-1, 0, 1]ᵀ`.\n    *   **Calculate the probability:**\n        `Prob(P=0) = |⟨p_0_norm|ψ_norm⟩|²`\n        `⟨p_0_norm|ψ_norm⟩ = ((1/√2) * [-1, 0, 1]) . ((1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1])`\n        `= (1/√12) * ((-1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (1)(1)) = 2/√12 = 1/√3`\n        `Prob(P=0) = (1/√3)² = 1/3`\n\n3.  **State Collapse after Measuring P=0:**\n    After measuring the value 0 for P, the system's state collapses to the corresponding normalized eigenvector. The new state of the system, `|ψ'⟩`, is:\n    `|ψ'⟩ = |p_0_norm⟩ = (1/√2) * [-1, 0, 1]ᵀ`\n\n4.  **Second Measurement: Probability of obtaining -1 for Q:**\n    Now we measure the observable Q on the new state `|ψ'⟩`.\n    *   **Find the eigenvalues and eigenvector of Q for eigenvalue -1:** The operator Q is a diagonal matrix, so its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements: `1, 0, -1`. The corresponding normalized eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. For the eigenvalue -1, the normalized eigenvector `|q_-1⟩` is `[0, 0, 1]ᵀ`.\n    *   **Calculate the probability:** The probability of measuring -1 for Q in the state `|ψ'⟩` is:\n        `Prob(Q=-1 after P=0) = |⟨q_-1|ψ'⟩|²`\n        `⟨q_-1|ψ'⟩ = [0, 0, 1] . ((1/√2) * [-1, 0, 1])`\n        `= (1/√2) * ((0)(-1) + (0)(0) + (1)(1)) = 1/√2`\n        `Prob(Q=-1 after P=0) = (1/√2)² = 1/2`\n\n5.  **Total Probability for the Sequence:**\n    The probability of a sequence of measurements is the product of the individual probabilities for each step.\n    `Prob(P=0 and then Q=-1) = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 after P=0)`\n    `= (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`\n\nThus, the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements is 1/6.\n\n<<<B>>>"
