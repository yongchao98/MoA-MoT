    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at both points in the titration.\n\n### 1. Initial Dilution of Acetic Acid\n\nFirst, we calculate the new concentration of acetic acid after it has been diluted with water.\n*   **Initial moles of acetic acid (HA):**\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.02000 L = 0.001 mol\n*   **New total volume:**\n    *   Volume = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³ = 0.04000 L\n*   **New concentration of acetic acid:**\n    *   Molarity = Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.04000 L = 0.025 M\n\n### 2. pH at 25% Titration\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). This creates a buffer solution.\n\n*   **pKa calculation:** The acid dissociation constant (Ka) is 1.85x10⁻⁵.\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85x10⁻⁵) = 4.73\n*   **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:** This equation is used to find the pH of a buffer solution.\n    *   pH = pKa + log ( [A⁻] / [HA] )\n    *   Where [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate) and [HA] is the concentration of the acid (acetic acid).\n*   **Ratio of Base to Acid:** At 25% titration, 25% of the acid is now the conjugate base, and 75% remains as the acid.\n    *   Ratio = [A⁻] / [HA] = 25% / 75% = 1/3\n*   **pH Calculation:**\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - 0.48 = 4.25\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the pH is **4.26**.\n\n### 3. pH at the Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by the NaOH, forming sodium acetate. The acetate ion then reacts with water (hydrolysis) to produce hydroxide ions (OH⁻), making the solution basic.\n\n*   **Volume of NaOH added:** To reach the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH must equal the initial moles of acetic acid.\n    *   Volume = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   **Total volume at equivalence:**\n    *   Volume = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.05000 L\n*   **Concentration of acetate ([A⁻]):** The moles of acetate formed are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid.\n    *   [A⁻] = 0.001 mol / 0.05000 L = 0.02 M\n*   **Hydrolysis of Acetate:** The acetate ion acts as a base.\n    *   CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n*   **Kb Calculation:** We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0x10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85x10⁻⁵) = 5.41x10⁻¹⁰\n*   **[OH⁻] Calculation:** We can find the hydroxide concentration from the Kb expression.\n    *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻] ≈ [OH⁻]² / [A⁻]\n    *   [OH⁻]² = Kb × [A⁻] = (5.41x10⁻¹⁰) × (0.02 M) = 1.082x10⁻¹¹\n    *   [OH⁻] = √(1.082x10⁻¹¹) = 3.29x10⁻⁶ M\n*   **pOH and pH Calculation:**\n    *   pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29x10⁻⁶) = 5.48\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\nThe pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are a pH of **4.26** at 25% titration and **8.52** at the equivalence point.\n\n<<<A>>>"
