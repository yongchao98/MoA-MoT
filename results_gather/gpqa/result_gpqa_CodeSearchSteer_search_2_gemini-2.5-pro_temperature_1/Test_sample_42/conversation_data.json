    "To determine the correct IUPAC name, we must follow a systematic approach based on the established rules of chemical nomenclature.\n\n### Analysis of the Molecular Structure\n\n1.  **Identify the Parent Compound**: The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) on a benzene ring makes the parent compound benzoic acid. According to IUPAC rules, the carboxylic acid group is assigned the highest priority among the given functional groups and its carbon is designated as position 1 on the benzene ring.\n\n2.  **Determine Substituent Positions**:\n    *   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH)** is at position 1.\n    *   **Methoxy group (-OCH₃)** is para to the carboxylic acid, placing it at position 4.\n    *   **Carbaldehyde (-CHO)** and a **cyano group (-CN)** are meta to the carboxylic acid (positions 3 and 5). They are also meta to each other, which is consistent with one being at position 3 and the other at position 5.\n    *   **Hydroxyl group (-OH)** and a **dimethylamino group (-N(CH₃)₂)** are ortho to the carboxylic acid (positions 2 and 6).\n    *   The problem states that the methoxy group (at C4) and the hydroxyl group are both ortho to the nitrile (cyano group). For this to be true, the cyano group must be at position 5 (making C4 and C6 ortho to it). Consequently, the hydroxyl group must be at position 6.\n    *   This leaves position 2 for the dimethylamino group and position 3 for the carbaldehyde (formyl) group.\n\n3.  **Final Structure Assignment**:\n    *   C1: -COOH (Carboxylic acid)\n    *   C2: -N(CH₃)₂ (Dimethylamino)\n    *   C3: -CHO (Formyl)\n    *   C4: -OCH₃ (Methoxy)\n    *   C5: -CN (Cyano)\n    *   C6: -OH (Hydroxy)\n\n### IUPAC Naming Conventions\n\n1.  **Numbering the Ring**: The principal functional group, carboxylic acid, is at C1. We must number the ring to give the other substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   **Clockwise numbering**: 2-(dimethylamino), 3-(formyl), 4-(methoxy), 5-(cyano), 6-(hydroxy). The locant set is (2, 3, 4, 5, 6).\n    *   **Counter-clockwise numbering**: 2-(hydroxy), 3-(cyano), 4-(methoxy), 5-(formyl), 6-(dimethylamino). The locant set is also (2, 3, 4, 5, 6).\n\n2.  **Applying Alphabetical Order for Numbering**: When two numbering schemes produce the same lowest locant set, the tie is broken by assigning the lower number to the substituent that comes first alphabetically.\n    *   Comparing the substituents at the first point of difference (position 2): \"dimethylamino\" vs. \"hydroxy\".\n    *   Alphabetically, \"d\" in dimethylamino comes before \"h\" in hydroxy. Therefore, the dimethylamino group is assigned C2, and the clockwise numbering is correct.\n\n3.  **Alphabetizing the Substituents**: The substituents must be listed in alphabetical order in the final name. The substituent names are: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, and methoxy.\n    *   **C**yano\n    *   **D**imethylamino\n    *   **F**ormyl\n    *   **H**ydroxy\n    *   **M**ethoxy\n\n4.  **Constructing the Final Name**: Combining the alphabetically ordered substituents with their assigned locants before the parent name \"benzoic acid\" gives:\n    5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing this derived name with the given options:\nA) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - Incorrect alphabetical order.\nB) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - **Correct**.\nC) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - Incorrect numbering and alphabetical order.\nD) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - Incorrect numbering.\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>"
