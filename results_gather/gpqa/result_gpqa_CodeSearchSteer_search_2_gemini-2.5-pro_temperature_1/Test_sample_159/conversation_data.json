    "An N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a' approaches a circular aperture of radius 'a' as N becomes infinitely large. The problem, therefore, reduces to finding the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern for a circular aperture.\n\nIn the far-field region, the diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a bright central disk, called the Airy disk, surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings. The angular positions of the intensity minima (the dark rings) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x).\n\nThe condition for the minima in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture of diameter D is given by `sin(θ) = m * λ / D`, where 'm' is a constant that depends on the order of the minimum. For a circular aperture of radius 'a', the diameter is D = 2a.\n\nUsing the small angle approximation (sin(θ) ≈ θ), the angular positions of the minima are given by:\n`θ = (z_n * λ) / (π * D) = (z_n * λ) / (2 * π * a)`\nwhere `z_n` are the zeros of the first-order Bessel function, J₁(x).\n\nThe first two non-zero roots for J₁(x) are approximately:\n*   z₁ ≈ 3.8317\n*   z₂ ≈ 7.0156\n\nNow, we can calculate the angular positions of the first two minima:\n\n*   **First minimum (θ₁):**\n    `θ₁ ≈ (3.8317 * λ) / (2 * π * a) ≈ 0.6098 * λ / a`\n    This is often approximated as `θ₁ ≈ 1.22 * λ / D = 1.22 * λ / (2a) = 0.610 * λ / a`.\n\n*   **Second minimum (θ₂):**\n    `θ₂ ≈ (7.0156 * λ) / (2 * π * a) ≈ 1.1168 * λ / a`\n    This corresponds to the position given as `2.23 * λ / D = 2.23 * λ / (2a) = 1.115 * λ / a`.\n\nThe question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁.\n\n`Δθ ≈ (1.1168 * λ / a) - (0.6098 * λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.507 * λ / a`\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 0.500 λ / a\nB) 0.506 λ / a\nC) 0.610 λ / a\nD) 1.220 λ / a\n\nThe calculated value of 0.507 λ / a is closest to 0.506 λ / a.\n\n<<<B>>>"
