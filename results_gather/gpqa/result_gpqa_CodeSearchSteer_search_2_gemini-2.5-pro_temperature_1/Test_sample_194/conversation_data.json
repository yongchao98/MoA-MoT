    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Condition for Transits and Occultations:**\n    For a planet to exhibit both a transit (passing in front of the star) and an occultation (passing behind the star), its orbit must be aligned with our line of sight. The geometry for both events is the same. The key parameter describing this alignment is the transit impact parameter, `b`.\n\n2.  **The Impact Parameter:**\n    The impact parameter `b` is the projected distance of the planet's center from the star's center during transit, measured in units of the star's radius (`R_s`). It is defined as:\n    `b = (a * cos(i)) / R_s`\n    where `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n3.  **The Condition for Maximum Period:**\n    A transit occurs if the planet's path intersects the star's disk. The standard condition for a transit is that the center of the planet passes in front of the star, which means `b ≤ 1`. A value of `b = 1` represents a \"grazing\" transit where the center of the planet passes exactly over the star's limb. To find the maximum possible orbital period for the second planet, we need to find the largest possible orbit it can have while still producing a transit. This corresponds to the maximum possible impact parameter, so we set `b_2 = 1`.\n\n4.  **Relating the Two Planets:**\n    The problem states that both planets share the same orbital plane. This means they have the same orbital inclination `i`. The star's radius `R_s` is also the same for both. Therefore, we can establish a relationship between the impact parameters and semi-major axes of the two planets:\n    *   For Planet 1: `b_1 = (a_1 * cos(i)) / R_s`\n    *   For Planet 2: `b_2 = (a_2 * cos(i)) / R_s`\n\n    Dividing the second equation by the first gives:\n    `b_2 / b_1 = a_2 / a_1`\n\n5.  **Using Kepler's Third Law:**\n    Kepler's Third Law relates the orbital period (`P`) of a planet to its semi-major axis (`a`): `P² ∝ a³`. For two planets orbiting the same star, we can write this as a ratio:\n    `(P_2 / P_1)² = (a_2 / a_1)³`\n\n    Solving for the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = (P_2 / P_1)^(2/3)`\n\n6.  **Combining the Equations and Solving for P₂:**\n    Now, substitute the expression for `a₂ / a₁` from Kepler's Law into the equation relating the impact parameters:\n    `b_2 / b_1 = (P_2 / P_1)^(2/3)`\n\n    We want to find the maximum period for Planet 2 (`P₂`), so we rearrange the equation to solve for it:\n    `(P_2 / P_1) = (b_2 / b_1)^(3/2)`\n    `P_2 = P_1 * (b_2 / b_1)^(3/2)`\n\n7.  **Calculation:**\n    We are given the following values:\n    *   `P_1 = 3` days\n    *   `b_1 = 0.2`\n    *   `b_2 = 1` (the maximum value for a transit)\n\n    Plugging these values into the equation:\n    `P_2 = 3 * (1 / 0.2)^(3/2)`\n    `P_2 = 3 * (5)^(3/2)`\n    `P_2 = 3 * (5 * √5)`\n    `P_2 ≈ 3 * (5 * 2.236)`\n    `P_2 ≈ 3 * 11.18`\n    `P_2 ≈ 33.54` days\n\n    The radii of the planets themselves are not needed for this calculation, as the condition `b ≤ 1` only concerns the path of the planet's center relative to the star's disk.\n\nThe maximum orbital period for the second planet is approximately 33.5 days. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
