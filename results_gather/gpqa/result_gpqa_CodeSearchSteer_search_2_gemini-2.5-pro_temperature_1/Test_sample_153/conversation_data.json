    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The presence of a significant peak at m/z = 158 with about one-third the intensity (32%) of the M+ peak is a classic sign of a single chlorine atom. Chlorine has two common isotopes, ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl, in an approximate 3:1 natural abundance, which leads to this characteristic M+ and M+2 peak pattern.\n*   All the proposed molecules (A, B, C, and D) have the chemical formula C₇H₅ClO₂, which corresponds to a molecular weight of approximately 156.5 g/mol, consistent with the MS data.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This very broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This peak falls squarely in the region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Its position is consistent with an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n*   This combination strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid group. Options A (2-chlorobenzoic acid) and B (4-chlorobenzoic acid) contain this functional group. Option C (Phenyl chloroformate) is an ester and would lack the broad O-H peak. Option D (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde) has a hydroxyl group and an aldehyde group, which would show different IR absorptions.\n\n### 3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is almost exclusively due to a carboxylic acid proton. The integration of one proton (1H) confirms this assignment. This further supports options A and B.\n*   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region of the spectrum. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, indicates a symmetrically 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **Option A (2-chlorobenzoic acid):** This ortho-substituted ring would produce a more complex splitting pattern with four distinct aromatic proton signals.\n    *   **Option B (4-chlorobenzoic acid):** This para-substituted ring has a plane of symmetry. This symmetry makes the two protons adjacent to the -COOH group equivalent and the two protons adjacent to the -Cl group equivalent. This leads to the observed pattern of two doublets. NMR data for 4-chlorobenzoic acid confirms two aromatic signals around 7.5-8.0 ppm.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combined spectral data points conclusively to **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n*   **MS** confirms the molecular weight of 156 g/mol and the presence of one chlorine atom.\n*   **IR** confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **¹H NMR** confirms the carboxylic acid proton and, crucially, the *para* substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure for the unidentified compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>"
