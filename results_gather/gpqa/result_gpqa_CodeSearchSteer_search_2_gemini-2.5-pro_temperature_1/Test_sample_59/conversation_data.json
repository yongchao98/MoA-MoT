    "To determine the travel time from the astronaut's perspective, we must use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\nHere is a step-by-step calculation:\n\n**1. Determine the Distance:**\nThe destination is Earth, and the origin is the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The distance between the Milky Way and the LMC is approximately 160,000 to 163,000 light-years. Let's use a value of 160,000 light-years for this calculation.\n\n**2. Calculate Travel Time in Earth's Reference Frame:**\nFirst, we calculate how long the journey would appear to take for an observer on Earth.\n*   **Speed (v):** 0.99999987 * c\n*   **Distance (d):** 160,000 light-years\n*   **Time (t_earth) = Distance / Speed**\n    t_earth = 160,000 light-years / (0.99999987 * c) ≈ 160,000.02 years\n\nFrom Earth's perspective, the journey takes just over 160,000 years.\n\n**3. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\nTime dilation is governed by the Lorentz factor, which depends on the spacecraft's velocity. The formula is:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n*   v/c = 0.99999987\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.99999987²)\n*   γ ≈ 1 / √(0.00000026)\n*   γ ≈ 1961.16\n\n**4. Calculate Time from the Astronaut's Perspective:**\nThe time experienced by the astronaut (the proper time, t_astronaut) is the time measured on Earth divided by the Lorentz factor.\n*   **t_astronaut = t_earth / γ**\n*   t_astronaut ≈ 160,000.02 years / 1961.16\n*   t_astronaut ≈ 81.58 years\n\nThe journey will take approximately 81.6 years from the astronaut's point of view.\n\n**5. Final Check:**\nThe astronaut is 22 years old at the start of the mission. Upon arrival at Earth, the astronaut's age would be:\n*   22 years + 81.6 years = 103.6 years\n\nSince the average lifespan of these aliens is 150 years, the astronaut will survive the journey. The calculated travel time of ~81.6 years corresponds most closely to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
