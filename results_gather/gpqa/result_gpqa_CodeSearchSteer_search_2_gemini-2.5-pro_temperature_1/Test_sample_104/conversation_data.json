    "To determine the equivalent planetary radius, we must first calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the starspots. Then, we can equate this to the transit depth of a hypothetical exoplanet.\n\n### 1. Light Variation from Starspots\n\nThe brightness of the star changes as it rotates, showing its unspotted hemisphere and its spotted hemisphere to an observer.\n\n*   **Maximum Brightness (F_max):** This occurs when the completely unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The flux is proportional to the effective temperature to the fourth power, according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n    *   F_max ∝ T_eff⁴ = 6000⁴ K⁴\n\n*   **Minimum Brightness (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. This hemisphere is 20% covered by cooler spots and 80% by the normal photosphere.\n    *   The spots have a temperature of T_spot = T_eff - 1000 K = 5000 K.\n    *   The flux from this hemisphere is a weighted average of the flux from the spotted and unspotted areas.\n    *   F_min ∝ (0.80 × T_eff⁴) + (0.20 × T_spot⁴) = (0.80 × 6000⁴) + (0.20 × 5000⁴) K⁴\n\nThe amplitude of the light curve variation is the relative change in flux:\n\n**Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max**\n\nAmplitude = (6000⁴ - [0.80 × 6000⁴ + 0.20 × 5000⁴]) / 6000⁴\nAmplitude = (0.20 × 6000⁴ - 0.20 × 5000⁴) / 6000⁴\nAmplitude = 0.20 × [1 - (5000/6000)⁴]\nAmplitude = 0.20 × [1 - (5/6)⁴]\nAmplitude = 0.20 × [1 - 0.48225]\nAmplitude ≈ 0.1035\n\n### 2. Equivalent Exoplanet Transit\n\nThe dimming of a star's light caused by a transiting exoplanet is known as the transit depth. For a simplified case, this depth is the ratio of the planet's cross-sectional area to the star's cross-sectional area.\n\n**Transit Depth = (π × R_pl²) / (π × R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²**\n\nTo produce the same signal amplitude as the starspots, the transit depth must equal the calculated amplitude of 0.1035.\n\n(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.1035\n\nNow, we solve for the relative radius of the planet (R_pl / R_star):\n\nR_pl / R_star = √0.1035\n**R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3217**\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\n<<<D>>>"
