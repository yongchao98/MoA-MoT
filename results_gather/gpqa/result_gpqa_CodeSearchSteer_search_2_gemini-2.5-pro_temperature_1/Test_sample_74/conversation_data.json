  "question": "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

    "The correct option is D because the provided DNA sequence contains a premature stop codon that terminates translation immediately after the HA tag sequence.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided DNA sequence:\n`5' ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGG... 3'`\n\n1.  **Start Codon**: Translation begins at the first `ATG` codon, which codes for the amino acid Methionine (Met).\n2.  **HA Tag Sequence**: The sequence for the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag is `YPYDVPDYA`. The corresponding DNA sequence is `TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCT`. In the provided construct, the sequence `TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCC` correctly codes for the amino acids `YPYDVPDYA`.\n3.  **Translation Termination**: To analyze the sequence, it is read in groups of three nucleotides (codons) starting from the `ATG`.\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Start)\n    *   `TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC` -> `Y P Y D V P D Y A` (This is the HA tag)\n    *   `AAA` -> Lysine\n    *   `TGA` -> **STOP**\n\nThe `TGA` codon is one of the three standard stop codons (along with `TAA` and `UAA`) that signal the ribosome to stop protein synthesis. This stop codon appears immediately after the HA tag and one additional amino acid. The ribosome detaches at this point, preventing the translation of the intended GADD45G protein sequence that follows. This results in the production of a very short, non-functional peptide and explains the failure to detect the overexpressed protein.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n*   **A) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain**: While linkers can be important for protein folding, the primary issue here is that the full-length protein is not being synthesized in the first place.\n*   **B) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse**: This is incorrect on two levels. First, the premature stop codon is `TGA`, not `UAA`. Second, stop codons are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs, in all mammals.\n*   **C) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation**: The analysis shows that the DNA sequence for the HA tag correctly codes for the intended amino acid sequence `YPYDVPDYA`. There is no mutation within the tag itself.\n\n<<<D>>>"
