    "The scribbled note contains several clues, but the most direct indicator of the number of loops in the Feynman diagram is the factor of `1/(4pi)^6`.\n\nIn quantum field theory calculations, particularly in four-dimensional spacetime, each loop in a Feynman diagram introduces an integral over an unconstrained four-momentum. When using common regularization schemes like dimensional regularization, performing this integration typically results in a factor of `1/(4pi)^2` for each loop.\n\nGiven this information, we can establish a relationship between the number of loops, L, and the power of the `4pi` term in the expression:\n\n`(1/(4pi)^2)^L = 1/(4pi)^(2L)`\n\nThe note shows a factor of `1/(4pi)^6`. By comparing the exponents, we can solve for L:\n\n`2L = 6`\n`L = 3`\n\nTherefore, the Feynman diagram contained three loops.\n\nThe other components of the expression provide additional context consistent with a three-loop diagram:\n*   **`alpha^3 * g^2`**: The powers of the coupling constants (`alpha` and `g`) indicate the number of interaction vertices in the diagram, in this case, a total of five.\n*   **`(Q/M)^2`**: This is a ratio between two energy scales, Q and M, which is typical in calculations of physical observables and depends on the specific process and particles involved.\n*   **`sqrt(2) * 8`**: These are numerical factors that arise from the specific details of the calculation, such as symmetry factors or traces over Dirac matrices.\n\nBased on the definitive `1/(4pi)^6` factor, the diagram had three loops.\n\n<<<A>>>"
