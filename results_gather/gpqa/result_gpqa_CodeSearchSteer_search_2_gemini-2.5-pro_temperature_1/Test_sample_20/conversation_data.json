    "### Analysis of Compounds\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\n*   **Tautomerism** is an isomerization reaction that involves the migration of a proton and a shift in the location of a double bond. For keto-enol tautomerism, the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) is typically required.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** This molecule has a six-membered ring with two ketone groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. Therefore, benzoquinone lacks alpha-hydrogens and cannot undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism. Attempting to draw a tautomer would result in a highly unstable structure with cumulated double bonds within the ring.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound possesses three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 each have two hydrogen atoms. These are alpha-hydrogens, situated between two carbonyl groups, making them acidic and readily available for tautomerization. This compound exists in equilibrium with its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). The enol form is exceptionally stable because it is aromatic, containing a planar ring with 6 π-electrons.\n\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\n*   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is a stereocenter, such as a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  a methyl group (-CH₃)\n    2.  a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  a hydrogen atom (-H)\n    4.  an ester group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon has four different substituents, it is a chiral center. Consequently, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exists as a pair of enantiomers (optical isomers).\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. It is a *trans* isomer. The molecule has a plane of symmetry and is therefore achiral. While it exhibits geometric (cis-trans) isomerism, it does not have a chiral center and is not optically active.\n\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Compound **A** (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound **B** (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
