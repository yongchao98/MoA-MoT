    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Model and the Transition\n\nThe problem describes a diatomic molecule using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The energy of a particular state, defined by the vibrational quantum number `v` and the rotational quantum number `J`, is given by:\n\n`E_v,J = ħω(v + 1/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * J(J + 1)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration\n*   `I` is the moment of inertia\n*   `v = 0, 1, 2, ...` are the vibrational quantum numbers\n*   `J = 0, 1, 2, ...` are the rotational quantum numbers\n\nThe molecule is initially in its **fundamental state**, which is the lowest possible energy state. This corresponds to `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\n\nThe molecule absorbs a photon and moves to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\". For a rovibrational transition, the selection rules are Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1. Since the molecule starts at J=0, a transition to J=-1 is not possible. Therefore, the only allowed transition is:\n\n*   **Initial state (v, J):** (0, 0)\n*   **Final state (v', J'):** (1, 1)\n\n### 2. Calculating the Photon's Energy\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon must be equal to the energy difference (ΔE) between the final and initial states.\n\n*   **Initial Energy (E_0,0):**\n    `E_0,0 = ħω(0 + 1/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * 0(0 + 1) = (1/2)ħω`\n\n*   **Final Energy (E_1,1):**\n    `E_1,1 = ħω(1 + 1/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * 1(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I`\n\n*   **Energy Difference (ΔE):**\n    `ΔE = E_1,1 - E_0,0 = [(3/2)ħω + ħ²/I] - [(1/2)ħω] = ħω + ħ²/I`\n\nTo calculate this energy, we need to find the moment of inertia, `I`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Moment of Inertia (I)\n\nThe moment of inertia is given by `I = μR²`, where `μ` is the reduced mass.\n\n*   **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n    `μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)`\n    `μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu`\n\n    Converting amu to kg (1 amu ≈ 1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg):\n    `μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg ≈ 3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg`\n\n*   **Moment of Inertia (I):**\n    `R = 2 angstroms = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m`\n    `I = μR² ≈ (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)²`\n    `I ≈ (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (4 x 10⁻²⁰ m²) ≈ 1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²`\n\n### 4. Final Energy and Momentum Calculation\n\nNow we can calculate the total energy change `ΔE`.\n\n*   **Constants:**\n    *   `ħ ≈ 1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s`\n    *   `ω = 4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s` (given)\n    *   `c ≈ 2.998 x 10⁸ m/s`\n\n*   **Calculate the two energy terms:**\n    *   `ħω = (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) ≈ 4.2183 x 10⁻²⁰ J`\n    *   `ħ²/I = (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 9.209 x 10⁻²³ J`\n\n*   **Total Energy (ΔE):**\n    `ΔE = ħω + ħ²/I ≈ (4.2183 x 10⁻²⁰ J) + (0.009209 x 10⁻²⁰ J) ≈ 4.2275 x 10⁻²⁰ J`\n\nThe momentum of a photon (`p`) is related to its energy by `E = pc`. Therefore, `p = E / c`.\n\n*   **Photon Momentum (p):**\n    `p = ΔE / c ≈ (4.2275 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (2.998 x 10⁸ m/s)`\n    `p ≈ 1.410 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s`\n\nThis value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
