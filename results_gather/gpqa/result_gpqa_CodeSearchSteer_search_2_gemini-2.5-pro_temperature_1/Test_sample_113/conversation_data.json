    "Here is a breakdown of the reactions to determine the appropriate reagents, A and B.\n\n### Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n\nThis reaction is a cyanohydrin formation. The nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms an alkoxide intermediate, which is then protonated to yield the final product, a cyanohydrin.\n\n*   **Step 1:** The cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n*   **Step 2:** An alkoxide intermediate is formed.\n*   **Step 3:** This intermediate needs a proton (H⁺) to form the hydroxyl group (-OH).\n\nReagent **A** must be a source of protons. In a typical laboratory setting, this is achieved through an acidic workup. The notation H₃O⁺ represents an acid in an aqueous solution (like HCl or H₂SO₄) and is the standard way to denote the proton source needed to complete the reaction.\n\n### Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n\nThis reaction involves the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation can be carried out under either strongly acidic or basic conditions, typically with heating.\n\n*   The options for reagent **B** are a strong acid (HCl) or a weak acid (CH₃COOH).\n*   While weak acids can hydrolyze nitriles, the reaction is generally very slow. The standard and most effective method for nitrile hydrolysis is to use a strong acid like hydrochloric acid (HCl) or sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄), or a strong base like sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n\nTherefore, **HCl** is the suitable reagent for B.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Reagent **A** is **H₃O⁺** (acidic workup for protonation).\n*   Reagent **B** is **HCl** (strong acid for nitrile hydrolysis).\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
