    "Here is a breakdown of the three Michael addition reactions:\n\n**Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) → (A)**\n\n1.  **Michael Donor:** Dimethyl malonate. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), removes an acidic α-proton from the carbon between the two ester groups, forming a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n2.  **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n3.  **Reaction:** The malonate enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate. Subsequent protonation yields the final product.\n4.  **Product (A):** The new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of the dimethyl malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate. The resulting structure is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n**Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) → (B)**\n\n1.  **Michael Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nitrogen analogs of enolates and are excellent nucleophiles. This type of reaction is known as the Stork enamine synthesis.\n2.  **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile).\n3.  **Reaction:** The nucleophilic α-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. The resulting iminium ion intermediate is then hydrolyzed with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) back to a ketone.\n4.  **Product (B):** The final product is a 1,5-dicarbonyl compound (or in this case, a keto-nitrile). The keto form is generally more stable than the enol tautomer, so the major product is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n**Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) → 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition where we need to identify the starting Michael donor (C).\n2.  **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one, commonly known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK).\n3.  **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. This product consists of a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring system with a `–CH₂CH₂COCH₃` (3-oxobutyl) group attached at the C2 position.\n4.  **Retrosynthesis:** The `3-oxobutyl` side chain is formed from the Michael acceptor, MVK. Therefore, the Michael donor (reactant C) must be the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` portion. The proton on the carbon between the two carbonyls (C2) is highly acidic and is easily removed by the base (KOH) to form a potent nucleophile that attacks the MVK.\n5.  **Reactant (C):** The Michael donor is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct combination of reactants and products is:\n*   **A:** trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B:** 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C:** cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
