    "The number of revolutions a proton makes in a synchrocyclotron can be determined by calculating the total energy gained and dividing it by the energy gained per revolution.\n\nHere is a step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Identify the given data:**\n    *   Final kinetic energy of the proton, T_final = 950 MeV\n    *   Initial kinetic energy, T_initial ≈ 0 MeV\n    *   Peak accelerating voltage, U₀ = 190 kV = 0.190 MV\n    *   Synchronous phase, Φ₀ = π/4 radians\n\n2.  **Determine the energy gain per revolution:**\n    A synchrocyclotron accelerates particles by applying an alternating voltage across a gap. This typically happens twice per revolution as the particle cycles through the \"dee\" electrodes. The energy gained at each gap crossing depends on the voltage at that instant. For stable acceleration, the particle consistently crosses the gap at a specific \"synchronous phase\" (Φs) relative to the peak voltage. The problem provides an initial phase Φ₀=π/4, which is the synchronous phase (Φs) for this calculation.\n\n    The energy gained per single gap crossing (ΔE) is:\n    ΔE = q * U₀ * cos(Φs)\n    Where 'q' is the charge of the particle. For a proton, q = e (elementary charge).\n    ΔE = e * (190 kV) * cos(π/4)\n    Since 1 eV is the energy gained by an electron (or proton) crossing a 1V potential, we can write:\n    ΔE = 190 * cos(π/4) keV\n    ΔE = 190 * (√2 / 2) keV ≈ 134.35 keV\n\n    Since the proton is accelerated twice per revolution, the energy gain per revolution (ΔT_rev) is:\n    ΔT_rev = 2 * ΔE\n    ΔT_rev = 2 * 190 * cos(π/4) keV\n    ΔT_rev = 380 * (√2 / 2) keV\n    ΔT_rev = 190 * √2 keV ≈ 268.7 keV\n\n3.  **Calculate the total number of revolutions (N):**\n    The total number of revolutions is the total energy gained divided by the energy gained per revolution.\n    N = T_final / ΔT_rev\n    N = (950 MeV) / (190 * √2 keV)\n    First, ensure the units are consistent (convert MeV to keV):\n    950 MeV = 950,000 keV\n    N = 950,000 keV / (190 * √2 keV)\n    N = 5000 / √2\n    N ≈ 5000 / 1.4142\n    N ≈ 3535.5\n\n4.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    The calculated value N ≈ 3535.5 is closest to option D.\n\n    A) 2500\n    B) 5300\n    C) 1864\n    D) 3536\n\nTherefore, the proton makes approximately 3536 revolutions in the synchrocyclotron.\n\n<<<D>>>"
