    "The problem asks to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of a specific vector field, `∇ ⋅ f`, within a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.\n\nThe vector field `f(r)` is defined as having a magnitude of `1/r²` and pointing radially outward. In vector notation, this is:\n\n`f(r) = (1/r²) * r̂`\n\nwhere `r` is the radial distance from the origin and `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n### Analysis of the Problem\n\nA straightforward approach is to first calculate the divergence of the field `f` and then integrate it over the volume of the sphere.\n\n1.  **Calculating the Divergence (∇ ⋅ f):**\n    The formula for divergence in spherical coordinates for a field with only a radial component `f_r` is:\n    `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r²) * ∂(r² * f_r)/∂r`\n\n    In this case, `f_r = 1/r²`. Substituting this into the formula:\n    `∇ ⋅ f = (1/r²) * ∂(r² * (1/r²))/∂r = (1/r²) * ∂(1)/∂r = 0`\n\n    This calculation suggests the divergence is zero. If the divergence were zero everywhere, the volume integral would also be zero. However, this holds true only for `r ≠ 0`. At the origin (`r = 0`), the vector field is undefined, creating a singularity.\n\n2.  **The Singularity at the Origin:**\n    Because the field is singular at the origin, a more careful approach is needed. The divergence at this single point is not zero. In the language of distributions, the divergence of the field `r̂/r²` is `4π` times the three-dimensional Dirac delta function, `4πδ³(r)`. The Dirac delta function is zero everywhere except at the origin, but its integral over any volume containing the origin is 1.\n\n3.  **Applying the Divergence Theorem (Gauss's Theorem):**\n    The Divergence Theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence to the surface integral of the field over the boundary of the volume.\n    `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\n    While the singularity at `r=0` means the theorem cannot be directly applied to the entire sphere, it can be used to find the solution. The value of the volume integral of the divergence is physically interpreted as the total flux coming out of the volume. We can calculate this flux through the surface of the sphere of radius R.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Flux:**\n    The surface integral `∮_S (f ⋅ dS)` is the total flux of the field `f` through the spherical surface `S` of radius `R`.\n    *   On the surface of the sphere, the field is `f(R) = (1/R²) * r̂`.\n    *   The differential surface area element `dS` in spherical coordinates points in the outward radial direction: `dS = R² sin(θ) dθ dφ * r̂`.\n    *   The dot product `f ⋅ dS` is:\n        `f ⋅ dS = ((1/R²) * r̂) ⋅ (R² sin(θ) dθ dφ * r̂) = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n    *   Now, we integrate over the entire surface of the sphere:\n        `∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_0^{2π} ∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n        `∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -(-1) - (-1) = 2`\n        `∫_0^{2π} 2 dφ = 2 * [φ]_0^{2π} = 4π`\n\nThe result of the surface integral is `4π`. This value represents the total flux emanating from the source at the origin. This flux is equal to the volume integral of the divergence, even with the singularity.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe volume integral of the divergence of the given vector field over the sphere of radius R is `4π`. The result is independent of the radius R, as long as the sphere encloses the origin.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 4 π\nC) 4/3 π R\nD) 1\n\nThe most appropriate answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
