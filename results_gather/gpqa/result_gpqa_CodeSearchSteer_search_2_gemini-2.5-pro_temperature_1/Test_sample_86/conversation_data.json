    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct ¹H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n### 1. Deducing the Molecular Structure\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" which is a benzene ring with two substituents. The ring itself accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n*   **Total Carbons:** The molecule contains 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the benzene ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contribute the remaining 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Functional Groups:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X). This means a halogen atom is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n\nBased on these facts, the two substituents on the benzene ring are:\n1.  A halogen atom (-X).\n2.  A substituent with 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. The only common chemical group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n\nTherefore, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**, with the general formula **X-C₆H₄-COCH₃**. This structure has 8 carbons, a carbonyl group, and a halogen attached to the aromatic ring, fitting all the given criteria.\n\n### 2. Analyzing the Substitution Pattern and Expected ¹H NMR\n\nThe two substituents (-X and -COCH₃) can be arranged in ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4) positions on the benzene ring. The ¹H NMR spectrum is highly dependent on this arrangement.\n\n*   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** These protons appear in the downfield region, typically between 7.0 and 8.5 ppm.\n    *   For **ortho** or **meta** substitution, there would be four distinct aromatic protons, leading to a complex pattern of signals.\n    *   For **para** (1,4) substitution, the molecule has a plane of symmetry. This makes the two protons next to the acetyl group equivalent to each other, and the two protons next to the halogen equivalent to each other. This results in a simpler and very characteristic pattern: two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons.\n*   **Methyl Protons (-COCH₃):** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent and are not adjacent to any other protons, so they will appear as a single sharp peak (a singlet). This signal is typically found around 2.3–2.6 ppm.\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Options\n\nLet's compare the expected spectrum with the given choices:\n\n*   **A) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This option lacks any signals in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm), which is incorrect for a benzene derivative.\n\n*   **B) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at 6.9 ppm is low for an acetophenone derivative. More importantly, the singlet at 1.3 ppm integrates to 2H, which is inconsistent with a methyl (-CH₃) group.\n\n*   **C) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** The two doublets at 7.8 ppm (2H) and 7.6 ppm (2H) are the classic A₂B₂ pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The electron-withdrawing acetyl group deshields the ortho protons, shifting them further downfield (7.8 ppm) compared to the protons ortho to the halogen (7.6 ppm).\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** The singlet at 2.3 ppm integrating to 3H is exactly what is expected for the methyl protons of an acetyl group.\n    *   This data perfectly matches the structure of a **para-haloacetophenone**. For instance, the reported spectrum for 4-Bromoacetophenone shows a singlet at 2.60 ppm and two signals for the aromatic protons at 7.61-7.63 ppm and 7.83-7.84 ppm. Similarly, 4-Chloroacetophenone shows a methyl singlet at 2.61 ppm and doublets at 7.45 ppm and 7.91 ppm. The values in option C are consistent with these reported spectra.\n\n*   **D) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The singlet at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone. While an aldehyde contains a carbonyl group, the rest of the structure required to fit this NMR data would contradict the condition of having an \"aromatic-halogen bond\".\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe data presented in option C is the only one that correctly represents all the structural features of the described compound, specifically pointing to a para-substituted haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<C>>>"
