    "Here is a step-by-step calculation for the amount of non-Gaussianity (nG) in the given Schrödinger cat state.\n\n**1. Define the State and Parameters**\n\nThe Schrödinger cat state is given by:\n|ψ⟩ = (cos(φ)|α⟩ + sin(φ)|-α⟩) / N\n\nThe given parameters are:\n*   Amplitude, α = 0.5\n*   Phase, φ = -π/4\n\nFirst, let's substitute the value of φ into the state's definition:\n*   cos(-π/4) = 1/√2\n*   sin(-π/4) = -1/√2\n\nSo the state becomes:\n|ψ⟩ = ( (1/√2)|α⟩ - (1/√2)|-α⟩ ) / N = (|α⟩ - |-α⟩) / (√2 * N)\n\nNow, we calculate the normalization constant N:\nN = sqrt(1 + sin(2φ) * exp(-2α²))\nN = sqrt(1 + sin(2 * -π/4) * exp(-2 * 0.5²))\nN = sqrt(1 + sin(-π/2) * exp(-0.5))\nN = sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5))\n\nSubstituting N back into the state equation, the full normalization constant for the state is:\nN_full = √2 * N = sqrt(2 * (1 - exp(-0.5)))\nThis state, |ψ⟩ = (|α⟩ - |-α⟩) / sqrt(2(1 - exp(-2α²))), is known as the odd coherent state or odd Schrödinger cat state.\n\n**2. Understand the Measure of Non-Gaussianity**\n\nThe relative entropy measure is given as:\nnG = δ_b = Tr(ρ ln ρ) - Tr(τ ln τ)\n\nWhere:\n*   ρ = |ψ⟩⟨ψ| is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state.\n*   τ is the density matrix of the reference Gaussian state.\n*   The von Neumann entropy is defined as S(ρ) = -Tr(ρ ln ρ).\n\nThe formula can be rewritten as:\nnG = -S(ρ) - (-S(τ)) = S(τ) - S(ρ)\n\nSince the state |ψ⟩ is a pure state, its density matrix ρ has one eigenvalue equal to 1 and all others equal to 0. Therefore, its von Neumann entropy is:\nS(ρ) = - (1 * ln(1)) = 0\n\nSo, the non-Gaussianity is simply the entropy of the reference Gaussian state:\nnG = S(τ)\n\n**3. Define the Reference Gaussian State τ**\n\nThe reference Gaussian state τ is the Gaussian state that has the same first and second moments as ρ.\n*   **First moment (mean amplitude):** For an odd cat state, the mean amplitude ⟨a⟩ is zero.\n*   **Second moments:** We need to calculate ⟨a²⟩ and ⟨a†a⟩ for the state ρ. For an odd cat state with real α, the moments are:\n    *   ⟨a²⟩ = α²\n    *   ⟨a†a⟩ = α² * coth(α²)\n\n**4. Calculate the Entropy of the Reference Gaussian State S(τ)**\n\nThe entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state is determined by its symplectic eigenvalue, ν. The symplectic eigenvalue is the square root of the determinant of the covariance matrix, ν = √det(V). The entropy is then given by the formula:\nS(τ) = (ν + 1/2)ln(ν + 1/2) - (ν - 1/2)ln(ν - 1/2)\n\nThe determinant of the covariance matrix can be calculated from the second moments:\ndet(V) = (1/4) * [ (1 + 2⟨a†a⟩)² - 4|⟨a²⟩|² ]\n\n**5. Perform the Calculation with Given Values**\n\nLet's plug in α = 0.5, which gives α² = 0.25.\n\n*   Calculate the second moments:\n    *   ⟨a²⟩ = 0.25\n    *   coth(0.25) = (e^0.25 + e^-0.25) / (e^0.25 - e^-0.25) ≈ (1.2840 + 0.7788) / (1.2840 - 0.7788) ≈ 4.083\n    *   ⟨a†a⟩ = 0.25 * 4.083 ≈ 1.02075\n\n*   Calculate the determinant of the covariance matrix:\n    *   det(V) = (1/4) * [ (1 + 2 * 1.02075)² - 4 * (0.25)² ]\n    *   det(V) = (1/4) * [ (1 + 2.0415)² - 4 * 0.0625 ]\n    *   det(V) = (1/4) * [ (3.0415)² - 0.25 ]\n    *   det(V) = (1/4) * [ 9.2507 - 0.25 ] = 9.0007 / 4 ≈ 2.25\n\n*   Calculate the symplectic eigenvalue ν:\n    *   ν = √2.25 = 1.5\n\n*   Calculate the entropy S(τ):\n    *   S(τ) = (1.5 + 0.5) * ln(1.5 + 0.5) - (1.5 - 0.5) * ln(1.5 - 0.5)\n    *   S(τ) = 2 * ln(2) - 1 * ln(1)\n    *   S(τ) = 2 * ln(2) - 0\n    *   S(τ) ≈ 2 * 0.6931 = 1.3862\n\nThe calculated amount of non-Gaussianity is approximately 1.38.\n\n<<<B>>>"
