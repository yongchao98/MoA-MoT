    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product, 4, and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms it contains.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\nThe first reaction combines 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene with 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide (NaI).\n*   The reaction of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene with sodium iodide is a known method to generate a reactive diene in situ. The NaI promotes a double elimination of bromine, forming 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene. This molecule will act as the diene in a cycloaddition reaction.\n*   7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, a norbornadiene derivative, acts as a dienophile.\n*   Since two equivalents of the diene precursor are used, a double Diels-Alder reaction occurs. Each of the two double bonds in the norbornadiene reacts with one molecule of the in situ generated 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene. This results in the formation of a large, polycyclic adduct, which is Product 1.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\nProduct 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   Aqueous acid is used to cleave tert-butyl ethers. The tert-butoxy group at the C7 position of the norbornane core is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   Product 2 is the same polycyclic adduct as Product 1, but with a C7-OH group instead of the C7-O-tert-butyl group.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\nProduct 2 is treated with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO.\n*   These are the reagents for the Parikh-Doering oxidation, a mild method for oxidizing alcohols.\n*   The secondary alcohol at the C7 position is oxidized to a ketone (C=O). Product 3 is a large polycyclic ketone.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\nProduct 3 is heated to 150°C.\n*   Heating Diels-Alder adducts typically induces a retro-Diels-Alder reaction, which is the reverse of the initial cycloaddition.\n*   The thermolysis of Product 3 regenerates the constituent molecules: two equivalents of the diene and one equivalent of the dienophile core.\n    *   **Diene**: Two molecules of 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene are released.\n    *   **Dienophile Core**: The dienophile that is reformed is bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one.\n*   Bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one is known to be thermally unstable and readily decomposes by extruding carbon monoxide (CO) in a cheletropic elimination to form benzene.\n*   The final reaction mixture thus contains benzene and two molecules of 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene. The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens on \"final product 4\". Given the options, it is most likely referring to the other major organic product, the diene, rather than benzene (which has only one type of hydrogen, an answer not provided).\n\n**Analysis of Product 4 (5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene)**\nLet's determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene.\n*   **Structure**: The molecule consists of a six-membered ring with two internal double bonds (at C1-C2 and C3-C4) and two exocyclic double bonds at C5 and C6.\n*   **Symmetry**: The molecule possesses C₂ᵥ symmetry. A symmetry plane passes through the C5-C6 bond and bisects the C2-C3 bond.\n*   **Hydrogen Environments**:\n    1.  The hydrogen on C1 is equivalent to the hydrogen on C4.\n    2.  The hydrogen on C2 is equivalent to the hydrogen on C3.\n    3.  On the exocyclic methylene groups (=CH₂), the two hydrogens on a single carbon are diastereotopic (in different chemical environments). Let's call them \"inner\" and \"outer\".\n    4.  Due to the molecule's symmetry, the \"inner\" hydrogen on the C5-methylene is equivalent to the \"inner\" hydrogen on the C6-methylene.\n    5.  Similarly, the \"outer\" hydrogen on the C5-methylene is equivalent to the \"outer\" hydrogen on the C6-methylene.\n\nCounting these unique environments, we find there are four sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms:\n1.  {H on C1, H on C4}\n2.  {H on C2, H on C3}\n3.  {Inner H on C5-CH₂, Inner H on C6-CH₂}\n4.  {Outer H on C5-CH₂, Outer H on C6-CH₂}\n\nTherefore, there are 4 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
