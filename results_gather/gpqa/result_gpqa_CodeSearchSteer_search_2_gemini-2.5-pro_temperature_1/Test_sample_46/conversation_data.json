    "### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula & Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula is C9H11NO2. The degree of unsaturation is calculated as `(2C + 2 + N - H) / 2 = (2*9 + 2 + 1 - 11) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5`. This value strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and an additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The medium to strong intensity bands at **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1** are characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH2)**.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm-1** indicates a **carbonyl group (C=O)**. This frequency is typical for an ester, which is consistent with the presence of two oxygen atoms in the molecular formula. Published data for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate show IR absorption bands at 3424 cm-1, 3345 cm-1, and a carbonyl stretch at 1685 cm-1. The provided data is in close agreement.\n\n3.  **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This triplet, integrating to three protons, is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH3) next to a methylene group (-CH2).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This quartet, integrating to two protons, is characteristic of a methylene group (-CH2) next to a methyl group (-CH3). The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and this quartet at 4.5 ppm confirms the presence of an **ethyl group (-CH2CH3)**. The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm indicates the methylene group is attached to an electronegative oxygen atom, forming an **ethyl ester (-OCH2CH3)**.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons in this region is indicative of a **primary amine (-NH2)**. The protons are broad due to exchange and nitrogen's quadrupole moment.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons at 7.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-donating amine group, while the protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe data pieces together to form a single structure:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   The substituents are a primary amine (-NH2) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n\nThis structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n### Evaluating the Options:\n\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. This is an isomer, but the NMR would show a propionate group, not an ethyl ester attached to the oxygen.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. This would show a single N-H stretch in the IR for the secondary amide and a formyl proton signal in the NMR.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. All spectroscopic data perfectly match this structure. Published 1H NMR data for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate confirms the observed chemical shifts: Î´ 1.36 (t, 3H), 4.04 (br s, 2H), 4.31 (q, 2H), 6.63 (d, 2H), and 7.85 (d, 2H). These values are very close to the data provided in the problem.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. This is a primary amide and would show a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR due to 1,3-substitution.\n\n<<<C>>>"
