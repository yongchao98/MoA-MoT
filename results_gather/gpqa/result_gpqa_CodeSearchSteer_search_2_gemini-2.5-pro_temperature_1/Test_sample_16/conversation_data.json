    "Here is the step-by-step calculation to determine the concentration of free calcium ions.\n\n1.  **Write the dissociation reaction:** The Ca-EDTA complex in solution will dissociate into free calcium ions (Ca²⁺) and EDTA ions (EDTA⁴⁻) until it reaches equilibrium.\n    [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Define the formation constant (K_f):** The formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex, which is the reverse of the dissociation reaction.\n    K_f = [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])\n\n3.  **Set up an equilibrium table:** Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates. At equilibrium, the concentration of Ca²⁺ will be 'x' and the concentration of EDTA⁴⁻ will also be 'x'. The concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex will be its initial concentration minus the amount that dissociated.\n\n    *   Initial concentration of [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ = 0.02 M\n    *   Equilibrium concentration of [Ca²⁺] = x\n    *   Equilibrium concentration of [EDTA⁴⁻] = x\n    *   Equilibrium concentration of [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ = 0.02 - x\n\n4.  **Substitute into the K_f expression:**\n    K_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x) = (0.02 - x) / x²\n\n5.  **Solve for x:** We are given K_f = 5 x 10¹⁰.\n    5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / x²\n\n    Because the formation constant (K_f) is very large, the equilibrium strongly favors the complex. This means that the amount of dissociation, 'x', will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can therefore simplify the equation by assuming that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\n    5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\n6.  **Rearrange and calculate x:**\n    x² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\n    x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻²) / (5 x 10¹⁰)\n    x² ≈ 0.4 x 10⁻¹²\n    x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n    x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is equal to x.\n\nTherefore, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<C>>>"
