    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the energy states for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Since spin-1/2 particles are fermions, they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\nThe energy levels for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L are given by the formula:\nE_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²)\n\nThe problem defines a base energy unit E as:\nE = (π²ħ²)/(2mL²)\n\nTherefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as E_n = n²E, where n = 1, 2, 3, ... is the principal quantum number.\n\nAccording to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A particle's state in this system is defined by its principal quantum number (n) and its spin projection (m_s), which can be either spin-up (+1/2) or spin-down (-1/2). This means each energy level *n* can hold a maximum of two particles, one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\nHere's the step-by-step calculation for the required energy states:\n\n### Ground State Energy\nFor the ground state, the four particles must fill the lowest possible energy levels.\n*   **Level n=1:** Can hold two particles (one spin-up, one spin-down). The energy for these two particles is 2 × E₁ = 2 × (1²E) = 2E.\n*   **Level n=2:** Can hold the remaining two particles (one spin-up, one spin-down). The energy for these two particles is 2 × E₂ = 2 × (2²E) = 2 × 4E = 8E.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\nE_ground = 2E + 8E = **10E**.\n\n### First Excited State Energy\nTo find the first excited state, we must move one particle from the ground state configuration to the lowest available energy level with the smallest possible energy increase. This is achieved by promoting one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   **Level n=1:** Still holds two particles. Energy = 2 × E₁ = 2E.\n*   **Level n=2:** Now holds one particle. Energy = 1 × E₂ = 1 × (2²E) = 4E.\n*   **Level n=3:** Now holds one particle. Energy = 1 × E₃ = 1 × (3²E) = 9E.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\nE_first_excited = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**.\n\n### Second Excited State Energy\nFor the second excited state, we need to find the next lowest energy configuration above the first excited state. There are a few possibilities to consider starting from the ground state:\n1.  **Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3:** The configuration would be one particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 × 1²E) + (2 × 2²E) + (1 × 3²E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n2.  **Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3:** The configuration would be two particles in n=1 and two in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (2 × 1²E) + (2 × 3²E) = 2E + 18E = **20E**.\n3.  **Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4:** The configuration would be two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4.\n    *   Energy = (2 × 1²E) + (1 × 2²E) + (1 × 4²E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = **22E**.\n\nComparing these energies, the lowest energy level above the first excited state (15E) is 18E. Thus, the second excited state energy is **18E**.\n\nThe energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively.\n\n<<<A>>>"
