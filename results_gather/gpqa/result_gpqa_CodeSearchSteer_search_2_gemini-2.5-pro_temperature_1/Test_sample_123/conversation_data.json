    "To determine the necessary Lorentz factor, we can use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and the law of radioactive decay.\n\n### Analysis of the Physics\n\nThe fraction of particles that survive after traveling a certain distance depends on their lifetime. For relativistic particles, their lifetime as observed in the laboratory frame is dilated (lengthened) by the Lorentz factor, γ.\n\nThe key formula governing the survival of particles is:\n\n**N / N₀ = e<sup>(-t / τ_lab)</sup>**\n\nWhere:\n*   **N** is the number of particles that survive.\n*   **N₀** is the initial number of particles.\n*   **t** is the time of flight in the laboratory frame.\n*   **τ_lab** is the mean lifetime of the particles in the laboratory frame.\n\nThis lab-frame lifetime is related to the particle's proper lifetime (τ₀, its lifetime in its own rest frame) by the time dilation formula:\n\n**τ_lab = γ * τ₀**\n\nThe particles travel at ultra-relativistic velocities, so we can approximate their speed *v* as the speed of light *c*. The time of flight to the detector wall of radius *R* is:\n\n**t ≈ R / c**\n\nSubstituting these into the survival equation gives:\n\n**N / N₀ = e<sup>-( (R/c) / (γ * τ₀) )</sup>**\n\n### Calculation Steps\n\n1.  **Use the initial conditions to find a constant.**\n    We are given that for a Lorentz factor (γ₁) of 20, one-third of the particles reach the detector.\n\n    *   N/N₀ = 1/3\n    *   γ₁ = 20\n    *   R = 30 m\n\n    So, **1/3 = e<sup>-( (30/c) / (20 * τ₀) )</sup>**\n\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    ln(1/3) = - (30 / (c * 20 * τ₀))\n    -ln(3) = - (1.5 / (c * τ₀))\n    **ln(3) = 1.5 / (c * τ₀)**\n\n    The term `1.5 / (c * τ₀)` is a constant that depends on the detector size and the particle's proper lifetime.\n\n2.  **Set up the equation for the desired condition.**\n    We want to find the new Lorentz factor (γ₂) for which two-thirds of the particles reach the detector.\n\n    *   N/N₀ = 2/3\n    *   γ₂ = ?\n\n    So, **2/3 = e<sup>-( (30/c) / (γ₂ * τ₀) )</sup>**\n\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    ln(2/3) = - (30 / (c * γ₂ * τ₀))\n    -ln(3/2) = - (30 / (c * γ₂ * τ₀))\n    **ln(3/2) = 30 / (c * γ₂ * τ₀)**\n\n3.  **Solve for the new Lorentz factor (γ₂).**\n    We now have a system of two equations:\n    a) ln(3) = 1.5 / (c * τ₀)\n    b) ln(3/2) = 30 / (c * γ₂ * τ₀)\n\n    Let's rearrange equation (b) to look more like (a):\n    ln(3/2) = (20 / γ₂) * (1.5 / (c * τ₀))\n\n    Now substitute the expression for `1.5 / (c * τ₀)` from equation (a) into the rearranged equation (b):\n    ln(3/2) = (20 / γ₂) * ln(3)\n\n    Now, we solve for γ₂:\n    γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)\n    γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986) / (ln(1.5))\n    γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986) / (0.4055)\n    **γ₂ ≈ 54.19**\n\nThis value is approximately 54. Based on the provided options, the correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
