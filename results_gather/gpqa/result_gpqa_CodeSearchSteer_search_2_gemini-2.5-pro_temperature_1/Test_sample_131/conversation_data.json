    "To solve this problem, a detailed analysis of the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each potential compound is necessary. The spectrum of the 1:1 mixture shows two singlets in the aromatic region (~6.7 ppm) with a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets in the aliphatic region (~2.2 ppm) with a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n### **Analysis of Individual Compounds**\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a high degree of symmetry with two perpendicular planes.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. This results in a single signal, a singlet, for 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. This results in a single signal, a singlet, for 12H.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry passing through the methyl groups at C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent due to this symmetry. This gives one singlet for 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups are in three different chemical environments:\n        *   The methyls at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl at C5 is unique (3H).\n        This results in three aliphatic singlets with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** A plane of symmetry bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent and will produce a single singlet for 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups are in two different chemical environments:\n        *   The methyls at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyls at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        This results in two aliphatic singlets with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, or 1:1.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (1:1 ratio).\n\n4.  **1,4-Diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a high degree of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are equivalent, giving one singlet for 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The protons of the two equivalent ethyl groups will split into two signals: a quartet for the four methylene (-CH2-) protons and a triplet for the six methyl (-CH3) protons. These are not singlets.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (4H), 1 aliphatic quartet (4H), 1 aliphatic triplet (6H).\n\n### **Evaluation of the Mixture Options**\n\nThe experimental data for the 1:1 mixture is:\n*   **Aromatic:** Two singlets (1:1 ratio).\n*   **Aliphatic:** Three singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\nNow, let's analyze the proposed mixtures:\n\n*   **Mixture A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB has one aromatic singlet (2H). 1,2,3,5-TMB also has one aromatic singlet (2H). If these have different chemical shifts, the 1:1 mixture would show **two singlets**, each integrating to 2H, giving a **1:1 ratio**. This matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB has one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,5-TMB has three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). If the 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB coincidentally overlaps with the 6H singlet from 1,2,3,5-TMB, the combined spectrum would show:\n        *   One singlet at the position of the two overlapping signals, with an integration of 12H + 6H = 18H.\n        *   Two other singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB with integrations of 3H and 3H.\n        The resulting ratio would be 18H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 6:1:1. This does not match the observed 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's reconsider the analysis for 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Some sources suggest it has two separate aromatic protons and three methyl signals. Let's re-examine the correct assignments based on chemical databases. The initial analysis of three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio for 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene is correct. The error was in the combination.\n\nLet's re-examine the options with a fresh perspective. We are looking for a combination that produces a total of two aromatic singlets and three aliphatic singlets with the specified ratios.\n\n*   **The total number of aliphatic signals is three.**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB has one.\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB has three.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB has two.\n    *   1,4-diethylbenzene has zero singlets.\n\nIf we mix two of these, the total number of aliphatic singlets (assuming no overlaps) would be:\n*   A) 1 + 3 = 4\n*   B) 3 + 0 = 3\n*   C) 2 + 3 = 5\n*   D) 1 + 2 = 3\n\nThis simple count suggests that options **B** and **D** are the most plausible candidates for producing exactly three aliphatic singlets.\n\n*   **Let's analyze Mixture D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** Both compounds show one aromatic singlet (2H each). A 1:1 mixture will produce **two aromatic singlets** in a **1:1 ratio**, assuming different chemical shifts. This matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB: one singlet (12H).\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB: two singlets (6H each).\n    *   **Combined Aliphatic Spectrum:** This mixture would exhibit a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Let's re-analyze Mixture B: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,3,5-TMB has one singlet (2H). 1,4-diethylbenzene has one singlet (4H). The mixture would show two singlets with a ratio of 2:4, or 1:2. This contradicts the observed 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** 1,2,3,5-TMB has three singlets. 1,4-diethylbenzene has a quartet and a triplet. The mixture would contain three singlets, a quartet, and a triplet, which does not match the data.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis, the combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only one that fits all the spectral data.\n\n<<<D>>>"
