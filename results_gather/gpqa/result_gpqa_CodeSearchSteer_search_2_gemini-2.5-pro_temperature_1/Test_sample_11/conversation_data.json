    "The problem requires finding the kinetic energies of the muon (μ⁺) and the neutrino (ν) from the decay of a stationary positive pion (π⁺). This can be solved by applying the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n**1. Setup:**\n*   **Decay reaction:** π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν\n*   The pion is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero, and its initial energy is its rest mass energy.\n*   **Given masses:**\n    *   Rest mass of π⁺ (m_π) = 139.6 MeV/c²\n    *   Rest mass of μ⁺ (m_μ) = 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   The neutrino (ν) is considered massless, a standard assumption in this context.\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum:**\nSince the pion is stationary, the total initial momentum is zero. To conserve momentum, the two product particles must be emitted in opposite directions with equal-magnitude momenta. Let 'p' be the magnitude of the momentum for both the muon and the neutrino.\n\n**3. Conservation of Energy:**\nThe initial energy of the system is the rest energy of the pion (E_π = m_πc²). The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon (E_μ) and the neutrino (E_ν).\n\n*   E_π = E_μ + E_ν\n\nThe total energy for a particle is given by the relativistic formula E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n\n*   For the massless neutrino: E_ν = pc. This energy is purely kinetic.\n*   For the massive muon: E_μ = √( (pc)² + (m_μc²)² )\n\nSubstituting these into the energy conservation equation:\nm_πc² = √( (pc)² + (m_μc²)² ) + pc\n\n**4. Calculation:**\nWe can now solve for the momentum (pc) and then find the kinetic energies.\n\nRearranging the energy equation to solve for pc:\nm_πc² - pc = √( (pc)² + (m_μc²)² )\n\nSquaring both sides:\n(m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²) (pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n\nThe (pc)² terms cancel out. Solving for pc:\npc = [ (m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)² ] / [ 2(m_πc²) ]\n\nPlugging in the given rest energy values:\npc = [ (139.6)² - (105.7)² ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]\npc = [ 19488.16 - 11172.49 ] / [ 279.2 ]\npc = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\n**5. Kinetic Energies:**\n\n*   **Neutrino's Kinetic Energy (KE_ν):**\n    Since the neutrino is massless, its total energy is its kinetic energy.\n    KE_ν = E_ν = pc ≈ 29.8 MeV.\n\n*   **Muon's Kinetic Energy (KE_μ):**\n    The kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest energy (KE_μ = E_μ - m_μc²). We can also find it by subtracting the neutrino's energy from the total energy released.\n    Total energy released = m_πc² - m_μc² = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV.\n    This total released energy is shared as kinetic energy between the muon and the neutrino.\n    KE_μ = (Total energy released) - KE_ν\n    KE_μ = 33.9 MeV - 29.8 MeV = 4.1 MeV.\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.1 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. These values match experimental and theoretical results.\n\nComparing our results with the given options:\n*   KE_μ ≈ 4.1 MeV (matches 4.12 MeV)\n*   KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
