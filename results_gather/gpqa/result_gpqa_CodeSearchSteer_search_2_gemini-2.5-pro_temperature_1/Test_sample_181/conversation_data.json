    "The validity of the Mott-Gurney equation rests on several key assumptions about the device and the nature of charge transport. Analyzing the options based on these assumptions reveals the correct conditions.\n\nThe foundational assumptions for the Mott-Gurney law are:\n*   **Single-Carrier Device:** The current is dominated by one type of charge carrier, either electrons or holes.\n*   **Trap-Free:** The semiconductor or insulator is considered ideal, with no trap states within the bandgap that could capture injected carriers. If traps are present, the current-voltage relationship changes.\n*   **Ohmic Contact (No Injection Barrier):** One contact must be perfectly Ohmic, meaning it can supply an unlimited number of charge carriers into the device without an energy barrier. This ensures the current is limited by the charge buildup in the bulk (space charge), not by the injection process itself. A Schottky contact, which has an injection barrier, violates this assumption.\n*   **Negligible Diffusion Current:** The current is assumed to be dominated by the drift of carriers under the influence of the applied electric field. The contribution from diffusion, which arises from carrier concentration gradients, is considered negligible. This holds true in the high-voltage regime.\n\nWith these points in mind:\n*   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.** This is incorrect because a Schottky contact introduces an injection barrier, which violates a core assumption.\n*   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.** This statement accurately includes all the key requirements: a single carrier type, no traps, an ideal Ohmic contact (no injection barrier), and drift-dominated current (negligible diffusion).\n*   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.** This is incorrect because the current in the SCLC regime *is* a drift current; it cannot be negligible.\n*   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.** This is incorrect because the basic Mott-Gurney law is derived for single-carrier (unipolar) transport.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that correctly describes the conditions for the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
