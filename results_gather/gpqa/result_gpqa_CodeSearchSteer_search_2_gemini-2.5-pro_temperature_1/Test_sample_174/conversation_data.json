    "An oscillating charge distribution with a well-defined symmetry axis can be modeled as a simple oscillating electric dipole, especially when its size is much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation it produces. For a dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the physics of electromagnetism dictates a specific pattern and nature for the radiated power.\n\n### Angular Distribution of Power\n\nThe time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle, which corresponds to the function `f` in the question, for an oscillating electric dipole is given by the formula:\n\n`dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)`\n\nwhere `θ` is the angle measured from the oscillation axis (the z-axis).\n\nFrom this relationship, we can determine the following:\n*   **Maximum Power (A):** The radiation is at its maximum when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. This occurs at `θ = 90°` (in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis), where `sin²(90°) = 1`. Thus, the maximum power `A` is proportional to 1.\n*   **Power at a Specific Angle:** To find the fraction of the maximum power radiated at a specific angle, we can calculate the ratio of the power at that angle to the maximum power.\n*   **Calculation for θ = 30°:** At an angle of `θ = 30°`, the power is proportional to `sin²(30°)`. Since `sin(30°) = 1/2`, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\nTherefore, the fraction of the maximum power `A` that is radiated at an angle of 30° is **1/4**.\n\n### Wavelength Dependence\n\nThe power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole also has a strong dependence on the wavelength (`λ`) of the radiation. The power is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency `ω` (`P ∝ ω⁴`).\n\nThe relationship between angular frequency and wavelength is `ω = 2πc/λ`, where `c` is the speed of light. Substituting this into the power proportionality gives:\n\n`P ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n\nThis means the radiated power per unit solid angle, `f`, is proportional to `λ⁻⁴`. This specific relationship is also characteristic of Rayleigh scattering, which explains, for instance, why the sky appears blue.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining these two results, the fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at an angle `θ = 30°` is **1/4**, and a possible form for the function `f` (representing the power's dependence on wavelength) is proportional to **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
