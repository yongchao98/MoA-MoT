    "To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻), we must first calculate the concentrations of the buffer components and the pH of the solution.\n\n### 1. Calculate the Molar Concentrations of the Buffer Components\n\nThe solution contains a phosphate buffer made from potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH₂PO₄) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O). The total volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 0.200 L.\n\n*   **For KH₂PO₄ (the acid component, H₂PO₄⁻):**\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Molar Mass (Mw) = 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   Concentration [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = **0.03674 M**\n\n*   **For Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O (the base component, HPO₄²⁻):**\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Molar Mass (Mw) = 177.99 g/mol\n    *   Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n    *   Concentration [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = **0.02809 M**\n\n### 2. Determine the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]\n\nThe pH of this buffer is governed by the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄), which involves the equilibrium between H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻. The corresponding acid dissociation constant is Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸.\n\nThe equilibrium is:\nH₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n\nWe can use the expression for Ka₂ to find the hydrogen ion concentration:\nKa₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n\nRearranging to solve for [H⁺]:\n[H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n[H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H⁺] ≈ 8.112 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n### 3. Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion (PO₄³⁻) Concentration\n\nThe orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is produced by the third dissociation of phosphoric acid, from the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻). The equilibrium for this process is:\n\nHPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n\nThis equilibrium is governed by the third acid dissociation constant, Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹². The expression for Ka₃ is:\nKa₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n\nWe can now solve for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, [PO₄³⁻]:\n[PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n\nUsing the values calculated previously:\n[PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.112 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n[PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis value is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
