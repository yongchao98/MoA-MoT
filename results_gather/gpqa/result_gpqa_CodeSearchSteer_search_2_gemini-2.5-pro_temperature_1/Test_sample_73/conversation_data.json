    "The problem of calculating the decay probability of a single atom is based on the principles of exponential decay. A key feature of this process is that it is \"memoryless,\" meaning the probability of decay in a future time interval is independent of how long the atom has already survived. The fact that the atom has not decayed for 50 minutes does not influence its future decay probability.\n\nTo solve this, we first determine the decay constant (λ), which represents the probability of decay per unit of time.\n\n**1. Calculate the Survival Probability:**\nThe probability of the atom decaying within 100 minutes is given as 32% (or 0.32). Therefore, the probability of it *surviving* (not decaying) in the same period is:\nP(survival in 100 min) = 1 - P(decay in 100 min) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\n**2. Determine the Decay Constant (λ):**\nThe probability of a single nucleus surviving for a time *t* is given by the formula P(survival) = e^(-λt). We can use the information from the previous step to find λ:\n0.68 = e^(-λ * 100)\n\nTo solve for λ, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\nln(0.68) = -100λ\nλ = -ln(0.68) / 100\n\n**3. Calculate the Decay Probability for the Next 150 Minutes:**\nDue to the memoryless nature of radioactive decay, the 50 minutes that have already passed are irrelevant to the future probability. We need to calculate the probability of the atom decaying in a new 150-minute interval.\n\nFirst, we find the survival probability for 150 minutes:\nP(survival in 150 min) = e^(-λ * 150)\n\nNow, substitute the expression for λ we found earlier:\nP(survival in 150 min) = e^((-(-ln(0.68) / 100)) * 150)\nP(survival in 150 min) = e^((ln(0.68) / 100) * 150)\nP(survival in 150 min) = e^(1.5 * ln(0.68))\n\nUsing the property of logarithms that a * ln(b) = ln(b^a):\nP(survival in 150 min) = e^(ln(0.68^1.5))\nP(survival in 150 min) = 0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.56\n\nThe probability of decay is 1 minus the probability of survival:\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - P(survival in 150 min)\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44\n\nThis corresponds to a 44% probability.\n\n<<<A>>>"
