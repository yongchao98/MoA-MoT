    "The problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the z-component of orbital angular momentum for two electrons.\n\n### Analysis of the State\n\n1.  **System:** The system consists of two electrons, each in a p-orbital. For a p-orbital, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is `l=1`. Thus, we have `l₁ = 1` for the first electron and `l₂ = 1` for the second.\n2.  **Possible z-components:** The magnetic quantum number `m` can take integer values from `-l` to `+l`. For each electron, the possible values for their magnetic quantum numbers (`m₁` and `m₂`) are -1, 0, and +1. The corresponding eigenvalues of the z-component of angular momentum (`L₁z` and `L₂z`) are `mħ`, i.e., -ħ, 0, and ħ.\n3.  **Coupled State:** The two-electron system is in a coupled angular momentum state represented by `|l, m> = |2, -1>`. Here, `l=2` is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, and `m=-1` is the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum quantum number.\n4.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** A fundamental principle of angular momentum addition is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. In terms of quantum numbers, this is expressed as:\n    `m = m₁ + m₂`\n\n### The Measurement\n\nThe question asks for the joint probability of measuring `L₁z = -ħ` and `L₂z = -ħ`. This corresponds to finding the system in a state where `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`.\n\nLet's check if this measurement outcome is consistent with the given state of the system. According to the conservation rule, if we were to find `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`, the total magnetic quantum number `m` would have to be:\n\n`m = m₁ + m₂ = (-1) + (-1) = -2`\n\nHowever, the system is explicitly stated to be in the state `|l, m> = |2, -1>`, which means its total magnetic quantum number is `m = -1`.\n\nSince the required measurement (`m₁ = -1`, `m₂ = -1`) would result in a total `m` of -2, which contradicts the system's actual state where `m = -1`, this measurement outcome is physically impossible.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe state `|l=2, m=-1>` is a superposition of states `|l₁, m₁>|l₂, m₂>` for which the condition `m₁ + m₂ = -1` is satisfied. The state corresponding to the measurement `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1` is `|l₁=1, m₁=-1>|l₂=1, m₂=-1>`. This state has a total `m` of -2 and is therefore orthogonal to the given state `|l=2, m=-1>`.\n\nThe probability of measuring an outcome that is inconsistent with the initial state of the system is zero.\n\n<<<C>>>"
