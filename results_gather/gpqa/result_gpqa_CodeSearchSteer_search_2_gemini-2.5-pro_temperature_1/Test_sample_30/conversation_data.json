    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 3.\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1.**\nThis reaction is the electrophilic nitration of toluene. The methyl group (-CH₃) is an ortho-, para-directing group. This means the nitro group (-NO₂) will be added to the benzene ring at the positions ortho (next to) or para (opposite) to the methyl group. While a mixture of ortho-nitrotoluene and para-nitrotoluene is formed, the para isomer is often considered the major product in multi-step synthesis problems due to reduced steric hindrance, and it possesses higher symmetry.\n*   **Product 1:** p-Nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene).\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄, forming product 2.**\nThis step involves the oxidation of the methyl group of p-nitrotoluene. Manganese dioxide (MnO₂) in the presence of a strong acid like sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) is an oxidizing agent capable of oxidizing an alkyl side-chain on a benzene ring to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The nitro group is stable under these conditions.\n*   **Product 2:** p-Nitrobenzoic acid (4-nitrobenzoic acid).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.**\nIn this step, we have p-nitrobenzoic acid, a strong base (sodium hydroxide, NaOH), and acetone.\nThe most immediate and definite reaction is the acid-base neutralization between the carboxylic acid (p-nitrobenzoic acid) and the strong base (NaOH).\n*   **Acid-Base Reaction:** C₇H₅NO₄ (p-nitrobenzoic acid) + NaOH → C₇H₄NNaO₄ (sodium p-nitrobenzoate) + H₂O\n\nThe role of acetone in this context is most likely as a solvent. While a more complex reaction involving acetone as a nucleophile to form a Meisenheimer complex is theoretically possible (a Janovsky-type reaction), it is less likely to be the intended final product for several reasons:\n1.  Such reactions typically require more strongly electron-deficient rings (e.g., with multiple nitro groups).\n2.  The resulting Meisenheimer complex would be asymmetric, having C₁ symmetry, which is not among the options.\n\nTherefore, the most logical and stable product formed is the salt from the neutralization reaction.\n*   **Product 3:** Sodium p-nitrobenzoate.\n\n**Molecular Symmetry of Product 3 (Sodium p-nitrobenzoate)**\nNow, we must determine the point group for the p-nitrobenzoate anion ([O₂N-C₆H₄-COO]⁻).\n1.  The molecule has a benzene ring substituted at the 1 and 4 positions with a carboxylate group (-COO⁻) and a nitro group (-NO₂).\n2.  Assuming the molecule is planar, it possesses several symmetry elements:\n    *   A C₂ rotational axis that passes through the N-C₄-C₁-C(carboxyl) atoms.\n    *   Two C₂ axes perpendicular to the main axis and to each other.\n    *   Three perpendicular mirror planes: the plane of the molecule itself (σh), a plane containing the main C₂ axis and perpendicular to the molecular plane (σv), and a third plane perpendicular to the other two (σd).\n    *   An inversion center (i).\n\nThe collection of these symmetry elements (E, 3xC₂, i, 3xσ) corresponds to the **D₂h** point group.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) C₂h\nB) D₂h\nC) Cs\nD) C₃\n\nThe molecular symmetry group of product 3 is D₂h.\n\n<<<B>>>"
