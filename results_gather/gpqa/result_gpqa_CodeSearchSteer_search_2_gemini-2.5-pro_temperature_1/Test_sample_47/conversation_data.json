    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions and the final determination of the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product.\n\n### Reaction Analysis\n\n*   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\n    This reaction is the α-halogenation of a ketone. One of the hydrogen atoms on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group is replaced by a bromine atom. This results in the formation of **2-bromocyclohexanone (Product 1)**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n    When an α-halo ketone, such as 2-bromocyclohexanone, is heated with a strong base like NaOH, it undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the formation of a cyclopropanone intermediate, which then opens up to form a ring-contracted carboxylic acid. In this case, the six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to a five-membered ring, yielding **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Product 2)**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n    This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the cyclopentanecarboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom, forming **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3)**. Pyridine is used to neutralize the HCl gas produced during the reaction.\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃)**\n    Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild reducing agent specifically used to reduce highly reactive acid chlorides to aldehydes, without further reduction to an alcohol. Therefore, it reduces cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride to **cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde (Product 4)**.\n\n### Analysis of Product 4\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde**. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to examine the molecule's structure and symmetry.\n\nThe structure of cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde (C₅H₉CHO) consists of a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO). The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group and the C-H bond of the carbon it's attached to (C1), bisecting the cyclopentane ring.\n\nDue to this plane of symmetry:\n*   The carbons C2 and C5 are equivalent.\n*   The carbons C3 and C4 are equivalent.\n\nNow let's count the sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms (protons that are in different electronic environments and would show separate signals in an NMR spectrum):\n\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton is unique.\n2.  **The proton on C1:** This proton is on the carbon attached to the aldehyde group. It lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique.\n3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** The two protons on C2 are not equivalent to each other; they are diastereotopic. One is *cis* to the aldehyde group and the other is *trans*. The same applies to C5. Because of the plane of symmetry, the two *cis* protons (one on C2, one on C5) are chemically equivalent to each other.\n4.  **Protons on C2 and C5 (continued):** Likewise, the two *trans* protons (one on C2, one on C5) are equivalent to each other, but they are in a different chemical environment than the *cis* protons. This gives a fourth distinct set of hydrogens.\n5.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** Similar to the C2/C5 positions, the protons on C3 and C4 are diastereotopic. The two *cis* protons (one on C3, one on C4) are equivalent to each other.\n6.  **Protons on C3 and C4 (continued):** The two *trans* protons (one on C3, one on C4) form the sixth and final set of chemically distinct hydrogens.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 6 chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde.\n\n<<<B>>>"
