    "An analysis of the provided spectral data allows for the determination of the product's structure.\n**Product Structure Analysis:**\n\n*   **¹³C NMR:** The signal at δ 197.7 ppm is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon, specifically from a ketone or an aldehyde. The signals in the range of δ 126-145 ppm indicate the presence of an aromatic ring and a carbon-carbon double bond. The two signals at δ 21.3 and 28.4 ppm correspond to two distinct aliphatic carbons, most likely methyl groups.\n*   **¹H NMR:** The data shows two singlets at δ 2.28 and 2.31 ppm, each integrating to 3 protons. These are characteristic of two methyl groups that are not coupled to any neighboring protons. The signals in the aromatic/olefinic region (δ 6.5-8.0 ppm) consist of four distinct peaks: two doublets each integrating to one proton (δ 6.75 and 7.68) and two doublets each integrating to two protons (δ 7.08 and 7.71). The pair of doublets at δ 7.08 (2H) and δ 7.71 (2H) is a classic pattern for a para-substituted benzene ring. The remaining two doublets at δ 6.75 (1H) and δ 7.68 (1H) are indicative of two coupled vinyl protons on a disubstituted double bond (-CH=CH-).\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:** Based on this analysis, the product is an α,β-unsaturated ketone containing a p-tolyl group and another methyl group. The structure can be identified as **(E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n    *   The p-tolyl group accounts for the methyl singlet (e.g., at δ 2.31 ppm) and the four aromatic protons (δ 7.08 and δ 7.71).\n    *   The `-C(=O)-CH₃` group accounts for the ketone carbon (δ 197.7 ppm) and the other methyl singlet (e.g., at δ 2.28 ppm).\n    *   The trans vinyl group, `-CH=CH-`, accounts for the two vinyl proton doublets (δ 6.75 and δ 7.68). The large chemical shift difference between them is typical for an enone system, with the β-proton being significantly deshielded by conjugation with both the aromatic ring and the carbonyl group.\n    *   The molecular formula of this product is C₁₁H₁₂O, which matches that of the starting material, Compound X.\n\n**Reaction and Starting Material Identification:**\n\nThe reaction is the rearrangement of Compound X (an epoxide) in the presence of 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), which is a non-nucleophilic base. This reaction is a base-mediated rearrangement of an epoxide, often a Meinwald rearrangement. The Meinwald rearrangement of a terminal epoxide (`R-CH(O)CH₂`) yields a methyl ketone (`R-C(=O)-CH₃`).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options for Compound X:\n\n*   **A) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane (`Ph-CH=CH-CH(O)CH-CH₃`):** This compound has a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group. Thus, it cannot yield the identified product.\n*   **B) 2-styrylepoxide (`Ph-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂`):** This compound has the molecular formula C₁₀H₁₀O, which does not match the given formula for Compound X (C₁₁H₁₂O).\n*   **C) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane (`Ph-CH=C(CH₃)-CH(O)CH₂`):** This compound has a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group. It cannot be Compound X.\n*   **D) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** The structure is `p-Tolyl-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂`. This compound has the correct molecular formula (C₁₁H₁₂O) and contains a p-tolyl group. It is a terminal vinyl epoxide. Applying the Meinwald rearrangement pattern, the group R is `p-Tolyl-CH=CH-`. The rearrangement product is `R-C(=O)-CH₃`, which corresponds to `p-Tolyl-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`. This is precisely the structure identified from the NMR spectra, (E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\nTherefore, Compound X must be 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<D>>>"
