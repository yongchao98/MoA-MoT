    "This is a problem of special relativity, specifically involving time dilation.\n\nHere is the step-by-step solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the given information:**\n    *   The velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame (this is the proper time), `Δt' = 50 s`.\n    *   The speed of light, `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n2.  **Understand the concept of time dilation:**\n    According to Einstein's theory of special relativity, time passes slower for a moving object (the ejecta) as measured by a stationary observer (in the Galaxy's frame of reference). This effect is called time dilation. The time measured in the stationary frame (`Δt`) is related to the time measured in the moving frame (`Δt'`) by the Lorentz factor (γ).\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n    The Lorentz factor is given by the formula:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n    First, calculate the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light:\n    `β = v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n    Now, substitute this value into the Lorentz factor formula:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96`\n    `γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`\n\n4.  **Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (Δt):**\n    The time dilation formula is:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    `Δt ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s`\n    `Δt ≈ 51.03 s`\n\n5.  **Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame:**\n    The distance traveled is the velocity multiplied by the time elapsed in the same reference frame.\n    `Distance = v * Δt`\n    `Distance = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s`\n    `Distance ≈ 3,061,800 km`\n\nThis calculated value is very close to option D. The minor difference is likely due to rounding in the problem's options. If we use the exact value from step 4 (`Δt = 50 / √0.96`), the distance is `60,000 * (50 / √0.96) = 3,000,000 / √0.96 ≈ 3,061,862 km`. This confirms that 3,060,000 km is the intended answer.\n\nTherefore, the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame is approximately 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<D>>>"
