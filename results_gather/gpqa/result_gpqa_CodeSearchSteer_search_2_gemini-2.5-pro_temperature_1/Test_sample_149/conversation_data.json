    "The final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.\nThe step-by-step analysis of the reaction is as follows:\n\n**1. Identification of the Starting Material**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **1H-NMR Data Analysis:**\n    *   9.72 ppm (t, 1H): This chemical shift and multiplicity (triplet) are characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO) adjacent to a methylene (-CH2-) group.\n    *   6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H): These two doublets, each integrating to two protons, indicate a para-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   6.27 ppm (bs, 2H): A broad singlet for two protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   3.66 ppm (d, 2H): This doublet corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methine (-CH-) group, in this case, the aldehyde.\n\n*   **Structure Determination:** Assembling these fragments, the starting material is identified as **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. The para-substituted ring contains an amino group (-NH2) and a -CH2CHO group. The formula C8H9NO and the NMR splitting patterns are consistent with this structure.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization)**: This set of reagents converts a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt. 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde is transformed into the corresponding arenediazonium salt, (4-diazoniumphenyl)acetaldehyde chloride.\n\n*   **Step 2: H2O (Hydrolysis)**: Treating the diazonium salt with water leads to its hydrolysis, replacing the diazonium group (-N2+) with a hydroxyl group (-OH). This reaction forms **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**: This step involves a base-catalyzed self-condensation of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. The molecule possesses acidic α-hydrogens (on the -CH2- group), making it susceptible to an aldol reaction.\n    *   An enolate is formed when the hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an α-hydrogen.\n    *   This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n    *   This initially forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which in this case is 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (Product A).\n    *   Because the reaction is heated, this intermediate aldol addition product undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule). This elimination is favorable as it results in a highly conjugated system (an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde). The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nBased on the multi-step synthesis, the final product is the result of the aldol condensation, which is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<B>>>"
