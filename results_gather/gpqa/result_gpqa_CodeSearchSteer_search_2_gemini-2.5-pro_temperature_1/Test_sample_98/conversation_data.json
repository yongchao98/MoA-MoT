    "To identify the unknown compound, we must analyze the provided spectroscopic data and see which of the candidate molecules fits the information.\n\n### **FTIR Spectrum Analysis**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is a result of hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) group stretch, and its position is consistent with that of a carboxylic acid (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n\nThe FTIR data strongly suggest that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. Since all four possible options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n### **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n\nThe ¹H NMR data provides the key details needed to determine the carbon skeleton. We are looking for a molecule that shows two specific complex splitting patterns for two different proton signals.\n\n1.  **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    This complex splitting, also called a multiplet, arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring, non-equivalent protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** Indicates coupling to one adjacent proton (-CH).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Indicates coupling to two adjacent, equivalent protons (-CH₂).\n    *   **Quartet (q):** Indicates coupling to three adjacent, equivalent protons (-CH₃).\n\n2.  **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    This pattern arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring, non-equivalent protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** Indicates coupling to one adjacent proton (-CH).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Indicates coupling to two adjacent, equivalent protons (-CH₂).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Indicates coupling to another, different set of two adjacent, equivalent protons (-CH₂).\n\n### **Evaluating the Candidate Structures**\n\nLet's analyze the expected splitting for the key protons (the ones on the main carbon chain) in each molecule.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   This structure contains a proton that is coupled to one methine (-CH) and two different methylene (-CH₂) groups. This would produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**, matching the second signal.\n    *   However, there is no proton in this molecule that is adjacent to a methyl (-CH₃), a methylene (-CH₂), and a methine (-CH) group simultaneously. Therefore, it cannot produce a doublet of triplets of quartets.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   This structure has a proton (at C3) that is adjacent to a methine (-CH), a methylene (-CH₂), and a methyl (-CH₃) group. This would result in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**, matching the first signal.\n    *   However, it does not have any proton that is adjacent to one methine and two different methylene groups. Therefore, it cannot produce a doublet of triplets of triplets.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   **Proton at C4**: This proton is adjacent to a methine (H at C3), a methyl group (at C5), and the methylene group of the ethyl substituent at C4. This environment leads to coupling with one proton (doublet), three protons (quartet), and two protons (triplet). This perfectly matches the **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** signal.\n    *   **Proton at C3**: This proton is adjacent to a methine (H at C4), the methylene group in the main chain (at C2), and the methylene group of the ethyl substituent at C3. This environment leads to coupling with one proton (doublet), two protons (triplet), and another set of two protons (triplet). This perfectly matches the **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)** signal.\n    *   This molecule is the only candidate that satisfies both ¹H NMR signal descriptions.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   This structure has a proton (at C3) that would give a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   However, the proton at C4 is coupled to a methine and two methyl groups, which would result in a doublet of quartets of quartets, not a doublet of triplets of triplets.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of both FTIR and ¹H NMR data, only compound C, CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH, is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic evidence.\n\n<<<C>>>"
