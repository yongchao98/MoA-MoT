    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as a local quantum field theory. As such, it must respect the fundamental symmetries of this framework.\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry**: This is a fundamental spacetime symmetry required for any relativistic quantum field theory. The operators in SMEFT are constructed to be invariant under Lorentz transformations.\n\n2.  **Poincaré Symmetry**: This symmetry group includes Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) and spacetime translations. It is a foundational symmetry of quantum field theory, and therefore, all SMEFT operators must respect it.\n\n3.  **CP Symmetry**: CP (Charge Conjugation and Parity) symmetry is violated in the Standard Model itself, specifically by the weak interactions. The SMEFT is designed to parameterize both Standard Model effects and potential new physics, which may also violate CP symmetry. Consequently, not all operators in the SMEFT are required to conserve CP. In fact, there is significant interest in classifying and studying the CP-violating operators within the SMEFT framework.\n\n4.  **CPT Symmetry**: The CPT theorem states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian is invariant under the combined transformation of Charge Conjugation (C), Parity (P), and Time Reversal (T). Since SMEFT is constructed as a Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory, it must respect CPT symmetry. A violation of CPT would imply a violation of Lorentz invariance.\n\nTherefore, all operators in the SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\n<<<A>>>"
