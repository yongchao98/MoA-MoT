    "### Calculation Steps:\n\nTo determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we need to calculate the total mass for each binary system. The total mass (M) of a double-lined spectroscopic binary system can be derived from Kepler's Third Law and the definitions of radial velocity.\n\n1.  **Fundamental Relationship**: The total mass of a binary system (M = M₁ + M₂) is related to its orbital period (P) and the semi-major axis (a) by Kepler's Third Law:\n    M = (4π²a³) / (GP²)\n\n2.  **Radial Velocity and Semi-Major Axis**: The observed quantities are the amplitudes of the radial velocities (K₁ and K₂). For a circular orbit, the maximum velocities are related to the semi-major axes of the individual orbits (a₁ and a₂) and the period (P):\n    v₁ = 2πa₁ / P\n    v₂ = 2πa₂ / P\n\n3.  **Observed vs. True Velocity**: The radial velocity is the component of the orbital velocity along the line of sight, so K = v * sin(i), where 'i' is the orbital inclination. Since both systems are eclipsing, we can assume the inclination angle i ≈ 90°, which means sin(i) ≈ 1. Therefore, the radial velocity amplitudes (K) are approximately equal to the true orbital velocities (v).\n    K₁ ≈ v₁ and K₂ ≈ v₂\n\n4.  **Total Mass Formula**: From the relationships above, we can derive a formula for the total mass in terms of the observable quantities P, K₁, and K₂. The total mass M is proportional to the period multiplied by the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes.\n    M ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂ )³\n\n5.  **Calculate for System 1**:\n    *   Period (P₁) = 2 years\n    *   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_total₁) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n    *   M₁ ∝ 2 * (15)³ = 2 * 3375 = 6750\n\n6.  **Calculate for System 2**:\n    *   Period (P₂) = 1 year\n    *   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_total₂) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n    *   M₂ ∝ 1 * (25)³ = 1 * 15625 = 15625\n\n7.  **Determine the Ratio**: Now, we find the ratio of the mass of system_1 to the mass of system_2.\n    Ratio = M₁ / M₂ = 6750 / 15625\n\n8.  **Simplify the Fraction**:\n    Ratio = (2 * (15)³) / (1 * (25)³) = 2 * (15/25)³ = 2 * (3/5)³\n    Ratio = 2 * (27 / 125) = 54 / 125\n    Ratio = 0.432\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
