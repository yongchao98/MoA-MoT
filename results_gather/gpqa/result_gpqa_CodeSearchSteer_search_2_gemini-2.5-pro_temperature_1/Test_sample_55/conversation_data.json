    "The decay of a hydrogen atom from an initial state to a final state via dipole transitions is governed by a set of selection rules. This two-step transition from the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state must adhere to these rules at each step.\n\n### Analysis of the Transition Route\n\n**1. Dipole Transition Selection Rules:**\nFor a non-relativistic hydrogen atom, electric dipole transitions are subject to the following selection rules for the quantum numbers *l* (azimuthal or orbital angular momentum) and *m* (magnetic):\n*   **Δl = ±1**\n*   **Δm = 0, ±1**\n\nThe principal quantum number *n* must decrease for a decay process (n<sub>final</sub> < n<sub>initial</sub>).\n\n**2. First Transition: |3,0,0⟩ → Intermediate State |n',l',m'⟩**\n*   The initial state has *n*=3, *l*=0, and *m*=0.\n*   For the first decay step, *l* must change by ±1. Since *l*=0, the only possibility is **Δl = +1**, meaning the intermediate state must have **l' = 1**.\n*   The magnetic quantum number *m* can change by 0 or ±1. Since the initial *m*=0, the possible values for the intermediate state's magnetic quantum number are **m' = -1, 0, or 1**.\n*   The principal quantum number *n* must be less than 3. The options provided suggest an intermediate state with **n' = 2**.\n*   Combining these, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩.\n\n**3. Second Transition: Intermediate State |2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩**\n*   The final state is |1,0,0⟩, which has *l*=0.\n*   For the transition from the intermediate state (*l'*=1) to the final state (*l*=0), the change is **Δl = 0 - 1 = -1**. This is an allowed transition.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number, Δm = 0 - m', also satisfies the selection rules for all possible m' values (-1, 0, 1).\n*   Therefore, all three potential pathways are valid according to the selection rules.\n\n### Calculation of the Transition Probability\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific transition route. This corresponds to the branching ratio for that particular decay cascade.\n\n1.  **First Step Branching Ratio:** The decay starts from the |3,0,0⟩ state. This state is spherically symmetric (since *l*=0). Because of this symmetry, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the first photon. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three possible intermediate states: |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, or |2,1,1⟩. The total probability must be 1, so the probability of transitioning into any single one of these states is 1/3.\n\n2.  **Second Step Branching Ratio:** Once the atom is in one of the |2,1,m'⟩ states (a 2p orbital), it must decay to a lower energy level. The only state with *n*=1 that satisfies the Δl=±1 rule is the |1,0,0⟩ state (the 1s ground state). Decay to the |2,0,0⟩ state is forbidden. Therefore, the probability of the second step, |2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, is 1 for any of the three intermediate states.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe overall probability for any of the specific two-step decay routes is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n*   P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m'⟩) = 1/3\n*   P(|2,1,m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩) = 1\n\nThus, the probability for the specific route |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ is (1/3) * 1 = 1/3.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n*   A) Probability of 1/4 is incorrect.\n*   B) Route |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ with a probability of 1/3 is correct.\n*   C) Probability of 1/4 is incorrect.\n*   D) Probability of 2/3 is incorrect.\n\nThe correct transition route and probability are:\n$$ |3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{1}{3} $$\n\n<<<B>>>"
