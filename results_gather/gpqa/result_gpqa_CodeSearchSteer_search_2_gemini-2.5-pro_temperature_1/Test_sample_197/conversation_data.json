    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], we must first calculate its mole fraction relative to all cobalt-containing species in the solution. This can be done using the provided overall stability constants (β) and the concentration of the thiocyanate ligand ([SCN⁻]).\n\nThe cobalt-containing species in the solution are Co²⁺, [Co(SCN)]⁺, [Co(SCN)₂], [Co(SCN)₃]⁻, and [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻. The total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of these species.\n\nThe mole fraction (α₂) of the dithiocyanato complex is given by the formula:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nGiven the values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nWe can calculate the terms in the denominator:\n*   1\n*   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 × 0.1 = 0.9\n*   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4\n*   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 63 × 0.001 = 0.063\n*   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 16 × 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nThe sum of these terms (the denominator) is:\n1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThe numerator is the term corresponding to the dithiocyanato complex:\nβ₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4\n\nNow, we can calculate the mole fraction (α₂):\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 × 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex in the solution is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<D>>>"
