    "The reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in condensed ammonia is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate. The number of possible products is determined by the different pathways the reaction can take.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nSodium amide is a very strong base and initiates the reaction by removing a proton from a position ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two such positions:\n*   The deuterium (D) atom at carbon-2.\n*   The hydrogen (H) atom at carbon-6.\n\nBecause a carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond is weaker than a carbon-deuterium (C-D) bond, the removal of the hydrogen at C-6 is kinetically favored. However, since the question asks for all *possible* products, both deprotonation pathways must be considered.\n\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the hydrogen from C-6. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C-1 results in a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C-1 and C-6. This intermediate still contains the deuterium atom at C-2.\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C-2. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C-1 forms a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C-1 and C-2. This intermediate does not contain deuterium.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzynes**\n\nThe amide ion (NH2‚Åª) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent to yield the final aniline products.\n\n*   **Products from Pathway A (Deuterated Benzyne):**\n    *   If the amide attacks C-1, the final product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   If the amide attacks C-6, the final product is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from Pathway B (Non-deuterated Benzyne):**\n    *   Attack at either C-1 or C-2, followed by protonation with ammonia, results in the formation of **aniline** (with no deuterium).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nConsidering all possible pathways, three distinct organic products can be formed:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-deuterioaniline\n3.  3-deuterioaniline\n\nTherefore, there are three possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>"
