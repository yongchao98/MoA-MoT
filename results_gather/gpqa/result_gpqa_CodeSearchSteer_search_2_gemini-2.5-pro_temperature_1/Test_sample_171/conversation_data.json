    "To determine the correct equation, we must use the Boltzmann equation, which describes the relative populations of atomic energy levels in a gas in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n1.  **The Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms (N) in a higher energy state (b) to a lower energy state (a) is given by:\n\n    N_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-(E_b - E_a) / (k * T)]\n\n    Where:\n    *   `g_b` and `g_a` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the energy levels.\n    *   `E_b - E_a` (or ΔE) is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the temperature.\n\n2.  **Setting up the Ratios for Two Stars:** The problem states that the \"excitation\" in star 1 is twice that in star 2. This means the ratio of atoms in the excited state (let's call it level 'b') to a reference lower state (level 'a') is twice as large for star 1 as it is for star 2.\n\n    Let T_1 and T_2 be the temperatures of star 1 and star 2, respectively. We can write the population ratio for each star:\n    *   For Star 1: (N_b / N_a)_1 = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n    *   For Star 2: (N_b / N_a)_2 = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n3.  **Applying the Given Condition:** The problem states that (N_b / N_a)_1 = 2 * (N_b / N_a)_2. Substituting the Boltzmann expressions:\n\n    (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n    The statistical weights (g_b / g_a) cancel out:\n\n    exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n4.  **Solving for Temperature:** To solve for the temperatures, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\n    ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n\n    Using the properties of logarithms (ln(x*y) = ln(x) + ln(y) and ln(exp(x)) = x):\n\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\n    Now, rearrange the equation to isolate ln(2):\n\n    ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)\n\n    Factor out the common term (ΔE / k):\n\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n\n    Combine the terms in the parenthesis to get a common denominator:\n\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)]\n\n5.  **Using the Given Values:** The problem provides the energy difference ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J. The Boltzmann constant, k, is a fundamental physical constant with a defined value of approximately 1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n\n    Therefore, the ratio ΔE / k is:\n\n    ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 1 K\n\n6.  **Final Equation:** Substituting ΔE / k = 1 into our derived equation:\n\n    ln(2) = 1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n    This simplifies to:\n\n    ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n    This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
