    "Here is a step-by-step resolution of the problem:\n\n### 1. Calculation of the Minimum Volume of Acid\n\nFirst, we determine the amount of strong acid required to completely dissolve the iron(III) hydroxide. This involves a stoichiometric calculation based on the neutralization reaction.\n\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between iron(III) hydroxide, a base, and a strong monobasic acid (which provides H⁺ ions) is:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:** The molar mass is calculated by summing the atomic masses of its elements:\n    Molar Mass = 55.85 (Fe) + 3 × (16.00 (O) + 1.01 (H)) = 106.88 g/mol.\n\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:** We calculate the number of moles in 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃:\n    Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ Required:** From the stoichiometry of the reaction, 3 moles of H⁺ are needed for every mole of Fe(OH)₃:\n    Moles of H⁺ = 3 × 0.0009356 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol\n\n*   **Volume of Acid:** The acid has a concentration of 0.1 M (0.1 mol/L). The required volume is:\n    Volume (L) = Moles of H⁺ / Concentration = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L ≈ 0.02807 L\n    Volume (cm³) = 0.02807 L × 1000 cm³/L ≈ 28.07 cm³\n\nThis calculated volume is very close to the value of 28.05 cm³ provided in option C.\n\n### 2. Calculation of the pH of the Resulting Solution\n\nThe strong acid is completely consumed in dissolving the Fe(OH)₃. The resulting solution, with a total volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L), contains Fe³⁺ ions. These ions hydrolyze in water, producing H⁺ ions and making the solution acidic.\n\n*   **Concentration of Fe³⁺:** The concentration of Fe³⁺ in the final 100 cm³ solution is:\n    [Fe³⁺] = Moles of Fe³⁺ / Total Volume = 0.0009356 mol / 0.1 L ≈ 0.009356 M\n\n*   **Hydrolysis of Fe³⁺:** The aqueous Fe³⁺ ion acts as a weak acid:\n    Fe³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ Fe(OH)²⁺(aq) + H⁺(aq)\n\n*   **Equilibrium Calculation:** To find the pH, we need the acid dissociation constant (Ka) for this reaction. The pKa for the aqueous Fe³⁺ ion at 25°C is approximately 2.19, which corresponds to a Ka value of 10⁻².¹⁹ ≈ 6.46 × 10⁻³.\n\n    We set up an equilibrium expression:\n    Ka = [Fe(OH)²⁺][H⁺] / [Fe³⁺]\n\n    Let 'x' be the equilibrium concentration of H⁺. Then [H⁺] = x, [Fe(OH)²⁺] = x, and [Fe³⁺] = 0.009356 - x.\n\n    6.46 × 10⁻³ = x² / (0.009356 - x)\n\n    This requires solving a quadratic equation:\n    x² + (6.46 × 10⁻³)x - (6.04 × 10⁻⁵) = 0\n\n    Solving for x (using the quadratic formula) gives a positive root of approximately x ≈ 0.00517 M.\n\n*   **pH Calculation:** The pH is the negative logarithm of the H⁺ concentration:\n    pH = -log₁₀([H⁺]) = -log₁₀(0.00517) ≈ 2.29\n\nThis calculated pH of 2.29 is different from the value of 2.04 in option C. However, given that the calculated volume of acid (28.07 cm³) so closely matches option C (28.05 cm³), it is the most plausible choice among the options. The discrepancy in pH may arise from slight variations in the Ka value used or potential simplifications in the problem's intended solution method. Comparing our results with the given options, option C remains the best fit.\n\n<<<C>>>"
