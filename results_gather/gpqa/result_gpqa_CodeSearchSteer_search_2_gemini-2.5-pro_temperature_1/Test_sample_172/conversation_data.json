    "To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy (ΔE) of the electron, we will use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\n**1. Identify Given Information:**\n*   Uncertainty in the electron's position (Δx) = 0.1 nm = 0.1 x 10⁻⁹ m = 10⁻¹⁰ m.\n*   Velocity of the electron (v) = 2 x 10⁸ m/s.\n\n**2. Principle and Formulas:**\nThe problem can be solved by relating the uncertainty in position (Δx) to the uncertainty in momentum (Δp), and then relating the uncertainty in momentum to the uncertainty in energy (ΔE).\n\n*   **Position-Momentum Uncertainty Principle:** This principle states that the product of the uncertainties in position and momentum is at least a certain minimum value. The mathematical relation is:\n    Δx Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h/2π), approximately 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s. For minimum uncertainty, we use the equality.\n\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** Since the electron's speed (2 x 10⁸ m/s) is a significant fraction of the speed of light (c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s), relativistic effects are important. The relationship between energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m₀) is given by:\n    E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp).**\n    Using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for minimum uncertainty:\n    Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx)\n    Δp = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 * 10⁻¹⁰ m)\n    Δp ≈ 5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s\n\n*   **Step 2: Relate the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) to the uncertainty in momentum (Δp).**\n    We can find the relationship by differentiating the energy-momentum equation with respect to momentum:\n    d(E²)/dp = d((pc)² + (m₀c²)²)/dp\n    2E (dE/dp) = 2pc²\n    dE/dp = pc² / E\n\n    From special relativity, we also know that E = γm₀c² and p = γm₀v, where γ is the Lorentz factor. Dividing p by E gives p/E = v/c².\n    Substituting this into the derivative:\n    dE/dp = (p/E) * c² = (v/c²) * c² = v\n\n    For small uncertainties, we can approximate the relationship as:\n    ΔE ≈ (dE/dp) * Δp = v * Δp\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE).**\n    Now, substitute the known values of v and the calculated Δp:\n    ΔE = (2 x 10⁸ m/s) * (5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s)\n    ΔE ≈ 10.54 x 10⁻¹⁷ J\n    ΔE ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\n**4. Conclusion:**\nThe calculated minimum uncertainty in energy is approximately 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J. This value is closest to 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\nB) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\nC) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\nD) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
