    "A dominant-negative mutation produces an altered protein that not only loses its own function but also interferes with the function of the wild-type protein produced from the normal allele. In this scenario, the transcription factor must form a dimer to become active.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the situation with mutation Y:\n*   **Location of Mutation:** The mutation (Y) is in the dimerization domain.\n*   **Proteins Present:** In a heterozygous individual, the cell produces both normal (wild-type) and mutant (Y) protein subunits.\n*   **Interaction:** The mutant Y protein can still interact with the wild-type protein to form a dimer because its dimerization domain is what's involved in this process. However, the resulting wild-type/mutant heterodimer is non-functional. This \"poisons\" the complex.\n*   **Outcome:** The formation of these non-functional heterodimers effectively sequesters the functional wild-type protein, preventing it from forming functional wild-type/wild-type homodimers. This leads to an overall loss of the transcription factor's function, even though a normal allele is present.\n*   **Cellular Response:** Misfolded or improperly assembled protein complexes, such as the non-functional heterodimers, are often recognized by the cell's quality control machinery and targeted for degradation by the proteasome.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n*   A) protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype: While a loss-of-function is correct, aggregation is a specific type of misfolding and not the most direct consequence. Interference followed by degradation is a more common mechanism.\n*   B) change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype: This is incorrect. A dominant-negative mutation results in a loss-of-function phenotype.\n*   C) protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele: This option accurately describes the molecular events. The formation of non-functional dimers containing the mutant protein leads to their degradation, which effectively removes the wild-type protein from its functional role, thus causing a \"loss-of-function of the wild-type allele\" at the protein level.\n*   D) loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype: This is incorrect because a dominant-negative mutation results in a mutant, not a wild-type, phenotype.\n\nTherefore, the most likely molecular phenotype involves the degradation of the protein complexes and a functional loss of the wild-type protein's activity.\n\n<<<C>>>"
