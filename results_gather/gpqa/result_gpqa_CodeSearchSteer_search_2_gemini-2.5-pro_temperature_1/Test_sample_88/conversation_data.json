    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded hydrogen atom.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of Product 1\n\n1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with an excess of potassium hydroxide (KOH) at 240°C. This reaction, under harsh basic conditions, causes a fragmentation of the adamantane cage. The resulting light yellow solid (Product 1) has an IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a ketone. The subsequent reaction steps provide crucial clues to its structure. The fact that an ozonolysis is performed in Step 3 indicates that the molecule must contain a carbon-carbon double bond.\n\nThe provided ¹H NMR spectrum (4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H)) shows 14 protons in total, matching the number of protons in the starting 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂). The formula of the product is therefore C₁₀H₁₄O. The signal at 4.79 ppm is in the vinylic region and corresponds to two protons, suggesting a =CH₂ (exocyclic methylene) group.\n\nBased on these data, Product 1 is identified as **4-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-2-one**. This structure is consistent with all the provided information:\n*   **Formula:** C₁₀H₁₄O\n*   **Functionality:** Contains a ketone (IR: 1720 cm⁻¹) and an alkene (ozonolysis reactant).\n*   **¹H NMR:** The two vinylic protons of the =CH₂ group account for the signal at 4.79 ppm.\n\n### Step 2: Identification of Product 2\n\nProduct 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide. This reagent is used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which selectively reduces aldehydes and ketones to alcohols. Therefore, the ketone group in Product 1 is reduced to a hydroxyl group, while the double bond remains unchanged.\n\nProduct 2 is **4-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-2-ol**.\n\n### Step 3: Identification of Product 3\n\nProduct 2 is subjected to ozonolysis (O₃ at -78°C) followed by a reductive workup with dimethyl sulfide (DMS). Ozonolysis cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds. The exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) of Product 2 is cleaved to form a ketone at the C4 position of the ring.\n\nProduct 3 is **2-hydroxybicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-4-one**.\n\n### Step 4: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3\n\nThe final step is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in Product 3 (excluding the exchangeable -OH proton).\n\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** In Product 3 (2-hydroxybicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-4-one), the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton is the one attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (the carbinol proton). This is the proton at position C2 (H2). Its chemical shift is typically in the range of 3.5-4.5 ppm, which is more deshielded than the protons alpha to the ketone (at C3 and C5, ~2.2-2.7 ppm).\n\n*   **Coupling of H2:** To determine the splitting pattern of H2, we must identify its neighboring protons. H2 is on C2, which is adjacent to the bridgehead carbon C1 and the methylene carbon C3.\n    *   H2 is coupled to the single proton at C1 (H1).\n    *   H2 is coupled to the two diastereotopic protons at C3 (let's call them H3a and H3b).\n\n*   **Conformation and J-Coupling:** The bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane system typically adopts a stable double-chair conformation. The reduction of the ketone in Step 2 is expected to yield the thermodynamically more stable equatorial alcohol, which means the corresponding proton (H2) is in the axial position.\n    1.  **Coupling to H3 protons:** An axial H2 will have a large *trans-diaxial* coupling (J ≈ 10-13 Hz) to the axial proton at C3 (H3a) due to a ~180° dihedral angle. It will have a small *axial-equatorial* coupling (J ≈ 2-4 Hz) to the equatorial proton at C3 (H3b) due to a ~60° dihedral angle.\n    2.  **Coupling to H1 proton:** The coupling between H2 (axial) and the bridgehead H1 will also be small (J ≈ 2-4 Hz), as their dihedral angle is also approximately 60°.\n\n*   **Resulting Pattern:** The signal for H2 is first split into a large **doublet** by the large coupling to the axial H3a. Then, each peak of this doublet is further split by two protons (H3b and H1) which have similar, small coupling constants. Coupling to two protons with similar J-values results in a **triplet**. Therefore, the overall pattern for the H2 signal is a **doublet of triplets (dt)**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
