    "To determine the geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space, we need to find its corresponding Bloch vector, often denoted as **r** = (rx, ry, rz).\n\nThe given density matrix is:\nρ = ½ (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)\n\nAny density matrix for a single qubit can be expressed in terms of the identity matrix (I) and the Pauli matrices (σx, σy, σz) using the Bloch vector **r**:\nρ = ½ (I + **r** ⋅ **σ**)\n\nwhere:\n*   I = [,]\n*   σx = [,]\n*   σy = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n*   σz = [, [0, -1]]\n\nFirst, let's write the given density matrix in its matrix form. The basis states are:\n*   |0⟩ =ᵀ, so |0⟩⟨0| = [,]\n*   |1⟩ =ᵀ, so |1⟩⟨1| = [,]\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for ρ:\nρ = ½ ([,] + [,])\nρ = ½ [,]\nThis is ½ times the identity matrix, I.\n\nThis state is known as the maximally mixed state. For this state, the Bloch vector is at the origin of the Bloch sphere.\n\nWe can also find the components of the Bloch vector **r** using the formula:\nri = Tr(ρ ⋅ σi) for i = x, y, z.\n\nLet's calculate each component:\n*   **rx** = Tr(ρ ⋅ σx) = Tr( (½ * I) ⋅ σx) = ½ Tr(σx) = ½ Tr([,]) = ½(0 + 0) = 0.\n*   **ry** = Tr(ρ ⋅ σy) = Tr( (½ * I) ⋅ σy) = ½ Tr(σy) = ½ Tr([[0, -i], [i, 0]]) = ½(0 + 0) = 0.\n*   **rz** = Tr(ρ ⋅ σz) = Tr( (½ * I) ⋅ σz) = ½ Tr(σz) = ½ Tr([, [0, -1]]) = ½(1 - 1) = 0.\n\nThus, the Bloch vector is **r** = (0, 0, 0). This corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere, representing a completely unpolarized or maximally mixed state.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) r=(1,1,0)\nB) r=(1,1,1)\nC) r=(0,0,1)\nD) r=(0,0,0)\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
