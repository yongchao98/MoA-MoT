    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2.\n\n**1. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates into space. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n\nWhere:\n*   `T_star` is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   `R_star` is the radius of the star.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo (the fraction of light it reflects).\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe want to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = [T_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [T_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star (so `T_star` and `R_star` are the same) and have the same albedo (A1 = A2). Therefore, most terms cancel out:\n\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt( (R_star / (2 * a1)) * (2 * a2 / R_star) )\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nThe problem now reduces to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes of the two planets.\n\n**2. Relating Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters**\n\nThe periodic Doppler shift (Δλ) in the star's spectrum is caused by the star's motion as it's pulled by the orbiting planet. The magnitude of this shift is related to the star's maximum radial velocity (K) by:\n\nK = c * (Δλ / λ₀)\n\nwhere `c` is the speed of light and `λ₀` is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's maximum radial velocity (K), assuming we are viewing the system edge-on (inclination i ≈ 90°, so sin(i) ≈ 1), is given by:\n\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * v_p\n\nwhere `M_p` is the planet's mass, `M_star` is the star's mass, and `v_p` is the planet's orbital velocity. The planet's orbital velocity is `v_p = sqrt(G * M_star / a)`. Substituting this in gives:\n\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) = M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n\nThe detection of the planets via the transit method confirms that the orbits are nearly edge-on, making the sin(i) ≈ 1 assumption valid.\n\n**3. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**\n\nWe can rearrange the formula for K to solve for the semi-major axis, `a`:\n\nK² ≈ M_p² * (G / (M_star * a))\na ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\nNow we can find the ratio a2 / a1:\n\n(a2 / a1) = [ (G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K2²) ] / [ (G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K1²) ]\n\nThe terms for the gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) cancel out:\n\n(a2 / a1) = (M_p2² / K2²) * (K1² / M_p1²)\n(a2 / a1) = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²\n\nThe ratio of the radial velocities (K1 / K2) is directly proportional to the ratio of their Doppler shifts (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂):\n\n(K1 / K2) = (c * Δλ₁ / λ₀) / (c * Δλ₂ / λ₀) = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3 / 4\n\nWe are given the planet masses: M_p1 = 7 M_earth and M_p2 = 5 M_earth.\n\n(M_p2 / M_p1) = 5 / 7\n\nNow, substitute these ratios back into the equation for a2 / a1:\n\n(a2 / a1) = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)²\n(a2 / a1) = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\n(a2 / a1) = 225 / 784\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\n\nFinally, we substitute the ratio of the semi-major axes back into our temperature ratio equation:\n\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(225 / 784)\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = 15 / 28\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>"
