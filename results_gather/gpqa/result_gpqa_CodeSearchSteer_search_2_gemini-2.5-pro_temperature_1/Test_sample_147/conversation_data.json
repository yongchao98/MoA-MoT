    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from Substance A2.**\n    The problem states that A2 is a binary fluoride of element Y and has a mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ, where n is the number of fluorine atoms and Y is the unknown element.\n\n    The mass fraction of fluorine can be expressed as:\n    ɷF = (n * Ar(F)) / (Ar(Y) + n * Ar(F))\n\n    Using the atomic weight of Fluorine (Ar(F) ≈ 19 g/mol) and the given mass fraction (0.3196):\n    0.3196 = (n * 19) / (Ar(Y) + n * 19)\n    0.3196 * Ar(Y) + 0.3196 * 19n = 19n\n    0.3196 * Ar(Y) + 6.0724n = 19n\n    0.3196 * Ar(Y) = 12.9276n\n    Ar(Y) = (12.9276 / 0.3196) * n ≈ 40.45n\n\n    We need to find an integer `n` (a plausible oxidation state for an element Y) that gives a realistic atomic weight Ar(Y).\n    *   If n=1, Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (similar to Ca, but CaF is not a stable compound).\n    *   If n=2, Ar(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (similar to Br or Se).\n    *   If n=3, Ar(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (very close to Antimony, Sb, with Ar(Sb) = 121.76 g/mol).\n    *   If n=4, Ar(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (similar to Dy, a lanthanide).\n    *   If n=5, Ar(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (similar to Hg, Tl, Pb).\n    *   If n=6, Ar(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (very close to Plutonium, Pu, with Ar(Pu) ≈ 244 g/mol).\n\n2.  **Verify the best candidates for Y.**\n    Let's check the theoretical mass fraction of fluorine for the most promising candidates:\n    *   **If Y = Sb and n = 3 (A2 = SbF₃):**\n        ɷF(SbF₃) = (3 * 19) / (121.76 + 3 * 19) = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188 (31.88%). This is extremely close to the given 31.96%.\n    *   **If Y = Pu and n = 6 (A2 = PuF₆):**\n        ɷF(PuF₆) = (6 * 19) / (244 + 6 * 19) = 114 / 358 ≈ 0.3184 (31.84%). This is also very close.\n\n3.  **Use other clues to distinguish between Sb and Pu.**\n    *   The problem states \"A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 ... and fluorine.\" This means A1 has a higher fluorine content than A2 (A1 → A2 + F₂).\n    *   If Y = Pu, then A2 = PuF₆. A1 would have to be a fluoride with more than 6 fluorine atoms (e.g., PuF₇ or PuF₈), which are not known to exist as stable compounds. This makes Plutonium an unlikely candidate.\n    *   If Y = Sb, then A2 = SbF₃. A1 could be SbF₅, which has a higher fluorine content. The decomposition would be SbF₅ → SbF₃ + F₂.\n\n    While the properties of A1 (bright-red, decomposes at 293 K) do not perfectly match those of SbF₅ (which is a colorless, stable liquid), the existence of a higher fluoride is chemically sound. Other clues in the problem are often more reliable than physical properties which can be misstated. The mass fraction calculation strongly points to Antimony (Sb).\n\n4.  **Identify Substance A4.**\n    Let's assume Y is Antimony (Sb). The known binary fluorides of antimony are SbF₃ and SbF₅. These, along with potential polymeric or complex forms, would constitute the \"five binary compounds\". Substance A4 must be one of these. The question asks for the range of the molecular weight of A4.\n\n    Let's calculate the molecular weights of the known antimony fluorides:\n    *   **MW(SbF₃):** 121.76 + 3 * 19 = 178.76 g/mol.\n    *   **MW(SbF₅):** 121.76 + 5 * 19 = 216.76 g/mol.\n\n5.  **Match the Molecular Weight with the given ranges.**\n    *   A) 160-180\n    *   B) 140-160\n    *   C) 110-130\n    *   D) 220-240\n\n    The molecular weight of SbF₃ (178.76 g/mol) falls perfectly within range A (160-180).\n    The molecular weight of SbF₅ (216.76 g/mol) does not fit well into any range, although it is closest to range D.\n\n    Based on the perfect fit of MW(SbF₃) into range A, it is highly probable that A4 is SbF₃. The other descriptive parts of the problem (e.g., the 1:1 reaction stoichiometry) might be flawed or intended to be misleading, which is common in complex chemical puzzles. The numerical data (mass fraction and molecular weight) provide the most direct path to the solution.\n\nTherefore, the substance A4 is SbF₃, and its molecular weight is approximately 178.76 g/mol, which falls in the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<A>>>"
