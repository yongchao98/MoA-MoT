    "To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X, we need to calculate its lifetime in the laboratory frame and its velocity.\n\n### 1. Calculation of the Proper Lifetime (τ)\n\nThe proper lifetime (τ) of a particle is related to its decay width (Γ) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:\nτ = ħ / Γ\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nThe given decay width is Γ = 320 MeV.\nA useful value for the reduced Planck constant in particle physics is ħc ≈ 197.3 MeV·fm (where c is the speed of light and fm is a femtometer, 10⁻¹⁵ m).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the proper lifetime in natural units (inverse energy):\nτ = ħ / Γ\n\n### 2. Calculation of the Lorentz Factor (γ)\n\nThe Lorentz factor (γ) accounts for time dilation due to the particle's relativistic speed. It is the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass energy (m*c²):\nγ = E / (m*c²)\n\nGiven:\n*   Total energy, E_X = 8 GeV = 8000 MeV\n*   Rest mass energy, m_X*c² = 1.2 GeV = 1200 MeV\n\nγ = 8000 MeV / 1200 MeV = 80 / 12 = 20 / 3 ≈ 6.667\n\n### 3. Calculation of the Velocity (v)\n\nThe velocity of the particle is related to the Lorentz factor. We can express this using β = v/c:\nβ = √(1 - 1/γ²)\nβ = √(1 - 1 / (20/3)²) = √(1 - 9/400) = √(391/400) ≈ 0.98867\n\nAlternatively, we can use the relativistic momentum (p). The momentum can be found from the energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²\n(pc)² = E² - (mc²)²\n(pc)² = (8 GeV)² - (1.2 GeV)² = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 GeV²\npc = √62.56 GeV ≈ 7.909 GeV\n\nThe factor γβ can be calculated as:\nγβ = p / (mc) = (pc) / (mc²) = 7.909 GeV / 1.2 GeV ≈ 6.591\n\n### 4. Calculation of the Mean Decay Distance (d)\n\nThe mean decay distance in the laboratory frame is given by the formula d = γ * v * τ = γ * β * c * τ.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for τ and γβ:\nd = γβ * c * (ħ / Γ) = γβ * (ħc / Γ)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n*   γβ ≈ 6.591\n*   ħc ≈ 197.3 MeV·fm\n*   Γ = 320 MeV\n\nd ≈ 6.591 * (197.3 MeV·fm / 320 MeV)\nd ≈ 6.591 * 0.6166 fm\nd ≈ 4.0655 fm\n\nSince 1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.0655 * 10⁻¹⁵ m.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\nFinal check of the calculation using a more precise formula to avoid intermediate rounding:\nd = (ħc / Γ) * (√(E² - (mc²)²) / (mc²))\nd = (197.327 MeV·fm / 320 MeV) * (√((8000 MeV)² - (1200 MeV)²) / 1200 MeV)\nd = (0.616647 fm) * (√(64,000,000 - 1,440,000) / 1200)\nd = (0.616647 fm) * (√62,560,000 / 1200)\nd = (0.616647 fm) * (7909.488 / 1200)\nd = (0.616647 fm) * 6.59124\nd ≈ 4.06455 * 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\nThe calculation confirms the result.\n\n<<<D>>>"
