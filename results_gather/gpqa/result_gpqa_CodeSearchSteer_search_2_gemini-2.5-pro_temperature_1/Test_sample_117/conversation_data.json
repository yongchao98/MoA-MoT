    "The reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine (Br₂) is an example of α-halogenation of a ketone through its enol intermediate. Enols, which contain a carbon-carbon double bond adjacent to a hydroxyl group, are electron-rich and readily react with electrophiles like bromine.\n\nThe mechanism proceeds as follows:\n1.  The electron-rich double bond of the enol attacks a bromine molecule (Br₂).\n2.  This leads to the formation of a resonance-stabilized intermediate and a bromide ion.\n3.  The intermediate then loses a proton from the oxygen atom, which reforms the stable carbonyl group (C=O).\n\nIn this specific reaction, the starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. The double bond is between carbon 1 (C1, bearing the -OH group) and carbon 2 (C2). The bromine adds to the α-carbon (C2), and the enol hydroxyl group at C1 is converted into a ketone. This results in the formation of 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.\n\nThe alternative products are less likely:\n*   **A) and B) (1R,2R)- and (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol:** These would be the products of simple electrophilic addition across the double bond without the involvement of the enol functionality. However, the formation of a highly stable carbonyl group is a strong thermodynamic driving force, making the α-halogenation pathway dominant.\n*   **C) 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone:** This product would require bromination at the C4 position, which is a quaternary carbon atom and not activated for this type of reaction.\n\nTherefore, the major product is the α-bromoketone.\n\n<<<D>>>"
