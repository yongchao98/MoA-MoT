    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the mass dimension of κ and the renormalizability of the theory described by the interaction Lagrangian $\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\n\n### Step 1: Mass Dimension of the Lagrangian Density\n\nIn natural units (where $\\hbar = c = 1$), the action $S = \\int d^4x \\, \\mathcal{L}$ is dimensionless. The spacetime volume element $d^4x$ has a mass dimension of [M]⁻⁴, since position and time have dimensions of inverse mass. For the action to be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ must have a mass dimension of [M]⁴.\n\n### Step 2: Mass Dimension of the Fields and Operators\n\nWe need to find the mass dimension of each component in the interaction term: $\\bar{\\psi}$, $\\psi$, $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$, and $F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\n\n*   **Fermion Field ($\\psi$ and $\\bar{\\psi}$):** The kinetic term for a Dirac fermion is $\\mathcal{L}_{Dirac} = \\bar{\\psi}(i\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu - m)\\psi$. For the term $\\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu\\psi$ to have a mass dimension of 4, and knowing the derivative $\\partial_\\mu$ has a mass dimension of 1, we can deduce the dimension of the fermion field.\n    *   $[\\bar{\\psi}] + [\\psi] + [\\partial_\\mu] = 4$\n    *   $2[\\psi] + 1 = 4$\n    *   $2[\\psi] = 3 \\implies [\\psi] = [\\bar{\\psi}] = 3/2$.\n\n*   **Electromagnetic Field Strength Tensor ($F^{\\mu\\nu}$):** The Lagrangian for the electromagnetic field is $\\mathcal{L}_{EM} = -\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$. This must have a mass dimension of 4.\n    *   $2[F^{\\mu\\nu}] = 4 \\implies [F^{\\mu\\nu}] = 2$.\n    *   Alternatively, since $F^{\\mu\\nu} = \\partial^\\mu A^\\nu - \\partial^\\nu A^\\mu$, and the photon field $A^\\mu$ has a mass dimension of 1, the dimension of $F^{\\mu\\nu}$ is $[\\partial] + [A] = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n*   **Sigma Tensor ($\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$):** This is defined as $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{i}{2}[\\gamma_\\mu, \\gamma_\\nu]$, where $\\gamma_\\mu$ are the Dirac gamma matrices. These matrices are dimensionless. Therefore, $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$ is also dimensionless.\n\n### Step 3: Mass Dimension of the Coupling Constant ($\\kappa$)\n\nNow we use the fact that the interaction term $\\mathcal{L}_{int}$ must have a mass dimension of 4.\n*   $[\\mathcal{L}_{int}] = [\\kappa] + [\\bar{\\psi}] + [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] + [\\psi] + [F^{\\mu\\nu}] = 4$\n*   Substituting the dimensions we found: $[\\kappa] + 3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2 = 4$\n*   $[\\kappa] + 3 + 2 = 4$\n*   $[\\kappa] + 5 = 4$\n*   $[\\kappa] = -1$\n\nThe mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$ is -1.\n\n### Step 4: Renormalizability of the Theory\n\nA key criterion for determining if a theory is renormalizable by power counting is the mass dimension of its coupling constants.\n*   If a coupling constant has a **positive** mass dimension, the interaction is called \"super-renormalizable\".\n*   If a coupling constant has a **zero** mass dimension (it is dimensionless), the interaction is \"renormalizable\".\n*   If a coupling constant has a **negative** mass dimension, the interaction is \"non-renormalizable\".\n\nIn this case, the coupling constant $\\kappa$ has a mass dimension of -1. A negative mass dimension implies that at higher orders of perturbation theory (in loop calculations), the divergences become progressively worse. To cancel these infinities, an infinite number of counterterms would be required, which renders the theory non-predictive at high energies and thus, non-renormalizable.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
