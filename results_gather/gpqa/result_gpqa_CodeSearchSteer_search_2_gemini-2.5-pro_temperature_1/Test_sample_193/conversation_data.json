    "To find the partition function Z for the system of three spins S1, S2, and S3, we must sum the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), over all possible states of the system. Each spin can take a value of +1 or -1, leading to a total of 2^3 = 8 possible configurations.\n\nThe energy of the system is given by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]\n\nWe need to calculate the energy for each of the 8 possible spin configurations.\n\n1.  **All spins are the same:**\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1):\n        E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1):\n        E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n    There are **2 states** with an energy of **-3J**.\n\n2.  **One spin is different from the other two:**\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, -1):\n        E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, +1):\n        E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, +1):\n        E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, +1):\n        E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, -1):\n        E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, -1):\n        E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    There are **6 states** with an energy of **J**.\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum over all states, which can be grouped by their energy and degeneracy (the number of states with the same energy).\n\nZ = (Number of states with energy E1) * e^(-βE1) + (Number of states with energy E2) * e^(-βE2)\n\nIn this system, we have two energy levels:\n*   E1 = -3J with a degeneracy (g1) of 2.\n*   E2 = J with a degeneracy (g2) of 6.\n\nSubstituting these values into the partition function formula:\nZ = g1 * e^(-βE1) + g2 * e^(-βE2)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
