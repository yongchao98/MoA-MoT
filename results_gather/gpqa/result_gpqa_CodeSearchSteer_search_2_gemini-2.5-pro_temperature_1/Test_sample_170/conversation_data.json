    "To arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic substitution reaction with bromine, we need to analyze the directing effects and steric hindrance of each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n### **Analysis of Substituents**\n\nThe six substances and their substituents are:\n1.  **C6H5-CH3** (Toluene): `-CH3` (methyl) is an activating, ortho-, para-directing group.\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5** (Ethyl benzoate): `-COOC2H5` (carboethoxy) is a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n3.  **C6H5-Cl** (Chlorobenzene): `-Cl` (chloro) is a deactivating, ortho-, para-directing group.\n4.  **C6H5-NO2** (Nitrobenzene): `-NO2` (nitro) is a strongly deactivating, meta-directing group.\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5** (Ethylbenzene): `-C2H5` (ethyl) is an activating, ortho-, para-directing group.\n6.  **C6H5-COOH** (Benzoic acid): `-COOH` (carboxyl) is a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n\n### **Categorizing by Directing Effect**\n\nThe yield of the para-isomer is primarily determined by whether the substituent is meta-directing or ortho-, para-directing.\n\n*   **Meta-Directors**: These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the meta position. The formation of the para-isomer is heavily disfavored and occurs in very small amounts.\n    *   `-NO2` (4)\n    *   `-COOC2H5` (2)\n    *   `-COOH` (6)\n\n*   **Ortho-, Para-Directors**: These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. Significant amounts of the para-isomer will be formed.\n    *   `-CH3` (1)\n    *   `-C2H5` (5)\n    *   `-Cl` (3)\n\n### **Ranking the Substances**\n\n**1. Meta-Directors (Lowest para-isomer yield)**\n\nThese three substances will have the lowest yield of the para-isomer. The order among them depends on their deactivating strength and any minor electronic or steric factors influencing the small amount of para-product.\n*   The `-NO2` group is one of the strongest deactivating groups. During its bromination, the para-isomer yield is extremely low, often less than 1%.\n*   The `-COOH` and `-COOC2H5` groups are also deactivating and meta-directing. For the nitration of ethyl benzoate, the para-isomer is about 5%. For benzoic acid, the para-isomer yield is also very low, typically around 1-2%. Comparing the deactivating strength, the order is generally `-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5`. Stronger deactivation leads to a more pronounced meta-direction and thus a lower fraction of para-product.\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-yield for the meta-directors is:\n**4 (`-NO2`) < 2 (`-COOC2H5`) < 6 (`-COOH`)**\n*(Note: Some sources might show slight variations, but they will consistently be the lowest).*\n\n**2. Ortho-, Para-Directors (Highest para-isomer yield)**\n\nFor these substances, the ratio of para to ortho product determines their order. This is mainly influenced by steric hindrance: a bulkier substituent will block the ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher proportion of the para-isomer.\n*   **-CH3 (1, Toluene) vs. -C2H5 (5, Ethylbenzene)**: The ethyl group is sterically bulkier than the methyl group. This increased bulk hinders the attack at the ortho positions, resulting in a higher yield of the para-isomer for ethylbenzene compared to toluene. For example, during bromination, toluene yields about 67% para-isomer, while ethylbenzene will yield more due to greater steric hindrance.\n*   **-Cl (3, Chlorobenzene)**: The chloro group is ortho-, para-directing. Due to its high electronegativity (inductive effect) and its ability to donate a lone pair of electrons (resonance effect), it strongly favors the para position. The bromination of chlorobenzene yields a very high proportion of the para-isomer, around 87-89%.\n\nComparing the three ortho-, para-directors:\n*   Toluene (**1**) has the smallest alkyl group and thus the lowest para/ortho ratio among the alkylbenzenes.\n*   Ethylbenzene (**5**) has a larger alkyl group, leading to a higher para/ortho ratio than toluene.\n*   Chlorobenzene (**3**) yields a very high percentage of the para-isomer, higher than both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n\nThus, the order of increasing para-yield for the ortho-, para-directors is:\n**1 (`-CH3`) < 5 (`-C2H5`) < 3 (`-Cl`)**\n\n### **Final Combined Order**\n\nCombining the two groups, we get the final sequence for increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n\n**4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5**\n\nWait, re-evaluating the order based on literature values.\n\n*   (4) Nitrobenzene: < 1% para\n*   (2) Ethyl Benzoate: ~5% para (from nitration data, as a proxy)\n*   (6) Benzoic Acid: ~1-2% para\n*   (1) Toluene: ~67% para\n*   (5) Ethylbenzene: >67% para (higher than toluene due to sterics)\n*   (3) Chlorobenzene: ~87% para\n\nLet's refine the order based on these values:\n1.  **Nitrobenzene (4)**: ~1%\n2.  **Benzoic Acid (6)**: ~1-2%\n3.  **Ethyl Benzoate (2)**: ~5%\n4.  **Toluene (1)**: ~67%\n5.  **Ethylbenzene (5)**: >67%\n6.  **Chlorobenzene (3)**: ~87%\n\nThis gives the order: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nLet's recheck the options provided. The order derived (4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3) matches option A.\n\nFinal check of the reasoning.\n- Meta directors (4, 6, 2) have the lowest para yield. The order among them is based on the degree of deactivation and meta-direction. NO2 is the strongest meta-director, giving the least para. Between COOH and COOC2H5, the difference is small, but the order 4 < 6 < 2 seems plausible.\n- Ortho-para directors (1, 5, 3) have high para yields. The order among them is based on steric and electronic effects. The para/ortho ratio increases with the steric bulk of the alkyl group, so 1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5). Halogens like Cl give a particularly high percentage of the para product, often higher than alkylbenzenes. So, 1 < 5 < 3 is correct.\n- Combining them, the lowest yields are from the meta directors, and the highest are from the o,p directors.\n\nTherefore, the complete sequence is 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3.\n\n<<<A>>>"
