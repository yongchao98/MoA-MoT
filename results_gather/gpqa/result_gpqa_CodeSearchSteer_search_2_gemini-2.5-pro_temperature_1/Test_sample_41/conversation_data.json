    "To solve this problem, we need to relate the planets' equilibrium temperatures to their orbital periods. This involves two key physical principles: the formula for equilibrium temperature and Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion. The information about the planets' masses and the TTV discovery method is not needed for this calculation.\n\n### Step 1: Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates. For a planet in a circular orbit, this temperature is related to its distance (d) from the star. The key relationship, assuming the planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, is that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance.\n\nThis can be expressed as:\nT_eq ∝ 1 / √d\n\nFrom this, we can establish a relationship for the orbital distance:\nd ∝ 1 / T_eq²\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Distances\n\nWe can use the given ratios of the equilibrium temperatures to find the ratios of the orbital distances for the planets.\n\n*   **For Planet 1 and Planet 2:** The ratio of their equilibrium temperatures is T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 1.4. The ratio of their orbital distances is:\n    d2 / d1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2)² = 1.4² = 1.96\n\n*   **For Planet 2 and Planet 3:** The ratio of their equilibrium temperatures is T_eq2 / T_eq3 ≈ 2.3. The ratio of their orbital distances is:\n    d3 / d2 = (T_eq2 / T_eq3)² = 2.3² = 5.29\n\nTo find the ratio of the orbital distance of Planet 3 to Planet 1 (d3 / d1), we multiply the two intermediate ratios:\nd3 / d1 = (d3 / d2) * (d2 / d1) = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684\n\n### Step 3: Use Kepler's Third Law to Find the Orbital Period Ratio\n\nKepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (which is the orbital distance 'd' for a circular orbit). This can be written as:\nP² ∝ d³\n\nTherefore, the period is proportional to the distance to the power of 3/2:\nP ∝ d^(3/2)\n\nNow we can calculate the ratio of the orbital periods for Planet 3 and Planet 1:\nP3 / P1 = (d3 / d1)^(3/2)\n\nSubstituting the value we found for the distance ratio:\nP3 / P1 = (10.3684)^(1.5)\n\nCalculating this value:\nP3 / P1 ≈ 33.38\n\nThis result is approximately 33.4, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
