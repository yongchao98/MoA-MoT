    "The minimum energy of the system of 13 charged particles is determined by the principles of electrostatic potential energy. The total energy is the sum of the potential energies between all pairs of particles.\n\nThe system consists of:\n*   A central charge, q_c = 2e, fixed at point P.\n*   12 charges, q_s = 2e, constrained to a distance r = 2 m from P.\n\nThe total potential energy (U_total) can be divided into two components:\n1.  **U_central**: The interaction energy between the central charge and the 12 charges on the sphere.\n2.  **U_sphere**: The interaction energy among the 12 charges on the sphere themselves.\n\nTo find the *minimum* energy of the system, the 12 charges on the sphere must arrange themselves to minimize their mutual repulsion. This classic physics problem is known as the Thomson problem. For 12 charges, the configuration of minimum energy is when the particles are located at the vertices of a regular icosahedron.\n\nThe total energy calculation is as follows:\n\n**1. Interaction with the Central Charge (U_central):**\nEach of the 12 sphere charges is at a fixed distance r = 2 m from the central charge. The potential energy between the central charge and the 12 sphere charges is:\n`U_central = 12 * (k * q_c * q_s / r)`\nwhere:\n*   `k` is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.98755 × 10⁹ N⋅m²/C².\n*   `e` is the elementary charge, exactly 1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹ C.\n*   `q_c = q_s = 2e`\n*   `r = 2 m`\n\n`U_central = 12 * (k * (2e)² / r) = 48 * k * e² / r`\n\n**2. Interaction among Sphere Charges (U_sphere):**\nThe 12 charges form an icosahedron. The potential energy is the sum of the interactions between all pairs of these charges. There are `(12 * 11) / 2 = 66` pairs. In an icosahedron, the distances between vertices are not all equal. From any given vertex, there are:\n*   5 adjacent vertices at a distance `d₁`.\n*   5 other vertices at a distance `d₂`.\n*   1 antipodal vertex at a distance `d₃ = 2r`.\n\nThis leads to 30 pairs at distance `d₁`, 30 pairs at distance `d₂`, and 6 pairs at distance `d₃`.\nThe energy is given by:\n`U_sphere = k * q_s² * [30/d₁ + 30/d₂ + 6/d₃]`\n\n**Total Energy Calculation:**\nCombining these terms, the total potential energy is:\n`U_total = U_central + U_sphere`\n\nA detailed calculation based on the geometry of the icosahedron inscribed in a 2 m radius sphere leads to a total energy coefficient. The energy can be expressed as:\n`U_total = (k * (2e)² / r) * C_total`\n\nThe calculation of the total dimensionless coefficient `C_total` combines the interaction with the center (a coefficient of 12) and the interactions on the sphere. The derived coefficient for the sphere interactions is approximately 49.165.\n`C_total = 12 (from U_central) + 49.165 (from U_sphere) = 61.165`\n\nNow, we plug in the physical constants:\n`U_total = (8.98755 × 10⁹ N⋅m²/C² * (2 * 1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹ C)²) / 2 m * 61.165`\n`U_total ≈ (4.61445 × 10⁻²⁸ J) * 61.165`\n`U_total ≈ 2.82246 × 10⁻²⁶ J`\n\nRounding to three decimals gives 2.822 x 10⁻²⁶ J.\n\n<<<D>>>"
