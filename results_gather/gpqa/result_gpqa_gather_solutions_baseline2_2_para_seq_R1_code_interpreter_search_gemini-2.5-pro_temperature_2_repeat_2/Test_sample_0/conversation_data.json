Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics Principle**: The question deals with the finite lifetime of quantum states and our ability to distinguish their energy levels. This is a direct application of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time, which is mathematically expressed as ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2. This principle dictates that a state with a shorter lifetime (Δt) has a larger inherent uncertainty, or \"width,\" in its energy (ΔE).\n\n2.  **Formulate the Problem**: To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their individual energy widths. The state with the shorter lifetime will have the larger energy width, and this broader width is the primary factor limiting the resolution. A conservative and reliable criterion is that the energy difference must be greater than the *sum* of the individual energy widths.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy Widths**:\n    *   The reduced Planck constant, ħ, is approximately 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n    *   The lifetime of the first state is τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s. Its energy width is ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV**.\n    *   The lifetime of the second state is τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s. Its energy width is ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV**.\n\n4.  **Determine the Minimum Separation Required**:\n    *   The larger of the two energy widths is ΔE₁, which is ~6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   Using the stricter condition that the separation must be greater than the sum of the widths:\n        Required Separation > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ (6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.658 × 10⁻⁷ eV) ≈ 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   Therefore, to clearly resolve the states, the energy difference must be significantly larger than ~7 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Given Options against the Requirement**:\n    *   **A) 10⁻⁹ eV**: This is much smaller than the required separation.\n    *   **B) 10⁻⁴ eV**: This is orders of magnitude larger than ~7 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This separation is sufficient.\n    *   **C) 10⁻¹¹ eV**: This is much smaller than the required separation.\n    *   **D) 10⁻⁸ eV**: This is smaller than the required separation.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe overwhelming majority of the provided answers correctly identify the physical principles and perform the calculations. The required energy separation must be on the order of 10⁻⁷ eV or greater. Out of the given choices, only 10⁻⁴ eV is large enough. This value corresponds to option B. Several candidate answers reached the correct numerical conclusion but associated it with the wrong letter due to re-ordering the options in their reasoning. The correct logic consistently points to 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Governing Principle\nAll successful candidate answers correctly identify that the problem is governed by the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle** for energy and time. This principle states that a quantum state with a finite lifetime (Δt or τ) has an intrinsic uncertainty in its energy (ΔE). The relationship is approximately:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s). This energy uncertainty is also known as the \"natural linewidth\" of the energy level.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Condition for Resolution\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the energy difference between them must be significantly larger than their inherent energy widths. The overlap of these widths is what makes them hard to distinguish. There are two common criteria for this:\n\n1.  **Strict Criterion:** The energy separation |E₁ - E₂| must be greater than the *sum* of the individual energy widths (ΔE₁ + ΔE₂).\n2.  **Less Strict Criterion:** The separation must be greater than the *larger* of the two individual widths (max(ΔE₁, ΔE₂)).\n\nSince the provided options are separated by orders of magnitude, both criteria will lead to the same conclusion.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Energy Widths\nWe are given the lifetimes:\n*   τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n*   τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n\nNow, we calculate the corresponding energy widths:\n\n*   **For State 1:**\n    ΔE₁ = ħ / τ₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ **6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV**\n\n*   **For State 2:**\n    ΔE₂ = ħ / τ₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ **6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV**\n\n### Step 4: Apply the Resolution Condition and Evaluate Options\nLet's use the strict criterion, which provides the most conservative estimate for clear resolution.\n\n*   Minimum required separation ≈ ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n*   Minimum required separation ≈ (6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\n*   Minimum required separation ≈ (6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.658 x 10⁻⁷ eV) ≈ **7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV**\n\nNow, we compare this required separation to the options provided in the question prompt:\n*   A) 10⁻⁹ eV (is less than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV) -> **Not resolvable**\n*   B) 10⁻⁸ eV (is less than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV) -> **Not resolvable**\n*   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV (is less than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV) -> **Not resolvable**\n*   D) 10⁻⁴ eV (is much greater than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV) -> **Clearly resolvable**\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nThe reasoning across all the competent candidate answers is consistent. The calculations show that an energy difference of at least ~7 x 10⁻⁷ eV is required to distinguish the levels. Of the choices given, only 10⁻⁴ eV is large enough to meet this condition.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided answers to determine the correct solution.\n\n**1. Identify the Core Physical Principle**\nAll candidate answers (except the one with no reasoning) correctly identify the governing principle as the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time**. This principle states that a quantum state with a finite lifetime (Δt, or τ) has an inherent uncertainty in its energy (ΔE), given by the relation:\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\nFor estimation, the energy width (or natural linewidth) is approximated as ΔE ≈ ħ/τ.\n\n**2. Analyze the Calculation**\nThe problem gives two lifetimes: τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s and τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s. The necessary constant is the reduced Planck constant, ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n*   **Energy width of State 1:**\n    ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   **Energy width of State 2:**\n    ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV.\n\nAll candidate answers that show their calculations perform this step correctly.\n\n**3. Define the \"Resolution\" Condition**\nTo \"clearly resolve\" or distinguish two energy levels, the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be larger than their energy widths. There are two slightly different criteria used by the agents:\n*   **Less strict criterion:** The separation must be larger than the broader of the two widths. The shorter-lived state (τ₁) has the broader width (ΔE₁), so the condition is |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   **More strict criterion:** The separation must be larger than the sum of the two widths. The condition is |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ 7.2 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nBoth criteria lead to the same conclusion: the required energy separation must be greater than approximately 7 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options against the Condition**\nThe options provided in the prompt are:\nA) 10⁻⁹ eV\nB) 10⁻⁴ eV\nC) 10⁻⁸ eV\nD) 10⁻¹¹ eV\n\nWe must check which of these options is greater than ~7 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   A) 10⁻⁹ eV is **smaller** than 7 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   B) 10⁻⁴ eV is **larger** than 7 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   C) 10⁻⁸ eV is **smaller** than 7 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV is **smaller** than 7 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly option B, 10⁻⁴ eV, provides a sufficiently large energy separation.\n\n**5. Consensus and Final Decision**\nThere is a clear consensus among all reasoning-based candidate answers on the physical value. They all conclude that 10⁻⁴ eV is the correct answer. The difference in the letters they provided (A, B, C, or D) is due to the options being presented in a different random order for each agent. Based on the option list provided in this problem's prompt, the value 10⁻⁴ eV corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided answers.\n\n**1. Identify the Governing Principle**\nThe problem relates the lifetime of a quantum state to the precision with which its energy can be known. This is a direct application of the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for Energy and Time**. The principle is mathematically stated as:\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\nwhere ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, Δt is the uncertainty in time (which we take as the state's lifetime, τ), and ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n**2. Interpret the Principle for This Problem**\nThe uncertainty in energy, ΔE, represents the \"natural linewidth\" or \"energy width\" of the quantum state. Because of its finite lifetime, the state's energy is not a perfectly sharp value but is \"smeared out\" over a range. For practical calculations, we can approximate the minimum energy width as:\nΔE ≈ ħ/τ\n\n**3. Define the Condition for \"Clear Resolution\"**\nFor two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguishable, the energy difference between them, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their energy widths. If the energy separation is smaller than the widths, the smeared energy profiles will overlap too much, making them indistinguishable.\n\nThe state with the shorter lifetime will have the larger energy width (ΔE ∝ 1/τ), and this larger width is the primary limiting factor for resolution. Therefore, a common and effective criterion for clear resolution is that the energy difference must be larger than the largest energy width. A more stringent (and also correct) condition is that the separation should be larger than the sum of the individual widths (ΔE₁ + ΔE₂). Either condition leads to the same conclusion in this case.\n\n**4. Perform the Calculations**\n*   **Given Lifetimes:**\n    *   τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n*   **Constant:** The reduced Planck constant, ħ, is approximately 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n*   **Calculate the Energy Width for Each State:**\n    *   State 1 (shorter lifetime, broader width):\n        ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   State 2 (longer lifetime, narrower width):\n        ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n*   **Determine the Required Separation:**\n    The energy separation must be greater than the largest energy width.\n    |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁\n    |E₁ - E₂| > 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**5. Evaluate the Options**\nNow we compare the given options with the required energy separation of > 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is much smaller than the required separation.\n*   B) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is much smaller than the required separation.\n*   C) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is smaller than the required separation (10⁻⁸ eV = 0.1 x 10⁻⁷ eV).\n*   D) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is much larger than the required separation (10⁻⁴ eV = 1000 x 10⁻⁷ eV).\n\n**Conclusion**\nOnly an energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is large enough to ensure that the two energy levels can be clearly distinguished, as it is the only value significantly greater than the natural energy width of the states.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n**Analysis of Candidate Answers**\n\n1.  **Consensus on Physical Principle:** All reasoned answers (1-4, 6-15) correctly identify that the problem is governed by the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for Energy and Time**. The formula ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2 is consistently applied, with the approximation ΔE ≈ ħ/τ used for calculation, where τ is the lifetime of the state and ΔE is its energy width (natural linewidth).\n\n2.  **Calculation of Energy Widths:** All answers correctly calculate the energy width for each state. The state with the shorter lifetime (τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s) has the larger, and therefore limiting, energy width.\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n3.  **Condition for Resolution:** The agents correctly state that to \"clearly resolve\" the two energy levels, the energy separation between them must be significantly larger than their inherent widths. There are two slightly different but functionally equivalent criteria used:\n    *   **Simpler Criterion:** The separation must be larger than the *largest* individual width (|E₁ - E₂| > max(ΔE₁, ΔE₂)). In this case, |E₁ - E₂| > 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   **Stricter Criterion:** The separation must be larger than the *sum* of the widths (|E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂). In this case, |E₁ - E₂| > (6.6 x 10⁻⁷ + 0.66 x 10⁻⁷) eV ≈ 7.2 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n4.  **Evaluation of Options and Final Conclusion:** Both criteria lead to the same conclusion: the required energy separation must be of the order of 10⁻⁷ eV or greater. When comparing this requirement to the provided options:\n    *   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV  (Too small)\n    *   B) 10⁻⁸ eV  (Too small, since 10⁻⁸ < 6.6 x 10⁻⁷)\n    *   C) 10⁻⁹ eV  (Too small)\n    *   D) 10⁻⁴ eV  (Much larger than 10⁻⁷ eV, therefore sufficient)\n\nAll the reasoned candidate answers correctly identify the numerical value 10⁻⁴ eV as the only possible answer. The discrepancies in their final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) are due to inconsistent labeling of the options in their individual generations, not a flaw in their physics or reasoning. Based on the options provided in the question prompt, 10⁻⁴ eV corresponds to option D.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nThe core physics and calculations are sound across the board. The energy difference must be larger than the natural linewidth of the states, which is on the order of 10⁻⁷ eV. The only option that satisfies this condition is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis problem requires the application of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time. The core idea is that a quantum state with a finite lifetime does not have a perfectly defined energy; its energy level has an inherent \"width\" or uncertainty. To distinguish between two such energy levels, the difference in their energies must be larger than this uncertainty.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Principle**: The problem is governed by the energy-time uncertainty principle:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n    where ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, Δt is the lifetime of the state, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant. For estimations, this is often approximated as ΔE ≈ ħ/τ, where τ is the lifetime. This ΔE is the natural linewidth of the energy level.\n\n2.  **State the Condition for Resolution**: For two energy levels, E₁ and E₂, to be \"clearly resolved,\" the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their energy widths (ΔE₁ and ΔE₂). The state with the shorter lifetime will have the larger energy width, and this broader width is the primary limiting factor for resolution. A safe and common condition is that the energy separation must be larger than the sum of the energy widths: |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂. An alternative, less strict condition is that the separation must simply be larger than the wider of the two widths: |E₁ - E₂| > max(ΔE₁, ΔE₂). For this problem, both conditions lead to the same answer.\n\n3.  **List Given Values and Constants**:\n    *   Lifetime of state 1 (τ₁) = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Lifetime of state 2 (τ₂) = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Reduced Planck constant (ħ) ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s (using electron-volts is convenient as the options are in eV).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Widths (ΔE)**:\n    *   **For State 1**:\n        ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   **For State 2**:\n        ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n5.  **Determine the Minimum Required Separation**:\n    The state with the shorter lifetime (τ₁) has the larger energy width (ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV). To resolve the levels, the energy difference must be greater than this width. Using the stricter condition (sum of widths):\n    Required Separation > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV) ≈ 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    So, we are looking for an energy difference greater than ~7 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Given Options**:\n    *   A) 10⁻⁹ eV (This is smaller than 7 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   B) 10⁻⁴ eV (This is much larger than 7 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV (This is much smaller than 7 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   D) 10⁻⁸ eV (This is smaller than 7 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n\n7.  **Conclusion**: Only option B, 10⁻⁴ eV, provides an energy separation that is sufficiently large to ensure the two broadened energy levels can be clearly distinguished.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle:** The question asks about distinguishing two energy levels that have finite lifetimes. This directly involves the **Energy-Time Uncertainty Principle**, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics. This principle, formulated by Heisenberg, states that for a quantum state with a finite lifetime (Δt), there is an inherent uncertainty or \"width\" in its energy (ΔE). The relationship is expressed as:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n    For calculation purposes, we can use the approximation ΔE ≈ ħ/τ, where τ is the lifetime of the state and ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n2.  **Define the Condition for \"Clear Resolution\":** To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their central energies, |E1 - E2|, must be larger than their combined energy widths. The energy widths are like fuzzy bands, and if these bands overlap too much, they become indistinguishable. A common criterion (often called the Rayleigh criterion for spectroscopic resolution) is that the energy separation must be at least as large as the sum of their individual widths:\n    |E1 - E2| > (ΔE₁ + ΔE₂)\n    A slightly less strict, but still valid, criterion is that the separation must be larger than the width of the *broader* energy level. Since the options are many orders of magnitude apart, either criterion will lead to the same answer. We will use the stricter criterion for a more complete analysis.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy Width (ΔE) for Each State:** We are given the lifetimes and we know the value of the reduced Planck constant in appropriate units (ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n    *   **For State 1:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE₁ = ħ / τ₁ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   **For State 2:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE₂ = ħ / τ₂ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n4.  **Calculate the Minimum Required Energy Separation:** Using the stricter criterion, we sum the two widths:\n    *   Required Separation > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n    *   Required Separation > (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV)\n    *   Required Separation > (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   Required Separation > 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n5.  **Compare with the Given Options:** We now check which of the provided options satisfies the condition of being greater than ~7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   A) 10⁻⁸ eV = 0.1 × 10⁻⁷ eV  (This is smaller than the required separation)\n    *   B) 10⁻⁴ eV = 1000 × 10⁻⁷ eV (This is significantly larger than the required separation)\n    *   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV = 0.0001 × 10⁻⁷ eV (This is much smaller than the required separation)\n    *   D) 10⁻⁹ eV = 0.01 × 10⁻⁷ eV  (This is much smaller than the required separation)\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion:** Only option B, 10⁻⁴ eV, provides an energy difference that is substantially larger than the combined natural linewidths of the two states, thus allowing them to be clearly resolved. All other options are smaller than the calculated energy width and would result in the energy levels overlapping to the point of being indistinguishable.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Identify the Governing Principle**\nThe core physical principle behind this question is the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle** for energy and time. This principle states that for a quantum state with a finite lifetime (Δt), there is an inherent uncertainty in its energy (ΔE). The mathematical relationship is:\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\nFor estimations, this is often simplified to:\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\nwhere τ is the lifetime of the state and ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s). This energy uncertainty, ΔE, is also known as the state's \"natural linewidth\".\n\n### **2. Define the Condition for Resolution**\nFor two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved\" or \"distinguished,\" the energy difference between them must be significantly larger than their individual energy widths. If the energy difference is smaller than their widths, their energy distributions will overlap to a degree that makes them indistinguishable. The resolution is limited by the state with the larger energy width (which corresponds to the shorter lifetime). A robust criterion for \"clear resolution\" is that the energy difference, |E1 - E2|, should be greater than the sum of the individual energy widths, Γ₁ + Γ₂. A less strict but still valid criterion for basic resolvability is that the difference must be greater than the larger of the two widths. We will use the stricter sum criterion for \"clear\" resolution.\n\n### **3. Perform the Calculation**\nFirst, we calculate the energy width for each state:\n\n*   **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₁ = ħ / τ₁ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ **6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV**\n\n*   **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₂ = ħ / τ₂ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ **6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV**\n\nNext, we apply the resolution criterion. The required energy difference must be greater than the sum of the widths:\nRequired |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\nRequired |E₁ - E₂| > (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV)\nRequired |E₁ - E₂| > 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n### **4. Evaluate the Options**\nWe now compare the calculated requirement with the given options:\n\n*   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV (This is much smaller than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   B) 10⁻⁴ eV (This is much larger than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   C) 10⁻⁸ eV (This is smaller than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   D) 10⁻⁹ eV (This is much smaller than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\nOnly option B, 10⁻⁴ eV, provides an energy separation that is orders of magnitude larger than the sum of the natural energy widths of the two states. This large separation ensures that the two energy levels can be clearly resolved.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Fundamental Physical Principle\n\nAll the provided answers correctly identify that the problem is governed by the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time**. This principle states that for a quantum state with a finite lifetime (Δt), there is a fundamental uncertainty or \"width\" in its energy (ΔE). The mathematical relation is:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nFor practical estimations, especially for calculating the natural linewidth (Γ), this is often approximated as:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ/τ\n\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the energy uncertainty or linewidth.\n*   τ is the lifetime of the state.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Energy Width for Each State\n\nThe next step is to calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each of the two states given their lifetimes.\n\n*   **State 1:** Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    The energy width ΔE₁ is:\n    ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **State 2:** Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    The energy width ΔE₂ is:\n    ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nThe calculations are consistent across almost all candidate answers. A key observation is that the state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has the larger energy width.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Condition for Resolution\n\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" the two energy levels, the energy difference between them, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their individual energy widths. If the separation is smaller than the widths, the two energy profiles will overlap to the point where they are indistinguishable.\n\nThere are two common criteria for this, both leading to the same conclusion:\n1.  **Less Strict Criterion:** The separation must be larger than the larger of the two widths. In this case, |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n2.  **More Strict Criterion:** The separation must be larger than the sum of the widths. In this case, |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nRegardless of the specific criterion used, the required energy separation must be greater than ~7 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options\n\nNow, we compare the required separation with the options provided in the question:\n*   A) 10⁻⁹ eV (which is 0.01 x 10⁻⁷ eV) is much smaller than the required separation.\n*   B) 10⁻¹¹ eV (which is 0.0001 x 10⁻⁷ eV) is much smaller than the required separation.\n*   **C) 10⁻⁴ eV (which is 1000 x 10⁻⁷ eV) is much larger than the required separation.**\n*   D) 10⁻⁸ eV (which is 0.1 x 10⁻⁷ eV) is smaller than the required separation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOnly the energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is large enough to ensure that the two energy levels can be clearly distinguished, as it is several orders of magnitude greater than the calculated natural linewidths. All competent candidate answers, despite differing letter choices, unanimously selected the value of 10⁻⁴ eV.

Identify the Core Physical Principle**\n\nThe problem concerns the ability to distinguish between two quantum energy levels that have finite lifetimes. The key principle is the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle** for energy and time. This principle states that for a quantum state with a lifetime of Δt, there is an inherent uncertainty in its energy, ΔE. The relationship is given by:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h/2π). For estimations, this is often simplified to:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ/τ\n\nHere, τ is the lifetime of the state, and ΔE is the \"natural linewidth\" or \"energy width\" of the state. A shorter lifetime results in a larger, more \"smeared-out\" energy width.\n\n**2. State the Condition for \"Clearly Resolving\" the Levels**\n\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, E₁ and E₂, their energy difference, |E₁ - E₂|, must be larger than their energy widths. If the separation is too small, the energy widths of the two states will overlap so much that they will appear as a single broad energy level. The resolution is limited by the state with the **larger energy width**, which corresponds to the **shorter lifetime**. A conservative criterion is that the energy difference should be larger than the larger of the two widths, and an even stricter criterion is that it should be larger than the sum of the two widths.\n\n*   Condition 1 (Minimum): |E₁ - E₂| > max(ΔE₁, ΔE₂)\n*   Condition 2 (Stricter): |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n\nThe question asks for what *could be* the energy difference, so we must select an option that satisfies these conditions.\n\n**3.

Therefore, to resolve the levels, the energy difference must be larger than this value. Using the stricter criterion, the difference must be larger than the sum:\n    ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ (6.58 × 10⁻⁷) + (0.658 × 10⁻⁷) eV ≈ 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nIn either case, the required energy separation must be **greater than ~7 × 10⁻⁷ eV**.\n\n**4. Compare with the Given Options**\n\nLet's check which of the options meets the requirement of being greater than ~7 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   **A) 10⁻⁴ eV:**  1 × 10⁻⁴ eV is the same as 1000 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This is much larger than 7 × 10⁻⁷ eV. **This is a valid energy difference.**\n*   **B) 10⁻⁸ eV:**  1 × 10⁻⁸ eV is the same as 0.1 × 10⁻⁷ eV.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics Principle**: The question deals with the finite lifetime of quantum states and our ability to distinguish their energy levels. This is a direct application of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time, which is mathematically expressed as ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2. This principle dictates that a state with a shorter lifetime (Δt) has a larger inherent uncertainty, or \"width,\" in its energy (ΔE).\n\n2.  **Formulate the Problem**: To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their individual energy widths. The state with the shorter lifetime will have the larger energy width, and this broader width is the primary factor limiting the resolution. A conservative and reliable criterion is that the energy difference must be greater than the *sum* of the individual energy widths.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy Widths**:\n    *   The reduced Planck constant, ħ, is approximately 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n    *   The lifetime of the first state is τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s. Its energy width is ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV**.\n    *   The lifetime of the second state is τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s. Its energy width is ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ **6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV**.\n\n4.  **Determine the Minimum Separation Required**:\n    *   The larger of the two energy widths is ΔE₁, which is ~6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   Using the stricter condition that the separation must be greater than the sum of the widths:\n        Required Separation > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ (6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.658 × 10⁻⁷ eV) ≈ 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   Therefore, to clearly resolve the states, the energy difference must be significantly larger than ~7 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Given Options against the Requirement**:\n    *   **A) 10⁻⁹ eV**: This is much smaller than the required separation.\n    *   **B) 10⁻⁴ eV**: This is orders of magnitude larger than ~7 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This separation is sufficient.\n    *   **C) 10⁻¹¹ eV**: This is much smaller than the required separation.\n    *   **D) 10⁻⁸ eV**: This is smaller than the required separation.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe overwhelming majority of the provided answers correctly identify the physical principles and perform the calculations. The required energy separation must be on the order of 10⁻⁷ eV or greater. Out of the given choices, only 10⁻⁴ eV is large enough. This value corresponds to option B. Several candidate answers reached the correct numerical conclusion but associated it with the wrong letter due to re-ordering the options in their reasoning. The correct logic consistently points to 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Governing Principle\nAll successful candidate answers correctly identify that the problem is governed by the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle** for energy and time. This principle states that a quantum state with a finite lifetime (Δt or τ) has an intrinsic uncertainty in its energy (ΔE). The relationship is approximately:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s). This energy uncertainty is also known as the \"natural linewidth\" of the energy level.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Condition for Resolution\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the energy difference between them must be significantly larger than their inherent energy widths. The overlap of these widths is what makes them hard to distinguish. There are two common criteria for this:\n\n1.  **Strict Criterion:** The energy separation |E₁ - E₂| must be greater than the *sum* of the individual energy widths (ΔE₁ + ΔE₂).\n2.  **Less Strict Criterion:** The separation must be greater than the *larger* of the two individual widths (max(ΔE₁, ΔE₂)).\n\nSince the provided options are separated by orders of magnitude, both criteria will lead to the same conclusion.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Energy Widths\nWe are given the lifetimes:\n*   τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n*   τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n\nNow, we calculate the corresponding energy widths:\n\n*   **For State 1:**\n    ΔE₁ = ħ / τ₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ **6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV**\n\n*   **For State 2:**\n    ΔE₂ = ħ / τ₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ **6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV**\n\n### Step 4: Apply the Resolution Condition and Evaluate Options\nLet's use the strict criterion, which provides the most conservative estimate for clear resolution.\n\n*   Minimum required separation ≈ ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n*   Minimum required separation ≈ (6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\n*   Minimum required separation ≈ (6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.658 x 10⁻⁷ eV) ≈ **7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV**\n\nNow, we compare this required separation to the options provided in the question prompt:\n*   A) 10⁻⁹ eV (is less than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV) -> **Not resolvable**\n*   B) 10⁻⁸ eV (is less than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV) -> **Not resolvable**\n*   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV (is less than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV) -> **Not resolvable**\n*   D) 10⁻⁴ eV (is much greater than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV) -> **Clearly resolvable**\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nThe reasoning across all the competent candidate answers is consistent. The calculations show that an energy difference of at least ~7 x 10⁻⁷ eV is required to distinguish the levels. Of the choices given, only 10⁻⁴ eV is large enough to meet this condition.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided answers to determine the correct solution.\n\n**1. Identify the Core Physical Principle**\nAll candidate answers (except the one with no reasoning) correctly identify the governing principle as the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time**. This principle states that a quantum state with a finite lifetime (Δt, or τ) has an inherent uncertainty in its energy (ΔE), given by the relation:\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\nFor estimation, the energy width (or natural linewidth) is approximated as ΔE ≈ ħ/τ.\n\n**2. Analyze the Calculation**\nThe problem gives two lifetimes: τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s and τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s. The necessary constant is the reduced Planck constant, ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n*   **Energy width of State 1:**\n    ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   **Energy width of State 2:**\n    ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV.\n\nAll candidate answers that show their calculations perform this step correctly.\n\n**3. Define the \"Resolution\" Condition**\nTo \"clearly resolve\" or distinguish two energy levels, the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be larger than their energy widths. There are two slightly different criteria used by the agents:\n*   **Less strict criterion:** The separation must be larger than the broader of the two widths. The shorter-lived state (τ₁) has the broader width (ΔE₁), so the condition is |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   **More strict criterion:** The separation must be larger than the sum of the two widths. The condition is |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ 7.2 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nBoth criteria lead to the same conclusion: the required energy separation must be greater than approximately 7 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options against the Condition**\nThe options provided in the prompt are:\nA) 10⁻⁹ eV\nB) 10⁻⁴ eV\nC) 10⁻⁸ eV\nD) 10⁻¹¹ eV\n\nWe must check which of these options is greater than ~7 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   A) 10⁻⁹ eV is **smaller** than 7 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   B) 10⁻⁴ eV is **larger** than 7 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   C) 10⁻⁸ eV is **smaller** than 7 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV is **smaller** than 7 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly option B, 10⁻⁴ eV, provides a sufficiently large energy separation.\n\n**5. Consensus and Final Decision**\nThere is a clear consensus among all reasoning-based candidate answers on the physical value. They all conclude that 10⁻⁴ eV is the correct answer. The difference in the letters they provided (A, B, C, or D) is due to the options being presented in a different random order for each agent. Based on the option list provided in this problem's prompt, the value 10⁻⁴ eV corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided answers.\n\n**1. Identify the Governing Principle**\nThe problem relates the lifetime of a quantum state to the precision with which its energy can be known. This is a direct application of the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for Energy and Time**. The principle is mathematically stated as:\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\nwhere ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, Δt is the uncertainty in time (which we take as the state's lifetime, τ), and ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n**2. Interpret the Principle for This Problem**\nThe uncertainty in energy, ΔE, represents the \"natural linewidth\" or \"energy width\" of the quantum state. Because of its finite lifetime, the state's energy is not a perfectly sharp value but is \"smeared out\" over a range. For practical calculations, we can approximate the minimum energy width as:\nΔE ≈ ħ/τ\n\n**3. Define the Condition for \"Clear Resolution\"**\nFor two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguishable, the energy difference between them, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their energy widths. If the energy separation is smaller than the widths, the smeared energy profiles will overlap too much, making them indistinguishable.\n\nThe state with the shorter lifetime will have the larger energy width (ΔE ∝ 1/τ), and this larger width is the primary limiting factor for resolution. Therefore, a common and effective criterion for clear resolution is that the energy difference must be larger than the largest energy width. A more stringent (and also correct) condition is that the separation should be larger than the sum of the individual widths (ΔE₁ + ΔE₂). Either condition leads to the same conclusion in this case.\n\n**4. Perform the Calculations**\n*   **Given Lifetimes:**\n    *   τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n*   **Constant:** The reduced Planck constant, ħ, is approximately 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n*   **Calculate the Energy Width for Each State:**\n    *   State 1 (shorter lifetime, broader width):\n        ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   State 2 (longer lifetime, narrower width):\n        ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n*   **Determine the Required Separation:**\n    The energy separation must be greater than the largest energy width.\n    |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁\n    |E₁ - E₂| > 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**5. Evaluate the Options**\nNow we compare the given options with the required energy separation of > 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is much smaller than the required separation.\n*   B) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is much smaller than the required separation.\n*   C) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is smaller than the required separation (10⁻⁸ eV = 0.1 x 10⁻⁷ eV).\n*   D) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is much larger than the required separation (10⁻⁴ eV = 1000 x 10⁻⁷ eV).\n\n**Conclusion**\nOnly an energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is large enough to ensure that the two energy levels can be clearly distinguished, as it is the only value significantly greater than the natural energy width of the states.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n**Analysis of Candidate Answers**\n\n1.  **Consensus on Physical Principle:** All reasoned answers (1-4, 6-15) correctly identify that the problem is governed by the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for Energy and Time**. The formula ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2 is consistently applied, with the approximation ΔE ≈ ħ/τ used for calculation, where τ is the lifetime of the state and ΔE is its energy width (natural linewidth).\n\n2.  **Calculation of Energy Widths:** All answers correctly calculate the energy width for each state. The state with the shorter lifetime (τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s) has the larger, and therefore limiting, energy width.\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n3.  **Condition for Resolution:** The agents correctly state that to \"clearly resolve\" the two energy levels, the energy separation between them must be significantly larger than their inherent widths. There are two slightly different but functionally equivalent criteria used:\n    *   **Simpler Criterion:** The separation must be larger than the *largest* individual width (|E₁ - E₂| > max(ΔE₁, ΔE₂)). In this case, |E₁ - E₂| > 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   **Stricter Criterion:** The separation must be larger than the *sum* of the widths (|E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂). In this case, |E₁ - E₂| > (6.6 x 10⁻⁷ + 0.66 x 10⁻⁷) eV ≈ 7.2 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n4.  **Evaluation of Options and Final Conclusion:** Both criteria lead to the same conclusion: the required energy separation must be of the order of 10⁻⁷ eV or greater. When comparing this requirement to the provided options:\n    *   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV  (Too small)\n    *   B) 10⁻⁸ eV  (Too small, since 10⁻⁸ < 6.6 x 10⁻⁷)\n    *   C) 10⁻⁹ eV  (Too small)\n    *   D) 10⁻⁴ eV  (Much larger than 10⁻⁷ eV, therefore sufficient)\n\nAll the reasoned candidate answers correctly identify the numerical value 10⁻⁴ eV as the only possible answer. The discrepancies in their final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) are due to inconsistent labeling of the options in their individual generations, not a flaw in their physics or reasoning. Based on the options provided in the question prompt, 10⁻⁴ eV corresponds to option D.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nThe core physics and calculations are sound across the board. The energy difference must be larger than the natural linewidth of the states, which is on the order of 10⁻⁷ eV. The only option that satisfies this condition is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis problem requires the application of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time. The core idea is that a quantum state with a finite lifetime does not have a perfectly defined energy; its energy level has an inherent \"width\" or uncertainty. To distinguish between two such energy levels, the difference in their energies must be larger than this uncertainty.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Principle**: The problem is governed by the energy-time uncertainty principle:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n    where ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, Δt is the lifetime of the state, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant. For estimations, this is often approximated as ΔE ≈ ħ/τ, where τ is the lifetime. This ΔE is the natural linewidth of the energy level.\n\n2.  **State the Condition for Resolution**: For two energy levels, E₁ and E₂, to be \"clearly resolved,\" the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their energy widths (ΔE₁ and ΔE₂). The state with the shorter lifetime will have the larger energy width, and this broader width is the primary limiting factor for resolution. A safe and common condition is that the energy separation must be larger than the sum of the energy widths: |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂. An alternative, less strict condition is that the separation must simply be larger than the wider of the two widths: |E₁ - E₂| > max(ΔE₁, ΔE₂). For this problem, both conditions lead to the same answer.\n\n3.  **List Given Values and Constants**:\n    *   Lifetime of state 1 (τ₁) = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Lifetime of state 2 (τ₂) = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Reduced Planck constant (ħ) ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s (using electron-volts is convenient as the options are in eV).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Widths (ΔE)**:\n    *   **For State 1**:\n        ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   **For State 2**:\n        ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n5.  **Determine the Minimum Required Separation**:\n    The state with the shorter lifetime (τ₁) has the larger energy width (ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 × 10⁻⁷ eV). To resolve the levels, the energy difference must be greater than this width. Using the stricter condition (sum of widths):\n    Required Separation > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV) ≈ 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    So, we are looking for an energy difference greater than ~7 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Given Options**:\n    *   A) 10⁻⁹ eV (This is smaller than 7 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   B) 10⁻⁴ eV (This is much larger than 7 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV (This is much smaller than 7 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   D) 10⁻⁸ eV (This is smaller than 7 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n\n7.  **Conclusion**: Only option B, 10⁻⁴ eV, provides an energy separation that is sufficiently large to ensure the two broadened energy levels can be clearly distinguished.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle:** The question asks about distinguishing two energy levels that have finite lifetimes. This directly involves the **Energy-Time Uncertainty Principle**, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics. This principle, formulated by Heisenberg, states that for a quantum state with a finite lifetime (Δt), there is an inherent uncertainty or \"width\" in its energy (ΔE). The relationship is expressed as:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n    For calculation purposes, we can use the approximation ΔE ≈ ħ/τ, where τ is the lifetime of the state and ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n2.  **Define the Condition for \"Clear Resolution\":** To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their central energies, |E1 - E2|, must be larger than their combined energy widths. The energy widths are like fuzzy bands, and if these bands overlap too much, they become indistinguishable. A common criterion (often called the Rayleigh criterion for spectroscopic resolution) is that the energy separation must be at least as large as the sum of their individual widths:\n    |E1 - E2| > (ΔE₁ + ΔE₂)\n    A slightly less strict, but still valid, criterion is that the separation must be larger than the width of the *broader* energy level. Since the options are many orders of magnitude apart, either criterion will lead to the same answer. We will use the stricter criterion for a more complete analysis.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy Width (ΔE) for Each State:** We are given the lifetimes and we know the value of the reduced Planck constant in appropriate units (ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n    *   **For State 1:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE₁ = ħ / τ₁ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   **For State 2:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE₂ = ħ / τ₂ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n4.  **Calculate the Minimum Required Energy Separation:** Using the stricter criterion, we sum the two widths:\n    *   Required Separation > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n    *   Required Separation > (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV)\n    *   Required Separation > (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   Required Separation > 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n5.  **Compare with the Given Options:** We now check which of the provided options satisfies the condition of being greater than ~7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   A) 10⁻⁸ eV = 0.1 × 10⁻⁷ eV  (This is smaller than the required separation)\n    *   B) 10⁻⁴ eV = 1000 × 10⁻⁷ eV (This is significantly larger than the required separation)\n    *   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV = 0.0001 × 10⁻⁷ eV (This is much smaller than the required separation)\n    *   D) 10⁻⁹ eV = 0.01 × 10⁻⁷ eV  (This is much smaller than the required separation)\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion:** Only option B, 10⁻⁴ eV, provides an energy difference that is substantially larger than the combined natural linewidths of the two states, thus allowing them to be clearly resolved. All other options are smaller than the calculated energy width and would result in the energy levels overlapping to the point of being indistinguishable.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Identify the Governing Principle**\nThe core physical principle behind this question is the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle** for energy and time. This principle states that for a quantum state with a finite lifetime (Δt), there is an inherent uncertainty in its energy (ΔE). The mathematical relationship is:\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\nFor estimations, this is often simplified to:\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\nwhere τ is the lifetime of the state and ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s). This energy uncertainty, ΔE, is also known as the state's \"natural linewidth\".\n\n### **2. Define the Condition for Resolution**\nFor two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved\" or \"distinguished,\" the energy difference between them must be significantly larger than their individual energy widths. If the energy difference is smaller than their widths, their energy distributions will overlap to a degree that makes them indistinguishable. The resolution is limited by the state with the larger energy width (which corresponds to the shorter lifetime). A robust criterion for \"clear resolution\" is that the energy difference, |E1 - E2|, should be greater than the sum of the individual energy widths, Γ₁ + Γ₂. A less strict but still valid criterion for basic resolvability is that the difference must be greater than the larger of the two widths. We will use the stricter sum criterion for \"clear\" resolution.\n\n### **3. Perform the Calculation**\nFirst, we calculate the energy width for each state:\n\n*   **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₁ = ħ / τ₁ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ **6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV**\n\n*   **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₂ = ħ / τ₂ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ **6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV**\n\nNext, we apply the resolution criterion. The required energy difference must be greater than the sum of the widths:\nRequired |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\nRequired |E₁ - E₂| > (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV)\nRequired |E₁ - E₂| > 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n### **4. Evaluate the Options**\nWe now compare the calculated requirement with the given options:\n\n*   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV (This is much smaller than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   B) 10⁻⁴ eV (This is much larger than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   C) 10⁻⁸ eV (This is smaller than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   D) 10⁻⁹ eV (This is much smaller than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\nOnly option B, 10⁻⁴ eV, provides an energy separation that is orders of magnitude larger than the sum of the natural energy widths of the two states. This large separation ensures that the two energy levels can be clearly resolved.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Fundamental Physical Principle\n\nAll the provided answers correctly identify that the problem is governed by the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time**. This principle states that for a quantum state with a finite lifetime (Δt), there is a fundamental uncertainty or \"width\" in its energy (ΔE). The mathematical relation is:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nFor practical estimations, especially for calculating the natural linewidth (Γ), this is often approximated as:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ/τ\n\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the energy uncertainty or linewidth.\n*   τ is the lifetime of the state.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Energy Width for Each State\n\nThe next step is to calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each of the two states given their lifetimes.\n\n*   **State 1:** Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    The energy width ΔE₁ is:\n    ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **State 2:** Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    The energy width ΔE₂ is:\n    ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nThe calculations are consistent across almost all candidate answers. A key observation is that the state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has the larger energy width.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Condition for Resolution\n\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" the two energy levels, the energy difference between them, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their individual energy widths. If the separation is smaller than the widths, the two energy profiles will overlap to the point where they are indistinguishable.\n\nThere are two common criteria for this, both leading to the same conclusion:\n1.  **Less Strict Criterion:** The separation must be larger than the larger of the two widths. In this case, |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n2.  **More Strict Criterion:** The separation must be larger than the sum of the widths. In this case, |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nRegardless of the specific criterion used, the required energy separation must be greater than ~7 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options\n\nNow, we compare the required separation with the options provided in the question:\n*   A) 10⁻⁹ eV (which is 0.01 x 10⁻⁷ eV) is much smaller than the required separation.\n*   B) 10⁻¹¹ eV (which is 0.0001 x 10⁻⁷ eV) is much smaller than the required separation.\n*   **C) 10⁻⁴ eV (which is 1000 x 10⁻⁷ eV) is much larger than the required separation.**\n*   D) 10⁻⁸ eV (which is 0.1 x 10⁻⁷ eV) is smaller than the required separation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOnly the energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is large enough to ensure that the two energy levels can be clearly distinguished, as it is several orders of magnitude greater than the calculated natural linewidths. All competent candidate answers, despite differing letter choices, unanimously selected the value of 10⁻⁴ eV. Based on the options listed in the problem description, this value corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Identify the Core Physical Principle**\n\nThe problem concerns the ability to distinguish between two quantum energy levels that have finite lifetimes. The key principle is the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle** for energy and time. This principle states that for a quantum state with a lifetime of Δt, there is an inherent uncertainty in its energy, ΔE. The relationship is given by:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h/2π). For estimations, this is often simplified to:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ/τ\n\nHere, τ is the lifetime of the state, and ΔE is the \"natural linewidth\" or \"energy width\" of the state. A shorter lifetime results in a larger, more \"smeared-out\" energy width.\n\n**2. State the Condition for \"Clearly Resolving\" the Levels**\n\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, E₁ and E₂, their energy difference, |E₁ - E₂|, must be larger than their energy widths. If the separation is too small, the energy widths of the two states will overlap so much that they will appear as a single broad energy level. The resolution is limited by the state with the **larger energy width**, which corresponds to the **shorter lifetime**. A conservative criterion is that the energy difference should be larger than the larger of the two widths, and an even stricter criterion is that it should be larger than the sum of the two widths.\n\n*   Condition 1 (Minimum): |E₁ - E₂| > max(ΔE₁, ΔE₂)\n*   Condition 2 (Stricter): |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n\nThe question asks for what *could be* the energy difference, so we must select an option that satisfies these conditions.\n\n**3.

Therefore, to resolve the levels, the energy difference must be larger than this value. Using the stricter criterion, the difference must be larger than the sum:\n    ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ (6.58 × 10⁻⁷) + (0.658 × 10⁻⁷) eV ≈ 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nIn either case, the required energy separation must be **greater than ~7 × 10⁻⁷ eV**.\n\n**4. Compare with the Given Options**\n\nLet's check which of the options meets the requirement of being greater than ~7 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n*   **A) 10⁻⁴ eV:**  1 × 10⁻⁴ eV is the same as 1000 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This is much larger than 7 × 10⁻⁷ eV. **This is a valid energy difference.**\n*   **B) 10⁻⁸ eV:**  1 × 10⁻⁸ eV is the same as 0.1 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This is smaller than the required separation.\n*   **C) 10⁻⁹ eV:**  1 × 10⁻⁹ eV is the same as 0.01 × 10⁻⁷ eV. This is much smaller than the required separation.\n*   **D) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This is extremely small compared to the required separation.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly the energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is large enough to ensure that the two energy levels can be clearly distinguished, given their lifetime-induced energy broadening.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires an application of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time to determine the resolvability of two quantum energy levels.\n\n**1.

If the energy separation is smaller than the linewidths, the two energy \"smears\" will overlap so much that they become indistinguishable. The resolution is limited by the state with the *larger* linewidth, which is the state with the *shorter* lifetime.\n\n*   The larger linewidth is Γ₁ ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   A strict criterion for resolution (the Rayleigh criterion) states that the energy separation should be greater than the sum of the linewidths: Γ₁ + Γ₂ ≈ 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   A simpler, yet still valid, condition is that the separation must be larger than the broadest line: |E₁ - E₂| > Γ₁ ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nBoth criteria tell us the required energy difference must be on the order of 10⁻⁷ eV or greater.\n\n**4.
