The energy received from the star decreases with the square of the distance ($1/a^2$). The temperature of the planet is related to its radiated energy by the Stefan-Boltzmann law ($P \\propto T^4$). In equilibrium, energy in equals energy out, leading to the relationship $T_{eq}^4 \\propto 1/a^2$, which simplifies to:\n        $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law**: This law connects a planet's orbital period ($P$) with its semi-major axis ($a$). For planets orbiting the same star, the law is $P^2 \\propto a^3$. We can rearrange this to express distance in terms of the period:\n        $a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n\n3.  **Combine the Physical Laws**: The problem gives us periods, but we need temperatures. We must combine the two laws to relate temperature directly to the period. We substitute the expression for $a$ from Kepler's Law into the temperature relationship.\n    *   We know $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\n    *   We also know $a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n    *   Substituting the second into the first: $T_{eq} \\propto (P^{2/3})^{-1/2}$\n    *   Using the rules of exponents, we multiply them: $(2/3) \\times (-1/2) = -1/3$.\n    *   This gives us the final relationship: $T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Ratio**: We can now write the ratio for the temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2 using their periods, $P_4$ and $P_2$.\n    *   $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{P_4^{-1/3}}{P_2^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_4}{P_2}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n5.  **Use Given Data for Calculation**: The problem provides the ratio of orbital periods as `1:2:2.5:3.5:5`. From this, we extract the relative values for $P_2$ and $P_4$:\n    *   $P_2 = 2$\n    *   $P_4 = 3.5$\n    *   Therefore, the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \\frac{2}{3.5}$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value**: Now we compute the value of the temperature ratio:\n    *   $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3.5}\\right)^{1/3}$\n    *   $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} \\approx (0.5714...)^{1/3} \\approx 0.8298...$\n\n7.  **Compare with Options and Conclude**: The calculated value is approximately `0.83`.

The discrepancies in their final chosen letters (A, B, C, or D) arise because the options seem to have been presented to them in a scrambled order. However, the scientific and mathematical consensus is overwhelming.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Understand the Physics Principles**\n\nThe problem requires understanding two key concepts in astrophysics:\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature ($T_{eq}$):** This is the theoretical temperature of a planet when the energy it absorbs from its star equals the energy it radiates back into space. The energy received from the star decreases with the square of the distance ($a$) from the star. The Stefan-Boltzmann law states that radiated energy is proportional to the fourth power of temperature ($T^4$). This leads to the relationship $T_{eq}^4 \\propto 1/a^2$, which simplifies to:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$ or $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates a planet's orbital period ($P$) to its semi-major axis ($a$). For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis:\n    $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n\n### **2. Combine the Principles to Find the Relationship between Temperature and Period**\n\nOur goal is to find the ratio of temperatures, but we are given periods. Therefore, we must derive a relationship between $T_{eq}$ and $P$.\n\n1.  Rearrange Kepler's Third Law to solve for the semi-major axis ($a$):\n    $a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n\n2.  Substitute this expression for $a$ into the equilibrium temperature relationship:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto (P^{2/3})^{-1/2}$\n\n3.  Simplify the exponent by multiplying the powers ($(2/3) \\times (-1/2) = -1/3$):\n    $T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\nThis final proportionality shows that a planet's equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of its orbital period.\n\n### **3. Set Up the Ratio Calculation**\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 ($\\frac{T_4}{T_2}$). Using the proportionality we just derived:\n\n$\\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\frac{P_4^{-1/3}}{P_2^{-1/3}} = (\\frac{P_4}{P_2})^{-1/3} = (\\frac{P_2}{P_4})^{1/3}$\n\n### **4. Substitute the Given Values and Calculate**\n\nThe problem provides the ratio of orbital periods as $P_1:P_2:P_3:P_4:P_5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5$.\nFrom this, we extract the relative values for $P_2$ and $P_4$:\n*   $P_2 = 2$\n*   $P_4 = 3.5$\n\nNow, substitute these into our equation:\n\n$\\frac{T_4}{T_2} = (\\frac{2}{3.5})^{1/3}$\n\nLet's calculate the numerical value:\n$\\frac{T_4}{T_2} = (\\frac{2}{3.5})^{1/3} \\approx (0.571428...)^{1/3} \\approx 0.8298...$\n\n### **5. Match the Result to the Options**\n\nThe calculated value is approximately `0.83`. Let's compare this to the provided options:\n*   A) ~0.57\n*   B) ~0.83\n*   C) ~0.69\n*   D) ~0.75\n\nThe calculated value `~0.83` matches option B. The vast majority of the candidate agents correctly derived this value, even if they associated it with a different letter due to variations in their provided options. The underlying physics and calculation are consistent.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem requires us to determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures for two exoplanets based on the ratio of their orbital periods.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Establish the relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance.**\n    The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet depends on the energy it absorbs from its star. The energy flux decreases with the square of the distance ($a$) from the star. The temperature is related to radiated energy by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that power is proportional to $T^4$. In equilibrium, energy in equals energy out, leading to the relationship:\n    $T_{eq}^4 \\propto \\frac{1}{a^2}$\n    By taking the fourth root of both sides, we get:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\n    This means the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance. All other factors, such as the star's luminosity and the planets' albedo, are constant for this ratio since the planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo.\n\n2.  **Establish the relationship between Orbital Distance and Orbital Period.**\n    Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis ($a$, which is the orbital radius for the circular orbits in this problem).\n    $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n    We can rearrange this to express the distance in terms of the period:\n    $a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n\n3.  **Combine the two relationships.**\n    Now we can find a direct relationship between equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) and orbital period ($P$) by substituting the expression for $a$ from Step 2 into the temperature relationship from Step 1.\n    $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2} \\propto (P^{2/3})^{-1/2}$\n    Using the rules of exponents, we multiply the powers: $(\\frac{2}{3}) \\times (-\\frac{1}{2}) = -\\frac{1}{3}$. This gives us the final proportionality:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the required ratio.**\n    We need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 to that of Planet_2 ($\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}}$). Using the proportionality from Step 3:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{P_4^{-1/3}}{P_2^{-1/3}} = (\\frac{P_4}{P_2})^{-1/3} = (\\frac{P_2}{P_4})^{1/3}$\n\n5.  **Substitute the given values and compute.**\n    The problem gives the ratio of orbital periods as $P_1:P_2:P_3:P_4:P_5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5$.\n    From this, the relative period for Planet_2 is $P_2 = 2$ and for Planet_4 is $P_4 = 3.5$.\n    Plugging these values into our ratio formula:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = (\\frac{2}{3.5})^{1/3}$\n    First, let's simplify the fraction: $\\frac{2}{3.5} = \\frac{2}{7/2} = \\frac{4}{7}$.\n    So, the calculation is $(\\frac{4}{7})^{1/3} \\approx (0.5714)^{1/3} \\approx 0.8298$.\n\n6.  **Match the result with the given options.**\n    The calculated value is approximately `0.83`.\n    Comparing this to the options:\n    A) ~0.57\n    B) ~0.69\n    C) ~0.83\n    D) ~0.75\n    The result matches option C.\n\nThe overwhelming consensus among the candidate answers confirms this derivation and numerical result, with any discrepancies stemming from inconsistent labeling of the multiple-choice options rather than errors in calculation. The correct numerical answer is ~0.83.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem based on the provided answers.\n\n**1. Identify the Goal**\nThe core task is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 to Planet_2 (`T_eq4 / T_eq2`).\n\n**2. Core Physics Principles**\nThe solution relies on two fundamental principles of astrophysics:\n\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) of a planet depends on its distance (`a`, the semi-major axis) from its star. Since all the other factors are the same for both planets (same star, same albedo), the temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance:\n    `T_eq ∝ 1 / √a` or `T_eq ∝ a⁻¹ᐟ²`\n\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (`a`):\n    `P² ∝ a³`\n\n**3. Combine the Principles to Establish a Relationship**\nWe need to find the relationship between temperature (`T_eq`) and period (`P`), as the periods are the known quantities.\n\n*   First, rearrange Kepler's Third Law to express the distance (`a`) in terms of the period (`P`):\n    `a ∝ P²ᐟ³`\n*   Next, substitute this expression for `a` into the equilibrium temperature relationship:\n    `T_eq ∝ (P²ᐟ³)⁻¹ᐟ²`\n*   Using the rules of exponents, multiply them (`(2/3) * (-1/2) = -1/3`). This gives us the final, direct relationship:\n    `T_eq ∝ P⁻¹ᐟ³`\n\n**4. Formulate and Calculate the Ratio**\nNow, we can write the ratio for the temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2:\n\n*   `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P4 / P2)⁻¹ᐟ³`\n*   This is mathematically equivalent to: `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2 / P4)¹ᐟ³`\n\nThe problem provides the ratio of orbital periods as `1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5`. We can use the relative values for the periods of Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n*   `P2` corresponds to `2`.\n*   `P4` corresponds to `3.5`.\n\nSubstitute these values into the formula:\n*   `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)¹ᐟ³`\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n*   `T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ (0.5714...)¹ᐟ³ ≈ 0.8298...`\n\n**5.

Let's compare this to the provided options:\n\n*   A) ~0.75\n*   B) ~0.83\n*   C) ~0.69\n*   D) ~0.57\n\nThe calculated result `~0.83` perfectly matches option B.\n\n**Analysis of Candidate Answers**\nAll 15 candidate answers correctly derive the physical relationship and calculate the numerical value to be approximately 0.83. The discrepancy in their final letter choice (A, C, D vs. B) is due to them referencing differently ordered lists of options. However, the physical and mathematical reasoning is unanimous and sound, pointing to the value of ~0.83. Based on the options provided in this specific question, that value corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, which can be written as `T_eq4 / T_eq2`.\n\n### **Step 2: Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance**\nThe equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates. For planets orbiting the same star and having the same albedo (as stated in the problem), the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance (`a`, the semi-major axis).\n*   **Relationship:** `T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)` or `T_eq ∝ 1/√a`\n\nUsing this proportionality, we can write the ratio of temperatures for Planet_4 and Planet_2 as:\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (a_4)^(-1/2) / (a_2)^(-1/2) = (a_4 / a_2)^(-1/2) = (a_2 / a_4)^(1/2)`\n\n### **Step 3: Relate Orbital Distance to Orbital Period**\nWe are not given the orbital distances, but we are given the orbital periods (`P`). Kepler's Third Law provides the connection between these two quantities for planets orbiting the same star. The square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis.\n*   **Relationship:** `P² ∝ a³`\n\nWe can rearrange this to express the distance in terms of the period:\n`a ∝ P^(2/3)`\nTherefore, the ratio of the distances `a_2 / a_4` can be expressed as a ratio of the periods `P_2 / P_4`:\n`a_2 / a_4 = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)`\n\n### **Step 4: Combine the Relationships**\nNow, substitute the expression for the distance ratio (from Step 3) into the temperature ratio equation (from Step 2).\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = [ (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2)`\n\nUsing the rule of exponents `(x^m)^n = x^(m*n)`, we can simplify the expression:\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P_2 / P_4)^((2/3) * (1/2))`\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)`\nThis is the final formula needed: the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is equal to the cube root of the inverse ratio of their orbital periods.\n\n### **Step 5: Calculate the Numerical Value**\nThe problem provides the ratio of the orbital periods for the planets:\n`P_1 : P_2 : P_3 : P_4 : P_5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5`\nFrom this, we take the relative values for the periods of Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n*   `P_2 = 2`\n*   `P_4 = 3.5`\n\nNow, substitute these values into the formula from Step 4:\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)`\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (4 / 7)^(1/3)`\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3)`\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.8298`\n\n### **Step 6: Match the Result to the Options**\nThe calculated value, when rounded to two decimal places, is **0.83**. We now compare this to the provided options:\nA) ~0.57\nB) ~0.69\nC) ~0.75\nD) ~0.83\n\nThe calculated value directly matches option D.\n\n**Note on candidate answers:** A review of the provided candidate answers shows a near-unanimous agreement on the physical principles and the final calculated value of ~0.83. The discrepancies in the final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) arise from inconsistent listing or mapping of the multiple-choice options. The correct procedure is to match the calculated value to the options as presented in the original question, which leads to D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate solutions.\n\n### **1. Core Physics Principles**\n\nAll correct solutions rely on two fundamental principles of astrophysics:\n\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq):** The equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates. For planets orbiting the same star with the same albedo, the temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's orbital distance (`a`).\n    *   `T_eq ∝ a⁻¹ᐟ²`\n\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates a planet's orbital period (`P`) to its orbital distance (`a`). For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the distance.\n    *   `P² ∝ a³` or `a ∝ P²ᐟ³`\n\n### **2. Deriving the Final Formula**\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find a relationship between temperature (`T_eq`) and period (`P`). This is done by combining the two principles above:\n\n1.  Start with the temperature-distance relation: `T_eq ∝ a⁻¹ᐟ²`\n2.  Substitute the distance-period relation (`a ∝ P²ᐟ³`) into the first equation:\n    `T_eq ∝ (P²ᐟ³)⁻¹ᐟ²`\n3.  Use the rules of exponents `(x^m)^n = x^(m*n)` to simplify:\n    `T_eq ∝ P^((2/3) * (-1/2))`\n    `T_eq ∝ P⁻¹ᐟ³`\n4.  Now, we can write the ratio for Planet_4 and Planet_2:\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P4)⁻¹ᐟ³ / (P2)⁻¹ᐟ³ = (P4 / P2)⁻¹ᐟ³`\n5.  This can be rewritten to avoid the negative exponent:\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2 / P4)¹ᐟ³`\n\nThis derivation is consistently and correctly performed by almost all candidate agents, forming a strong consensus on the correct physical model.\n\n### **3.

For planets orbiting the same star and having the same albedo, all other factors cancel out in a ratio, leaving the proportionality:\n    `T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)` (Equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance).\n\n2.  **Orbital Distance and Orbital Period:** Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (`a`):\n    `P² ∝ a³`\n    This can be rearranged to express distance in terms of the period:\n    `a ∝ P^(2/3)`\n\n### **Step 3: Combine the Relationships**\nTo find the relationship between temperature and period, substitute the expression for `a` from Kepler's Law into the temperature proportionality:\n`T_eq ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2)`\nUsing the rules of exponents, we multiply the powers: `(2/3) * (-1/2) = -1/3`.\nThis gives the final, direct relationship:\n`T_eq ∝ P^(-1/3)`\n\n### **Step 4: Formulate the Required Ratio**\nWe need to find the ratio `T_eq4 / T_eq2`. Using the proportionality derived in the previous step:\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P4)^(-1/3) / (P2)^(-1/3) = (P4 / P2)^(-1/3)`\nThis is mathematically equivalent to:\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)`\n\nThis formula is derived correctly by the vast majority of the candidate answers.\n\n### **Step 5: Substitute the Given Values**\nThe problem provides the ratio of orbital periods as `P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5`.\nFrom this, we take the relative values for `P2` and `P4`:\n*   `P2` = 2\n*   `P4` = 3.5\n\nNow, we calculate the ratio `P2 / P4`:\n`P2 / P4 = 2 / 3.5`\n\n### **Step 6: Calculate the Final Result**\nSubstitute the period ratio into the temperature ratio formula:\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)`\n\nCalculating this value:\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3) ≈ 0.8298`\n\nRounding the result to two decimal places gives `0.83`.\n\n### **Step 7: Match with Options**\nThe calculated numerical answer is `~0.83`.

Identify the Physical Principles**\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature ($T_{eq}$):** For a planet orbiting a star, its equilibrium temperature is related to its orbital distance (semi-major axis, $a$). The energy received from the star decreases with the square of the distance ($1/a^2$). The planet radiates energy based on its temperature to the fourth power ($T^4$). In equilibrium, this leads to the proportionality:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law connects a planet's orbital period ($P$) to its semi-major axis ($a$).

The energy flux from the star decreases with the square of the distance ($1/a^2$). Since the radiated energy from the planet is proportional to $T_{eq}^4$ (from the Stefan-Boltzmann law), the equilibrium condition ($Energy_{in} = Energy_{out}$) gives us $T_{eq}^4 \\propto 1/a^2$. Taking the fourth root of both sides, we get the relationship:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\n    This means that the temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance.\n\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates a planet's orbital period (P) to its semi-major axis (a).

The energy received from the star decreases with the square of the distance (proportional to `1/a²`). This received energy must be balanced by radiated energy, which is proportional to `T_eq⁴` (from the Stefan-Boltzmann law).\n    Therefore, `T_eq⁴ ∝ 1/a²`.\n    Taking the fourth root of both sides, we get `T_eq ∝ (1/a²)^(1/4)`, which simplifies to `T_eq ∝ 1/a^(1/2)` or `T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)`.\n    This means the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance.

Identify Key Physical Principles**\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature ($T_{eq}$):** For a planet orbiting a specific star, its equilibrium temperature is primarily determined by its distance from the star (the semi-major axis, $a$) and its albedo (A). Since the problem states that all planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, the relationship simplifies to a proportionality. The energy a planet receives is inversely proportional to the square of its distance ($1/a^2$). The energy radiated is proportional to the fourth power of temperature ($T_{eq}^4$) according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law. In equilibrium, these are balanced, so $T_{eq}^4 \\propto 1/a^2$.

The incoming energy flux is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the star ($a$). The radiated energy is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature ($T_{eq}^4$).\nIn equilibrium, this leads to the relationship:\n$T_{eq}^4 \\propto \\frac{1}{a^2}$\nTaking the fourth root of both sides gives:\n$T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\nThis means the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's orbital distance. Since both planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, all other factors are constant and cancel out in the ratio.\n\n**Step 2: Relationship between Orbital Distance and Orbital Period**\nKepler's Third Law connects a planet's orbital distance ($a$) to its orbital period ($P$). For planets orbiting the same star:\n$P^2 \\propto a^3$\nTo use this in our temperature equation, we solve for distance in terms of the period:\n$a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n\n**Step 3: Combining the Relationships to Link Temperature and Period**\nBy substituting the expression for distance ($a$) from Step 2 into the temperature relationship from Step 1, we can find a direct link between temperature and period:\n$T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2} \\propto (P^{2/3})^{-1/2}$\nUsing the rule of exponents, we multiply the powers: $(\\frac{2}{3}) \\times (-\\frac{1}{2}) = -\\frac{1}{3}$. This gives the final relationship:\n$T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$\nThis crucial result shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n**Step 4: Calculating the Specific Ratio**\nThe question asks for the ratio of the temperature of Planet_4 to Planet_2 ($\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}}$). Using the proportionality from Step 3:\n$\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{P_4^{-1/3}}{P_2^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_4}{P_2}\\right)^{-1/3}$\nTo work with a positive exponent, we can invert the fraction inside the parentheses:\n$\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n**Step 5: Substituting the Given Values and Computing**\nThe problem gives the ratio of orbital periods as $P_1:P_2:P_3:P_4:P_5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5$.\nWe can extract the relative period values for the two planets in question:\n*   $P_2 = 2$\n*   $P_4 = 3.5$\nNow we substitute these into the equation from Step 4.\n\n```python\nP2 = 2\nP4 = 3.5\nratio = (P2 / P4)**(1/3)\nprint(ratio)\n```\n\nThe calculation yields approximately `0.82987`, which rounds to **0.83**.\n\n### Conclusion and Careful Points\n\n1.  **Consensus:** All 15 candidate answers agree on the physical principles, the derived formula `(P2 / P4)^(1/3)`, and the final numerical result of `~0.83`.\n2.  **Discrepancy:** The only disagreement among the candidates is the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D). This is explained by them receiving different orderings for the multiple-choice options.\n3.  **Correct Match:** The task is to match the universally agreed-upon numerical result (`~0.83`) to the options provided in the question:\n    A) ~0.57\n    B) ~0.69\n    C) ~0.75\n    D) ~0.83\n4.  **Final Answer:** The calculated value `~0.83` corresponds to option **D**. A careful point is ensuring the ratio is set up correctly as `T4/T2` leading to `(P2/P4)^(1/3)`, not the inverse, which would give a value greater than 1.\n\n<<<D>>>",

The energy received from the star decreases with the square of the distance ($1/a^2$). The temperature of the planet is related to its radiated energy by the Stefan-Boltzmann law ($P \\propto T^4$). In equilibrium, energy in equals energy out, leading to the relationship $T_{eq}^4 \\propto 1/a^2$, which simplifies to:\n        $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law**: This law connects a planet's orbital period ($P$) with its semi-major axis ($a$). For planets orbiting the same star, the law is $P^2 \\propto a^3$. We can rearrange this to express distance in terms of the period:\n        $a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n\n3.  **Combine the Physical Laws**: The problem gives us periods, but we need temperatures. We must combine the two laws to relate temperature directly to the period. We substitute the expression for $a$ from Kepler's Law into the temperature relationship.\n    *   We know $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\n    *   We also know $a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n    *   Substituting the second into the first: $T_{eq} \\propto (P^{2/3})^{-1/2}$\n    *   Using the rules of exponents, we multiply them: $(2/3) \\times (-1/2) = -1/3$.\n    *   This gives us the final relationship: $T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Ratio**: We can now write the ratio for the temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2 using their periods, $P_4$ and $P_2$.\n    *   $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{P_4^{-1/3}}{P_2^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_4}{P_2}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n5.  **Use Given Data for Calculation**: The problem provides the ratio of orbital periods as `1:2:2.5:3.5:5`. From this, we extract the relative values for $P_2$ and $P_4$:\n    *   $P_2 = 2$\n    *   $P_4 = 3.5$\n    *   Therefore, the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \\frac{2}{3.5}$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value**: Now we compute the value of the temperature ratio:\n    *   $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3.5}\\right)^{1/3}$\n    *   $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} \\approx (0.5714...)^{1/3} \\approx 0.8298...$\n\n7.  **Compare with Options and Conclude**: The calculated value is approximately `0.83`.

The discrepancies in their final chosen letters (A, B, C, or D) arise because the options seem to have been presented to them in a scrambled order. However, the scientific and mathematical consensus is overwhelming.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Understand the Physics Principles**\n\nThe problem requires understanding two key concepts in astrophysics:\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature ($T_{eq}$):** This is the theoretical temperature of a planet when the energy it absorbs from its star equals the energy it radiates back into space. The energy received from the star decreases with the square of the distance ($a$) from the star. The Stefan-Boltzmann law states that radiated energy is proportional to the fourth power of temperature ($T^4$). This leads to the relationship $T_{eq}^4 \\propto 1/a^2$, which simplifies to:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$ or $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates a planet's orbital period ($P$) to its semi-major axis ($a$). For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis:\n    $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n\n### **2. Combine the Principles to Find the Relationship between Temperature and Period**\n\nOur goal is to find the ratio of temperatures, but we are given periods. Therefore, we must derive a relationship between $T_{eq}$ and $P$.\n\n1.  Rearrange Kepler's Third Law to solve for the semi-major axis ($a$):\n    $a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n\n2.  Substitute this expression for $a$ into the equilibrium temperature relationship:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto (P^{2/3})^{-1/2}$\n\n3.  Simplify the exponent by multiplying the powers ($(2/3) \\times (-1/2) = -1/3$):\n    $T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\nThis final proportionality shows that a planet's equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of its orbital period.\n\n### **3. Set Up the Ratio Calculation**\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 ($\\frac{T_4}{T_2}$). Using the proportionality we just derived:\n\n$\\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\frac{P_4^{-1/3}}{P_2^{-1/3}} = (\\frac{P_4}{P_2})^{-1/3} = (\\frac{P_2}{P_4})^{1/3}$\n\n### **4. Substitute the Given Values and Calculate**\n\nThe problem provides the ratio of orbital periods as $P_1:P_2:P_3:P_4:P_5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5$.\nFrom this, we extract the relative values for $P_2$ and $P_4$:\n*   $P_2 = 2$\n*   $P_4 = 3.5$\n\nNow, substitute these into our equation:\n\n$\\frac{T_4}{T_2} = (\\frac{2}{3.5})^{1/3}$\n\nLet's calculate the numerical value:\n$\\frac{T_4}{T_2} = (\\frac{2}{3.5})^{1/3} \\approx (0.571428...)^{1/3} \\approx 0.8298...$\n\n### **5.

Let's compare this to the provided options:\n*   A) ~0.57\n*   B) ~0.83\n*   C) ~0.69\n*   D) ~0.75\n\nThe calculated value `~0.83` matches option B. The vast majority of the candidate agents correctly derived this value, even if they associated it with a different letter due to variations in their provided options. The underlying physics and calculation are consistent.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem requires us to determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures for two exoplanets based on the ratio of their orbital periods.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Establish the relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance.**\n    The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet depends on the energy it absorbs from its star. The energy flux decreases with the square of the distance ($a$) from the star. The temperature is related to radiated energy by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that power is proportional to $T^4$. In equilibrium, energy in equals energy out, leading to the relationship:\n    $T_{eq}^4 \\propto \\frac{1}{a^2}$\n    By taking the fourth root of both sides, we get:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\n    This means the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance. All other factors, such as the star's luminosity and the planets' albedo, are constant for this ratio since the planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo.\n\n2.  **Establish the relationship between Orbital Distance and Orbital Period.**\n    Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis ($a$, which is the orbital radius for the circular orbits in this problem).\n    $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n    We can rearrange this to express the distance in terms of the period:\n    $a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n\n3.  **Combine the two relationships.**\n    Now we can find a direct relationship between equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) and orbital period ($P$) by substituting the expression for $a$ from Step 2 into the temperature relationship from Step 1.\n    $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2} \\propto (P^{2/3})^{-1/2}$\n    Using the rules of exponents, we multiply the powers: $(\\frac{2}{3}) \\times (-\\frac{1}{2}) = -\\frac{1}{3}$. This gives us the final proportionality:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the required ratio.**\n    We need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 to that of Planet_2 ($\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}}$). Using the proportionality from Step 3:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{P_4^{-1/3}}{P_2^{-1/3}} = (\\frac{P_4}{P_2})^{-1/3} = (\\frac{P_2}{P_4})^{1/3}$\n\n5.  **Substitute the given values and compute.**\n    The problem gives the ratio of orbital periods as $P_1:P_2:P_3:P_4:P_5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5$.\n    From this, the relative period for Planet_2 is $P_2 = 2$ and for Planet_4 is $P_4 = 3.5$.\n    Plugging these values into our ratio formula:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = (\\frac{2}{3.5})^{1/3}$\n    First, let's simplify the fraction: $\\frac{2}{3.5} = \\frac{2}{7/2} = \\frac{4}{7}$.\n    So, the calculation is $(\\frac{4}{7})^{1/3} \\approx (0.5714)^{1/3} \\approx 0.8298$.\n\n6.  **Match the result with the given options.**\n    The calculated value is approximately `0.83`.\n    Comparing this to the options:\n    A) ~0.57\n    B) ~0.69\n    C) ~0.83\n    D) ~0.75\n    The result matches option C.\n\nThe overwhelming consensus among the candidate answers confirms this derivation and numerical result, with any discrepancies stemming from inconsistent labeling of the multiple-choice options rather than errors in calculation.

Core Physics Principles**\nThe solution relies on two fundamental principles of astrophysics:\n\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) of a planet depends on its distance (`a`, the semi-major axis) from its star. Since all the other factors are the same for both planets (same star, same albedo), the temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance:\n    `T_eq ∝ 1 / √a` or `T_eq ∝ a⁻¹ᐟ²`\n\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (`a`):\n    `P² ∝ a³`\n\n**3. Combine the Principles to Establish a Relationship**\nWe need to find the relationship between temperature (`T_eq`) and period (`P`), as the periods are the known quantities.\n\n*   First, rearrange Kepler's Third Law to express the distance (`a`) in terms of the period (`P`):\n    `a ∝ P²ᐟ³`\n*   Next, substitute this expression for `a` into the equilibrium temperature relationship:\n    `T_eq ∝ (P²ᐟ³)⁻¹ᐟ²`\n*   Using the rules of exponents, multiply them (`(2/3) * (-1/2) = -1/3`). This gives us the final, direct relationship:\n    `T_eq ∝ P⁻¹ᐟ³`\n\n**4. Formulate and Calculate the Ratio**\nNow, we can write the ratio for the temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2:\n\n*   `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P4 / P2)⁻¹ᐟ³`\n*   This is mathematically equivalent to: `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2 / P4)¹ᐟ³`\n\nThe problem provides the ratio of orbital periods as `1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5`. We can use the relative values for the periods of Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n*   `P2` corresponds to `2`.\n*   `P4` corresponds to `3.5`.\n\nSubstitute these values into the formula:\n*   `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)¹ᐟ³`\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n*   `T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ (0.5714...)¹ᐟ³ ≈ 0.8298...`\n\n**5.

For planets orbiting the same star and having the same albedo (as stated in the problem), the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance (`a`, the semi-major axis).\n*   **Relationship:** `T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)` or `T_eq ∝ 1/√a`\n\nUsing this proportionality, we can write the ratio of temperatures for Planet_4 and Planet_2 as:\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (a_4)^(-1/2) / (a_2)^(-1/2) = (a_4 / a_2)^(-1/2) = (a_2 / a_4)^(1/2)`\n\n### **Step 3: Relate Orbital Distance to Orbital Period**\nWe are not given the orbital distances, but we are given the orbital periods (`P`). Kepler's Third Law provides the connection between these two quantities for planets orbiting the same star. The square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis.\n*   **Relationship:** `P² ∝ a³`\n\nWe can rearrange this to express the distance in terms of the period:\n`a ∝ P^(2/3)`\nTherefore, the ratio of the distances `a_2 / a_4` can be expressed as a ratio of the periods `P_2 / P_4`:\n`a_2 / a_4 = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)`\n\n### **Step 4: Combine the Relationships**\nNow, substitute the expression for the distance ratio (from Step 3) into the temperature ratio equation (from Step 2).\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = [ (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2)`\n\nUsing the rule of exponents `(x^m)^n = x^(m*n)`, we can simplify the expression:\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P_2 / P_4)^((2/3) * (1/2))`\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)`\nThis is the final formula needed: the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is equal to the cube root of the inverse ratio of their orbital periods.\n\n### **Step 5: Calculate the Numerical Value**\nThe problem provides the ratio of the orbital periods for the planets:\n`P_1 : P_2 : P_3 : P_4 : P_5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5`\nFrom this, we take the relative values for the periods of Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n*   `P_2 = 2`\n*   `P_4 = 3.5`\n\nNow, substitute these values into the formula from Step 4:\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)`\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (4 / 7)^(1/3)`\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3)`\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.8298`\n\n### **Step 6: Match the Result to the Options**\nThe calculated value, when rounded to two decimal places, is **0.83**.

For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the distance.\n    *   `P² ∝ a³` or `a ∝ P²ᐟ³`\n\n### **2. Deriving the Final Formula**\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find a relationship between temperature (`T_eq`) and period (`P`). This is done by combining the two principles above:\n\n1.  Start with the temperature-distance relation: `T_eq ∝ a⁻¹ᐟ²`\n2.  Substitute the distance-period relation (`a ∝ P²ᐟ³`) into the first equation:\n    `T_eq ∝ (P²ᐟ³)⁻¹ᐟ²`\n3.

For planets orbiting the same star and having the same albedo, all other factors cancel out in a ratio, leaving the proportionality:\n    `T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)` (Equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance).\n\n2.  **Orbital Distance and Orbital Period:** Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (`a`):\n    `P² ∝ a³`\n    This can be rearranged to express distance in terms of the period:\n    `a ∝ P^(2/3)`\n\n### **Step 3: Combine the Relationships**\nTo find the relationship between temperature and period, substitute the expression for `a` from Kepler's Law into the temperature proportionality:\n`T_eq ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2)`\nUsing the rules of exponents, we multiply the powers: `(2/3) * (-1/2) = -1/3`.\nThis gives the final, direct relationship:\n`T_eq ∝ P^(-1/3)`\n\n### **Step 4: Formulate the Required Ratio**\nWe need to find the ratio `T_eq4 / T_eq2`. Using the proportionality derived in the previous step:\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P4)^(-1/3) / (P2)^(-1/3) = (P4 / P2)^(-1/3)`\nThis is mathematically equivalent to:\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)`\n\nThis formula is derived correctly by the vast majority of the candidate answers.\n\n### **Step 5: Substitute the Given Values**\nThe problem provides the ratio of orbital periods as `P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5`.\nFrom this, we take the relative values for `P2` and `P4`:\n*   `P2` = 2\n*   `P4` = 3.5\n\nNow, we calculate the ratio `P2 / P4`:\n`P2 / P4 = 2 / 3.5`\n\n### **Step 6: Calculate the Final Result**\nSubstitute the period ratio into the temperature ratio formula:\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)`\n\nCalculating this value:\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3) ≈ 0.8298`\n\nRounding the result to two decimal places gives `0.83`.\n\n### **Step 7: Match with Options**\nThe calculated numerical answer is `~0.83`.

Identify the Physical Principles**\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature ($T_{eq}$):** For a planet orbiting a star, its equilibrium temperature is related to its orbital distance (semi-major axis, $a$). The energy received from the star decreases with the square of the distance ($1/a^2$). The planet radiates energy based on its temperature to the fourth power ($T^4$). In equilibrium, this leads to the proportionality:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law connects a planet's orbital period ($P$) to its semi-major axis ($a$). For planets orbiting the same star, the relationship is:\n    $P^2 \\propto a^3$ which can be rearranged to $a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n\n**2. Combine the Principles to Form a Single Relationship**\nThe goal is to find a direct relationship between temperature ($T_{eq}$) and period ($P$).

This can be written as:\n        $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n\n2.  **Combine the principles to find a direct relationship between Temperature and Period.** We need to express temperature in terms of the period. To do this, we first rearrange Kepler's Law to solve for `a`:\n    $a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n    Now, substitute this expression for `a` into the temperature relationship:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto (P^{2/3})^{-1/2}$\n    Using the exponent rule $(x^m)^n = x^{mn}$, we get:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto P^{(2/3) \\times (-1/2)} = P^{-1/3}$\n    This establishes that a planet's equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of its orbital period.\n\n3.  **Formulate the ratio for Planet_4 and Planet_2.** The question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures $T_{eq4} / T_{eq2}$.

Thus, in equilibrium:\n    $T_{eq}^4 \\propto \\frac{1}{a^2}$\n    Taking the fourth root of both sides gives:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\n    This means the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance.\n\n2.  **Relationship between Orbital Distance and Orbital Period**\n    Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis ($a$):\n    $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n    We can express the orbital distance in terms of the orbital period:\n    $a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n\n3.  **Combining the Relationships**\n    To find the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital period, we substitute the expression for $a$ from Kepler's Law into the temperature relationship:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2} \\propto (P^{2/3})^{-1/2}$\n    Using the rules of exponents, we multiply them:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto P^{(2/3) \\times (-1/2)} = P^{-1/3}$\n    This shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Temperature Ratio**\n    We need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, which is $\\frac{T_4}{T_2}$. Using the proportionality from the previous step:\n    $\\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\frac{P_4^{-1/3}}{P_2^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_4}{P_2}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n5.  **Using the Given Period Ratios**\n    The problem provides the ratio of orbital periods as $P_1:P_2:P_3:P_4:P_5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5$.\n    From this, the relative value for $P_2$ is 2 and for $P_4$ is 3.5.\n    The ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \\frac{2}{3.5}$.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation**\n    Now, we compute the final ratio:\n    $\\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3.5}\\right)^{1/3} \\approx (0.5714)^{1/3} \\approx 0.8298$\n    Rounding this value to two decimal places gives 0.83.\n\n7.  **Matching with Options**\n    The calculated value is ~0.83. Comparing this to the provided options:\n    A) ~0.75\n    B) ~0.83\n    C) ~0.57\n    D) ~0.69\n\nThe calculated result matches option B. The candidate answers mostly agree on the numerical value of ~0.83, but differ in their final letter choice due to different permutations of the options. Based on the options provided in the problem statement, 0.83 is option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the final answer:\n\n### **1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, which can be written as $T_4 / T_2$.\n\n### **2. Identify Key Physical Principles**\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature ($T_{eq}$):** For a planet orbiting a specific star, its equilibrium temperature is primarily determined by its distance from the star (the semi-major axis, $a$) and its albedo (A). Since the problem states that all planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, the relationship simplifies to a proportionality. The energy a planet receives is inversely proportional to the square of its distance ($1/a^2$). The energy radiated is proportional to the fourth power of temperature ($T_{eq}^4$) according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law. In equilibrium, these are balanced, so $T_{eq}^4 \\propto 1/a^2$. Taking the fourth root of both sides gives:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$ or $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates a planet's orbital period ($P$) to its semi-major axis ($a$). For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis:\n    $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n\n### **3. Combine the Principles to Find a Solution**\nOur goal is to find a relationship between temperature ($T_{eq}$) and period ($P$). We can do this by substituting one formula into the other.\n\n1.  Rearrange Kepler's Third Law to solve for $a$:\n    $a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n\n2.  Substitute this expression for $a$ into the equilibrium temperature proportionality:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto (P^{2/3})^{-1/2}$\n\n3.  Simplify the expression using the rules of exponents (multiply them: $2/3 \\times -1/2 = -1/3$):\n    $T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n### **4. Formulate the Ratio**\nUsing the final proportionality, we can set up the ratio for Planet_4 and Planet_2:\n$\\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\frac{(P_4)^{-1/3}}{(P_2)^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_4}{P_2}\\right)^{-1/3}$\n\nThis can be rewritten more simply by inverting the fraction and making the exponent positive:\n$\\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n### **5. Insert the Given Values and Calculate**\nThe problem states the orbital periods are in a ratio of $1:2:2.5:3.5:5$.\n*   The relative period for Planet_2 ($P_2$) is 2.\n*   The relative period for Planet_4 ($P_4$) is 3.5.\n\nNow, we calculate the final value:\n$\\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3.5}\\right)^{1/3}$\n$\\frac{T_4}{T_2} \\approx (0.5714)^{1/3}$\n$\\frac{T_4}{T_2} \\approx 0.8298$\n\n### **6. Compare with Options**\nRounding the calculated value to two decimal places gives **0.83**. We compare this with the provided choices:\nA) ~0.57\nB) ~0.69\nC) ~0.75\nD) ~0.83\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.83 directly matches option D. An analysis of the candidate answers shows that while most correctly derived the physics and performed the calculation, many made errors in matching their result to the correct option letter, likely due to using a jumbled list of options. The physics and calculation, however, are overwhelmingly consistent.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",
