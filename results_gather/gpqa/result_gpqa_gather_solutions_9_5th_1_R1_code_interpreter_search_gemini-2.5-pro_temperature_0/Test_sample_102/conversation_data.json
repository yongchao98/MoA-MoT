Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Core Structure:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Key Feature:** The substituents are in a **1,3,5-relationship**. All three groups are positioned *meta* relative to each other. This specific substitution pattern is the most critical clue for determining the correct order of reactions.\n\n### **2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\nThe order of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) is governed by the directing effects of the groups already on the ring.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n### **3. Formulate the Optimal Synthetic Strategy**\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern in high yield, the synthesis must be planned logically. The most effective strategy is to install a **meta-director** first.\n\n*   **Strategy 1: Start with Bromination (Option A).** If we add the bromo group first, it acts as an *ortho, para*-director. The next substitution would yield a mixture of 1,2- and 1,4-disubstituted products, not the required 1,3-pattern. This is an incorrect approach.\n\n*   **Strategy 2: Start with Nitration (Options B and D).** If we add the nitro group first, we get nitrobenzene. While the nitro group is a *meta*-director, it is also strongly deactivating. A subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add the -COCH₃ group) would fail on the highly deactivated nitrobenzene ring. Therefore, any sequence that attempts this is not a high-yield route.\n    *   Option B is also incorrect because the first four steps constitute a pointless loop that converts benzene back into benzene.\n    *   Option D is incorrect because it attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline (formed in steps i and ii), which fails because the basic amino group (-NH₂) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃).\n\n*   **Strategy 3: Start with Acylation (Option C).** This is the most promising and correct strategy.\n    1.  **Step i (Acylation):** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) to form acetophenone. This is an excellent first step as it installs a **meta-directing** acetyl group.\n    2.  **Step ii (Bromination):** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone correctly guides the incoming bromine (Br₂/FeBr₃) to the 3-position, forming 3-bromoacetophenone. This establishes the required 1,3-relationship.\n    3.  **Step iii (Nitration):** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) is performed. The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. Although the bromo group directs to other positions (2, 4, 6), substitution at C5 is the major product because it is meta to both deactivating groups. This step successfully yields the target molecule.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe only chemically sound pathway that leads to the desired product in high yield is presented in option C. It correctly utilizes the directing effects of the substituents by first installing a meta-director (the acetyl group), which then guides the subsequent substitutions to achieve the required 1,3,5-pattern. The first three steps of option C constitute the complete and correct synthesis.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful analysis of the directing effects of the substituents and the feasibility of the reactions is necessary.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Core Structure:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Key Feature:** The substituents are in a **1,3,5-relationship**. This means all three groups are positioned *meta* to each other. This specific substitution pattern is the most critical clue for determining the correct reaction order.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Substituent Properties\nThe order of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) is governed by the directing effects of the groups already on the ring.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** A deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** A deactivating group but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** A strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n\n### Step 3: Formulate the Optimal Synthetic Strategy\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the synthesis must be planned to use these directing effects advantageously. The most logical strategy is to install a *meta*-director first.\n\n1.  **Choosing the First Step:**\n    *   Starting with bromination (Option A) would place an *ortho, para*-director on the ring, leading to 1,2- and 1,4-disubstituted products in the next step, which is incorrect for the desired 1,3,5-pattern.\n    *   Starting with nitration (Options C and D) would add a *meta*-director. However, the nitro group is so strongly deactivating that a subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add the -COCH₃ group) would fail or give an extremely low yield. Therefore, this is not a high-yield strategy.\n    *   Starting with **Friedel-Crafts acylation** (Option B) is the best approach. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director, and it does not deactivate the ring so severely as to prevent further substitutions.\n\n2.  **Determining the Subsequent Steps:**\n    *   **Step i: Acylation.** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This correctly installs a *meta*-director.\n    *   **Step ii: Bromination.** With acetophenone as the substrate, the *meta*-directing acetyl group will guide the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    *   **Step iii: Nitration.** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the C5 position. Although the bromo group directs to other positions, the position at C5 is electronically favored, leading to the desired **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one** as the major product.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options\nBased on the analysis, the only chemically sound, high-yield pathway is: **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**.\n\n*   **A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ...:** Incorrect. Starts with an ortho, para-director.\n*   **B) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...:** Correct. This sequence follows the optimal pathway: acylation, then bromination, then nitration. The first three steps successfully synthesize the target molecule. The subsequent steps listed are superfluous for this particular synthesis but do not invalidate the correctness of the initial, successful route.\n*   **C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...:** Incorrect. This sequence attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline, which fails because the basic amino group reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst.\n*   **D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂...:** Incorrect. This sequence is a pointless loop that starts with benzene and regenerates it after four steps.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan to solve this task is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule**: I will first examine the structure of the final product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. The key is to identify the substituents (acetyl, bromo, nitro) and their relative positions on the benzene ring (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n2.  **Analyze Substituent Properties**: I will review the properties of each substituent, specifically their directing effects in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) and their activating/deactivating nature.\n    *   Acetyl group (-COCH₃): meta-director, deactivating.\n    *   Bromo group (-Br): ortho, para-director, deactivating.\n    *   Nitro group (-NO₂): meta-director, strongly deactivating.\n3.  **Formulate the Optimal Synthetic Strategy**: Based on the target structure and substituent properties, I will determine the most logical order of reactions. The goal is to use the directing effects to place each group in the correct position. I will also consider reaction limitations, such as the failure of Friedel-Crafts reactions on strongly deactivated rings.\n4.  **Evaluate Each Option**: I will systematically analyze each of the provided reaction sequences (A, B, C, D) against the optimal strategy. I will identify which sequence is chemically sound and leads to the desired product in high yield.\n5.  **Synthesize the Final Answer**: I will consolidate the analysis to make a final decision and present the reasoning clearly.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_synthesis():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one and determines the correct reaction sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule\n    target_molecule = \"1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\"\n    substituents = {\n        \"1\": \"Acetyl group (-COCH3)\",\n        \"3\": \"Bromo group (-Br)\",\n        \"5\": \"Nitro group (-NO2)\"\n    }\n    pattern = \"1,3,5-substitution pattern.

This correctly installs a *meta*-director (-COCH₃) that is only moderately deactivating, allowing for further substitutions.\n    *   **ii) Br₂/FeBr₃:** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone guides the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    *   **iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the C5 position. This position is electronically favored, leading to the desired **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one** as the major product.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is chemically sound and provides a high-yield route to the desired product.\n\n2.  **Starting with Bromination (Option A):** This is incorrect. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director, which would lead to 1,2- and 1,4-disubstituted products in the next step, not the required 1,3,5-pattern.\n\n3.  **Starting with Nitration (Options B and D):** This is also incorrect.\n    *   In Option B, the initial steps (nitration, then reduction) form aniline. The subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation fails because the basic amino group reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst.\n    *   In Option D, the first four steps constitute a pointless loop that converts benzene back into benzene.\n    *   Furthermore, any strategy that involves nitrating first and then acylating would fail because the strongly deactivating nitro group prevents the Friedel-Crafts acylation from occurring.\n\n### Final Decision\nBased on the chemical principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution, the only option that describes a viable, high-yield synthetic route is C. It correctly utilizes the directing effects of the substituents by first installing a meta-director (the acetyl group), which then guides the subsequent substitutions to achieve the required 1,3,5-pattern.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nTo decide the final answer, a systematic analysis of the chemical synthesis is required. The process involves understanding the target molecule, the properties of the chemical reactions involved, and the directing effects of substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Core Structure:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Key Point:** The most critical feature is the **1,3,5-substitution pattern**. All three groups are positioned *meta* relative to each other. This pattern dictates the required order of reactions.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Substituent Properties and Reaction Limitations**\n\nThe order of substitution is determined by the directing effects of the groups already on the ring and the feasibility of the reactions.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n    *   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n    *   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Reaction Limitations:**\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (adding the -COCH₃ group):** This reaction fails on strongly deactivated rings (e.g., nitrobenzene). It also fails when an amino group (-NH₂) is present, as the basic nitrogen reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst.\n\n### **Step 3: Formulate the Optimal Synthetic Pathway**\n\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the synthesis must be planned to use the directing effects advantageously.\n1.  **Choosing the First Step:**\n    *   Starting with bromination is incorrect. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director, which would lead to 1,2- and 1,4-disubstituted products, not the required 1,3,5-pattern.\n    *   Starting with nitration is also incorrect. While the nitro group is a *meta*-director, it is so strongly deactivating that the subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation step would fail.\n    *   The only viable first step is **Friedel-Crafts acylation**. This installs the acetyl group, which is a *meta*-director but is only moderately deactivating, allowing for further substitutions.\n\n2.  **Determining the Subsequent Steps:**\n    *   **Step i: Acylation.** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This correctly installs a *meta*-director.\n    *   **Step ii: Bromination.** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone guides the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    *   **Step iii: Nitration.** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the C5 position. This position is favored, leading to the desired final product.\n\nThe only high-yield, chemically sound pathway is: **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**.\n\n### **Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nNow, we match this correct pathway to the options provided in the question.\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n    This sequence attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline (formed in steps i and ii). This reaction fails. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...**\n    This sequence follows the exact pathway determined to be correct: Acylation → Bromination → Nitration. The first three steps successfully produce the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous for this synthesis, but the initial, core pathway is correct. **Correct.**\n\n*   **C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂...**\n    This sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) is a pointless loop that starts with benzene and regenerates benzene. It does not produce the target molecule. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n    This sequence starts with bromination, installing an *ortho, para*-director, which leads to the wrong isomers. **Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the only option that describes a viable synthetic route is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a systematic analysis based on the principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution is required.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe desired product is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Core Structure:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Key Feature:** The substituents are arranged in a **1,3,5-pattern**. This means each substituent is *meta* to the other two. This specific arrangement is the most critical factor in determining the correct order of reactions.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\nThe order in which the substituents are added is crucial because existing groups on the ring direct the position of incoming groups.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** A deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** A deactivating group but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** A strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n\n### **Step 3: Formulate the Optimal Synthetic Strategy**\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the synthesis must be planned to take advantage of these directing effects.\n1.  **Choosing the First Step:** The most logical strategy is to first install a **meta-director**.\n    *   Starting with bromination (an *ortho, para*-director) is incorrect as it would lead to 1,2- and 1,4-disubstituted products.\n    *   Starting with nitration is also not ideal. Although the nitro group is a *meta*-director, it is so strongly deactivating that a subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add the acetyl group) would fail or give an extremely low yield.\n    *   Therefore, the best first step is **Friedel-Crafts acylation**. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director and is only moderately deactivating, allowing for further substitutions.\n\n2.  **Determining the Subsequent Steps:**\n    *   **Step i: Acylation.** Benzene reacts with CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ to form acetophenone. This correctly installs a *meta*-directing group.\n    *   **Step ii: Bromination.** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone guides the incoming bromine to the 3-position, forming 3-bromoacetophenone. This establishes the correct 1,3-relationship.\n    *   **Step iii: Nitration.** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the C5 position. This position is the most favorable, leading to the desired final product.\n\nThe only viable, high-yield pathway is: **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**.\n\n### **Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options**\nNow, we match this correct pathway to the options provided.\n\n*   **A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ...:** This sequence starts with bromination, installing an *ortho, para*-director. This is an incorrect strategy for achieving a 1,3,5-pattern.\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...:** This sequence forms aniline (from steps i and ii) and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation. This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH₂) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃).\n*   **C) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...:** This sequence follows the exact pathway determined to be correct: **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**. The first three steps successfully produce the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous for this synthesis, but the initial pathway is correct and leads to the product.\n*   **D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂...:** This sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) is a pointless loop that starts with benzene and regenerates benzene. It does not produce the target molecule.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only option that describes a chemically sound and high-yield route to the desired product is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer by evaluating the provided candidate answers and the underlying chemical principles.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Question**\n*   **Goal:** Synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene.\n*   **Task:** Identify the correct sequence of reactions from the given options.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Target Molecule's Structure**\n*   The molecule has a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   **Substituent 1:** Acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n*   **Substituent 2:** Bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   **Substituent 3:** Nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Key Feature:** The substituents are in a **1,3,5-relationship**. All groups are *meta* to each other. This substitution pattern is the most critical clue for determining the correct reaction order.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Chemical Principles (Substituent Directing Effects)**\nThe order of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) is governed by the directing effects of the groups already on the ring.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** A deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** A deactivating group but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** A strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n\n### **4. Formulate the Optimal Synthetic Strategy**\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the synthesis must be planned logically.\n*   **Point 1: The first substituent must be a meta-director.** Starting with bromination (an ortho, para-director) would lead to 1,2- and 1,4-products, which is incorrect. This immediately invalidates **Option C**.\n*   **Point 2: Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on strongly deactivated rings.** The two possible meta-directing first steps are nitration or acylation. If we perform nitration first, the resulting nitrobenzene is too strongly deactivated for a subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add the -COCH₃ group). Therefore, any sequence that attempts to acylate nitrobenzene is not a high-yield pathway.\n*   **Point 3: Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on anilines.** The basic amino group (-NH₂) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), deactivating the ring. This invalidates **Option A**, which creates aniline and then attempts acylation.\n*   **Point 4: The only viable first step is Acylation.** Starting with Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) places a moderately deactivating, meta-directing acetyl group on the ring. This is the correct first step.\n*   **Point 5: Subsequent steps.**\n    *   After acylation, we have acetophenone. The meta-directing acetyl group will guide the next substituent to the 3-position. Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃) correctly yields 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    *   Finally, nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) of 3-bromoacetophenone will add the nitro group. The acetyl group directs to C5, and while the bromo group directs elsewhere, the C5 position is favored, yielding the final 1,3,5-product.\n\n### **5. Evaluate the Options Based on the Correct Strategy**\nThe only viable, high-yield pathway is: **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**.\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**: Incorrect. Fails at step (iii) due to reaction between aniline and AlCl₃.\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂...**: Incorrect. This is a pointless series of reactions that regenerates the starting material, benzene.\n*   **C) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...**: Incorrect. Starts with an ortho, para-director, which will not lead to the 1,3,5-pattern.\n*   **D) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...**: **Correct**. The first three steps follow the exact optimal pathway: Acylation → Bromination → Nitration. The subsequent steps listed are superfluous for this synthesis, but the initial, core pathway is the only one among the options that correctly and efficiently produces the target molecule.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe overwhelming consensus in the reasoning of the candidate answers, combined with a rigorous analysis of chemical principles, points to a single correct synthetic route. This route begins with acylation, followed by bromination, and then nitration. This sequence corresponds exactly to the first three steps of Option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Core Structure:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Key Feature:** The substituents are in a **1,3,5-relationship**. All three groups are positioned *meta* relative to each other. This specific substitution pattern is the most critical clue for determining the correct reaction order.\n\n### **2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\nThe order of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) is crucial. The directing effects of the substituents already on the ring determine where the next group will be added.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n### **3. Formulate the Optimal Synthetic Strategy**\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern in high yield, the synthesis must be planned logically. The most effective strategy is to install a **meta-director** first.\n\n*   **Starting with Bromination:** If we add the bromo group first, it acts as an *ortho, para*-director. The next substitution would yield a mixture of 1,2- and 1,4-disubstituted products, not the required 1,3-pattern. This is an incorrect approach.\n*   **Starting with Nitration:** If we add the nitro group first, we get nitrobenzene. While the nitro group is a *meta*-director, it is also strongly deactivating. A subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add the -COCH₃ group) would fail on the highly deactivated nitrobenzene ring. Therefore, any sequence that attempts this is not viable for high yield.\n*   **Starting with Acylation:** This is the most promising and correct strategy.\n    1.  **Step i (Acylation):** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts acylation to form acetophenone. This is an excellent first step as it installs a **meta-directing** acetyl group.\n    2.  **Step ii (Bromination):** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone correctly guides the incoming bromine to the 3-position, forming 3-bromoacetophenone. This establishes the required 1,3-relationship.\n    3.  **Step iii (Nitration):** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. Although the bromo group directs to other positions (2, 4, 6), substitution at C5 is the major product because it is meta to both deactivating groups. This step successfully yields the target molecule.\n\nThe only chemically sound pathway that leads to the desired product is: **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**.\n\n### **4.

Formulate the Optimal Synthetic Strategy**\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the synthesis must be planned logically. The most effective strategy is to install a *meta*-director first.\n\n*   **Strategy 1: Start with Bromination.** This is incorrect.

Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Core Structure:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Key Structural Feature:** The substituents are in a **1,3,5-relationship**. This means all three groups are positioned *meta* to each other. This specific substitution pattern is the most critical clue for determining the correct order of reactions.\n\n### **2. List the Careful Points (Chemical Principles)**\n\nTo devise a high-yield synthesis, we must consider the following principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n\n*   **Directing Effects of Substituents:** The group(s) already on the ring direct the next incoming group to specific positions.\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** A deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n    *   **Bromo group (-Br):** A deactivating group but an **ortho, para-director**.\n    *   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** A strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Reaction Feasibility and Limitations:**\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃):** This reaction is essential for adding the acetyl group. However, it **fails** on strongly deactivated rings (e.g., nitrobenzene) because the ring is too electron-poor. It also fails on rings with an amino group (-NH₂) because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic nitrogen atom.\n\n### **3. Develop the Optimal Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe strategy must be planned to create the 1,3,5-pattern by using the directing effects advantageously.\n\n*   **Step 1: The First Substitution.**\n    *   Starting with **bromination** (`Br₂/FeBr₃`) is incorrect. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director, which would lead to 1,2- and 1,4-disubstituted products, not the required 1,3-pattern.\n    *   Starting with **nitration** (`HNO₃/H₂SO₄`) is not a viable high-yield route. Although the nitro group is a *meta*-director, it deactivates the ring so strongly that the subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation step would fail.\n    *   The best first step is **Friedel-Crafts acylation** (`CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`). This adds the acetyl group, which is a *meta*-director and only moderately deactivates the ring, allowing for further substitutions.\n\n*   **Step 2: The Second Substitution.**\n    *   Starting with acetophenone (from Step 1), we perform **bromination**. The *meta*-directing acetyl group guides the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n\n*   **Step 3: The Third Substitution.**\n    *   Starting with 3-bromoacetophenone, we perform **nitration**. The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. The bromo group directs to C2, C4, and C6. In this case of competing directors, substitution at C5 is the major product because it is meta to both deactivating groups, which is an electronically favorable position. This step successfully yields the target molecule.\n\nThe only viable, high-yield pathway is: **i) Acylation → ii) Bromination → iii) Nitration**.\n\n### **4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nNow, we match this correct pathway to the options provided in the question.\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline (formed in steps i and ii).

The subsequent steps listed (iv-vii) are superfluous for this synthesis, but the initial, core pathway is correct. **Correct.**\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Core Structure:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Key Feature:** The substituents are in a **1,3,5-relationship**. All three groups are positioned *meta* relative to each other. This specific substitution pattern is the most critical clue for determining the correct reaction order.\n\n### **2. Analyze Substituent Properties and Reaction Limitations**\n\nThe order of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) is crucial. We must consider the directing effects of the substituents and the feasibility of the reactions.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n    *   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n    *   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Reaction Feasibility:**\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (FCA):** This reaction (e.g., CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) fails on strongly deactivated rings, such as nitrobenzene. It also fails on aniline because the basic amino group reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃).\n\n### **3. Formulate the Optimal Synthetic Strategy**\n\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern in high yield, the synthesis must be planned logically. The most effective strategy is to install a *meta*-director first.\n\n1.  **Choosing the First Step:**\n    *   Starting with **bromination** is incorrect. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director and would lead to 1,2- and 1,4-disubstituted products, not the required 1,3,5-pattern.\n    *   Starting with **nitration** is not a viable high-yield strategy. Although the nitro group is a *meta*-director, it strongly deactivates the ring, which would cause the subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation step to fail.\n    *   Therefore, the only logical first step is **Friedel-Crafts acylation**. This installs the acetyl group, which is a *meta*-director but is only moderately deactivating, allowing for further substitutions.\n\n2.  **Determining the Subsequent Steps:**\n    *   **Step i: Acylation.** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This correctly installs the *meta*-directing acetyl group at position 1.\n    *   **Step ii: Bromination.** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone will guide the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    *   **Step iii: Nitration.** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The powerful *meta*-directing acetyl group will guide the incoming nitro group to the C5 position. This position is also favored because it is meta to both deactivating groups, successfully yielding the target molecule, **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n\n### **4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nThe only chemically sound, high-yield pathway is: **i) Acylation → ii) Bromination → iii) Nitration**. Now, we match this correct pathway to the options provided.\n\n*   **A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ...**: This sequence starts with bromination, installing an *ortho, para*-director. This is an incorrect strategy.\n*   **B) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...**: This sequence follows the exact pathway determined to be correct: Acylation → Bromination → Nitration. The first three steps produce the desired product. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous for this synthesis, but the initial sequence is the only valid one among the choices that leads to the target molecule.\n*   **C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂...**: This sequence is a pointless loop that starts with benzene and regenerates benzene after four steps. It does not produce the target molecule.\n*   **D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**: This sequence forms aniline (the product of steps i and ii) and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation. This reaction fails because the basic amino group of aniline reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst.\n\nBased on the analysis, Option B is the only one that contains a chemically viable route to the target molecule.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Problem**\n\n*   **Target Molecule:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene.\n*   **Task:** Identify the correct sequence of reactions for a high-yield synthesis.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Target Molecule's Structure**\n\nThe most critical feature of the target molecule is the substitution pattern on the benzene ring:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) is at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) is at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO₂) is at position 5.\n\nThis is a **1,3,5-substitution pattern**, where all three groups are *meta* to each other. This pattern is the primary clue for determining the correct order of reactions.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Chemical Principles (Consensus from all answers)**\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the same core chemical principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n\n*   **Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** A deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n    *   **Bromo group (-Br):** A deactivating group but an **ortho, para-director**.\n    *   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** A strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Reaction Limitations:**\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (adding the -COCH₃ group):** This reaction fails on strongly deactivated rings (like nitrobenzene) and on aniline (due to the basic -NH₂ group reacting with the AlCl₃ catalyst).\n\n### **4. Synthesize the Optimal Strategy (Consensus from all answers)**\n\nBased on the principles above, every candidate answer correctly deduces the only viable, high-yield strategy:\n\n1.  **Start with a meta-director that allows further reactions.** Starting with bromination is incorrect because it's an *ortho, para*-director. Starting with nitration is incorrect because the resulting nitrobenzene is too deactivated for the necessary next step of Friedel-Crafts acylation. Therefore, the synthesis **must** begin with **Friedel-Crafts acylation**.\n    *   **Step i: CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ (Acylation).** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This installs the meta-directing acetyl group.\n\n2.  **Install the second substituent.** The meta-directing acetyl group will guide the next substituent to the 3-position.\n    *   **Step ii: Br₂/FeBr₃ (Bromination).** This correctly forms 3-bromoacetophenone, establishing the 1,3-relationship.\n\n3.  **Install the final substituent.** The ring now has a meta-director (-COCH₃) and an ortho, para-director (-Br). The powerful meta-directing effect of the acetyl group guides the incoming nitro group to the 5-position.\n    *   **Step iii: HNO₃/H₂SO₄ (Nitration).** This yields the final target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThe only correct core sequence is: **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**.\n\n### **5. Final Decision: Match the Strategy to the Options**\n\nNow, we match this universally agreed-upon correct sequence to the options provided in the original question.\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄...** Incorrect. Starts with nitration.\n*   **B) i) Br₂/FeBr₃...** Incorrect. Starts with bromination.\n*   **C) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄...** **Correct.** The first three steps perfectly match the optimal synthetic pathway. The subsequent steps listed (iv-vii) are superfluous for this particular synthesis but do not invalidate the correctness of the initial, successful route.\n*   **D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄...** Incorrect. Starts with nitration.\n\nDespite numerous labeling errors in the candidate answers, the underlying chemical reasoning is unanimous and points to a single correct pathway. This pathway is described in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful analysis of the directing effects of the substituents and the feasibility of the reactions is necessary.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Core Structure:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.

This specific substitution pattern is the most critical clue for determining the correct reaction order.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\n\nThe order of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) is governed by the directing effects of the groups already on the ring.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n### **Step 3: Formulate the Optimal Synthetic Strategy**\n\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the synthesis must be planned to use these directing effects advantageously. The most logical strategy is to install a *meta*-director first.\n\n1.  **Choosing the First Step:**\n    *   **Starting with Bromination:** This is incorrect. Adding the bromo group first would place an *ortho, para*-director on the ring, leading to 1,2- and 1,4-disubstituted products in the next step, not the required 1,3,5-pattern.\n    *   **Starting with Nitration:** This is not a high-yield strategy. Although the nitro group is a *meta*-director, it is so strongly deactivating that a subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add the -COCH₃ group) would fail or give an extremely low yield.\n    *   **Starting with Acylation:** This is the correct approach. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director and is only moderately deactivating, allowing for further substitutions.\n\n2.  **Developing the Sequence:**\n    *   **Step i: Acylation.** Benzene reacts with CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ to form acetophenone.

This specific substitution pattern is the most critical clue for determining the correct order of reactions.\n\n### **2. List the Careful Points (Chemical Principles)**\nTo devise a high-yield synthesis, we must consider the following principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n\n*   **Point 1: Substituent Directing Effects:** The group(s) already on the ring direct the next incoming group to specific positions.\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** A deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n    *   **Bromo group (-Br):** A deactivating group but an **ortho, para-director**.\n    *   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** A strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n\n*   **Point 2: Reaction Feasibility and Limitations:**\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (FCA):** This reaction (e.g., `CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`) is essential for adding the acetyl group. However, it **fails** on strongly deactivated rings (like nitrobenzene) because the ring is too electron-poor. It also **fails** on rings with an amino group (-NH₂) because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic nitrogen atom.\n\n### **3. Develop the Optimal Synthetic Strategy**\nThe strategy must be planned to create the 1,3,5-pattern by using the directing effects advantageously.\n\n*   **Step 1: The First Substitution.**\n    *   Starting with **bromination** (`Br₂/FeBr₃`) is incorrect.

Formulate the Optimal Synthetic Strategy**\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern in high yield, the synthesis must be planned logically. The most effective strategy is to install a **meta-director** first.\n\n*   **Strategy 1: Start with Bromination (Option A).** If we add the bromo group first, it acts as an *ortho, para*-director. The next substitution would yield a mixture of 1,2- and 1,4-disubstituted products, not the required 1,3-pattern. This is an incorrect approach.\n\n*   **Strategy 2: Start with Nitration (Options B and D).** If we add the nitro group first, we get nitrobenzene. While the nitro group is a *meta*-director, it is also strongly deactivating. A subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add the -COCH₃ group) would fail on the highly deactivated nitrobenzene ring. Therefore, any sequence that attempts this is not a high-yield route.\n    *   Option B is also incorrect because the first four steps constitute a pointless loop that converts benzene back into benzene.\n    *   Option D is incorrect because it attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline (formed in steps i and ii), which fails because the basic amino group (-NH₂) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃).\n\n*   **Strategy 3: Start with Acylation (Option C).** This is the most promising and correct strategy.\n    1.  **Step i (Acylation):** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) to form acetophenone. This is an excellent first step as it installs a **meta-directing** acetyl group.\n    2.  **Step ii (Bromination):** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone correctly guides the incoming bromine (Br₂/FeBr₃) to the 3-position, forming 3-bromoacetophenone. This establishes the required 1,3-relationship.\n    3.  **Step iii (Nitration):** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) is performed. The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. Although the bromo group directs to other positions (2, 4, 6), substitution at C5 is the major product because it is meta to both deactivating groups. This step successfully yields the target molecule.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe only chemically sound pathway that leads to the desired product in high yield is presented in option C. It correctly utilizes the directing effects of the substituents by first installing a meta-director (the acetyl group), which then guides the subsequent substitutions to achieve the required 1,3,5-pattern. The first three steps of option C constitute the complete and correct synthesis.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful analysis of the directing effects of the substituents and the feasibility of the reactions is necessary.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Core Structure:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.

Therefore, this is not a high-yield strategy.\n    *   Starting with **Friedel-Crafts acylation** (Option B) is the best approach. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director, and it does not deactivate the ring so severely as to prevent further substitutions.\n\n2.  **Determining the Subsequent Steps:**\n    *   **Step i: Acylation.** Benzene is converted to acetophenone.

The key is to identify the substituents (acetyl, bromo, nitro) and their relative positions on the benzene ring (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n2.  **Analyze Substituent Properties**: I will review the properties of each substituent, specifically their directing effects in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) and their activating/deactivating nature.\n    *   Acetyl group (-COCH₃): meta-director, deactivating.\n    *   Bromo group (-Br): ortho, para-director, deactivating.\n    *   Nitro group (-NO₂): meta-director, strongly deactivating.\n3.  **Formulate the Optimal Synthetic Strategy**: Based on the target structure and substituent properties, I will determine the most logical order of reactions. The goal is to use the directing effects to place each group in the correct position. I will also consider reaction limitations, such as the failure of Friedel-Crafts reactions on strongly deactivated rings.\n4.  **Evaluate Each Option**: I will systematically analyze each of the provided reaction sequences (A, B, C, D) against the optimal strategy.

Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Core Structure:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents and Positions:**\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Key Feature:** The substituents are in a **1,3,5-relationship**. All three groups are positioned *meta* relative to each other. This specific substitution pattern is the most critical clue for determining the correct order of reactions.\n\n**2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\nThe order of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) is governed by the directing effects of the groups already on the ring.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** A deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** A deactivating group but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** A strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Formulate the Optimal Synthetic Strategy**\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern in high yield, the synthesis must be planned logically. The most effective strategy is to install a **meta-director** first.\n\n*   **Strategy 1: Start with Bromination.** If we add the bromo group first, it acts as an *ortho, para*-director. The next substitution would yield a mixture of 1,2- and 1,4-disubstituted products, not the required 1,3-pattern. This is an incorrect approach.\n\n*   **Strategy 2: Start with Nitration.** If we add the nitro group first, we get nitrobenzene. While the nitro group is a *meta*-director, it is also strongly deactivating. A subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add the -COCH₃ group) would fail or give an extremely low yield because the ring is too electron-poor. This is not a viable high-yield strategy.\n\n*   **Strategy 3: Start with Acylation.** This is the most promising strategy.\n    1.  **Step i (Acylation):** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) to form acetophenone. This is an excellent first step as it installs a **meta-directing** acetyl group. The ring is deactivated, but not so much that further reactions are prevented.\n    2.  **Step ii (Bromination):** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone correctly guides the incoming bromine to the 3-position, forming 3-bromoacetophenone. This establishes the required 1,3-relationship.\n    3.  **Step iii (Nitration):** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). We need to add a nitro group. The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. Although the bromo group directs to other positions (2, 4, 6), substitution at C5 is the major product because it is meta to both deactivating groups. This step successfully yields the target molecule.\n\nThe only chemically sound, high-yield pathway is: **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\nNow, we match this correct pathway to the options provided in the question.\n\n*   **A) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...**\n    This sequence follows the exact pathway determined to be correct: Acylation → Bromination → Nitration. The first three steps produce the desired product. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous for this synthesis, but the initial sequence is the only valid one among the choices that leads to the product. **This is the correct option.**\n\n*   **B) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n    This sequence forms aniline (the product of steps i and ii) and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation. This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH₂) of aniline reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), deactivating the ring. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n    This sequence starts with bromination, installing an *ortho, para*-director, which leads to the wrong isomers in the next step. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; ...**\n    This sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) is a pointless loop that starts with benzene and ends with benzene. It does not produce the target molecule. This is incorrect.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Core Structure:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.

This specific substitution pattern is the most critical clue for determining the correct order of reactions.\n\n### **2. Analyze Substituent Properties (Directing Effects & Reactivity)**\n\nThe order of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) is crucial. The directing effects of the substituents already on the ring determine the position of the next incoming group. We also must consider how substituents affect the ring's reactivity.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Reaction Limitation:** Friedel-Crafts acylation (using CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) fails on strongly deactivated rings (like nitrobenzene) and on rings substituted with an amino group (-NH₂).\n\n### **3.

The most effective strategy is to install a *meta*-director first.\n\n*   **Strategy 1: Start with Bromination.** If we add the bromo group first, it acts as an *ortho, para*-director.

This strategy is incorrect.\n\n*   **Strategy 2: Start with Nitration.** If we add the nitro group first, we get nitrobenzene. While the nitro group is a *meta*-director, it is also strongly deactivating. A subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add the -COCH₃ group) would fail on the highly deactivated nitrobenzene ring. This is not a viable high-yield strategy.\n\n*   **Strategy 3: Start with Acylation.** This is the most promising strategy.\n    1.  **Step i (Acylation):** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts acylation to form acetophenone. This is an excellent first step as it installs a **meta-directing** acetyl group that is only moderately deactivating.\n    2.  **Step ii (Bromination):** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone correctly guides the incoming bromine to the 3-position, forming 3-bromoacetophenone.

This is an incorrect strategy for achieving a 1,3,5-pattern.\n\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**: This sequence forms aniline (the product of steps i and ii) and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation.

The first three steps produce the desired product in high yield. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous and do not contribute to the synthesis, but the initial sequence is the only valid one among the choices.\n\nBased on the analysis, Option D is the only one that contains a chemically sound and logical pathway to the desired product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful analysis of the directing effects of the substituents and the feasibility of the reactions is necessary.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Core Structure:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Key Feature:** The substituents are in a **1,3,5-relationship**. This means all three groups are positioned *meta* relative to each other. This specific substitution pattern is the most critical clue for determining the correct reaction order.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Substituent Properties and Reaction Limitations\nThe order of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) is governed by the directing effects of the groups already on the ring.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** A deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** A deactivating group but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** A strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Reaction Constraint:** Friedel-Crafts acylation (using CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) is a key reaction for adding the acetyl group. However, this reaction fails on strongly deactivated rings (such as nitrobenzene) and on rings containing an amino group (-NH₂), as the Lewis acid catalyst reacts with the basic nitrogen.\n\n### Step 3: Formulate and Evaluate the Optimal Synthetic Strategy\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the synthesis must be planned logically. The most effective strategy is to install a *meta*-directing group first.\n\n1.  **Starting with Acylation (Option C):** This is the most logical first step.\n    *   **i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃:** Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene produces acetophenone. This correctly installs a *meta*-director (-COCH₃) that is only moderately deactivating, allowing for further substitutions.\n    *   **ii) Br₂/FeBr₃:** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone guides the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    *   **iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the C5 position. This position is electronically favored, leading to the desired **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one** as the major product.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is chemically sound and provides a high-yield route to the desired product.\n\n2.  **Starting with Bromination (Option A):** This is incorrect. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director, which would lead to 1,2- and 1,4-disubstituted products in the next step, not the required 1,3,5-pattern.\n\n3.  **Starting with Nitration (Options B and D):** This is also incorrect.\n    *   In Option B, the initial steps (nitration, then reduction) form aniline. The subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation fails because the basic amino group reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst.\n    *   In Option D, the first four steps constitute a pointless loop that converts benzene back into benzene.\n    *   Furthermore, any strategy that involves nitrating first and then acylating would fail because the strongly deactivating nitro group prevents the Friedel-Crafts acylation from occurring.\n\n### Final Decision\nBased on the chemical principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution, the only option that describes a viable, high-yield synthetic route is C. It correctly utilizes the directing effects of the substituents by first installing a meta-director (the acetyl group), which then guides the subsequent substitutions to achieve the required 1,3,5-pattern.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nTo decide the final answer, a systematic analysis of the chemical synthesis is required. The process involves understanding the target molecule, the properties of the chemical reactions involved, and the directing effects of substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Core Structure:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Key Point:** The most critical feature is the **1,3,5-substitution pattern**. All three groups are positioned *meta* relative to each other. This pattern dictates the required order of reactions.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Substituent Properties and Reaction Limitations**\n\nThe order of substitution is determined by the directing effects of the groups already on the ring and the feasibility of the reactions.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n    *   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n    *   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Reaction Limitations:**\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (adding the -COCH₃ group):** This reaction fails on strongly deactivated rings (e.g., nitrobenzene). It also fails when an amino group (-NH₂) is present, as the basic nitrogen reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst.\n\n### **Step 3: Formulate the Optimal Synthetic Pathway**\n\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the synthesis must be planned to use the directing effects advantageously.\n1.  **Choosing the First Step:**\n    *   Starting with bromination is incorrect. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director, which would lead to 1,2- and 1,4-disubstituted products, not the required 1,3,5-pattern.\n    *   Starting with nitration is also incorrect. While the nitro group is a *meta*-director, it is so strongly deactivating that the subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation step would fail.\n    *   The only viable first step is **Friedel-Crafts acylation**. This installs the acetyl group, which is a *meta*-director but is only moderately deactivating, allowing for further substitutions.\n\n2.  **Determining the Subsequent Steps:**\n    *   **Step i: Acylation.** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This correctly installs a *meta*-director.\n    *   **Step ii: Bromination.** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone guides the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    *   **Step iii: Nitration.** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the C5 position. This position is favored, leading to the desired final product.\n\nThe only high-yield, chemically sound pathway is: **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**.\n\n### **Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nNow, we match this correct pathway to the options provided in the question.\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**\n    This sequence attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline (formed in steps i and ii).

An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Key Feature:** The substituents are arranged in a **1,3,5-pattern**. This means each substituent is *meta* to the other two. This specific arrangement is the most critical factor in determining the correct order of reactions.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\nThe order in which the substituents are added is crucial because existing groups on the ring direct the position of incoming groups.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** A deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** A deactivating group but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** A strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n\n### **Step 3: Formulate the Optimal Synthetic Strategy**\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the synthesis must be planned to take advantage of these directing effects.\n1.  **Choosing the First Step:** The most logical strategy is to first install a **meta-director**.\n    *   Starting with bromination (an *ortho, para*-director) is incorrect as it would lead to 1,2- and 1,4-disubstituted products.\n    *   Starting with nitration is also not ideal. Although the nitro group is a *meta*-director, it is so strongly deactivating that a subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add the acetyl group) would fail or give an extremely low yield.\n    *   Therefore, the best first step is **Friedel-Crafts acylation**. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director and is only moderately deactivating, allowing for further substitutions.\n\n2.  **Determining the Subsequent Steps:**\n    *   **Step i: Acylation.** Benzene reacts with CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ to form acetophenone. This correctly installs a *meta*-directing group.\n    *   **Step ii: Bromination.** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone guides the incoming bromine to the 3-position, forming 3-bromoacetophenone. This establishes the correct 1,3-relationship.\n    *   **Step iii: Nitration.** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the C5 position. This position is the most favorable, leading to the desired final product.\n\nThe only viable, high-yield pathway is: **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**.\n\n### **Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options**\nNow, we match this correct pathway to the options provided.\n\n*   **A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ...:** This sequence starts with bromination, installing an *ortho, para*-director. This is an incorrect strategy for achieving a 1,3,5-pattern.\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...:** This sequence forms aniline (from steps i and ii) and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation. This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH₂) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃).\n*   **C) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...:** This sequence follows the exact pathway determined to be correct: **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**. The first three steps successfully produce the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous for this synthesis, but the initial pathway is correct and leads to the product.\n*   **D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂...:** This sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) is a pointless loop that starts with benzene and regenerates benzene. It does not produce the target molecule.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only option that describes a chemically sound and high-yield route to the desired product is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer by evaluating the provided candidate answers and the underlying chemical principles.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Question**\n*   **Goal:** Synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene.\n*   **Task:** Identify the correct sequence of reactions from the given options.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Target Molecule's Structure**\n*   The molecule has a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   **Substituent 1:** Acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n*   **Substituent 2:** Bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   **Substituent 3:** Nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Key Feature:** The substituents are in a **1,3,5-relationship**. All groups are *meta* to each other. This substitution pattern is the most critical clue for determining the correct reaction order.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Chemical Principles (Substituent Directing Effects)**\nThe order of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) is governed by the directing effects of the groups already on the ring.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** A deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** A deactivating group but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** A strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n\n### **4. Formulate the Optimal Synthetic Strategy**\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the synthesis must be planned logically.\n*   **Point 1: The first substituent must be a meta-director.** Starting with bromination (an ortho, para-director) would lead to 1,2- and 1,4-products, which is incorrect. This immediately invalidates **Option C**.\n*   **Point 2: Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on strongly deactivated rings.** The two possible meta-directing first steps are nitration or acylation. If we perform nitration first, the resulting nitrobenzene is too strongly deactivated for a subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add the -COCH₃ group). Therefore, any sequence that attempts to acylate nitrobenzene is not a high-yield pathway.\n*   **Point 3: Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on anilines.** The basic amino group (-NH₂) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), deactivating the ring. This invalidates **Option A**, which creates aniline and then attempts acylation.\n*   **Point 4: The only viable first step is Acylation.** Starting with Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) places a moderately deactivating, meta-directing acetyl group on the ring. This is the correct first step.\n*   **Point 5: Subsequent steps.**\n    *   After acylation, we have acetophenone. The meta-directing acetyl group will guide the next substituent to the 3-position. Bromination (Br₂/FeBr₃) correctly yields 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    *   Finally, nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) of 3-bromoacetophenone will add the nitro group. The acetyl group directs to C5, and while the bromo group directs elsewhere, the C5 position is favored, yielding the final 1,3,5-product.\n\n### **5. Evaluate the Options Based on the Correct Strategy**\nThe only viable, high-yield pathway is: **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**.\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**: Incorrect. Fails at step (iii) due to reaction between aniline and AlCl₃.\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂...**: Incorrect. This is a pointless series of reactions that regenerates the starting material, benzene.\n*   **C) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...**: Incorrect. Starts with an ortho, para-director, which will not lead to the 1,3,5-pattern.\n*   **D) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...**: **Correct**. The first three steps follow the exact optimal pathway: Acylation → Bromination → Nitration. The subsequent steps listed are superfluous for this synthesis, but the initial, core pathway is the only one among the options that correctly and efficiently produces the target molecule.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe overwhelming consensus in the reasoning of the candidate answers, combined with a rigorous analysis of chemical principles, points to a single correct synthetic route. This route begins with acylation, followed by bromination, and then nitration. This sequence corresponds exactly to the first three steps of Option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Core Structure:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Key Feature:** The substituents are in a **1,3,5-relationship**. All three groups are positioned *meta* relative to each other. This specific substitution pattern is the most critical clue for determining the correct reaction order.\n\n### **2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\nThe order of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) is crucial. The directing effects of the substituents already on the ring determine where the next group will be added.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n### **3. Formulate the Optimal Synthetic Strategy**\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern in high yield, the synthesis must be planned logically. The most effective strategy is to install a **meta-director** first.\n\n*   **Starting with Bromination:** If we add the bromo group first, it acts as an *ortho, para*-director. The next substitution would yield a mixture of 1,2- and 1,4-disubstituted products, not the required 1,3-pattern. This is an incorrect approach.\n*   **Starting with Nitration:** If we add the nitro group first, we get nitrobenzene. While the nitro group is a *meta*-director, it is also strongly deactivating. A subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add the -COCH₃ group) would fail on the highly deactivated nitrobenzene ring. Therefore, any sequence that attempts this is not viable for high yield.\n*   **Starting with Acylation:** This is the most promising and correct strategy.\n    1.  **Step i (Acylation):** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts acylation to form acetophenone. This is an excellent first step as it installs a **meta-directing** acetyl group.\n    2.  **Step ii (Bromination):** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone correctly guides the incoming bromine to the 3-position, forming 3-bromoacetophenone. This establishes the required 1,3-relationship.\n    3.  **Step iii (Nitration):** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. Although the bromo group directs to other positions (2, 4, 6), substitution at C5 is the major product because it is meta to both deactivating groups. This step successfully yields the target molecule.\n\nThe only chemically sound pathway that leads to the desired product is: **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**.\n\n### **4. Evaluate the Given Options**\nNow, we match this correct pathway to the options provided in the question.\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**: This sequence attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline (the product of steps i and ii). This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH₂) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), deactivating the ring. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂...**: This sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) is a pointless loop that starts with benzene and ends with benzene. It does not produce the target molecule. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**: This sequence starts with bromination, installing an *ortho, para*-director. This will not lead to the desired 1,3,5-pattern. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**: This sequence follows the exact pathway determined to be correct: **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**. The first three steps produce the desired product in high yield. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous and do not contribute to the synthesis, but the initial sequence is the only valid one among the choices. **Correct.**\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### **1.

This specific substitution pattern is the most critical clue for determining the correct reaction order.\n\n### **2. Analyze Substituent Properties and Reaction Limitations**\nThe order of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) is crucial. We must consider the directing effects of the substituents and the feasibility of the reactions.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n    *   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n    *   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Reaction Feasibility:**\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (e.g., CH₃COCl/AlCl₃):** This reaction fails on strongly deactivated rings (like nitrobenzene) and on rings with basic groups like amines (-NH₂), as the Lewis acid catalyst reacts with the nitrogen.\n\n### **3. Formulate the Optimal Synthetic Strategy**\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the synthesis must be planned logically. The most effective strategy is to install a *meta*-director first.\n\n*   **Strategy 1: Start with Bromination.** This is incorrect. Adding a bromo group first places an *ortho, para-director* on the ring. The next substitution would yield 1,2- and 1,4-disubstituted products, not the required 1,3,5-pattern.\n*   **Strategy 2: Start with Nitration.** This is not a high-yield strategy. While the nitro group is a *meta*-director, it is so strongly deactivating that a subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add the -COCH₃ group) would fail.\n*   **Strategy 3: Start with Acylation.** This is the correct strategy.\n    1.  **Step i: Friedel-Crafts Acylation.** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This installs a *meta-directing* acetyl group that is only moderately deactivating, allowing for further substitutions.\n    2.  **Step ii: Bromination.** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone guides the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **Step iii: Nitration.** The substrate is now 3-bromoacetophenone. It has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. This position is electronically favored, leading to the desired final product.\n\nThe only chemically sound, high-yield pathway is: **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**.\n\n### **4. Evaluate the Given Options**\nNow, we match this correct pathway to the options provided in the question.\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂...**: This sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) is a pointless loop that starts with benzene and regenerates benzene after four steps. It does not produce the target molecule.\n*   **B) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**: This sequence starts with bromination, installing an *ortho, para*-director, which leads to the wrong isomers.\n*   **C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...**: This sequence forms aniline (the product of steps i and ii) and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation.

Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Core Structure:** A benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.

This specific substitution pattern is the most critical clue for determining the correct order of reactions.\n\n### **2. List the Careful Points (Chemical Principles)**\n\nTo devise a high-yield synthesis, we must consider the following principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n\n*   **Directing Effects of Substituents:** The group(s) already on the ring direct the next incoming group to specific positions.\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** A deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n    *   **Bromo group (-Br):** A deactivating group but an **ortho, para-director**.\n    *   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** A strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Reaction Feasibility and Limitations:**\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃):** This reaction is essential for adding the acetyl group. However, it **fails** on strongly deactivated rings (e.g., nitrobenzene) because the ring is too electron-poor. It also fails on rings with an amino group (-NH₂) because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic nitrogen atom.\n\n### **3. Develop the Optimal Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe strategy must be planned to create the 1,3,5-pattern by using the directing effects advantageously.\n\n*   **Step 1: The First Substitution.**\n    *   Starting with **bromination** (`Br₂/FeBr₃`) is incorrect. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director, which would lead to 1,2- and 1,4-disubstituted products, not the required 1,3-pattern.\n    *   Starting with **nitration** (`HNO₃/H₂SO₄`) is not a viable high-yield route. Although the nitro group is a *meta*-director, it deactivates the ring so strongly that the subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation step would fail.\n    *   The best first step is **Friedel-Crafts acylation** (`CH₃COCl/AlCl₃`). This adds the acetyl group, which is a *meta*-director and only moderately deactivates the ring, allowing for further substitutions.\n\n*   **Step 2: The Second Substitution.**\n    *   Starting with acetophenone (from Step 1), we perform **bromination**. The *meta*-directing acetyl group guides the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n\n*   **Step 3: The Third Substitution.**\n    *   Starting with 3-bromoacetophenone, we perform **nitration**. The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. The bromo group directs to C2, C4, and C6. In this case of competing directors, substitution at C5 is the major product because it is meta to both deactivating groups, which is an electronically favorable position. This step successfully yields the target molecule.\n\nThe only viable, high-yield pathway is: **i) Acylation → ii) Bromination → iii) Nitration**.\n\n### **4.

Deconstruct the Problem**\n\n*   **Target Molecule:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Starting Material:** Benzene.\n*   **Task:** Identify the correct sequence of reactions for a high-yield synthesis.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Target Molecule's Structure**\n\nThe most critical feature of the target molecule is the substitution pattern on the benzene ring:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) is at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) is at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO₂) is at position 5.\n\nThis is a **1,3,5-substitution pattern**, where all three groups are *meta* to each other. This pattern is the primary clue for determining the correct order of reactions.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Chemical Principles (Consensus from all answers)**\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the same core chemical principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n\n*   **Directing Effects of Substituents:**\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** A deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n    *   **Bromo group (-Br):** A deactivating group but an **ortho, para-director**.\n    *   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** A strongly deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Reaction Limitations:**\n    *   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (adding the -COCH₃ group):** This reaction fails on strongly deactivated rings (like nitrobenzene) and on aniline (due to the basic -NH₂ group reacting with the AlCl₃ catalyst).\n\n### **4. Synthesize the Optimal Strategy (Consensus from all answers)**\n\nBased on the principles above, every candidate answer correctly deduces the only viable, high-yield strategy:\n\n1.  **Start with a meta-director that allows further reactions.** Starting with bromination is incorrect because it's an *ortho, para*-director. Starting with nitration is incorrect because the resulting nitrobenzene is too deactivated for the necessary next step of Friedel-Crafts acylation. Therefore, the synthesis **must** begin with **Friedel-Crafts acylation**.\n    *   **Step i: CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ (Acylation).** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This installs the meta-directing acetyl group.\n\n2.  **Install the second substituent.** The meta-directing acetyl group will guide the next substituent to the 3-position.\n    *   **Step ii: Br₂/FeBr₃ (Bromination).** This correctly forms 3-bromoacetophenone, establishing the 1,3-relationship.\n\n3.  **Install the final substituent.** The ring now has a meta-director (-COCH₃) and an ortho, para-director (-Br). The powerful meta-directing effect of the acetyl group guides the incoming nitro group to the 5-position.\n    *   **Step iii: HNO₃/H₂SO₄ (Nitration).** This yields the final target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThe only correct core sequence is: **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**.\n\n### **5.

This specific substitution pattern is the most critical clue for determining the correct reaction order.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\n\nThe order of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) is governed by the directing effects of the groups already on the ring.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n### **Step 3: Formulate the Optimal Synthetic Strategy**\n\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the synthesis must be planned to use these directing effects advantageously. The most logical strategy is to install a *meta*-director first.\n\n1.  **Choosing the First Step:**\n    *   **Starting with Bromination:** This is incorrect. Adding the bromo group first would place an *ortho, para*-director on the ring, leading to 1,2- and 1,4-disubstituted products in the next step, not the required 1,3,5-pattern.\n    *   **Starting with Nitration:** This is not a high-yield strategy. Although the nitro group is a *meta*-director, it is so strongly deactivating that a subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add the -COCH₃ group) would fail or give an extremely low yield.\n    *   **Starting with Acylation:** This is the correct approach. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director and is only moderately deactivating, allowing for further substitutions.\n\n2.  **Developing the Sequence:**\n    *   **Step i: Acylation.** Benzene reacts with CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ to form acetophenone. This correctly installs a *meta*-director at position 1.\n    *   **Step ii: Bromination.** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone will guide the incoming bromine to the 3-position. This reaction (Br₂/FeBr₃) yields 3-bromoacetophenone, establishing the correct 1,3-relationship.\n    *   **Step iii: Nitration.** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. This position is favored, leading to the desired **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n\nThe only viable, high-yield pathway is: **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**.\n\n### **Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nNow, we evaluate the options from the question against this correct pathway.\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence forms aniline (the product of steps i and ii) and then attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation. This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH₂) of aniline reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), deactivating the ring. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    This sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination) is a pointless loop that starts with benzene and ends with benzene. It does not produce the target molecule. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence starts with bromination, installing an *ortho, para*-director, which will not lead to the required 1,3,5-pattern. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    This sequence perfectly matches the optimal pathway derived above. The first three steps (acylation, bromination, nitration) successfully produce the target molecule in high yield. The subsequent steps listed in the option are superfluous for this synthesis but do not invalidate the correctness of the initial, successful route. **This is the correct option.**\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
