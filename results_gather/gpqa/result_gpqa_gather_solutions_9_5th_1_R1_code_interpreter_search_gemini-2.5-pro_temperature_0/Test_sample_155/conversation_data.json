Analysis of the Chemical Reactions and Products**\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine the stereochemical outcome of two separate reactions and then analyze the combined product mixture. The reaction sequence in both cases is an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene (a *trans*-alkene) undergoes *anti*-dihydroxylation.**\n    *   **Stereochemical Rule:** The *anti*-addition of two groups to a *trans*-alkene results in the formation of a **meso compound**.\n    *   **Product 1:** A single, achiral product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. This molecule has two stereocenters but is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene (a *cis*-alkene) undergoes *anti*-dihydroxylation.**\n    *   **Stereochemical Rule:** The *anti*-addition of two groups to a *cis*-alkene results in the formation of a **racemic mixture** (a 1:1 mixture of enantiomers).\n    *   **Product 2:** A pair of enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **2. Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products of both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol**\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol**\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**\n\nThe relationships between these molecules are crucial:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers are **enantiomers** of each other.\n*   The meso isomer is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers.\n\n### **3.

The two enantiomers will co-elute. This results in **2 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation.\n    *   A chiral column can separate **both diastereomers and enantiomers**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** All three unique stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved into separate peaks.

The Chemical Transformation: Anti-Dihydroxylation**\nThe reaction sequence described—treatment with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid (H₃O⁺)—is a standard method for the *anti*-dihydroxylation of an alkene. This means that two hydroxyl (-OH) groups are added across the former double bond, one to each face. The stereochemical outcome of this addition is highly specific and depends on the geometry of the starting alkene.\n\n**2. Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 1**\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** A fundamental principle of stereochemistry is that an *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in the formation of a **meso compound**.\n*   **Product:** Reaction 1 yields a single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. This molecule has two stereocenters but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n\n**3. Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 2**\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The corresponding rule is that an *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene results in the formation of a **racemic mixture**.\n*   **Product:** Reaction 2 yields a 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**4. Composition of the Final Mixture**\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains a total of **three distinct stereoisomers**:\n1.  meso-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n2.  (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationships between these isomers are critical: the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers are **enantiomers**, while the meso isomer is a **diastereomer** to both of them.\n\n**5. Prediction for Standard (Achiral) HPLC**\n*   **Principle:** A standard HPLC column uses an achiral stationary phase. It separates molecules based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n*   **Application:** Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated; they will elute together as a single peak. Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n*   **Observation:** The mixture will show **2 peaks**. One peak corresponds to the meso-octane-4,5-diol. The second peak corresponds to the co-eluting pair of enantiomers, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**6. Prediction for Chiral HPLC**\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column uses a chiral stationary phase. This creates a chiral environment that allows the column to interact differently with each enantiomer, enabling their separation. It also separates diastereomers.\n*   **Application:** All three unique stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved.\n*   **Observation:** The mixture will show **3 peaks**. One peak for the meso-diol, a second peak for the (4R,5R)-diol, and a third peak for the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis consistently shows that the chemist will observe **2 peaks in the standard HPLC** and **3 peaks in the chiral HPLC**. Matching this result to the given options:\n\nA) 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\nB) 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC\nC) 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC\nD) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to logically deduce the number of peaks observed in each type of HPLC by following the established principles of stereochemistry and chromatography. I will break down the problem into a series of steps, which will be simulated in the Python code.\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 1**: Determine the stereochemical product(s) of the anti-dihydroxylation of (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a trans-alkene.\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2**: Determine the stereochemical product(s) of the anti-dihydroxylation of (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a cis-alkene.\n3.  **Analyze the Mixture**: Combine the products from both reactions and identify the total number of unique stereoisomers and their relationships (i.e., enantiomers vs. diastereomers).\n4.  **Predict Standard HPLC Peaks**: Based on the principle that achiral HPLC separates diastereomers but not enantiomers, calculate the number of expected peaks.\n5.  **Predict Chiral HPLC Peaks**: Based on the principle that chiral HPLC separates all stereoisomers (both diastereomers and enantiomers), calculate the number of expected peaks.\n6.  **Select the Correct Option**: Match the calculated peak numbers to the given multiple-choice options from the original prompt to find the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_hplc_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function logically determines the number of HPLC peaks for a mixture of stereoisomers\n    by analyzing the stereochemical outcomes of two reactions and the principles of chromatography.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"--- Step-by-Step Chemical and Chromatographic Analysis ---\")\n\n    #

It is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** The two-step process of treatment with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene. This means two hydroxyl (-OH) groups are added to opposite faces of the original double bond.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemical Rule):** A fundamental rule in stereochemistry is that an **anti-addition** to a **trans-alkene** yields a **meso compound**. A meso compound is a single, achiral molecule that contains stereocenters but is superimposable on its mirror image due to an internal element of symmetry.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single product is formed: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Product of Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene. It is also an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** The same *anti*-dihydroxylation reaction is performed.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemical Rule):** The corresponding stereochemical rule is that an **anti-addition** to a **cis-alkene** yields a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers. A racemic mixture is a 1:1 mixture of two molecules that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers is formed: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\n*   The chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains a total of **three distinct stereoisomers**:\n    1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n    2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n    3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n*   **Careful Point (Isomer Relationships):** It is crucial to identify the relationships between these isomers.

It cannot distinguish between enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n    *   **Separation:** Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated. Enantiomers will co-elute (elute at the same time).\n    *   **Observation:** The meso-diol will be separated from the enantiomeric pair, resulting in one peak.

    "Based on a comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers, there is a unanimous consensus on the underlying chemical principles and the expected experimental outcome. The discrepancies in the final letter choices among the candidates appear to stem from variations in the labeling of the multiple-choice options they were provided, not from any disagreement in the scientific reasoning. The following step-by-step analysis synthesizes this consistent reasoning to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### **Careful Points and Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Analyze the Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 1**\n*   **Reaction:** (E)-oct-4-ene, a *trans*-alkene, undergoes *anti*-dihydroxylation. The reaction sequence (1. mCPBA, 2. H₃O⁺) adds two hydroxyl (-OH) groups to opposite faces of the original double bond.\n*   **Governing Principle:** A fundamental rule in stereochemistry is that an **anti-addition** to a **trans-alkene** results in a **meso compound**. A meso compound is a single, achiral molecule that contains stereocenters but is superimposable on its mirror image due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single product is formed: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 2**\n*   **Reaction:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, a *cis*-alkene, undergoes the same *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Governing Principle:** The corresponding stereochemical rule is that an **anti-addition** to a **cis-alkene** results in a **racemic mixture**. A racemic mixture is a 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror-image molecules).\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers is formed: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**3. Characterize the Combined Product Mixture**\n*   The chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains a total of **three distinct stereoisomers**:\n    1.  meso-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n    2.  (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n    3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n*   **Stereochemical Relationships:** The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers are **enantiomers**. The meso isomer is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers. This distinction is critical for predicting the chromatographic behavior.\n\n**4. Predict the Standard (Achiral) HPLC Chromatogram**\n*   **Principle of Separation:** A standard HPLC column has an achiral stationary phase. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Application:**\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated. They will elute at the same time (co-elute).\n*   **Observation:** The mixture will be separated into two components. The meso-diol will be resolved as one peak. The pair of enantiomers will co-elute, appearing as a second peak. Therefore, the chemist will observe **2 peaks**.\n\n**5. Predict the Chiral HPLC Chromatogram**\n*   **Principle of Separation:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase. This creates a chiral environment that allows the column to interact differently with each enantiomer, enabling their separation. It also separates diastereomers.\n*   **Application:** The chiral column can distinguish between all three unique stereoisomers in the mixture.\n*   **Observation:** The meso-diol will be resolved as one peak. The (4R,5R)-enantiomer will be resolved as a second peak, and the (4S,5S)-enantiomer will be resolved as a third peak. Therefore, the chemist will observe **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis consistently and unanimously shows that the chemist will observe **2 peaks in the standard HPLC** and **3 peaks in the chiral HPLC**. Matching this result to the provided options:\n\nA) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\nB) 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC\nC) 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC\nD) 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\n\nThe correct description of the outcome is given in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"

The Chemical Transformation: Anti-Dihydroxylation**\nThe reaction sequence described—treatment with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid (H₃O⁺)—is a standard method for the *anti*-dihydroxylation of an alkene. This means that two hydroxyl (-OH) groups are added across the former double bond, one to each face. The stereochemical outcome of this addition is highly specific and depends on the geometry of the starting alkene.\n\n**2. Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 1**\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** A fundamental principle of stereochemistry is that an *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in the formation of a **meso compound**.\n*   **Product:** Reaction 1 yields a single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. This molecule has two stereocenters but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n\n**3. Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 2**\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The corresponding rule is that an *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene results in the formation of a **racemic mixture**.\n*   **Product:** Reaction 2 yields a 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**4. Composition of the Final Mixture**\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains a total of **three distinct stereoisomers**:\n1.  meso-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n2.  (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationships between these isomers are critical: the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers are **enantiomers**, while the meso isomer is a **diastereomer** to both of them.\n\n**5. Prediction for Standard (Achiral) HPLC**\n*   **Principle:** A standard HPLC column uses an achiral stationary phase. It separates molecules based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n*   **Application:** Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated; they will elute together as a single peak. Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n*   **Observation:** The mixture will show **2 peaks**. One peak corresponds to the meso-octane-4,5-diol. The second peak corresponds to the co-eluting pair of enantiomers, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**6. Prediction for Chiral HPLC**\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column uses a chiral stationary phase. This creates a chiral environment that allows the column to interact differently with each enantiomer, enabling their separation. It also separates diastereomers.\n*   **Application:** All three unique stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved.\n*   **Observation:** The mixture will show **3 peaks**. One peak for the meso-diol, a second peak for the (4R,5R)-diol, and a third peak for the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis consistently shows that the chemist will observe **2 peaks in the standard HPLC** and **3 peaks in the chiral HPLC**. Matching this result to the given options:\n\nA) 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\nB) 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC\nC) 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC\nD) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to logically deduce the number of peaks observed in each type of HPLC by following the established principles of stereochemistry and chromatography.

It is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** The two-step process of treatment with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene. This means two hydroxyl (-OH) groups are added to opposite faces of the original double bond.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemical Rule):** A fundamental rule in stereochemistry is that an **anti-addition** to a **trans-alkene** yields a **meso compound**. A meso compound is a single, achiral molecule that contains stereocenters but is superimposable on its mirror image due to an internal element of symmetry.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single product is formed: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Product of Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene. It is also an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** The same *anti*-dihydroxylation reaction is performed.\n*   **Careful Point (Stereochemical Rule):** The corresponding stereochemical rule is that an **anti-addition** to a **cis-alkene** yields a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers. A racemic mixture is a 1:1 mixture of two molecules that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers is formed: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\n*   The chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains a total of **three distinct stereoisomers**:\n    1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n    2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n    3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n*   **Careful Point (Isomer Relationships):** It is crucial to identify the relationships between these isomers. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers are **enantiomers**. The meso isomer is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the Chromatographic Results**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:**\n    *   **Careful Point (Principle):** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity). It cannot distinguish between enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n    *   **Separation:** Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated.

H₃O⁺) is a standard method for the *anti*-dihydroxylation of an alkene. This means two hydroxyl (-OH) groups are added across the double bond, one to each face (i.e., from opposite sides).\n    *   The stereochemical outcome of this addition depends on the geometry of the starting alkene. The two key rules are:\n        *   *Anti*-addition to a **trans-alkene** yields a **meso compound**.\n        *   *Anti*-addition to a **cis-alkene** yields a **racemic mixture** (a pair of enantiomers).\n\n2.  **Apply the Rules to Each Reaction:**\n    *   **Reaction 1:** The starting material is (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a *trans*-alkene. Applying the first rule, the *anti*-dihydroxylation produces a single product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. This is an achiral molecule that contains two stereocenters but has an internal plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Reaction 2:** The starting material is (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a *cis*-alkene. Applying the second rule, the *anti*-dihydroxylation produces a **racemic mixture** of two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n3.  **Characterize the Final Product Mixture:**\n    *   The chemist combines the products from both reactions.

(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   It is crucial to understand the relationship between these isomers. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers are **enantiomers** of each other. The meso isomer is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers.\n\n4.  **Predict the Outcome on a Standard (Achiral) HPLC Column:**\n    *   Standard HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will be separated into distinct peaks.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC will show **2 peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: The meso-diol.\n        *   Peak 2: The co-eluting enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n5.  **Predict the Outcome on a Chiral HPLC Column:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It can also separate diastereomers.\n    *   Therefore, all three unique stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved into separate peaks. The chiral HPLC will show **3 peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: The meso-diol.\n        *   Peak 2: The (4R,5R)-diol.\n        *   Peak 3: The (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis consistently shows that the chemist will observe **2 peaks in the standard HPLC** and **3 peaks in the chiral HPLC**.

Analyze the Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 1**\n*   **Reaction:** (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a *trans*-alkene, undergoes *anti*-dihydroxylation. The reaction sequence of mCPBA followed by aqueous acid adds two hydroxyl (-OH) groups to opposite faces of the original double bond.\n*   **Governing Principle:** A fundamental rule in stereochemistry is that an **anti-addition** to a **trans-alkene** results in a **meso compound**. A meso compound is a single, achiral molecule that contains stereocenters but is superimposable on its mirror image due to an internal element of symmetry.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single product is formed: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 2**\n*   **Reaction:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a *cis*-alkene, undergoes the same *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Governing Principle:** The corresponding stereochemical rule is that an **anti-addition** to a **cis-alkene** results in a **racemic mixture**. A racemic mixture is a 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror-image molecules).\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers is formed: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**3. Characterize the Combined Product Mixture**\n*   The chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains a total of **three distinct stereoisomers**:\n    1.  meso-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n    2.  (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n    3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n*   **Stereochemical Relationships:** The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers are **enantiomers**. The meso isomer is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) isomers. This distinction is critical for predicting the chromatographic behavior.\n\n**4. Predict the Standard (Achiral) HPLC Chromatogram**\n*   **Principle of Separation:** A standard HPLC column has an achiral stationary phase. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Application:**\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated. They will elute at the same time (co-elute).\n*   **Observation:** The mixture will be separated into two components. The meso-diol will be resolved as one peak. The pair of enantiomers will co-elute, appearing as a second peak. Therefore, the chemist will observe **2 peaks**.\n\n**5. Predict the Chiral HPLC Chromatogram**\n*   **Principle of Separation:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase. This creates a chiral environment that allows the column to interact differently with each enantiomer, enabling their separation. It also separates diastereomers.\n*   **Application:** The chiral column can distinguish between all three unique stereoisomers in the mixture.\n*   **Observation:** The meso-diol will be resolved as one peak. The (4R,5R)-enantiomer will be resolved as a second peak, and the (4S,5S)-enantiomer will be resolved as a third peak. Therefore, the chemist will observe **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis consistently shows that the chemist will observe **2 peaks in the standard HPLC** and **3 peaks in the chiral HPLC**.
