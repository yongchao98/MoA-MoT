    "To arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer during electrophilic bromination, we need to analyze the directing effects and steric hindrance of each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n1.  **Substituent Classification and Directing Effects:**\n    *   **-CH₃ (Toluene, 1)** and **-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene, 5)** are alkyl groups. They are activating and ortho-, para-directing.\n    *   **-Cl (Chlorobenzene, 3)** is a halogen. It is deactivating but ortho-, para-directing.\n    *   **-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene, 4)**, **-COOH (Benzoic acid, 6)**, and **-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate, 2)** are deactivating, meta-directing groups.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Meta-Directing Groups (Low Para Yield):**\n    These substituents direct the incoming electrophile (Br⁺) primarily to the meta position, resulting in very low yields of the para-isomer.\n    *   **Nitrobenzene (-NO₂):** The nitro group is one of the strongest deactivating groups. It makes the ortho and para positions highly electron-deficient, leading to a very high preference for meta-substitution. For bromination, the para-isomer yield is extremely low, often less than 1%.\n    *   **Benzoic acid (-COOH):** The carboxylic acid group is also a strong deactivator. Bromination yields predominantly the meta-isomer. The para yield is very low, around 1-2%.\n    *   **Ethyl benzoate (-COOC₂H₅):** The ester group is a deactivator, similar to the carboxylic acid group. Its deactivating strength is slightly less than -COOH. Data for nitration of ethyl benzoate shows a para yield of about 5%, which suggests the para yield for bromination would also be low but likely slightly higher than for benzoic acid.\n\n    Therefore, the order of increasing para yield for this subset is: Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\n\n3.  **Analysis of Ortho, Para-Directing Groups (High Para Yield):**\n    These substituents direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The ratio between the ortho and para isomers is influenced by steric effects and electronic factors.\n    *   **Ethylbenzene (-C₂H₅):** The ethyl group is an o,p-director. One might expect the bulkier ethyl group to sterically hinder the ortho position more than a methyl group, leading to a higher para yield. However, experimental data for bromination often shows the opposite. For example, one source indicates the product distribution is about 29.6% ortho and 70.4% para. Another source cites 24.6% ortho and 75.4% para.\n    *   **Toluene (-CH₃):** The methyl group is an o,p-director. Typical bromination product distributions are around 33% ortho and 67% para. While some conditions show slightly different ratios, the para yield is consistently high.\n    *   **Chlorobenzene (-Cl):** The chloro group is o,p-directing but deactivating. The inductive electron-withdrawing effect deactivates the ring, but resonance directs substitution to the o,p positions. For halogens, the para-isomer is highly favored over the ortho-isomer due to the combination of inductive and steric effects. Bromination of chlorobenzene gives a very high yield of the para-isomer, approximately 90%.\n\n    Comparing the three, the experimental data shows that the para-isomer yield generally follows this order: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3). It is worth noting that the exact ortho/para ratio for toluene and ethylbenzene can vary with reaction conditions, but the para-selectivity for chlorobenzene is consistently the highest among these three. Some sources might show ethylbenzene giving a slightly higher para yield than toluene, but chlorobenzene's para-selectivity is distinctly superior. Let's re-examine the order of toluene and ethylbenzene. A catalyst system with ZnBr₂ on K-10 clay gave 75.4% para-bromoethylbenzene versus 65.1% para-bromotoluene, suggesting ethylbenzene can give a higher para yield. The key factor is that the para position is generally less sterically hindered. Given the options, let's re-establish the most likely order. Alkyl groups (-CH₃, -C₂H₅) are less para-directing than halogens (-Cl). The larger size of the ethyl group compared to the methyl group increases steric hindrance at the ortho positions, favouring para substitution more. Therefore, the para yield should be higher for ethylbenzene than for toluene.\n\n    So, the revised order for this subset is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\n4.  **Final Arrangement:**\n    Combining the two groups gives the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield:\n\n    **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\n    This corresponds to:\n    Nitrobenzene < Benzoic acid < Ethyl benzoate < Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene\n\n    This order aligns with option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
