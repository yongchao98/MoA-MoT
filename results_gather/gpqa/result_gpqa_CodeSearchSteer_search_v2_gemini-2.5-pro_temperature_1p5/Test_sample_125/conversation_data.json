    "An organic chemist performs two reactions.\n\n**Reaction I:**\nThe starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral ketone with a single stereocenter at the C5 position. It is treated with Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH will reduce the ketone at the C3 position to an alcohol. This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3. Since there is a pre-existing stereocenter at C5, the hydride can attack the carbonyl from two different faces, leading to the formation of two diastereomeric products: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n\n**Reaction II:**\nThe starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, an achiral diketone. It is treated with excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), a reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ will reduce both ketone groups to alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. The possible products are (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol, (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, and (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) molecules are a pair of enantiomers. The (2R, 4S) compound has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound, which is achiral. Therefore, this reaction produces three distinct stereoisomers: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n**Combined Products:**\nThe final mixture to be analyzed contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n*   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n**Analysis by HPLC:**\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC:**\nThis technique separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   The two products of Reaction I, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, including polarity, and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) have identical polarities in an achiral environment and will not be separated, eluting together as a **single peak**.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II, (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has a different polarity and will be separated, giving another **single peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (methoxy-alcohols) and Reaction II (diols) are structurally different with distinct polarities and will be separated from each other.\n*   In total, the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram will show **four peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC:**\nThis technique uses a chiral stationary phase to separate chiral molecules, including both enantiomers and diastereomers.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I are both chiral and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   The enantiomeric pair from Reaction II, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will be resolved by the chiral column into **two separate peaks**.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II is achiral but is a diastereomer of the other products from this reaction. It will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and elute as a **single, distinct peak**.\n*   Therefore, the chiral HPLC will separate all five stereoisomers present in the mixture.\n*   In total, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **five peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<C>>>"
