  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n\nA) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\nB) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1\nC) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nD) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>",

    "Based on the experimental results, we can draw the following conclusions by analyzing the genetic interactions:\n\n1.  **Role of G2**: The single mutant `g2` results in a 0% resistance phenotype, a complete loss of function. The double mutants `g1g2` and `g2g3` also show 0% resistance. When the phenotype of a double mutant is identical to the phenotype of one of the single mutants, that gene is said to be **epistatic** to the other. In this case, G2's null phenotype masks the phenotypes of G1 and G3. This is characteristic of a gene that acts upstream in a regulatory pathway. Given that at least one gene is a transcription factor, G2 is the strongest candidate for this role, as it appears to be a master regulator necessary for the entire resistance pathway.\n\n2.  **Relationship between G1 and G3**: The single mutants `g1` and `g3` have partial resistance (75% and 50%, respectively). However, the double mutant `g1g3` has a much more severe phenotype (10% resistance) than either of the single mutants. This type of synergistic interaction, where the double mutant phenotype is worse than the additive effects of the single mutants, is a hallmark of **gene redundancy**. This suggests that G1 and G3 perform similar or overlapping functions in parallel pathways downstream of G2. When one is knocked out, the other can partially compensate, but knocking out both nearly eliminates the function.\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Options**:\n    *   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**: \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\" is incorrect because the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g3` phenotype (50%).\n    *   **B) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**: \"G1 is a transcription factor\" is unlikely, as G2 shows clear epistasis over the other genes. Also, pleiotropy cannot be determined as only one trait was measured.\n    *   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**: The first two statements (\"G2 is a transcription factor\" and \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\") are the most accurate conclusions from the data. The third statement, \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\", is incorrect as the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%). However, this option contains two correct and significant conclusions.\n    *   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**: This is incorrect as gene redundancy is a better description than pleiotropy, and G1 is not epistatic towards G3.\n\nDespite the inaccuracy in its final clause, option C provides the most accurate overall description of the gene interactions based on the data.\n\n<<<C>>>"
