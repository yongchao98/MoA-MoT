    "To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we first need to identify the structure of the starting material and the final product after the reaction.\n\n### 1. Starting Material Structure and Molecular Formula\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down the structure to determine its molecular formula:\n*   **Cyclohex-3-ene:** A six-membered carbon ring with one double bond.\n*   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH):** This is the principal functional group, so it is at position C1.\n*   **Formyl group (-CHO):** Located at position C2.\n*   **Vinyl group (-CH=CH2):** Located at position C5.\n\nBased on this, the molecular formula is **C10H12O2**.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for the starting material can be calculated to verify the structure:\nIHD = C + 1 - H/2\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 5\nThis IHD of 5 corresponds to:\n*   1 for the ring structure\n*   1 for the double bond within the ring (cyclohex-3-ene)\n*   1 for the double bond in the vinyl group\n*   1 for the carbonyl double bond (C=O) in the formyl group\n*   1 for the carbonyl double bond (C=O) in the carboxylic acid group\n\n### 2. The Reaction\n\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus (P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This is a powerful reducing agent known to perform the following reductions:\n*   Reduces aldehydes (-CHO) to alkanes (-CH3).\n*   Reduces carboxylic acids (-COOH) to alkanes (-CH3).\n*   Reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   Reduces alcohols to alkanes.\n\nApplying these transformations to our starting molecule:\n*   The cyclohex-3-ene ring will be reduced to a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The 2-formyl group (-CHO) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The 1-carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The 5-vinyl group (-CH=CH2) will be reduced to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n\n### 3. Product Structure and Molecular Formula\n\nThe final product will be a substituted cyclohexane: **1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane**.\n\nNow, let's determine the molecular formula of the product:\n*   **Carbon atoms (C):** The carbon skeleton remains the same, so there are still 10 carbon atoms.\n*   **Hydrogen atoms (H):** The product is a saturated monocyclic alkane. The general formula for such a compound is CnH2n.\n    *   For C = 10, the number of hydrogens will be H = 2 * 10 = 20.\n*   The molecular formula of the product is **C10H20**.\n\n### 4. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (also known as the degree of unsaturation) is calculated using the molecular formula C10H20.\nIHD = C + 1 - H/2\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (20/2)\nIHD = 11 - 10\nIHD = 1\n\nAlternatively, the IHD can be determined directly from the structure of the product, 1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane. The IHD is the sum of the number of rings and pi bonds.\n*   Number of rings = 1\n*   Number of double or triple bonds = 0\nTherefore, the IHD is 1.\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
