    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at the two specified points in the titration.\n\n### 1. Initial State and Dilution\n\n*   **Initial acetic acid (HA):** 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M solution.\n*   **Dilution:** An additional 20.00 cm³ of water is added.\n*   **Titrant:** 0.1 M NaOH (a strong base).\n*   **Acid dissociation constant (Ka) for acetic acid:** 1.85 x 10⁻⁵.\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of the acetic acid solution after dilution.\n\n*   **Initial moles of acetic acid:**\n    Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.02000 L = 0.001 mol\n*   **New total volume:**\n    Volume = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.04000 L\n*   **New concentration of acetic acid:**\n    Molarity = Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.04000 L = 0.025 M\n\n### 2. Equivalence Point Volume\n\nThe equivalence point is reached when the moles of added NaOH equal the initial moles of acetic acid.\n\n*   **Moles of NaOH needed:** 0.001 mol\n*   **Volume of NaOH to reach equivalence point:**\n    Volume = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n### 3. pH at 25% Titration\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH, forming its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻).\n\n*   **Volume of NaOH added:** 25% of 10.00 cm³ = 2.50 cm³ = 0.00250 L\n*   **Moles of NaOH added:** 0.1 mol/L × 0.00250 L = 0.00025 mol\n*   This reaction creates a buffer solution containing unreacted acetic acid and the newly formed acetate.\n    *   **Moles of acetate (A⁻) formed:** 0.00025 mol\n    *   **Moles of acetic acid (HA) remaining:** 0.001 mol - 0.00025 mol = 0.00075 mol\n\nTo find the pH of this buffer, we use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\n*   **pKa:**\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   **Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:**\n    pH = pKa + log ( [A⁻] / [HA] )\n\nSince the acid and its conjugate base are in the same solution, we can use the ratio of their moles.\n\n*   pH = 4.73 + log (0.00025 / 0.00075)\n*   pH = 4.73 + log (1/3)\n*   pH = 4.73 - 0.477\n*   **pH ≈ 4.26**\n\n### 4. pH at the Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the initial acetic acid (0.001 mol) has been converted into its conjugate base, acetate (0.001 mol).\n\n*   **Total volume of solution:**\n    Initial diluted acid volume + NaOH volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n*   **Concentration of acetate ([A⁻]):**\n    Concentration = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.020 M\n\nThe acetate ion hydrolyzes water, producing OH⁻ ions, which makes the solution basic.\n\nA⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HA + OH⁻\n\nWe need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate.\n\n*   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n*   We set up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis:\n    Kb = [HA][OH⁻] / [A⁻]\n    5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.020 - x)\n*   Assuming 'x' is much smaller than 0.020, we can simplify:\n    x² ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.020\n    x² ≈ 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   Now, calculate pOH:\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n*   Finally, calculate pH:\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48\n*   **pH ≈ 8.52**\n\nThe calculated values are a pH of **4.26** at 25% titration and a pH of **8.52** at the equivalence point.\n\n<<<B>>>"
