    "To determine which energy difference allows the two quantum states to be clearly resolved, we must use the time-energy formulation of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. This principle states that a quantum state that exists for a limited time cannot have a perfectly defined energy. The uncertainty in the energy (ΔE) and the lifetime of the state (Δt, or τ) are related by the formula:\n\nΔE ⋅ τ ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant. For practical calculations, this is often approximated as:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\nThis ΔE represents the inherent \"width\" or \"blurriness\" of an energy level. For two energy levels to be clearly distinguishable, their energy separation must be significantly greater than their individual energy widths.\n\nFirst, we identify the value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ) in units of electronvolt-seconds (eV·s):\nħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\nNext, we calculate the energy width (ΔE) for each state using their respective lifetimes (τ):\n\n*   **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nThe state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has the larger energy width (ΔE₁), which is the dominant factor for resolution. For the two energy levels to be clearly resolved, the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be substantially larger than this dominant energy width.\n\nThe condition is: |E₁ - E₂| >> ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nNow let's compare this requirement with the given options:\n*   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV  (Much smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   B) 10⁻⁸ eV  (Smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   D) 10⁻⁹ eV  (Much smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   C) 10⁻⁴ eV  (Much larger than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n\nOnly the energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is significantly larger than the energy width of either state. This large separation ensures that the inherent \"blur\" of the energy levels does not cause them to overlap, allowing them to be clearly distinguished.\n\n<<<C>>>"
