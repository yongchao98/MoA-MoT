    "In a universe where magnetic monopoles (isolated north or south poles) could exist, two of Maxwell's equations would need to be modified to account for them.\n\nThe two affected equations would be:\n\n*   **Gauss's Law for Magnetism**: In our universe, this law states that the divergence of the magnetic field (∇·B) is zero. This is the mathematical expression of the fact that magnetic field lines always form closed loops and that there are no magnetic monopoles to act as a source or a sink. If magnetic monopoles existed, they would be sources of the magnetic field, just as electric charges are sources of the electric field. Therefore, this law would be modified to show that the divergence of the magnetic field is proportional to the density of magnetic charge.\n\n*   **Faraday's Law of Induction**: This law describes how a changing magnetic field creates a circulating electric field (the curl of E, or ∇×E). The existence of magnetic monopoles implies a greater symmetry between electricity and magnetism. Just as a moving electric charge constitutes an electric current, a moving magnetic monopole would constitute a magnetic current. This new magnetic current would act as a source for a circulating electric field and would need to be added as a new term in Faraday's Law.\n\nTherefore, the two equations that would change relate to the divergence of the magnetic field and the circulation (or curl) of the electric field.\n\n<<<A>>>"
