    "To determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product, we must first elucidate the structure of product 4 through the given reaction sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\nAcetic acid (CH₃COOH) is treated with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating. This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction, where the α-carbon of the carboxylic acid is brominated.\nProduct 1 is α-bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\nProduct 1 (BrCH₂COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a Fischer esterification reaction.\nProduct 2 is ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\nProduct 2 (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion is a strong nucleophile and displaces the bromide in an Sₙ2 reaction.\nProduct 3 is ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\nProduct 3 (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH₂)₅Br).\n1.  Sodium hydride, a strong base, deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, which is acidic due to the adjacent electron-withdrawing cyano and ester groups, forming an enolate: [NC-CH-COOCH₂CH₃]⁻.\n2.  This enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromide ion and forming an intermediate: NC-CH( (CH₂)₅Br )-COOCH₂CH₃.\n3.  Since excess NaH is used, it deprotonates the α-carbon again, forming a new enolate: [NC-C( (CH₂)₅Br )-COOCH₂CH₃]⁻.\n4.  This enolate undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction. The carbanion attacks the carbon at the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion and forming a six-membered ring.\nThe final product, 4, is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n**1H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 4**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals for ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n1.  **Conformation:** The cyclohexane ring is substituted at the C1 position with two bulky groups (a cyano group and an ethyl carboxylate group). This significant 1,1-disubstitution will create a high energy barrier for chair-chair interconversion. Therefore, the ring can be considered \"locked\" in a single chair conformation on the NMR timescale.\n\n2.  **Symmetry:** Let's analyze the symmetry of the molecule in its locked chair conformation.\n    *   Strictly speaking, the molecule does not have a plane of symmetry. A plane passing through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group is disrupted by the ethyl portion (-CH₂CH₃) of the ester, which is not symmetric with respect to this plane.\n    *   However, in the context of typical organic chemistry problems, it is a common and reasonable simplification to assume that the rapid rotation of the ester group creates an *effective* plane of symmetry that passes through C1 and C4.\n\n3.  **Counting the Signals (assuming effective Cₛ symmetry):**\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C6, and the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C5.\n    *   Because the chair is locked, the axial (ax) and equatorial (eq) protons on each carbon are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct.\n\nLet's count the distinct sets of protons:\n*   **Ethyl group:** The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent, and the two protons of the methylene group (-CH₂-) are equivalent (within this simplified model). This gives **2 signals**.\n*   **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n    *   **C2 and C6:** The two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) are equivalent to each other. The two equatorial protons are also equivalent to each other, but distinct from the axial ones. This gives **2 signals** (one for H-2ax/H-6ax and one for H-2eq/H-6eq).\n    *   **C3 and C5:** Similarly, the protons on these carbons give rise to another **2 signals** (one for H-3ax/H-5ax and one for H-3eq/H-5eq).\n    *   **C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. Its two protons (axial and equatorial) are diastereotopic and therefore not equivalent. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nSumming them up: 2 (from ethyl group) + 2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) + 2 (from C4) = 8 distinct hydrogen signals.\n\nThe options are:\nA) 8\nB) 10\nC) 5\nD) 12\n\nOur analysis based on standard simplifying assumptions leads to 8 signals.\n\n<<<A>>>"
