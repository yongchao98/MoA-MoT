    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the major products, A and B.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\nThis reaction is a Michael addition.\n\n1.  **Formation of the Enolate (Nucleophile):** The base used is potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), which is a strong and sterically hindered base. It will abstract an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form an enolate.\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   The α-carbon at position C2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl and a methyl group), so it has no protons to be removed.\n    *   The α-carbon at position C6 is a tertiary carbon (bonded to a hydrogen and a methyl group). This is the only position where deprotonation can occur.\n    *   The t-BuOK base removes the proton from C6, creating a nucleophilic enolate.\n\n2.  **Conjugate Addition:** The Michael acceptor is ethyl acrylate, an α,β-unsaturated ester. The enolate formed at C6 of the cyclohexanone will attack the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n3.  **Product Formation:** After the nucleophilic attack, the resulting intermediate is protonated to yield the final product, A. A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the original ethyl acrylate molecule.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The product has the ethyl propanoate group (`-CH2CH2COOEt`) attached to the C6 position of the original ketone. The structure is 2-ethyl-6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   To match the options, we need to name this structure according to IUPAC rules where the ethyl propanoate is the parent chain.\n    *   The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on the C3 position of the ethyl propanoate.\n    *   For naming the substituent, the point of attachment to the main chain is designated as C1 of the ring.\n        *   This position (the original C6 of the ketone) has a methyl group, so there is a `1-methyl` substituent.\n        *   The adjacent carbon with the carbonyl group (original C1) becomes C2, so there is a `2-oxo` substituent.\n        *   The next carbon (original C2) becomes C3, which has both an ethyl and a methyl group, leading to `3-ethyl` and `3-methyl` substituents.\n    *   Combining these parts, the substituent name is `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\nThis is also a Michael addition reaction.\n\n1.  **Formation of the Carbanion (Nucleophile):** The base KOH deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane. These protons are acidic due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the nitro group. This creates the nucleophile `CH₃CH₂C⁻HNO₂`.\n\n2.  **Conjugate Addition:** The Michael acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as trans-crotononitrile, `CH₃CH=CHCN`). The carbanion attacks the β-carbon of this α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n3.  **Product Formation:** The resulting intermediate is protonated by water to give the final product, B. A new C-C bond forms between C1 of the nitropropane and C3 of the butenenitrile.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:**\n    *   The resulting structure is `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n    *   To name this molecule, the nitrile group (`-CN`) has the highest priority and determines the suffix and numbering of the parent chain. The chain is a hexanenitrile.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1: `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the full IUPAC name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nMatching these two products with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A, Incorrect B)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (**Correct A, Correct B**)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A, Correct B)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Correct A, Incorrect B)\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies both products is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
