    "The problem asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both the z-component of the orbital angular momentum of electron 1 ($L_{1z}$) and electron 2 ($L_{2z}$) to be $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to finding the probability that a measurement will yield the quantum numbers $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\nThe two-electron system is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1, 2, -1>$. In this state, the total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$, and the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum is $m=-1$.\n\nThe total z-component of the angular momentum is the sum of the individual components: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$. A fundamental principle of quantum mechanics is that if a system is in an eigenstate of an operator, any measurement of the corresponding observable will yield the eigenvalue of that state. In this case, the system is in an eigenstate of the total angular momentum z-component operator, $L_z$, with a well-defined eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\nWhen a joint measurement of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ is performed, the sum of the outcomes must equal the total z-component of the angular momentum. The eigenvalues of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ are given by $m_{l1}\\hbar$ and $m_{l2}\\hbar$, respectively. Therefore, any measurement must satisfy the condition $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = m = -1$.\n\nThe question asks for the probability of the outcome where $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$. For this specific outcome, the sum of the z-component quantum numbers would be $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n\nSince this resulting total z-component ($m=-2$) is different from the system's well-defined total z-component ($m=-1$), this outcome violates the conservation of angular momentum. Therefore, the probability of observing this outcome is zero.\n\nTo confirm this with a formal calculation, one can express the coupled state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ in the uncoupled basis $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}>$ using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\nThe expansion is:\n$|1, 1, 2, -1> = <1, 0; 1, -1|2, -1>|1, 0; 1, -1> + <1, -1; 1, 0|2, -1>|1, -1; 1, 0>$\nUsing a standard table of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, both coefficients are $\\sqrt{1/2}$:\n$|1, 1, 2, -1> = \\sqrt{1/2}|1, 0; 1, -1> + \\sqrt{1/2}|1, -1; 1, 0>$\n\nThe probability of finding the system in the state with $m_{l1}=-1$ and $m_{l2}=-1$ (denoted as $|1, -1; 1, -1>$) is the square of the magnitude of the projection of the system's state onto this target state:\n$P(m_{l1}=-1, m_{l2}=-1) = |<1, -1; 1, -1| (|1, 1, 2, -1>)|^2$\n$P = |<1, -1; 1, -1| (\\sqrt{1/2}|1, 0; 1, -1> + \\sqrt{1/2}|1, -1; 1, 0>)|^2$\n\nDue to the orthonormality of the basis vectors, the inner product $<1, -1; 1, -1|1, 0; 1, -1>$ is 0, and the inner product $<1, -1; 1, -1|1, -1; 1, 0>$ is also 0. Thus, the entire expression evaluates to 0, and the probability is $0^2=0$.\n\n<<<B>>>"
