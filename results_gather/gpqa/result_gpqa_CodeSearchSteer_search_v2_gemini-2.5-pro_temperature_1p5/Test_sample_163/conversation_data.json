    "To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we can use the principles of orbital mechanics for binary star systems. For a double-lined spectroscopic binary, where the radial velocities of both stars can be measured, the total mass of the system (the sum of the masses of the two stars, M = m₁ + m₂) can be related to the orbital period (P) and the radial velocity amplitudes (K₁ and K₂).\n\nFor an eclipsing binary system, we can assume the orbital inclination is close to 90 degrees (sin(i) ≈ 1), which simplifies the calculations. We can also assume circular orbits, as is common for eclipsing binaries.\n\nThe total mass (M_total) of a binary system is given by the formula:\n\nM_total = (P / (2πG)) * (K₁ + K₂)³\n\nWhere:\n*   P is the orbital period\n*   K₁ and K₂ are the amplitudes of the radial velocities for the two stars\n*   G is the gravitational constant\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M_total_1) to the total mass of system_2 (M_total_2).\n\n**For system_1:**\n*   Orbital period (P₁) = 2 years\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_total_1) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**For system_2:**\n*   Orbital period (P₂) = 1 year\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_total_2) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nNow, we can set up the ratio of the masses:\n\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = [ (P₁ / (2πG)) * (K_total_1)³ ] / [ (P₂ / (2πG)) * (K_total_2)³ ]\n\nThe constant term (1 / (2πG)) cancels out, leaving:\n\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = (P₁ / P₂) * (K_total_1 / K_total_2)³\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into the equation:\n\n*   P₁ / P₂ = 2 years / 1 year = 2\n*   K_total_1 / K_total_2 = 15 km/s / 25 km/s = 3/5\n\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = 2 * (3/5)³\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = 54 / 125\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = 0.432\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
