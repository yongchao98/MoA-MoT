    "### Analysis of the Final Product\n\nThe provided spectroscopic data is key to identifying the structure of the reaction product.\n\n*   **¹³C NMR Spectrum**: The signal at **δ 197.7 ppm** is characteristic of a **ketone** carbonyl carbon. The signals in the aromatic region, particularly the two signals each accounting for two carbons (**δ 126.9 (2C)** and **δ 129.1 (2C)**), along with two other quaternary carbons, strongly suggest a **para-substituted benzene ring**.\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum**: The aromatic region shows two distinct doublets at **δ 7.08 (2H, d)** and **δ 7.71 (2H, d)**. This pattern is a classic indicator of para-substitution on a benzene ring. The presence of two separate methyl singlets at **δ 2.28 (3H, s)** and **δ 2.31 (3H, s)** indicates two methyl groups that are not adjacent to any protons. The two doublets in the olefinic region at **δ 6.75 (1H, d)** and **δ 7.68 (1H, d)** signify two non-equivalent vinyl protons coupled to each other (`-CH=CH-`).\n\nBased on this evidence, the product can be assembled as follows:\n1.  A ketone functional group (`C=O`).\n2.  A para-substituted benzene ring. One of the substituents is a methyl group (accounting for one methyl singlet, e.g., at δ 2.31 ppm). This forms a **p-tolyl group** (`CH₃-C₆H₄-`).\n3.  The rest of the molecule consists of an α,β-unsaturated ketone system attached to the p-tolyl group. This part must contain the second methyl singlet and the two vinyl protons.\n4.  The structure that fits all these features is **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**, also known as 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n    *   `p-Tolyl group`: `CH₃-` (δ ~2.31 s) and `-C₆H₄-` (δ ~7.08 d, 7.71 d).\n    *   `but-3-en-2-one` part: `-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`. The `-CH=CH-` protons account for the doublets at δ 6.75 and 7.68. The acetyl methyl group `-C(=O)CH₃` is a singlet, accounting for the signal at δ 2.28. The ketone carbon corresponds to the δ 197.7 signal. This structure perfectly matches the provided NMR data. The molecular formula of this product is C₁₁H₁₂O.\n\n### Analysis of the Reaction and Starting Material\n\nThe reaction involves heating Compound X (C₁₁H₁₂O) with DABCO, a non-nucleophilic base, which points towards a base-catalyzed rearrangement. Since the starting materials are all epoxides, this is a rearrangement of an epoxide. Specifically, vinyl epoxides are known to rearrange to α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds.\n\nNow we must determine which of the possible starting materials would yield `4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one`.\n\n*   **A) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane**: This compound has a phenyl group (`C₆H₅-`), not the p-tolyl group found in the product. The reaction conditions are not suitable for adding a methyl group to the aromatic ring.\n*   **B) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane**: The structure is `CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂`. This compound has the correct molecular formula (C₁₁H₁₂O) and contains the required p-tolyl group. This type of conjugated vinyl epoxide is known to undergo base-catalyzed rearrangement to form an α,β-unsaturated ketone. The plausible mechanism involves the formation of 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n*   **C) 2-styrylepoxide**: The molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₀O, which does not match that of Compound X.\n*   **D) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane**: This compound has a phenyl group, not the p-tolyl group found in the product.\n\nTherefore, the only plausible starting material that contains the correct carbon skeleton and can rearrange to the identified product under the given conditions is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<B>>>"
