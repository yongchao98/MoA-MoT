    "The user's question describes a scenario analogous to two different modes of double-beta decay.\n\n*   **Original Decay (2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V):** This is equivalent to the standard two-neutrino double-beta decay (2νββ). In this process, the decay energy is shared among the two final-state electrons (particles E) and two antineutrinos (particles V). Because the energy is shared among four light particles (plus the recoil of the heavy nucleus), the summed kinetic energy of the two E particles has a broad, continuous spectrum. The endpoint of this spectrum, Q, is determined by the total energy released in the decay.\n\n*   **Exotic Decay (2A -> 2B + 2E + M):** This is equivalent to a neutrinoless double-beta decay with the emission of a single, massless exotic particle called a Majoron (M). In this case, the decay energy is shared among the two E particles, the particle M, and the recoiling nucleus. Since the final state still consists of multiple bodies (three, not counting the nucleus), the energy is shared among them. Consequently, the summed energy spectrum of the two E particles remains continuous.\n\nThe key difference lies in the total energy available to the final particles.\n\n*   In the original decay, the total kinetic energy released is `Q_orig = (2m_A - 2m_B - 2m_E - 2m_V)c²`. The endpoint of the E spectrum corresponds to this value (minus a negligible recoil energy for the B nuclei).\n*   In the exotic decay, the total kinetic energy released is `Q_exotic = (2m_A - 2m_B - 2m_E)c²`, since M is massless.\n\nComparing the two, `Q_exotic = Q_orig + 2m_V c²`. Since particle V is described as \"much lighter,\" it has a non-zero mass (`m_V > 0`). Therefore, more energy is released in the exotic decay than in the original decay.\n\nThis entire released energy is available as kinetic energy to the final particles. The maximum possible kinetic energy for the two E particles—the endpoint of their spectrum—is the total energy released. As `Q_exotic > Q_orig`, the endpoint of the spectrum for the exotic decay is higher than for the original decay.\n\nTherefore, the spectrum remains continuous but its shape is altered, and the endpoint increases.\n\n<<<D>>>"
