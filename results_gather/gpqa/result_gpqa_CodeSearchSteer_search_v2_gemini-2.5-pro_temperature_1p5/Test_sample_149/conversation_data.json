    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Starting Material**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C₈H₉NO\n*   **1H-NMR Data Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift and triplet splitting pattern are characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This doublet for two protons is consistent with a methylene group (-CH₂-) coupled to the aldehyde proton.\n\n*   **Structure Determination:** Assembling these fragments, the starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. The formula C₈H₉NO is consistent with this structure.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Reagents 1 & 2 (1. NaNO₂ + HCl; 2. H₂O):** This is a standard two-step process for converting a primary aromatic amine into a phenol.\n    *   The primary amine on 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde reacts with NaNO₂ and HCl to form a diazonium salt.\n    *   Heating the diazonium salt in water replaces the diazonium group (-N₂⁺) with a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    *   The product of this stage is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Reagent 3 (aq. KOH, Heat):** These are the classic conditions for an **Aldol Condensation** reaction.\n    *   The term \"aldol\" refers to reactions between aldehydes or ketones. Since we have only one type of aldehyde that has α-hydrogens (the hydrogens on the -CH₂- group), it will undergo a self-condensation.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** The base (KOH) removes an α-hydrogen from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. After protonation, this forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is the aldol *addition* product. The structure is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option C).\n    *   **Aldol Condensation:** The reaction conditions explicitly include **heat**. Heating an aldol reaction drives a dehydration (elimination of water) reaction to form a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. This is known as the aldol *condensation* product. When you see \"heat\" specified in an aldol reaction, the condensation product is the expected final product.\n    *   The dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal forms a double bond between the α and β carbons (C2 and C3), resulting in **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Final Product**\n\nBased on the reaction sequence, the initial aldol addition product (C) is formed and then subsequently dehydrated due to the heat, yielding the aldol condensation product (D).\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde\n*   **Intermediate:** 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde\n*   **Aldol Addition Product:** 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (Structure C)\n*   **Final Condensation Product (with heat):** 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal (Structure D)\n\nThe question asks for the final product after all three steps, including heating with KOH. Therefore, the condensation product is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
