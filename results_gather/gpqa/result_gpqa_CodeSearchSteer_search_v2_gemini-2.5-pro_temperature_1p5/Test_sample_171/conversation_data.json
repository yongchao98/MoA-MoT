    "The search results confirm the key physical principles used in the derivation.\n\n1.  **Boltzmann Constant (k)**: The searches confirm that the value of the Boltzmann constant is k ≈ 1.380649 × 10⁻²³ J/K. This is crucial as it matches the value of the energy difference (ΔE) given in the problem, making the ratio ΔE/k equal to approximately 1.\n\n2.  **Boltzmann Equation**: Several sources confirm the Boltzmann equation, which relates the populations of two energy levels (N_a, N_b) in a system in thermal equilibrium at temperature T. The equation is given as:\n    N_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp(-(E_b - E_a) / (k * T)).\n    This is the exact formula I used in my initial derivation. The assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) in the stellar photospheres justifies the use of this equation.\n\nThe derivation steps were:\n1.  Define the ratio of excited atoms for each star using the Boltzmann Equation. Let 'j' be the excited state and 'i' be the ground state.\n    *   For Star 1 (Temperature T₁): (N_j / N_i)₁ = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))\n    *   For Star 2 (Temperature T₂): (N_j / N_i)₂ = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\n2.  Use the problem statement that the excitation in star 1 is double that of star 2:\n    *   (N_j / N_i)₁ = 2 * (N_j / N_i)₂\n\n3.  Substitute the Boltzmann equations into this relation:\n    *   (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\n4.  Cancel the statistical weight term (g_j / g_i) as it's the same for both:\n    *   exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\n5.  Take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    *   -ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T₂)\n\n6.  Rearrange to solve for ln(2):\n    *   ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T₂) - ΔE / (k * T₁)\n    *   ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁)\n    *   ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁*T₂) ]\n\n7.  Substitute the given values. The problem states ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J, and we know k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K. Therefore, the ratio ΔE/k ≈ 1 K.\n\n8.  The final equation is:\n    *   ln(2) = [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁*T₂) ]\n\nThis matches option A. The logic is sound and supported by fundamental physics principles confirmed in the search results.\n\n<<<A>>>"
