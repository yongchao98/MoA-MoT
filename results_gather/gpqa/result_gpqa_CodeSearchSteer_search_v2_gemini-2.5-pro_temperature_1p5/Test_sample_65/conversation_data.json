    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as an extension of the Standard Model, incorporating higher-dimensional operators that are suppressed by a high-energy scale. The construction of the SMEFT Lagrangian is based on fundamental principles of quantum field theory and observed symmetries.\n\n1.  **Lorentz and Poincare Symmetry:** The SMEFT Lagrangian is built to be an infinite series of local, higher-dimensional operators constructed from Standard Model fields that obey both gauge and Poincaré symmetries. Poincaré symmetry, which includes Lorentz transformations (boosts and rotations) and spacetime translations, is a fundamental symmetry of spacetime in quantum field theory and is a core assumption in the construction of SMEFT.\n\n2.  **CPT Symmetry:** CPT (Charge-Parity-Time Reversal) symmetry is a fundamental theorem in any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory. Since SMEFT adheres to these principles, it must also respect CPT symmetry. In fact, a violation of CPT symmetry would imply a violation of Lorentz invariance.\n\n3.  **CP Symmetry:** In contrast, CP (Charge-Parity) symmetry is known to be violated in the Standard Model itself. SMEFT, being an extension, not only accommodates the CP violation of the Standard Model but also introduces new potential sources of CP violation through higher-dimensional operators. Therefore, SMEFT operators are not required to respect CP symmetry.\n\nBased on these principles, all operators in the SMEFT must respect Lorentz and Poincare symmetry, as well as CPT symmetry.\n\n<<<C>>>"
