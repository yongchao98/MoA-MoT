    "The performed search confirms that the initial reasoning was correct. The key physics principles are the formula for planetary equilibrium temperature and Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion.\n\n*   **Planetary Equilibrium Temperature:** The search results confirm that the equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on the star's properties (temperature and radius) and the planet's orbital distance (a) and albedo (A). For planets orbiting the same star and having the same albedo, the relationship simplifies, showing that temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance (`T_eq ∝ 1/√a`). This validates the first step of the calculation. The problem states the orbits are circular, so the semi-major axis is equivalent to the orbital radius.\n\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** The search results also broadly confirm Kepler's Third Law, which states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a). This can be written as P² ∝ a³, or P ∝ a^(3/2). This validates the second major step of the calculation.\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The provided information on planetary masses and the TTV discovery method are confirmed to be distractors for this particular question. The TTV method uses gravitational interactions between planets to find them or determine their mass, but the question posed can be solved using the more fundamental relationships between temperature, distance, and period. The general form of Kepler's Third Law does include planetary mass, but this is only a minor correction when the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, which is a standard assumption.\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\n\n1.  **Find the ratio of orbital radii from temperature ratios.**\n    *   Given: T₁ / T₂ = 1.4 and T₂ / T₃ = 2.3.\n    *   Since T ∝ a⁻⁰.⁵, we have (T₁ / T₂) = (a₂ / a₁)⁰.⁵.\n    *   Therefore, a₂ / a₁ = (T₁ / T₂)² = 1.4² = 1.96.\n    *   Similarly, a₃ / a₂ = (T₂ / T₃)² = 2.3² = 5.29.\n\n2.  **Calculate the total ratio of the outer to inner orbital radii.**\n    *   a₃ / a₁ = (a₃ / a₂) * (a₂ / a₁) = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684.\n\n3.  **Use Kepler's Third Law to find the ratio of orbital periods.**\n    *   According to Kepler's law, (P₃ / P₁)² = (a₃ / a₁)³.\n    *   P₃ / P₁ = (a₃ / a₁)¹·⁵ = (10.3684)¹·⁵.\n    *   P₃ / P₁ ≈ 33.4.\n\nThis result matches one of the provided options.\n\n<<<B>>>"
