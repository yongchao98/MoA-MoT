    "This is a quantum mechanics problem involving sequential measurements. Here is a step-by-step solution.\n\n**1. Define and Normalize the Initial State**\n\nThe initial state of the system is given by the column matrix (ket):\n|ψ⟩ = `[[-1], [2], [1]]`\n\nFirst, we need to normalize this state vector. The norm squared of the state is:\n⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)*(-1) + (2)*(2) + (1)*(1) = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6\n\nThe normalization constant is 1/√6. The normalized state, |ψ_norm⟩, is:\n|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * `[[-1], [2], [1]]`\n\n**2. Analyze the Measurement of Operator P**\n\nThe operator P is represented by the matrix:\nP = `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n\nWe need to find the probability of getting the result 0 for P. This requires finding the eigenvector of P corresponding to the eigenvalue λ = 0.\n\n*   **Find eigenvalues of P:** The characteristic equation is det(P - λI) = 0.\n    -λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = 0\n    -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = 0\n    λ - λ³ = 0\n    λ(1 - λ²) = 0\n    The eigenvalues of P are λ = 0, 1, -1.\n\n*   **Find the eigenvector for eigenvalue λ = 0:** Let the eigenvector be |v_P0⟩ = `[[x], [y], [z]]`.\n    P|v_P0⟩ = 0 * |v_P0⟩\n    `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]` * `[[x], [y], [z]]` = `[[0], [0], [0]]`\n    This gives the equations:\n    1.  (1/√2)y = 0  => y = 0\n    2.  (1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0 => x + z = 0 => x = -z\n\n    So, the eigenvector is of the form `[[x], [0], [-x]]`. To normalize it, x² + 0² + (-x)² = 1, which gives 2x² = 1, so x = 1/√2.\n    The normalized eigenvector for λ=0 is |v_P0⟩ = (1/√2) * `[[1], [0], [-1]]`.\n\n*   **Calculate the probability of measuring P=0:**\n    Prob(P=0) = |⟨v_P0|ψ_norm⟩|²\n    The inner product ⟨v_P0|ψ_norm⟩ is:\n    ⟨v_P0|ψ_norm⟩ = [(1/√2) * `[1, 0, -1]`] * [(1/√6) * `[[-1],,]`]\n    = (1/√12) * (1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1)\n    = (1/√12) * (-2) = -2 / (2√3) = -1/√3\n    The probability is Prob(P=0) = (-1/√3)² = 1/3.\n\n**3. State Collapse and Measurement of Operator Q**\n\nAfter measuring P=0, the state of the system collapses to the corresponding eigenvector:\n|ψ'⟩ = |v_P0⟩ = (1/√2) * `[[1], [0], [-1]]`\n\nNow, we measure operator Q on this new state |ψ'⟩. The operator Q is:\nQ = `[[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`\n\nWe want to find the probability of getting the result -1 for Q.\n\n*   **Find the eigenvector for eigenvalue λ = -1:** Since Q is a diagonal matrix, its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements (1, 0, -1), and its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.\n    The normalized eigenvector for λ = -1 is |v_Q-1⟩ = `[[0], [0], [1]]`.\n\n*   **Calculate the probability of measuring Q=-1:**\n    This probability is calculated on the collapsed state |ψ'⟩.\n    Prob(Q=-1 after P=0) = |⟨v_Q-1|ψ'⟩|²\n    The inner product ⟨v_Q-1|ψ'⟩ is:\n    ⟨v_Q-1|ψ'⟩ = [``] * [(1/√2) * `[,, [-1]]`]\n    = (1/√2) * (0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1))\n    = -1/√2\n    The probability is Prob(Q=-1 after P=0) = (-1/√2)² = 1/2.\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Joint Probability**\n\nThe probability of getting 0 for P and then -1 for Q is the product of the individual probabilities calculated in the sequence:\nProb(P=0 and then Q=-1) = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 after P=0)\n= (1/3) * (1/2)\n= 1/6\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
