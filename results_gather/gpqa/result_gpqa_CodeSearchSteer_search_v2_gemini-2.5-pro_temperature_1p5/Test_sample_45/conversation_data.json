    "The self-metathesis of racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene provides a clear example of how stereochemistry influences reaction outcomes. The reactant is a 50:50 mixture of two enantiomers: (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene. A Grubbs catalyst facilitates the breaking and reforming of carbon-carbon double bonds. In this self-metathesis reaction, two molecules of the alkene react to form a new, longer alkene (a dimer) and ethene, which is excluded from the product count.\n\nThe reaction can proceed in three ways, depending on which enantiomers react:\n\n1.  **Reaction of two (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene molecules ((R) + (R)):** This combination produces 4,7-dimethyldec-5-ene with an (R) configuration at both chiral centers (C4 and C7). Because the newly formed double bond at C5 can be either *cis* (Z) or *trans* (E), two distinct products are formed. Both of these products, (E, 4R, 7R) and (Z, 4R, 7R), are chiral.\n\n2.  **Reaction of two (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene molecules ((S) + (S)):** This reaction is analogous to the first. It produces the enantiomers of the first pair of products: (E, 4S, 7S)- and (Z, 4S, 7S)-4,7-dimethyldec-5-ene. These are two additional distinct, chiral products.\n\n3.  **Cross-reaction of (R)- and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene ((R) + (S)):** This reaction leads to products with both (R) and (S) configurations (4R, 7S). Again, both E and Z isomers of the double bond can form.\n    *   The (Z, 4R, 7S) isomer possesses a center of inversion, which makes it an achiral *meso* compound.\n    *   The (E, 4R, 7S) isomer has a C2 axis of symmetry and is also an achiral *meso* compound.\n    Therefore, this cross-reaction adds two more distinct, achiral products to the mixture.\n\nIn total, these three reaction pathways generate a total of six different stereoisomeric products.\n\n<<<A>>>"
