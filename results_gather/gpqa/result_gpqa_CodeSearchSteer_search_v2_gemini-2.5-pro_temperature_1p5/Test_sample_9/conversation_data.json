    "To determine which exoplanet has the highest density among the given choices, let's analyze each option:\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This describes a planet essentially identical to Earth. Earth's average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly stated as being about 5.5 g/cm³, which is very close to Earth's density.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** For terrestrial (rocky) planets with the same chemical makeup, the density is not constant across different masses. A more massive planet will have stronger gravity, which compresses its material more significantly. This gravitational compression leads to a higher overall density. Therefore, a planet with the same composition as Earth but five times its mass would be considerably denser than Earth.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** Conversely, a planet with less mass will experience weaker gravitational compression. As a result, its density would be lower than that of Earth, assuming the same composition.\n\n**Comparison:**\n\n*   Planet (a) has a density of ~5.5 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (b) has a density of ~5.5 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (d) would have a density lower than 5.5 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (c), being much more massive than Earth but with the same composition, will be compressed to a higher density, making its density greater than 5.5 g/cm³.\n\nTherefore, the planet with five times the mass of Earth and the same composition will have the highest density due to greater gravitational compression.\n\n<<<C>>>"
