    "To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻), we must first calculate the pH of the buffer solution and then use the third dissociation constant of phosphoric acid.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the molar amounts and initial concentrations of the buffer components.\n\nThe buffer solution contains potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH₂PO₄) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O).\n\n*   **For KH₂PO₄ (the acid component, H₂PO₄⁻):**\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Molar Mass (Mw) = 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n\n*   **For Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O (the base component, HPO₄²⁻):**\n    *   Mass = 1.00 g\n    *   Molar Mass (Mw) = 177.99 g/mol\n    *   Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\nThe total volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 0.200 L. Now, we calculate the initial concentrations:\n\n*   **[H₂PO₄⁻]** = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n*   **[HPO₄²⁻]** = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺].\n\nThis solution is a phosphate buffer, and the relevant equilibrium is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid, which involves the H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻ conjugate acid-base pair. The equilibrium reaction is:\n\nH₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n\nThe acid dissociation constant for this reaction is Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸. We can use the equilibrium expression to find the hydrogen ion concentration, [H⁺]:\n\nKa₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n\nRearranging to solve for [H⁺]:\n\n[H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n[H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H⁺] ≈ 8.11x10⁻⁸ M\n\nAlternatively, one could use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH and then calculate [H⁺].\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO₄³⁻].\n\nThe concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is determined by the third dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n\nHPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n\nThe acid dissociation constant for this reaction is Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹². The equilibrium expression is:\n\nKa₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n\n[PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n\nWe use the initial concentration of HPO₄²⁻ (0.02809 M) and the calculated concentration of H⁺ (8.11x10⁻⁸ M):\n\n[PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11x10⁻⁸ M)\n[PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is approximately 6.24x10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<D>>>"
