    "The observed properties of the quasar's spectrum provide the necessary information to determine its redshift, which can then be used to calculate its comoving distance.\n\n### Redshift Calculation\n\nThe spectrum of the quasar shows a peak at an observed wavelength (λ_obs) of 790 nm, with a significant drop in flux at shorter wavelengths. This feature is characteristic of the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) emission line, which is redshifted due to the expansion of the universe. The drop-off, known as the Lyman-alpha forest, is caused by the absorption of light by neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium between the quasar and Earth.\n\nThe rest-frame wavelength (λ_rest) of the Lyman-alpha transition is approximately 121.6 nanometers (nm), or 1216 Ångströms.\n\nThe redshift (z) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n*z = (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1*\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n*z = (790 nm / 121.6 nm) - 1 ≈ 6.497 - 1 = 5.497*\n\nSo, the redshift of the quasar is approximately z ≈ 5.5.\n\n### Comoving Distance Calculation\n\nWith the redshift determined, the comoving distance can be calculated using the specified parameters of the Lambda-CDM cosmological model:\n*   **Hubble constant (H₀):** 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹\n*   **Matter density parameter (Ω_m):** 0.3\n*   **Dark energy density parameter (Ω_Λ):** 0.7\n\nFor a flat universe, the comoving distance is calculated by integrating over redshift. This complex calculation is best performed using a cosmological calculator. Using these cosmological parameters and the calculated redshift of z ≈ 5.5, the comoving distance is found to be approximately **8 Gpc**.\n\nSeveral online cosmological calculators, such as those developed by Ned Wright (UCLA) or available in astronomical software packages like Astropy, can perform this calculation. Based on the inputs provided, these tools yield a result that aligns with one of the given options.\n\nTherefore, the value of the comoving distance to this quasar is approximately 8 Gpc.\n\n<<<A>>>"
