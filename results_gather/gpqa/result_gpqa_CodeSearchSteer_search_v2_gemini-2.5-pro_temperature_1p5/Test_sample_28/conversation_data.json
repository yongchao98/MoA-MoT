    "To eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the barley cultivar, a loss-of-function mutation is required in the gene responsible for its synthesis. This type of mutation results in a complete or partial loss of the gene's function. Analyzing the different types of mutations found in the mutants reveals which is most likely to achieve this outcome.\n\nThe types of mutations that most reliably cause a loss of function are nonsense and frameshift mutations. A nonsense mutation changes a codon for an amino acid into a premature stop codon, which halts protein synthesis and typically results in a shortened, non-functional protein. A frameshift mutation, caused by an insertion or deletion of nucleotides not in a multiple of three, alters the reading frame of the gene. This changes all subsequent amino acids and almost always results in a non-functional protein. Missense mutations, which substitute one amino acid for another, may or may not eliminate the protein's function and are therefore less reliable for this purpose.\n\nLet's examine the specific mutants:\n*   **Intact gene codons:** 5’-ATG (Met) TTT (Phe) CTC (Leu) ... -3’\n*   **Mutant 1:** The sequence shows a change from CTC to TAC in the third codon. This is a **missense mutation**, changing the amino acid from Leucine to Tyrosine. The protein is still produced and might be functional.\n*   **Mutant 2:** The sequence shows a change from CTC to TAA in the third codon. TAA is a **stop codon**. This nonsense mutation would cause protein synthesis to terminate after only two amino acids. The resulting truncated protein would be non-functional, leading to a loss of function.\n*   **Mutant 3:** The sequence in this mutant is longer than the intact gene, indicating an insertion. This causes a **frameshift mutation**, which would alter the entire amino acid sequence from that point forward, leading to a loss of function. However, the problem states the mutations were induced by EMS, a chemical mutagen that primarily causes point mutations (single base substitutions), specifically G:C to A:T transitions. While EMS can in rare cases cause deletions or insertions, it is not the typical mechanism.\n*   **Mutant 4:** This mutant contains multiple changes, all of which are **missense mutations** that substitute one amino acid for another. While several amino acid changes increase the likelihood of disrupting function compared to a single change, it is not as certain as a premature stop codon.\n\nConsidering the types of mutations and their effects, both Mutant 2 and Mutant 3 would very likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. However, the question asks which is the *most probable* mutation to achieve this. Given that EMS was the mutagen used, a point mutation is the expected event. Mutant 2 contains a point mutation that results in a nonsense codon. This is a very common and effective way to create a knockout or null allele. Mutant 3's frameshift via insertion is not a characteristic EMS mutation. Therefore, Mutant 2 represents the most probable and effective mutation to eliminate the target compound under the specified experimental conditions.\n\n<<<D>>>"
