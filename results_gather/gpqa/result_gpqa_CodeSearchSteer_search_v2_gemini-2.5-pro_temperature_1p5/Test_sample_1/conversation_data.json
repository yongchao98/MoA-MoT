    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions to determine the number of carbon atoms in Product 3.\n\n**Step 1: trans-cinnamaldehyde + methylmagnesium bromide → Product 1**\n\n*   **trans-cinnamaldehyde** is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde with the structure Ph-CH=CH-CHO. It contains a phenyl group (6 carbons) and a three-carbon aldehyde chain, for a total of **9 carbon atoms**.\n*   **Methylmagnesium bromide (CH₃MgBr)** is a Grignard reagent. In reaction with an aldehyde, the nucleophilic methyl group attacks the carbonyl carbon in a 1,2-addition. This reaction adds one carbon atom from the methyl group to the cinnamaldehyde structure.\n*   **Product 1** is the resulting secondary alcohol, 4-phenyl-3-buten-2-ol (Ph-CH=CH-CH(OH)-CH₃).\n*   The number of carbon atoms in Product 1 is 9 + 1 = **10 carbon atoms**.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 + pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) → Product 2**\n\n*   **Product 1** (4-phenyl-3-buten-2-ol) is a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC)** is a mild oxidizing agent that selectively oxidizes secondary alcohols to ketones. It does not typically affect carbon-carbon double bonds.\n*   **Product 2** is the ketone, 4-phenyl-3-buten-2-one (Ph-CH=CH-C(O)-CH₃), also known as benzylideneacetone.\n*   No carbon atoms are added or removed during this oxidation step. Therefore, the number of carbon atoms in Product 2 remains **10 carbon atoms**.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 + (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane → Product 3**\n\n*   **Product 2** (4-phenyl-3-buten-2-one) is an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n*   The reagent, **(dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane**, is dimethylsulfoxonium methylide, also known as the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent.\n*   This sulfur ylide reacts with ketones to form epoxides. Specifically with α,β-unsaturated ketones, dimethylsulfoxonium methylide attacks the carbonyl group (1,2-addition) to yield a vinyloxirane (an epoxide adjacent to a double bond).\n*   The reaction involves the transfer of a methylene group (–CH₂–) from the ylide to the ketone, adding one carbon atom to the molecule.\n*   **Product 3** is 2-methyl-2-(2-phenylethenyl)oxirane.\n*   The number of carbon atoms in Product 3 is 10 + 1 = **11 carbon atoms**.\n\nBased on the reaction sequence, the final product contains 11 carbon atoms.\n\n<<<B>>>"
