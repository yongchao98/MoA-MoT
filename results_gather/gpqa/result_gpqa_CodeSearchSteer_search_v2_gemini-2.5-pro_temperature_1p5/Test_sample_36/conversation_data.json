    "The final product of the given reaction series is identified by systematically determining the product of each step.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 → A**\n    This reaction protects the aldehyde group of propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) with ethanedithiol (EDT, HSCH₂CH₂SH) using a Lewis acid catalyst (BF₃) to form a cyclic thioacetal. The resulting product, A, is 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane. The carbon atom that was part of the aldehyde group (the C2 position of the dithiane ring) is bonded to both a hydrogen atom and an ethyl group.\n\n2.  **Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\n    2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane (A) has an acidic proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms (the C2 position). Butyllithium (BuLi), a strong base, deprotonates this position to form a lithiated carbanion, B.\n\n3.  **Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\n    The nucleophilic carbanion (B) reacts with bromoethane in a nucleophilic substitution reaction. An ethyl group is added to the C2 position of the dithiane ring, which already has an ethyl group. The product, C, is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiane.\n\n4.  **Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\n    This step is the deprotection of the thioacetal. The C-S bonds are cleaved using mercuric chloride (HgCl₂), and the carbonyl group is regenerated. The C2 carbon, which is bonded to two ethyl groups, becomes a carbonyl carbon. The product, D, is diethyl ketone, also known as 3-pentanone (CH₃CH₂COCH₂CH₃).\n\n5.  **Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n    This is a Wittig reaction. First, triphenylphosphine (PPh₃) reacts with 3-bromopentane to form a phosphonium salt. This salt is then deprotonated by BuLi to create the Wittig reagent (ylide), (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃. This ylide then reacts with the ketone from the previous step, 3-pentanone (D). The carbonyl oxygen of the ketone is replaced by the alkylidene group of the ylide.\n    (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O + (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃ → (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂ + O=PPh₃\n    The final product, E, is 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.\n\n**¹³C-NMR Analysis of Product E**\n\nThe structure of the final product, E, is 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene:\n```\n      CH₃-CH₂   CH₂-CH₃\n             \\ /\n              C = C\n             / \\\n      CH₃-CH₂   CH₂-CH₃\n```\nTo determine the number of ¹³C-NMR signals, we must identify the number of chemically non-equivalent carbon atoms by examining the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe molecule 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene is highly symmetrical. It has a plane of symmetry through the C=C double bond and a C₂ rotational axis perpendicular to it.\n\n*   The two carbons of the central double bond (C=C) are chemically equivalent due to this symmetry. This will produce **one signal**.\n*   The four methylene carbons (-CH₂-) of the ethyl groups are all chemically equivalent. This will produce a **second signal**.\n*   The four methyl carbons (-CH₃) at the ends of the ethyl groups are also all chemically equivalent. This will produce a **third signal**.\n\nTherefore, due to its high degree of symmetry, 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene will produce a total of 3 signals in its ¹³C-NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<A>>>"
