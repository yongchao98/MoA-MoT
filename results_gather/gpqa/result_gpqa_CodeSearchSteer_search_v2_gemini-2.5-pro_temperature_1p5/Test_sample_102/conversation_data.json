    "An analysis of the target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, is the first step in determining the correct reaction sequence. The benzene ring has three substituents: an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2). These substituents are located at positions 1, 3, and 5, respectively, indicating a meta-relationship between all three groups. The key to solving this problem is to understand the directing effects of these substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions and to choose a sequence that results in this specific 1,3,5-substitution pattern with high yield.\n\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** This is a deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** This is a deactivating group but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** This is a strongly deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n\nLet's evaluate the given synthetic routes:\n\n**Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...**\n1.  **i) Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene reacts with acetyl chloride in the presence of aluminum chloride to form acetophenone. This introduces the -COCH3 group.\n2.  **ii) Bromination:** Acetophenone is then brominated. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director, so the bromine atom is introduced at the 3-position, yielding 3-bromoacetophenone.\n3.  **iii) Nitration:** The next step is the nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. The ring now has two substituents: the acetyl group at position 1 (*meta*-director) and the bromo group at position 3 (*ortho, para*-director).\n    *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming nitro group to the 5-position.\n    *   The -Br group directs to the 2, 4, and 6 positions.\n    When directing groups are in conflict, the outcome depends on their relative strengths and the reaction conditions. However, in this case, the position *meta* to the powerful *meta*-directing acetyl group (position 5) is the primary site of nitration. The reaction successfully yields 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThe synthesis is complete after these three steps. The subsequent steps listed in option A (iv to vii) are unnecessary for synthesizing the target molecule and appear to be distractors. The initial three steps represent a viable and direct route to the product.\n\n**Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n1.  **i) Nitration:** Benzene is nitrated to form nitrobenzene.\n2.  **ii) Reduction:** Nitrobenzene is reduced to aniline.\n3.  **iii) Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Aniline does not undergo Friedel-Crafts acylation on the ring. The basic amino group (-NH2) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) to form a highly deactivated complex, which prevents the electrophilic substitution reaction on the ring. This pathway is incorrect.\n\n**Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl ; iv) H3PO2 ; ...**\n1.  **i) Nitration:** Benzene to nitrobenzene.\n2.  **ii) Reduction:** Nitrobenzene to aniline.\n3.  **iii) Diazotization & iv) Deamination:** The sequence of diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) followed by reduction with hypophosphorous acid (H3PO2) converts the amino group back into a hydrogen atom. Steps i-iv result in converting benzene back into benzene, which is a nonsensical and redundant sequence.\n\n**Option D: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n1.  **i) Bromination:** Benzene is brominated to form bromobenzene.\n2.  **ii) Nitration:** Bromobenzene is nitrated. Since bromine is an *ortho, para*-director, a mixture of o-bromonitrobenzene and p-bromonitrobenzene is formed, with the para isomer being the major product.\n3.  **iii) Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** This step requires the acylation of p-bromonitrobenzene. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, and Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work well, if at all, on strongly deactivated rings. This pathway fails at this step.\n\nBased on this analysis, Option A is the only viable sequence. The first three steps lead directly to the desired product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n<<<A>>>"
