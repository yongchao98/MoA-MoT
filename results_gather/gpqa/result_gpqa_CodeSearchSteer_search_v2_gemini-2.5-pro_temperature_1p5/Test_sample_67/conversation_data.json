    "The physical phenomenon described is known as Larmor precession. When a magnetic moment is placed in an external magnetic field, it experiences a torque that causes its angular momentum vector to precess around the direction of the magnetic field. The frequency of this precession is called the Larmor frequency.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation for the oscillation frequency:\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The particle is a spin-1/2 particle, and its magnetic moment is initially aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in the \"spin-up\" state with respect to the z-axis. In quantum mechanics, this state is denoted as |+z⟩.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian**: The magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude B. The Hamiltonian (energy operator) for a magnetic moment **μ** in a magnetic field **B** is given by H = -**μ** · **B**. Since the magnetic moment is related to the spin angular momentum **S** by **μ** = γ**S** (where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio), the new Hamiltonian is H = -γ(Sy * B), where Sy is the spin operator for the y-direction.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution**: The state of the particle evolves according to the Schrödinger equation. The state at time *t*, |ψ(t)⟩, is given by applying the time evolution operator to the initial state: |ψ(t)⟩ = e^(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩. In this case, the state evolves as |ψ(t)⟩ = exp(i * γ * B * t * Sy / ħ) |+z⟩.\n\n4.  **Expectation Value**: We are interested in the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, ⟨μz(t)⟩. This is calculated as ⟨ψ(t)| μz |ψ(t)⟩. The operator μz is equal to γ*Sz. As the state |ψ(t)⟩ evolves, this expectation value changes.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Oscillation**: The calculation shows that the expectation value of the z-component of spin, ⟨Sz(t)⟩, oscillates as cos(γBt). The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is directly proportional to this: ⟨μz(t)⟩ ∝ cos(γBt).\n\n6.  **Oscillation Frequency**: The term inside the cosine function is ωt, where ω is the angular frequency of oscillation. By comparing this to the calculated expression, we can identify the angular frequency ω as γB. This frequency, known as the Larmor frequency, is independent of the initial orientation of the spin relative to the field.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle's moment is γB.\n\n<<<D>>>"
