    "Based on a review of the relevant scientific and industrial literature, the correct statement is D. Here is a detailed analysis of each statement:\n\n*   **A) Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.** This statement is ambiguous. While dual-catalyst systems are indeed used industrially in the US, such as Univation Technologies' PRODIGY™ technology, they are primarily for producing bimodal polyethylene (polymers with two different molecular weight distributions). The specific process of using one catalyst to create α-olefins (like 1-hexene) from ethylene and a second catalyst to copolymerize them in the same reactor—known as tandem catalysis—has been commercialized by Phillips (a US company) abroad, but it is not as widespread as bimodal technologies.\n\n*   **B) Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.** This statement is plausible. Noble metals like palladium and platinum can be used to create branches in polyethylene from ethylene alone through a mechanism called \"chain walking.\" However, the system described involves oligomerization to create α-olefins, a reaction for which noble metals are not the primary catalysts of choice. Their high cost is a generally accepted fact in industrial chemistry, which makes the assertion likely true but less specific to the process in question compared to other options.\n\n*   **C) Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.** This statement is incorrect. The essential step for creating branches from ethylene is the selective oligomerization of ethylene into α-olefins (e.g., trimerization to 1-hexene). Numerous research articles show that chromium-based catalysts for this very reaction are effectively activated by aluminum-based compounds like methylaluminoxane (MAO) and modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO). Therefore, aluminum-based activators are not only functional but are standard components in these systems.\n\n*   **D) One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.** This statement is correct. The most well-established and industrially successful catalysts for the selective oligomerization of ethylene to specific α-olefins like 1-hexene and 1-octene are based on the Group VIa metal, chromium. For instance, the Phillips catalyst system for ethylene trimerization uses a chromium salt in combination with specific ligands and activators. This process, which creates the short-chain branches in situ, directly aligns with the scientist's goal. These chromium catalysts require activation by co-catalysts, often aluminum alkyls, which fits the description of \"specific activators.\"\n\n<<<D>>>"
