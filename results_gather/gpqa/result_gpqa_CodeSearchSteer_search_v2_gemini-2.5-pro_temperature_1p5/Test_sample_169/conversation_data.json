    "To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, ⟨Sy⟩, we use the formula:\n\n⟨Sy⟩ = `<χ|Sy|χ> / <χ|χ>`\n\nWhere:\n*   `|χ⟩` is the spin state vector, given as `(3i, 4)`. In column vector form, `|χ⟩ = [3i, 4]^T`.\n*   `<χ|` is the conjugate transpose (bra vector) of `|χ⟩`. So, `<χ| = [-3i, 4]`.\n*   `Sy` is the spin operator in the y-direction, given by `Sy = (ħ/2) * σ_y`.\n*   `σ_y` is the Pauli Y-matrix:\n    `σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the denominator `<χ|χ>`**\nThis term normalizes the state.\n`<χ|χ> = [-3i, 4] * [3i, 4]^T`\n`<χ|χ> = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4)`\n`<χ|χ> = -9i² + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25`\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the numerator `<χ|Sy|χ>`**\nFirst, we apply the `Sy` operator to the `|χ⟩` vector:\n`Sy|χ> = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [3i, 4]^T`\n`Sy|χ> = (ħ/2) * [(0*3i + (-i)*4), (i*3i + 0*4)]^T`\n`Sy|χ> = (ħ/2) * [-4i, 3i²]^T`\n`Sy|χ> = (ħ/2) * [-4i, -3]^T`\n\nNow, we multiply this result by the bra vector `<χ|`:\n`<χ|Sy|χ> = [-3i, 4] * (ħ/2) * [-4i, -3]^T`\n`<χ|Sy|χ> = (ħ/2) * [(-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3)]`\n`<χ|Sy|χ> = (ħ/2) * [12i² - 12]`\n`<χ|Sy|χ> = (ħ/2) * [-12 - 12] = (ħ/2) * [-24] = -12ħ`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the final expectation value**\nNow, divide the result from Step 2 by the result from Step 1:\n`⟨Sy⟩ = -12ħ / 25`\nThis can be written as `-12*hbar/25`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options, the correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
