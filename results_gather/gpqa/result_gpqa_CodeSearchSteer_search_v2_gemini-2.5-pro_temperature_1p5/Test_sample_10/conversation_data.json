    "The correct response should identify the statement that is not true regarding the molecular biology of SARS-CoV-2.\n\n*   **Statement A** is correct. Studies using optical tweezers have shown that the frameshifting efficiency of viral pseudoknots is related to their conformational dynamics under tension. A linear correlation has been observed between the rate of frameshifting and the number of conformations a pseudoknot can adopt. Both the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 programmed -1 frameshift signals (PFSEs) are reported to adopt two main conformations under tension, which is consistent with their measured frameshifting rates.\n\n*   **Statement B** is correct. The SARS-CoV-2 accessory protein ORF3a has been shown to induce apoptosis by activating caspase-8, a key initiator of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. These studies also note that this activation occurs without altering the levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, which is central to the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway, thus pointing to the extrinsic pathway as the primary mechanism of initiation.\n\n*   **Statement C** is partially incorrect. Programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting does create two polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) by shifting the reading frame back by one nucleotide, a process that requires a \"slippery sequence\" and a downstream RNA pseudoknot. The pseudoknot structures of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are indeed highly similar. However, the statement that this process occurs \"near to 5' end of the genome\" is inaccurate. The frameshifting site is located at approximately nucleotide 13,462 of a nearly 30,000-nucleotide genome, which is close to the middle of the genome, not the 5' terminus.\n\n*   **Statement D** is incorrect. The SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14 complex does function as a heterodimer in which nsp10 activates the N-terminal exoribonuclease (ExoN) domain of nsp14. This complex performs a crucial proofreading function during RNA replication. However, the statement claims the active exonuclease complex *prevents* the breakdown of dsRNA. This is a direct contradiction of its function. An exonuclease is an enzyme that *degrades* nucleic acids. Specifically, the nsp14-ExoN complex excises mismatched nucleotides and preferentially degrades double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Therefore, the complex causes the breakdown of dsRNA, it does not prevent it.\n\nBoth C and D contain inaccuracies. However, the error in statement D is a fundamental contradiction of the protein's defined enzymatic activity, whereas the error in statement C is an inaccurate description of location. The description of an exonuclease complex preventing RNA breakdown is a more significant and definitive error in molecular biology.\n\n<<<D>>>"
