    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms.\n\n### Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of a trans-alkene, (E)-oct-4-ene, with mCPBA is a syn-addition. This stereospecific reaction results in the formation of a trans-epoxide. Specifically, it produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** The epoxide ring is opened by aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This is an anti-addition, where a water molecule attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite the oxygen bridge.\n    *   The attack of water on either enantiomer of the trans-epoxide [(4R,5R) or (4S,5S)] leads to the formation of a single product: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   This product molecule has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a meso compound. It is achiral.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The sole product is the meso-diol, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation with mCPBA.** The reaction of a cis-alkene, (Z)-oct-4-ene, with mCPBA is also a syn-addition. This produces a cis-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is symmetrical and achiral, the resulting cis-epoxide, (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane, is a meso compound.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.** The acid-catalyzed opening of this meso-epoxide ring occurs via anti-addition.\n    *   Attack of water on one of the epoxide carbons (e.g., C4) results in one enantiomer, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack on the other carbon (C5) results in the other enantiomer, (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Because the attacks on both carbons are equally likely, the reaction produces a racemic mixture (a 50:50 mixture) of the two enantiomers.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The products are a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers of octane-4,5-diol:\n\n1.  **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the meso-diol from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (an enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the other enantiomer from Reaction 2)\n\nThe meso-diol is a diastereomer to both of the enantiomers from Reaction 2.\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. Therefore, the meso-diol will be separated from the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated by an achiral column. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso-diol and one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase to differentiate between enantiomers.\n    *   The chiral column can separate all three stereoisomers. It separates the diastereomers (the meso compound from the chiral pair), and it also resolves the two enantiomers from each other.\n    *   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**: one for the meso-diol, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\nTherefore, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<D>>>"
