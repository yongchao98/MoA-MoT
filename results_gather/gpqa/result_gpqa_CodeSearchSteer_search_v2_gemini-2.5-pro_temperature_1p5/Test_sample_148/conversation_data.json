    "Based on the evidence provided, the most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers. Here's a breakdown of the analysis:\n\n*   **Â¹H NMR Data:** The presence of two peaks for a single alpha-proton, which together integrate to one proton, strongly suggests the presence of two distinct chemical species. The fact that spin-spin coupling is ruled out means the splitting is not due to neighboring protons. In achiral solvents, enantiomers give identical NMR spectra, so this observation is inconsistent with a mixture of enantiomers. Diastereomers, however, are distinct compounds and are expected to have different NMR spectra. The doubling of specific proton signals is a classic sign of either epimerization at a chiral center or, very commonly in peptides, the presence of *cis-trans* isomers (rotamers) around an amide bond. Both epimers and rotamers are types of diastereomers.\n\n*   **LC-MS Data:** The observation of two separate peaks in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace, both having the same mass spectrum, confirms that the sample contains two isomers of the target molecule. This definitively rules out contamination with a precursor (which would have a different mass) and a mixture of enantiomers (which would not separate on a standard, achiral LC column). Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated by standard chromatography, which is consistent with the two observed peaks.\n\n*   **Synthesizing the Evidence:**\n    *   **Possibility 1: Epimerization.** During chemical peptide synthesis, an amino acid's alpha-carbon can sometimes change its stereochemistry, a process called epimerization. This creates a diastereomer of the intended peptide. For instance, if an L-amino acid is unintentionally converted to a D-amino acid within the peptide sequence, the resulting molecule is a diastereomer of the desired product. This would lead to two species with the same mass, but different chromatographic and NMR properties.\n    *   **Possibility 2: Cis-Trans Isomerism.** The amide bonds that form the peptide backbone have significant double-bond character, which restricts rotation. This can lead to the existence of both *cis* and *trans* conformations around the bond. These two conformers are diastereomers (specifically, rotamers) and are often stable enough to be observed as separate species on the NMR and LC time scales. The doubling of peaks for protons adjacent to the amide bond (like alpha-protons) is a hallmark of this phenomenon, especially for bonds involving a proline residue.\n\nBoth epimerization and cis-trans isomerism result in a mixture of diastereomers. Therefore, this is the most encompassing and accurate explanation for all the observations.\n\n<<<A>>>"
