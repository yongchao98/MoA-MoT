    "### Unraveling the Chemical Puzzle\n\nBased on the series of clues provided, the unknown substances and reactions can be identified through a step-by-step deduction:\n\n1.  **Identifying Substance B and Gas W:** The melting point of substance B is stated to be very close to 277 K (3.85°C). This is the characteristic melting point of **heavy water (D₂O)**. The reaction also releases a gas W whose molecules contain an equal number of neutrons and protons. A strong candidate for this gas is **deuterium gas (D₂)**. Each deuterium atom has one proton and one neutron, so a D₂ molecule has two protons and two neutrons.\n\n2.  **Identifying Substance X:** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate G, which upon heating yields D₂O. This suggests a powerful reducing agent that contains deuterium. A well-known class of reagents in organic chemistry that fits this description is metal hydrides. The most common analog mentioned is **lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄)**. Therefore, Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope, is **lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. The clue about the reaction with a keto acid producing a compound with two oxygen atoms aligns with the known reactivity of LiAlH₄, which reduces the keto group but not the carboxylic acid group.\n\n3.  **Identifying the Reaction:** The violent reaction can be deduced as the reaction between LiAlD₄ (Substance X) and D₂O (Liquid Y).\n    *   **Reaction:** `LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂`\n    *   This reaction is known to be violent, analogous to the reaction of LiAlH₄ with water.\n    *   It produces deuterium gas (W).\n    *   It forms a precipitate G, which is aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃ (and lithium deuteroxide, LiOD). Aluminum hydroxide is a known precipitate.\n    *   Heating the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) causes it to decompose, releasing heavy water B (D₂O). The corresponding reaction for aluminum hydroxide is `2 Al(OH)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3 H₂O`.\n\n### Calculating the Cumulative Atomic Masses\n\nThe final step is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n\n*   **Elements in LiAlD₄:** The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H, in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest and Heaviest Elements:** By atomic number, the lightest element is **Hydrogen** (Z=1) and the heaviest element is **Aluminum** (Z=13). Lithium (Z=3) is in between.\n*   **Mass Contribution:** The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses, considering all instances of these elements in the molecule. For simplicity and as the options are integers, we will use the mass numbers of the specific isotopes.\n    *   **Heaviest Element (Aluminum):** There is one atom of Aluminum. The stable isotope is Al-27.\n        *   Mass contribution from Al = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Lightest Element (Hydrogen):** The isotope present is Deuterium (D), and there are four atoms. The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n        *   Mass contribution from D = 4 × 2 = 8.\n*   **Cumulative Mass:** The sum of these masses is:\n    *   27 (from Aluminum) + 8 (from Deuterium) = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
