    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the correct chemical formula:\n\n### **1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark of an O-H stretching vibration, and its broadness strongly indicates the presence of hydrogen bonding. This is characteristic of a carboxylic acid or an alcohol.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) group stretching vibration. The presence of this peak, combined with the broad O-H absorption, strongly suggests a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). Carboxylic acid C=O stretches typically appear between 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n\n**FTIR Conclusion:** The compound is likely a carboxylic acid that also contains a C=C double bond.\n\n### **2. Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** This observation confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a double bond, and their signals typically appear in the 4.5-6.5 ppm region of an NMR spectrum.\n\n### **3. Analysis of Mass Spectrum**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment. In the mass spectrum of a carboxylic acid, a common fragmentation pattern is the loss of the alkyl group to form a resonance-stabilized cation with the formula [COOH]⁺. The mass of this fragment is calculated as:\n    *   Carbon (C): 12 amu\n    *   Oxygen (O): 16 amu\n    *   Oxygen (O): 16 amu\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 1 amu\n    *   **Total: 45 amu**\n*   This m/z = 45 peak provides strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n### **4. Determining the Molecular Formula**\n\nLet's evaluate the proposed formulas based on the spectroscopic evidence:\n\n*   The presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) means the molecule must contain **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and B (C6H10O).\n*   We are left with C (C6H12O2) and D (C6H10O2). To distinguish between these, we can calculate the **Degree of Unsaturation** (or Double Bond Equivalent), which indicates the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula is: DBE = C - (H/2) + 1 (for molecules containing only C, H, and O).\n    *   **For C6H12O2 (Option C):** DBE = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**. This formula allows for only one degree of unsaturation (e.g., one double bond or one ring).\n    *   **For C6H10O2 (Option D):** DBE = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**. This formula allows for two degrees of unsaturation.\n\nOur analysis concluded that the unknown compound contains **both** a carbonyl group (C=O, one degree of unsaturation) and a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C, a second degree of unsaturation). Therefore, the molecule must have at least two degrees of unsaturation.\n\n**Conclusion:** The molecular formula C6H10O2 is the only option that is consistent with all the provided data: it has two oxygen atoms for the carboxylic acid and two degrees of unsaturation to account for both the C=O and C=C double bonds.\n\n<<<D>>>"
