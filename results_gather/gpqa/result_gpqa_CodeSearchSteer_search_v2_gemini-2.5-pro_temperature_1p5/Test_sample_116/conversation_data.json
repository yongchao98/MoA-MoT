    "To determine which of the given organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we must identify which molecules are chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property can arise from a chiral center or from axial chirality, as seen in certain substituted biphenyls (atropisomerism).\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:** This molecule belongs to a class of compounds known as biphenyls. Optical isomerism can occur in substituted biphenyls if there is restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restriction, called atropisomerism, happens when large, bulky groups are present at the ortho-positions (the positions adjacent to the bond linking the rings). In this specific molecule, the ortho-positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') are all substituted with large groups (nitro and dimethyl carboxylate groups). This steric hindrance prevents free rotation, leading to a molecule that is not superimposable on its mirror image. Therefore, it is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure of this molecule, also known as methyl lactate, is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. A carbon atom bonded to four different groups is a chiral center. The second carbon atom in this molecule is bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). Since these four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. Molecules containing a chiral center are optically active. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exists as two non-superimposable mirror images, the (R) and (S) enantiomers, and thus shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone:** The chemical formula for benzophenone is (C₆H₅)₂CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. For a carbon to be a chiral center, it must be bonded to four different groups. Since this is not the case, benzophenone does not have a chiral center. The molecule possesses elements of symmetry, making it achiral and therefore optically inactive. While it's possible for highly substituted benzophenones to be chiral, the parent molecule itself is not.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the ester groups are in a *trans* arrangement across the carbon-carbon double bond. Due to this trans geometry, the molecule has a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry, which means it is achiral. Its cis-isomer, dimethyl maleate, also has a plane of symmetry and is achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nBased on this analysis, only dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<B>>>"
