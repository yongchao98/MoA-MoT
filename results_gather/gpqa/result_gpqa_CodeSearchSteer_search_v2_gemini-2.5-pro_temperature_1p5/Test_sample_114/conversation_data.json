    "Here is the step-by-step derivation of the angle between the two photons:\n\n### 1. Conservation of Energy\n\nFirst, we establish the total energy of the system before the collision. The energy of a relativistic particle is given by E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light.\n\n*   **Electron's Energy (Eₑ):**\n    *   Given Lorentz factor γₑ = 4.\n    *   Eₑ = 4 * mₑc² (where mₑ is the rest mass of an electron).\n\n*   **Positron's Energy (Eₚ):**\n    *   Given Lorentz factor γₚ = 2.\n    *   A positron has the same rest mass as an electron.\n    *   Eₚ = 2 * mₑc²\n\n*   **Total Initial Energy (E_initial):**\n    *   E_initial = Eₑ + Eₚ = 4mₑc² + 2mₑc² = 6mₑc²\n\nAfter annihilation, this energy is converted into the energy of two photons. It is stated that the photons have equal energy.\n\n*   **Total Final Energy (E_final):**\n    *   E_final = E_γ1 + E_γ2 = 2E_γ\n    *   By conservation of energy, E_initial = E_final.\n    *   6mₑc² = 2E_γ\n    *   **E_γ = 3mₑc²** (This is the energy of each photon).\n\n### 2. Conservation of Momentum\n\nNext, we apply the conservation of momentum. Momentum is a vector, so we analyze its component along the horizontal axis (x-axis).\n\n*   **Initial Momentum (p_initial):**\n    *   The momentum of a relativistic particle is p = √(E² - (mc²)²)/c or p = γmvc. A more direct formula using the Lorentz factor is p = (mc) * √(γ² - 1).\n    *   **Electron's Momentum (pₑ):** It moves from the left, so its momentum is positive.\n        *   pₑ = mₑc * √(4² - 1) = mₑc * √15\n    *   **Positron's Momentum (pₚ):** It moves from the right, so its momentum is negative.\n        *   pₚ = -mₑc * √(2² - 1) = -mₑc * √3\n    *   **Total Initial Momentum (p_initial_x):**\n        *   p_initial_x = (√15 - √3) * mₑc\n\n*   **Final Momentum (p_final):**\n    *   The momentum of a photon is p_γ = E_γ / c.\n        *   p_γ = (3mₑc²) / c = 3mₑc\n    *   Since the initial momentum in the vertical direction (y-axis) is zero, the final vertical momenta of the two photons must cancel each other out. This means if one photon moves at an angle θ with the x-axis, the other must move at -θ.\n    *   **Total Final Momentum (p_final_x):**\n        *   p_final_x = p_γ * cos(θ) + p_γ * cos(-θ) = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ)\n        *   p_final_x = 2 * (3mₑc) * cos(θ) = 6mₑc * cos(θ)\n\n*   **Equating Momenta:**\n    *   p_initial_x = p_final_x\n    *   (√15 - √3) * mₑc = 6mₑc * cos(θ)\n    *   cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6\n\n### 3. Calculating the Angle\n\nNow we calculate the value of θ.\n\n*   Using a calculator:\n    *   √15 ≈ 3.8730\n    *   √3 ≈ 1.7321\n    *   cos(θ) ≈ (3.8730 - 1.7321) / 6 = 2.1409 / 6 ≈ 0.3568\n    *   θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.09°\n\nThe question asks for the angle *between* the directions of the two photons. Since one moves at angle θ and the other at -θ relative to the horizontal axis, the total angle between them is 2θ.\n\n*   **Angle between photons = 2θ = 2 * 69.09° = 138.18°**\n\nThis value is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
