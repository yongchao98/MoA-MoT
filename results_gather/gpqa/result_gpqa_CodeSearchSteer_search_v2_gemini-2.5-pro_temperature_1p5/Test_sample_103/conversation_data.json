    "The reasoning and derivation seem solid. The search results confirm the key concepts.\n\n1.  **Doppler Shift and Radial Velocity**: The radial velocity (v_r) is calculated from the Doppler shift (Δλ) using the formula v_r = (Δλ/λ) * c. Therefore, the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K), which is the maximum radial velocity, is directly proportional to the maximum observed wavelength shift (Δλ_max).\n\n2.  **Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude (K) and Orbital Period (P)**: The search results show the formula for the semi-amplitude K. For a circular orbit (eccentricity e=0) and assuming the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's (m_p << M_star), the formula is confirmed as K ≈ (2πG/P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3). This confirms that K is proportional to P^(-1/3).\n\nLet's summarize the problem's conditions and my derived relationship:\n*   M_star1 = M_star2 (Same stellar masses)\n*   m_p1 ≈ m_p2 (Similar planet masses)\n*   e1 = e2 = 0 (Circular orbits)\n*   We assume sin(i1) ≈ sin(i2) as it's the only way to solve it, and no other information is given.\n*   The wavelength shifts (Δλ) are directly proportional to the RV semi-amplitude (K).\n*   Δλ1 = 5 mÅ, so K1 ∝ 5.\n*   Δλ2 = 7 mÅ, so K2 ∝ 7.\n\nFrom the physics, we established:\nK ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\nThis leads to the ratio:\nK2 / K1 = (P1 / P2)^(1/3)\n\nSolving for the ratio of the periods (P2 / P1):\nP2 / P1 = (K1 / K2)³\n\nPlugging in the values proportional to K:\nP2 / P1 = (5 / 7)³\n\nCalculation:\nP2 / P1 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis result matches option A. The logic is sound and confirmed by the fundamental equations of the radial velocity method.\n\nFinal check of the question: \"How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\" This asks for the ratio P2 / P1.\n\nThe calculation yielded P2 / P1 ≈ 0.36.\n\nTherefore, the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1.\n\nFinal conclusion is firm.\n\n<<<A>>>"
