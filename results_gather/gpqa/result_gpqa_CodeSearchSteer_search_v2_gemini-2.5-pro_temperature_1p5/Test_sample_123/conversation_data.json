    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understanding Particle Decay and Time Dilation**\n    The fraction of particles that survive after a time `t` in the laboratory frame is given by the exponential decay law:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-t / τ_lab)`\n    where:\n    *   `N` is the number of particles remaining.\n    *   `N₀` is the initial number of particles.\n    *   `t` is the time elapsed in the laboratory frame.\n    *   `τ_lab` is the average lifetime of the particles in the laboratory frame.\n\n    Due to time dilation in special relativity, the lifetime of a moving particle (`τ_lab`) is longer than its proper lifetime (`τ₀`, the lifetime in its own rest frame). The relationship is:\n    `τ_lab = γ * τ₀`\n    where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n\n    Combining these two equations, we get:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-t / (γ * τ₀))`\n\n2.  **Applying the Formula to the First Scenario**\n    In the first case, we are given:\n    *   The fraction of particles reaching the detector: `N/N₀ = 1/3`\n    *   The Lorentz factor: `γ₁ = 20`\n    *   The radius of the detector: `R = 30 m`\n\n    The time `t` it takes for the ultra-relativistic particles to reach the detector wall is `t = R / c`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n    Plugging these values into the formula:\n    `1/3 = exp(-(R/c) / (γ₁ * τ₀))`\n    `1/3 = exp(-30 / (c * 20 * τ₀))`\n\n    To solve for the unknown proper lifetime `τ₀`, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * c * τ₀)`\n    `-ln(3) = -30 / (20 * c * τ₀)`\n    `ln(3) = 30 / (20 * c * τ₀)`\n\n    Let's rearrange this equation to isolate the constant term `30 / (c * τ₀)`:\n    `20 * ln(3) = 30 / (c * τ₀)`\n\n3.  **Applying the Formula to the Second Scenario**\n    In the second case, we want to find the new Lorentz factor (`γ₂`) required for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector:\n    *   Desired fraction of surviving particles: `N/N₀ = 2/3`\n    *   The time of flight `t = R/c` and proper lifetime `τ₀` remain the same.\n\n    Using the same formula:\n    `2/3 = exp(-(R/c) / (γ₂ * τ₀))`\n    `2/3 = exp(-30 / (c * γ₂ * τ₀))`\n\n    Again, take the natural logarithm:\n    `ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * c * τ₀)`\n    `ln(2) - ln(3) = -30 / (γ₂ * c * τ₀)`\n    `-(ln(3) - ln(2)) = -30 / (γ₂ * c * τ₀)`\n    `ln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * c * τ₀)`\n\n    Rearranging this gives:\n    `γ₂ * ln(3/2) = 30 / (c * τ₀)`\n\n4.  **Solving for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂)**\n    We now have two expressions equal to the same constant `30 / (c * τ₀)`:\n    1.  `20 * ln(3)`\n    2.  `γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\n    By setting them equal to each other, we can solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ * ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3)`\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n\n    Now, we can calculate the numerical value:\n    *   `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n    *   `ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055) ≈ 20 * 2.7092 ≈ 54.185`\n\nThis value is approximately 54.\n\n<<<A>>>"
