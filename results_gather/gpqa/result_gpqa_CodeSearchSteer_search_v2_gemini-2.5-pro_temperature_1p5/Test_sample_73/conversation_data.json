    "The phenomenon of radioactive decay is governed by exponential decay, which has a key characteristic known as the \"memoryless property\". This principle states that the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. Therefore, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not influence its future decay probability. The problem reduces to finding the probability of a new atom decaying within 150 minutes.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Determine the survival probability and decay constant.**\n    The initial information states that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%.\n    *   Probability of decay in 100 minutes: P(decay) = 0.32\n    *   This means the probability of *survival* in 100 minutes is: P(survival) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n\n    The survival probability P(t) over a time (t) is given by the formula P(t) = e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant.\n    *   For t = 100 minutes, P(100) = 0.68.\n    *   So, e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68.\n\n2.  **Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes.**\n    Due to the memoryless property, the 50 minutes that have passed are irrelevant. We need to calculate the probability of the atom decaying in a 150-minute interval.\n    *   The probability of survival over 150 minutes is P(150) = e^(-λ * 150).\n    *   We can rewrite e^(-λ * 150) as (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5.\n    *   Since we know e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68, we can substitute this value: P(survival in 150 min) = (0.68)^1.5.\n\n3.  **Compute the final value.**\n    *   P(survival in 150 min) ≈ 0.5607.\n    *   The probability of decay in 150 minutes is 1 minus the probability of survival.\n    *   P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393.\n\n4.  **Convert to a percentage.**\n    The probability of 0.4393 is equivalent to 43.93%, which is approximately 44%.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is about 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>"
