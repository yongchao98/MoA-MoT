    "To determine how many of the listed stars would be detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph, several factors need to be considered: the instrument's limiting magnitude for the required signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), the apparent magnitude of each star, and its visibility from the Paranal Observatory in Chile. A star is considered detectable if an S/N of at least 10 per binned pixel is achieved in a one-hour exposure using a single 8.2-meter VLT telescope.\n\n### ESPRESSO's Limiting Magnitude\n\nAccording to the ESPRESSO User Manual from the European Southern Observatory (ESO), for a one-hour (3600s) exposure in single high-resolution mode (singleHR), a star with a V magnitude of approximately 16 to 17 will yield a signal-to-noise ratio of about 10. For the purposes of this evaluation, we will adopt a conservative limiting V magnitude of 16.\n\n### Visibility from Paranal Observatory\n\nThe Paranal Observatory is located in the Southern Hemisphere, which restricts the portion of the sky it can observe. The observatory's southern latitude means that stars with very high positive declinations are not visible. Polaris, the North Star, has a declination of nearly +89°, making it impossible to observe from Paranal. Conversely, stars with southern or equatorial declinations are well-suited for observation.\n\n### Analysis of the Stars:\n\n**a) Canopus:**\n*   **Apparent V Magnitude:** Canopus is the second-brightest star in the night sky, with an apparent V magnitude of approximately -0.74.\n*   **Declination:** Its declination is about -52°, making it easily visible from Paranal.\n*   **Detectability:** With an apparent magnitude significantly brighter than the limiting magnitude of 16, Canopus is **detectable**.\n\n**b) Polaris:**\n*   **Apparent V Magnitude:** Polaris has a variable apparent magnitude, averaging around 1.98.\n*   **Declination:** Its declination is approximately +89° 15′.\n*   **Detectability:** Due to its extreme northern declination, Polaris is not visible from the Paranal Observatory and is therefore **not detectable**.\n\n**c) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 10 pc distance:**\n*   **Apparent V Magnitude Calculation:** The apparent magnitude (mV) can be calculated from the absolute magnitude (MV) and distance (d) in parsecs using the formula: `mV = MV + 5 * log10(d) - 5`.\n    *   mV = 15 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 = 15 + 5 * 1 - 5 = 15.\n*   **Declination:** At 0 degrees declination, the star is observable from Paranal.\n*   **Detectability:** An apparent magnitude of 15 is brighter than ESPRESSO's limiting magnitude of 16 for this observation, so it is **detectable**.\n\n**d) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 200 pc distance:**\n*   **Apparent V Magnitude Calculation:**\n    *   mV = 15 + 5 * log10(200) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * 2.301 - 5 = 15 + 11.505 - 5 = 21.505.\n*   **Declination:** At 0 degrees declination, the star is observable.\n*   **Detectability:** With an apparent magnitude of approximately 21.5, this star is much fainter than the limiting magnitude of 16 and is therefore **not detectable**.\n\n**e) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 5 pc distance:**\n*   **Apparent V Magnitude Calculation:**\n    *   mV = 15 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * 0.699 - 5 = 15 + 3.495 - 5 = 13.495.\n*   **Declination:** At 0 degrees declination, the star is observable.\n*   **Detectability:** An apparent magnitude of approximately 13.5 is brighter than the limiting magnitude of 16, making it **detectable**.\n\n**f) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 50 pc distance:**\n*   **Apparent V Magnitude Calculation:**\n    *   mV = 15 + 5 * log10(50) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * 1.699 - 5 = 15 + 8.495 - 5 = 18.495.\n*   **Declination:** At 0 degrees declination, the star is observable.\n*   **Detectability:** With an apparent magnitude of roughly 18.5, this star is fainter than the limiting magnitude of 16 and is **not detectable**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the analysis, the following stars are detectable by ESPRESSO under the specified conditions:\n*   Canopus\n*   Star (c)\n*   Star (e)\n\nThis gives a total of three detectable stars.\n\n<<<C>>>"
