    "Here is the step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the Initial Energy**\n\nThe annihilation process begins with a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible. We assume the proton is also at rest. Therefore, the total initial energy of the system is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n\n*   The rest mass energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938 MeV.\n*   An antiproton has the same mass as a proton, so its rest mass energy ($m_{\\bar{p}} c^2$) is also 938 MeV.\n\nTotal Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$) = $m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2$\n$E_{initial} = 938 \\text{ MeV} + 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**2. Determine the Final Energy**\n\nThe annihilation results in four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n\n*   The rest mass energy of each particle A ($m_A c^2$) is given as 300 MeV.\n*   The total final energy ($E_{final}$) is the sum of the total energies of these four particles. Since energy is conserved, all the initial energy is converted into the total energy of the four A particles.\n\n$E_{final} = E_{initial} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**3. Calculate the Energy per Particle A**\n\nThe total final energy is shared equally among the four resulting particles.\n\nEnergy per particle A ($E_A$) = $\\frac{E_{final}}{4}$\n$E_A = \\frac{1876 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**4. Calculate the Velocity of Particle A**\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic particle ($E_A$) is given by the equation $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is defined as $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\n*   We know $E_A = 469$ MeV and $m_A c^2 = 300$ MeV. We can now solve for $\\gamma$.\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469 \\text{ MeV}}{300 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 1.5633$\n\n*   Now, we solve for the velocity, $v$.\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n$1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\n*   Substitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.444}}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4092}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{0.5908}$\n$v/c \\approx 0.7686$\n\nThus, the velocity of particle A is approximately 0.77c.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 0.96c\nB) 0.77c\nC) 0.86c\nD) 0.91c\n\nThe calculated velocity matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
