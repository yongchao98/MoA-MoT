    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the expectation value of the operator `O = 10σz + 5σx` for the given quantum state `|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩`.\n\nThe expectation value `⟨O⟩` can be calculated using the linearity of expectation values:\n`⟨O⟩ = ⟨10σz + 5σx⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ + 5⟨σx⟩`\n\nFirst, let's find the expectation value of `σz`. The state is given by `|ψ⟩ = c↑|↑⟩ + c↓|↓⟩`, where the probability amplitudes are `c↑ = 0.5` and `c↓ = √3/2`. The expectation value of `σz` is given by:\n`⟨σz⟩ = |c↑|² * (+1) + |c↓|² * (-1)`\n`⟨σz⟩ = (0.5)² - (√3/2)² = 0.25 - 3/4 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5`\n\nNext, we calculate the expectation value of `σx`. We use the matrix representation for this calculation.\nThe state `|ψ⟩` can be written as a column vector:\n`|ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2]`\n\nThe bra `⟨ψ|` is the conjugate transpose:\n`⟨ψ| = [0.5, √3/2]`\n\nThe Pauli matrix `σx` is:\n`σx = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n\nThe expectation value `⟨σx⟩` is calculated as `⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩`:\n`⟨σx⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * [0.5, √3/2]`\n`⟨σx⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [√3/2, 0.5]`\n`⟨σx⟩ = (0.5 * √3/2) + (√3/2 * 0.5) = √3/4 + √3/4 = 2√3/4 = √3/2`\n\nNow, we can substitute the expectation values of `σz` and `σx` back into the expression for `⟨O⟩`:\n`⟨O⟩ = 10 * (-0.5) + 5 * (√3/2)`\n`⟨O⟩ = -5 + 2.5√3`\n\nUsing the approximation `√3 ≈ 1.732`:\n`⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 2.5 * 1.732`\n`⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 4.33`\n`⟨O⟩ ≈ -0.67`\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the value is -0.7.\n\n<<<D>>>"
