    "Here is the step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Hydrogenation of (R)-(+)-Limonene**\n\nStarting with (R)-(+)-Limonene, the reaction with one equivalent of hydrogen (H₂) in the presence of a Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst will selectively reduce the less sterically hindered double bond. Limonene has two double bonds: a trisubstituted one within the cyclohexene ring and a disubstituted one in the exocyclic isopropenyl group. The exocyclic double bond is more accessible and will be hydrogenated preferentially. This reaction does not affect the stereocenter at C4.\n\n*   **Product 1:** (R)-4-isopropyl-1-methylcyclohex-1-ene (also known as (R)-carvomenthene).\n\n**Step 2: Epoxidation of Product 1**\n\nProduct 1 is treated with 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA), an agent used for epoxidation. The epoxidation of an alkene is a syn-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond. In this case, the bulky isopropyl group at the allylic position (C4) directs the m-CPBA to attack from the opposite face of the ring (*trans* attack) to minimize steric hindrance. If we consider the isopropyl group to be on a wedged bond (pointing out), the epoxide will be formed on the dashed side (pointing in).\n\n*   **Product 2:** The resulting epoxide, which has the epoxide oxygen *trans* to the isopropyl group.\n\n**Step 3: Epoxide Opening with Sodium Methoxide**\n\nThe epoxide (Product 2) is treated with sodium methoxide (NaOMe), a strong nucleophile, in what is a base-catalyzed epoxide opening. The reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism. The methoxide ion (MeO⁻) attacks the less substituted carbon of the epoxide, which is C2. This attack occurs from the side opposite to the C-O epoxide bond, leading to an inversion of the stereochemistry at C2. Since the epoxide ring is on the dashed side, the methoxide attacks from the wedged side. The C1-O bond of the epoxide breaks and, after protonation, forms a hydroxyl group (-OH) on the dashed side.\n\n*   **Product 3:** (1S, 2S, 4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexan-1-ol. Let's verify the stereochemistry:\n    *   **C4:** Retains the R configuration from the starting material.\n    *   **C2:** The methoxide attacks from the wedged side, so the -OCH₃ group is on a wedge and the hydrogen is on a dash. The priorities are -OCH₃ > C1 > C3 > H. With H pointing away, the sequence is counter-clockwise, which corresponds to the **S** configuration.\n    *   **C1:** Has a methyl group on a wedge and the newly formed hydroxyl group on a dash. The priorities are -OH > C2 > C6 > -CH₃. To determine the configuration, if we place the lowest priority group (-CH₃) in the back, the sequence of the remaining groups (-OH -> C2 -> C6) is counter-clockwise, leading to the **S** configuration.\n\n**Step 4: Esterification**\n\nProduct 3 is treated with propanoic acid, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and a catalytic amount of 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). This is a Steglich esterification, where the hydroxyl group at C1 is converted to a propionate ester. This reaction proceeds with retention of stereochemistry at C1.\n\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is **(1S,2S,4R)-4-isopropyl-2-methoxy-1-methylcyclohexyl propionate**.\n\nThis structure matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
