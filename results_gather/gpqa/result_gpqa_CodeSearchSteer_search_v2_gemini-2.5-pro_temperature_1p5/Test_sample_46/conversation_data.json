    "Based on the detailed analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the unknown compound C9H11NO2 is identified as **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of how the data supports this conclusion:\n\n### **1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation**\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation:** A calculation reveals 5 degrees of unsaturation, which strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 degrees) and an additional double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n### **2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two distinct, medium-to-strong bands are characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) group. Specifically, it matches the frequency for an ester that is conjugated with an aromatic ring, which lowers the frequency from that of a simple aliphatic ester.\n\n### **3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **1.20 ppm (triplet, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (quartet, 2H):** This combination is a classic signature for an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The quartet's downfield chemical shift (~4.5 ppm) indicates the methylene (-CH2) group is attached to an electronegative atom, which is consistent with the oxygen of an ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n*   **4.0 ppm (broad singlet, 2H):** This broad signal corresponds to the two protons of the primary amine (-NH2) group. The broadness is typical for amine protons due to factors like chemical exchange and quadrupolar coupling.\n*   **7.0 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H):** This pattern is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two aromatic protons ortho to the electron-donating amine group (-NH2) are shielded and appear at the lower chemical shift (7.0 ppm). The two protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing ethyl ester group (-COOEt) are deshielded and appear at the higher chemical shift (8.0 ppm).\n\n### **4. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR, not two.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted compound, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two clean doublets.\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This structure is an ester, but the ethyl group is part of the propionate, not an ethoxy group attached to the carbonyl. Its NMR would show a quartet around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **D) Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the available data:\n    *   It has a primary amine (-NH2).\n    *   It has an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   It is a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   Spectroscopic data found in literature for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate confirms the observed chemical shifts and IR bands.\n\n**Conclusion:** The compound is unambiguously identified as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>"
