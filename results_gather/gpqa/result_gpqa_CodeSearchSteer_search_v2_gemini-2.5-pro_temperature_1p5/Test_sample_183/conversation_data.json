    "To determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, a careful analysis of the directing effects of the substituents at each step is required. The target molecule has a 1,2,3-substitution pattern, which is often challenging to achieve due to the ortho, para, and meta directing effects of various functional groups.\n\nLet's break down the structure of the final product:\n*   **A benzene ring** is the starting scaffold.\n*   **An ethoxy group (-OEt)** at position C1 (a strongly activating, ortho/para director).\n*   **A tert-butyl group (-tBu)** at position C2 (an activating, ortho/para director).\n*   **A nitro group (-NO2)** at position C3 (a strongly deactivating, meta director).\n\nA thorough evaluation of the provided options reveals that options A, B, and D contain chemically unfeasible steps, such as attempting to perform diazotization on a compound without an amino group or trying to nitrate a diazonium salt. This makes them incorrect pathways.\n\nOption C presents the most plausible sequence of reaction *types*, although the regiochemical outcome requires careful consideration. Let's analyze this pathway step-by-step:\n\n1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation which attaches a tert-butyl group to the benzene ring, forming tert-butylbenzene. The tert-butyl group is an ortho, para-director, but due to its significant steric bulk, the major product of subsequent reactions is often the para-substituted isomer.\n\n2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** This is a nitration reaction. The nitration of tert-butylbenzene yields primarily p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene.\n\n3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** This reaction reduces the nitro group to an amino group (-NH2), converting p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene into p-tert-butylaniline (also known as 4-tert-butylaniline).\n\n4.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** This is the second nitration step, now on p-tert-butylaniline. The directing effects must be carefully considered. The amino group is a very strong ortho, para-director, while the tert-butyl group is a weaker ortho, para-director. Typically, an amino group would be protected (e.g., by acetylation) before nitration. However, if the nitration proceeds on the unprotected aniline, the directing effects must be analyzed. One possible, though not always dominant, pathway for nitrating anilines in strong acid involves the protonation of the amino group to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+). This ion is a deactivating, meta-director. In the case of the p-tert-butylanilinium ion, the -NH3+ group at C1 would direct nitration to the C3 position, while the activating -tBu group at C4 directs to the C3 position. This synergistic effect would lead to the formation of 3-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline.\n\n5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** This is a diazotization reaction, which converts the primary amino group of 3-nitro-4-tert-butylaniline into a diazonium salt.\n\n6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, replacing the -N2+ group with an -OH group, yielding 3-nitro-4-tert-butylphenol.\n\n7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** This final step is a Williamson ether synthesis. The phenolic -OH group is deprotonated by NaOH and then reacts with ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form an ether, yielding the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Note: the IUPAC priority rules change, causing the ethoxy-bearing carbon to be numbered C1).\n\nWhile the regiochemical outcome of step (iv) can be complex, the sequence of transformations presented in option C is the only one that is chemically logical and avoids impossible reaction steps, leading to a structure consistent with the target molecule's substitution pattern. The final two steps listed in option C, (viii) sulfonation and (ix) desulfonation, appear to be superfluous or incorrectly placed, but the core synthesis pathway (i-vii) remains the only viable option among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>"
