    "The correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane is outlined in option B. This multi-step synthesis involves the formation of a key intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which then undergoes a self-condensation reaction.\n\nThe synthesis proceeds through the following steps:\n1.  **Alkylation of Ethynylcyclohexane**: Ethynylcyclohexane is first treated with sodium amide (NaNH2), a strong base, to deprotonate the terminal alkyne and form a sodium acetylide. This is followed by a reaction with methyl chloride, which adds a methyl group to the alkyne, yielding 1-cyclohexyl-1-propyne.\n2.  **Partial Hydrogenation**: The resulting alkyne, 1-cyclohexyl-1-propyne, is then hydrogenated using H2 over a poisoned palladium catalyst, specifically Pd on calcium carbonate (Lindlar's catalyst). This reduces the alkyne to a *cis* or (Z)-alkene, forming (Z)-1-cyclohexyl-1-propene.\n3.  **Ozonolysis**: The alkene is subjected to ozonolysis (O3), followed by a reductive workup with dimethyl sulfide ((CH3)2S). This reaction cleaves the double bond, yielding two different aldehyde products: cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and acetaldehyde.\n4.  **Aldol Condensation**: The mixture is treated with barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2), a base that catalyzes an aldol reaction. In this step, two molecules of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde react with each other (one acting as a nucleophilic enolate and the other as an electrophile) in a self-condensation reaction. This forms the desired final product, the Î±-hydroxy aldehyde 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Although self-condensation of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde can be sterically hindered, it is a known reaction.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because they either use inappropriate reagents for the intended transformations or would lead to different, undesired products. For example, option A would fully hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane, while option D involves an oxidative workup after ozonolysis, which would produce carboxylic acids instead of aldehydes.\n\n<<<B>>>"
