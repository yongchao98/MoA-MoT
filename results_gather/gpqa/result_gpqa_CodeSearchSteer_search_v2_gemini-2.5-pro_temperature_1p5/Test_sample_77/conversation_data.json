    "The correct expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($ \\vec{A} $) for a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials account for the fact that electromagnetic signals propagate at the finite speed of light, c. This means the potential measured at a point $\\vec{r}$ and time *t* is determined by the state of the charge at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time *tr*.\n\nThe derivation of these potentials starts from the general formulas for retarded potentials and incorporates the charge and current density of a moving point source. A crucial part of the derivation involves integrating over the volume of the charge and accounting for the change in retarded time as the observation point moves, which leads to a correction factor in the denominator.\n\nThe scalar potential V is given by:\n$ V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{t_r} $\n\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by *c* yields the form:\n$ V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} $\n\nHere, all quantities on the right side are evaluated at the retarded time *tr*. The term $ (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}) $ in the denominator accounts for the relativistic effects of the moving source.\n\nThe vector potential $ \\vec{A} $ is similarly found to be:\n$ \\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]_{t_r} $\n\nAgain, multiplying the numerator and denominator by c gives:\n$ \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} $\n\nThese two potentials are related by $ \\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2) V $. Comparing these expressions to the given options, we find that option D matches the correct Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<D>>>"
