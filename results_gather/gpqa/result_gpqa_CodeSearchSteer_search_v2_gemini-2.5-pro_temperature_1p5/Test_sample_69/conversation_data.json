    "Based on the clues provided, we can deduce the identities of several of the substances, which in turn allows us to determine the molecular symmetry of the final product E.\n\n1.  **Identifying Gases B, D, and Solvent H:** The reaction where gas D and gas B react in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent (H) is a strong clue. A common industrial reaction that fits this description is the reaction between sulfur dioxide (SO₂) and chlorine gas (Cl₂) to form sulfuryl chloride (SO₂Cl₂), which is used as a solvent.\n    *   Gas B = Cl₂ (Chlorine)\n    *   Gas D = SO₂ (Sulfur Dioxide)\n    *   Solvent H = SO₂Cl₂ (Sulfuryl chloride)\n\n2.  **Identifying the Acids F and G:** The hydrolysis of product C produces a strong acid (F) and a weak acid (G). Since we've identified B as chlorine, the hydrolysis would likely involve chlorine compounds. The resulting acids would be hydrochloric acid (HCl), which is a strong acid, and a weak chlorine oxoacid, such as hypochlorous acid (HClO) or chlorous acid (HClO₂).\n    *   Strong Acid F = HCl (Hydrochloric acid)\n    *   Weak Acid G = A chlorine oxoacid (e.g., HClO or HClO₂)\n\n3.  **Identifying Hazardous Product E:** Product E is formed when the bright red product C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D (SO₂). Given that C is a chlorine compound and SO₂ is a reducing agent, the reaction produces an \"extremely hazardous\" product. Several chlorine-containing compounds are known to be very hazardous, including chlorine trifluoride (ClF₃), phosgene (COCl₂), and chlorine dioxide (ClO₂).\n    *   Considering the reactants (a chlorine compound and SO₂), the most plausible hazardous product is **Chlorine Dioxide (ClO₂) **, a well-known hazardous gas. The reaction would involve the reduction of a higher-oxidation-state chlorine compound (C) by sulfur dioxide.\n\n4.  **Determining the Molecular Symmetry of E (ClO₂):** The final step is to determine the molecular symmetry group for chlorine dioxide (ClO₂).\n    *   According to the VSEPR theory, the ClO₂ molecule has a bent geometry, similar to water (H₂O). The central chlorine atom is bonded to two oxygen atoms and has lone electrons.\n    *   A bent molecule possesses a C₂ rotational axis and two vertical mirror planes (σᵥ).\n    *   A molecule with this set of symmetry elements (E, C₂, σᵥ(xz), σᵥ(yz)) belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\nWhile the precise identities of the solid A and the bright red product C are part of a more complex chemical puzzle, identifying E as ClO₂ is consistent with the other clues and allows for the determination of its molecular symmetry group.\n\n<<<B>>>"
