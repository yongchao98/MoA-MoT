    "The mean decay distance of a particle is the average distance it travels before decaying. This distance depends on its velocity and its lifetime as observed in the laboratory frame.\n\nFirst, we determine the particle's proper lifetime (τ), which is its lifetime in its own rest frame. This is inversely related to the decay width (Γ) by the formula τ = ħ/Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 x 10⁻²⁵ GeV·s).\n\nGiven:\n*   Decay width, Γ_X = 320 MeV = 0.320 GeV\n\nCalculation of proper lifetime:\nτ = (6.582 x 10⁻²⁵ GeV·s) / 0.320 GeV ≈ 2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s\n\nNext, we need to account for relativistic effects, as the particle is moving at a high velocity. We calculate the Lorentz factor (γ), which describes the time dilation effect.\n\nGiven:\n*   Total energy, E_X = 8 GeV\n*   Rest mass, m_X = 1.2 GeV\n\nCalculation of the Lorentz factor:\nγ = E_X / m_X = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV ≈ 6.667\n\nThe lifetime in the lab frame (τ_lab) is the proper lifetime multiplied by the Lorentz factor (τ_lab = γ * τ). The particle's velocity (v) can be expressed as a fraction of the speed of light, β = v/c, where c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10⁸ m/s). The value of β is related to γ by β = √(1 - 1/γ²).\n\nCalculation of β:\nβ = √(1 - 1 / 6.667²) ≈ √(1 - 0.0225) ≈ 0.9887\n\nFinally, the mean decay distance (L) is the particle's velocity multiplied by its lifetime in the lab frame.\nL = v * τ_lab = (βc) * (γτ) = βγcτ\n\nCalculation of mean decay distance:\nL ≈ 0.9887 * 6.667 * (3 x 10⁸ m/s) * (2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s)\nL ≈ 4.065 x 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\nA more direct way to calculate the decay length is using the formula L = (γβ / Γ) * ħc, where ħc is approximately 0.1973 GeV·fm (1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m).\n\nCalculation using ħc:\nγβ = 6.667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.591\nL = (6.591 / 0.320 GeV) * (0.1973 GeV·fm) ≈ 20.597 * 0.1973 fm ≈ 4.064 fm\nL ≈ 4.064 x 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\nBoth calculation methods yield a result of approximately 4.065 x 10⁻¹⁵ m. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
