    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n### 1. Define Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   An atomic nucleus is at rest.\n    *   Its rest-mass is M.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is `M*c² = 300 GeV`.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses `m₁` and `m₂`.\n    *   We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other: `m₁ = 2*m₂`.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M`.\n    *   The fragments have kinetic energies `T₁` and `T₂`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest-Masses of the Fragments\n\nWe can solve for the individual masses:\nSubstitute `m₁ = 2*m₂` into the sum equation:\n`2*m₂ + m₂ = 0.99 * M`\n`3*m₂ = 0.99 * M`\n`m₂ = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow, find `m₁`:\n`m₁ = 2 * m₂ = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, we convert these masses to their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m₁`):\n    `m₁*c² = 0.66 * (M*c²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (`m₂`):\n    `m₂*c² = 0.33 * (M*c²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Apply Conservation of Energy\n\nThe total energy before fission must equal the total energy after fission.\n*   Energy before = `M*c² = 300 GeV` (since the nucleus is at rest).\n*   Energy after = `(m₁*c² + T₁) + (m₂*c² + T₂)`.\n\nSo, `M*c² = m₁*c² + m₂*c² + T₁ + T₂`.\nThe total kinetic energy `T_total = T₁ + T₂` released in the fission (also known as the Q-value) is:\n`T_total = M*c² - (m₁*c² + m₂*c²) = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\nTherefore, `T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 4. Apply Conservation of Momentum\n\nSince the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum is zero. Therefore, the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\nLet `p₁` and `p₂` be the magnitudes of the momenta of the fragments.\n`p₁ = p₂`\n\n### 5. Calculate T₁ using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T` and momentum `p` are related by `T = p² / (2m)`.\nFrom the conservation of momentum (`p₁ = p₂`), we have `p₁² = p₂²`.\n`2*m₁*T₁_cla = 2*m₂*T₂_cla`\n`m₁*T₁_cla = m₂*T₂_cla`\n\nWe can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n`T₁_cla / T₂_cla = m₂ / m₁ = (0.33*M) / (0.66*M) = 1/2`.\nThis means `T₂_cla = 2 * T₁_cla`.\n\nNow, we use the total kinetic energy equation:\n`T₁_cla + T₂_cla = 3 GeV`\n`T₁_cla + 2*T₁_cla = 3 GeV`\n`3*T₁_cla = 3 GeV`\n`T₁_cla = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\n\n### 6. Calculate T₁ using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)\n\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (`E`), momentum (`p`), and rest-mass (`m`) is `E² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)²`.\nThe total energy is also `E = T + m*c²`, where T is the kinetic energy.\nSubstituting this gives: `(T + m*c²)² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)²`.\nExpanding and rearranging for `(p*c)²`:\n`T² + 2*T*m*c² + (m*c²)² = (p*c)² + (m*c²)²`\n`(p*c)² = T² + 2*T*m*c² = T * (T + 2*m*c²)`.\n\nFrom momentum conservation, `p₁ = p₂`, so `(p₁*c)² = (p₂*c)²`.\n`T₁_rel * (T₁_rel + 2*m₁*c²) = T₂_rel * (T₂_rel + 2*m₂*c²)`.\n\nWe have `T₂_rel = 3 - T₁_rel` (in GeV). Substitute this and the rest-mass energies:\n`T₁_rel * (T₁_rel + 2*198) = (3 - T₁_rel) * ((3 - T₁_rel) + 2*99)`\n`T₁_rel * (T₁_rel + 396) = (3 - T₁_rel) * (3 - T₁_rel + 198)`\n`T₁_rel² + 396*T₁_rel = (3 - T₁_rel) * (201 - T₁_rel)`\n`T₁_rel² + 396*T₁_rel = 603 - 3*T₁_rel - 201*T₁_rel + T₁_rel²`\n`T₁_rel² + 396*T₁_rel = 603 - 204*T₁_rel + T₁_rel²`\n\nCancel `T₁_rel²` from both sides:\n`396*T₁_rel = 603 - 204*T₁_rel`\n`600*T₁_rel = 603`\n`T₁_rel = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`.\n\n### 7. Find the Difference\n\nFinally, calculate the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\nDifference = `T₁_rel - T₁_cla`\nDifference = `1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
