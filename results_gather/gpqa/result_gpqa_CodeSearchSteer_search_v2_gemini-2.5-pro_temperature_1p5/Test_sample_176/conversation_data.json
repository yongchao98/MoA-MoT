    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the luminosity ratio of the two stars.\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star is determined by its radius (R) and surface temperature (T) according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio:** To find the luminosity of Star_1 relative to Star_2, we can create a ratio of their luminosities:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    The constants (4, π, σ) cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Radius Ratio:** The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂). Therefore, the ratio of their radii squared is:\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\n4.  **Temperature Ratio (The Effect of Radial Velocity):**\n    *   According to Wien's Displacement Law, a star's surface temperature is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength (λ_max) of its *intrinsic* or *rest-frame* spectrum.\n    *   The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars *appeared brightest* were the same. This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength (λ_obs), which is affected by the star's motion due to the Doppler effect.\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity is 0, so its observed peak wavelength is the same as its rest-frame peak wavelength (λ_obs,₁ = λ_rest,₁).\n    *   For Star_2, which is moving away from us at 700 km/s, its light is redshifted. The observed wavelength is longer than its rest-frame wavelength. The relationship for non-relativistic speeds is:\n        λ_obs,₂ = λ_rest,₂ * (1 + v/c)\n        where v is the radial velocity (700 km/s) and c is the speed of light (~300,000 km/s).\n    *   Since the astronomers found that λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂, we can state that:\n        λ_rest,₁ = λ_rest,₂ * (1 + v/c)\n    *   Because temperature is inversely proportional to the rest-frame wavelength (T ∝ 1/λ_rest), the ratio of their temperatures is:\n        T₁/T₂ = λ_rest,₂ / λ_rest,₁ = λ_rest,₂ / (λ_rest,₂ * (1 + v/c)) = 1 / (1 + v/c)\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Now, substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * (1 / (1 + v/c))⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 700 / 300,000)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333...)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333...)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / 1.00937\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is closest to ~2.23. The information about the masses of the stars is not needed for this calculation.\n\nTherefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<C>>>"
