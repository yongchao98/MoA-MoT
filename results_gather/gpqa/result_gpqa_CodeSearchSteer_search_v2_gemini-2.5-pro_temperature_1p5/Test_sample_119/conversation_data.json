    "Assuming stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, we can determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with the parallax itself.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Uniform Star Distribution:** The fundamental assumption is that stars are distributed uniformly throughout space. This means there is a constant average number of stars per unit volume. Let's call this constant star density ρ.\n\n2.  **Number of Stars and Volume:** The number of stars within a certain distance, *d*, from an observer is proportional to the volume of a sphere with radius *d*. The volume of a sphere is given by the formula V = (4/3)πd³. Therefore, the total number of stars, N, up to a distance *d* is:\n    N(d) = ρ * (4/3)πd³\n\n3.  **Number of Stars in a Shell:** To find the number of stars in a small range of distances, from *d* to *d* + d*d*, we consider a thin spherical shell of this thickness. The volume of this shell (dV) is the derivative of the total volume with respect to distance, multiplied by the thickness d*d*:\n    dV = 4πd²d*d*\n    The number of stars (dN) in this shell is then:\n    dN = ρ * 4πd²d*d*\n\n4.  **Parallax and Distance Relationship:** Stellar parallax (*plx*) is inversely proportional to the distance (*d*). The relationship is given by:\n    d = 1/plx\n    where *d* is in parsecs and *plx* is in arcseconds.\n\n5.  **Expressing the Number of Stars in Terms of Parallax:** We now need to express dN in terms of *plx* and d*plx* (the change in parallax). To do this, we first find the relationship between d*d* and d*plx* by differentiating the distance equation:\n    d(d)/d(plx) = -1/plx²\n    So, d*d* = |-1/plx²| d*plx* = (1/plx²) d*plx*. We take the absolute value as we are interested in the magnitude of the change.\n\n6.  **Substitution:** Now, we substitute d = 1/plx and d*d* = (1/plx²) d*plx* into the equation for dN:\n    dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) d*plx*\n    dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) d*plx*\n\n7.  **Number of Stars per Unit Range of Parallax:** The question asks for how the number of stars *per unit range of parallax* (dN/d*plx*) changes with *plx*. From the equation above, we can see that:\n    dN/d*plx* = 4πρ / plx⁴\n\n    Since ρ (star density), 4, and π are constants, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to 1/plx⁴. This relationship is also noted in discussions of the Lutz-Kelker bias.\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx as ~ 1/plx⁴.\n\n<<<A>>>"
