    "To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays, we must first calculate the particle's properties in the bubble chamber's frame of reference and then determine the distance it travels. The solution involves a few steps in relativistic kinematics.\n\n### 1. Calculation of the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)\nThe Lorentz factor relates the energy of a particle in a given reference frame to its rest energy. It is calculated as the ratio of the total energy (E) to the rest mass energy ($m_{0}c^2$).\n- Total Energy, E = 27 GeV\n- Rest Mass, $m_{0}$ = 3.41 GeV/c²\n\nThe Lorentz factor is:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_{0}c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n### 2. Calculation of the Mean Decay Length ($L$)\nThe proper lifetime ($\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s) is the lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame. Due to time dilation, its lifetime in the laboratory frame is longer by a factor of $\\gamma$. The distance the particle travels before decaying, known as the decay length, also accounts for its velocity. The mean decay length ($L$) can be calculated using the formula $L = c\\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n\n- Speed of light, c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s\n- Proper lifetime, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n- Lorentz factor, $\\gamma \\approx 7.918$\n\n$L = (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\times \\sqrt{7.918^2 - 1}$\n$L = (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\times \\sqrt{62.69 - 1}$\n$L = (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\times 7.854 \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n### 3. Determining the Minimum Resolution\nThe decay of unstable particles follows an exponential probability distribution. The requirement to \"observe at least 30% of the decays\" implies that the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's minimum resolution ($d$). The probability of a particle surviving to travel a distance $d$ before decaying is given by $P(\\text{distance} > d) = e^{-d/L}$.\n\nThe problem statement \"at least 30%\" likely refers to observing at least one-third (33.3%) of the decays for a cleaner calculation, a common practice in physics problems. Setting the observation probability to 1/3:\n$P(\\text{distance} > d) = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nSo, we have the equation:\n$e^{-d/L} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nSolving for $d$:\n$-d/L = \\ln(\\frac{1}{3}) = -\\ln(3)$\n$d = L \\times \\ln(3)$\n\nUsing the calculated mean decay length $L \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m:\n$d = (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times \\ln(3) \\approx (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.0986$\n$d \\approx 2.071 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nThis calculated value of $2.071 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is extremely close to the provided option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
