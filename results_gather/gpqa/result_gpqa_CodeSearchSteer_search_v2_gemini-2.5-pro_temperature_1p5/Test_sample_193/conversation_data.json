    "To find the partition function Z, we must sum the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), over all possible states of the system. Since we have three spins (S1, S2, S3) that can each take values of +1 or -1, there are a total of 2^3 = 8 possible configurations.\n\nThe energy of the system is given by the equation:\nE = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]\n\nThe partition function Z is defined as:\nZ = Σ_states * e^(-βE)\n\nLet's calculate the energy for each of the 8 possible states:\n\n1.  **All spins up:** (S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1)\n    E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\n2.  **All spins down:** (S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1)\n    E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\n    *   These two states have an energy of -3J.\n\n3.  **One spin down, two spins up:**\n    *   (S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1): E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = J\n    *   (S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1): E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = J\n    *   (S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1): E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = J\n\n4.  **One spin up, two spins down:**\n    *   (S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1): E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = J\n    *   (S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1): E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = J\n    *   (S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1): E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = J\n\n    *   The six states with one spin flipped relative to the others all have an energy of J.\n\nNow we can group the states by their energy level to find the degeneracy of each level:\n*   There are **2** states with energy **E = -3J**.\n*   There are **6** states with energy **E = J**.\n\nFinally, we calculate the partition function by summing the contributions from each energy level:\nZ = (degeneracy of state 1) * e^(-β * E1) + (degeneracy of state 2) * e^(-β * E2)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options, we find that it matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
