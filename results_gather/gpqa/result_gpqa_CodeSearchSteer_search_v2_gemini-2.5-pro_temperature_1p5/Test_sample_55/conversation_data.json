    "To solve this problem, we need to consider the principles of quantum mechanics that govern the decay of an electron in a hydrogen atom, specifically the selection rules for electric dipole transitions.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Transition and Selection Rules\nThe electron is transitioning from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via a two-step process. The states are described in the standard $|n,l,m\\rangle$ notation, where:\n*   $n$ is the principal quantum number (energy level).\n*   $l$ is the azimuthal or orbital angular momentum quantum number.\n*   $m$ is the magnetic quantum number.\n\nElectric dipole transitions are governed by the following selection rules:\n1.  The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, $\\Delta l$, must be $\\pm 1$.\n2.  The change in the magnetic quantum number, $\\Delta m$, must be $0, \\pm 1$.\n3.  The change in the principal quantum number, $\\Delta n$, can be any integer. For decay, $\\Delta n$ must be negative.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Allowed Intermediate State(s)\nThe transition occurs in two steps, so there must be an intermediate state, let's call it $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n\n**First transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n*   **Initial state:** $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   Applying the selection rules:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1 \\implies l' = 1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1 \\implies m' = 0, 1, \\text{or} -1$.\n    *   Since this is a decay cascade, the intermediate state must have a lower principal quantum number than the initial state, so $n' < 3$. The options provided suggest an intermediate state with $n'=2$.\n\nThis leads to three possible intermediate states: $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n**Second transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   **Final state:** $n=1, l=0, m=0$.\n*   We check if a transition from our possible intermediate states to the final state is allowed:\n    *   For any of the intermediate states ($|2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle, |2,1,-1\\rangle$), we have $l'=1$. The final state has $l=0$.\n    *   $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is an allowed change.\n    *   The change in $m$ must also satisfy the rules. For each intermediate state:\n        *   $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$: $\\Delta m = 0 - 0 = 0$. (Allowed)\n        *   $|2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$: $\\Delta m = 0 - 1 = -1$. (Allowed)\n        *   $|2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$: $\\Delta m = 0 - (-1) = +1$. (Allowed)\n\nThus, all three paths are valid according to the selection rules.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Probability of Each Path\nThe initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (a 3s orbital) is spherically symmetric. In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the probability of the atom decaying into any of the three degenerate intermediate p-states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle, |2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle$) is equal.\n\nThe total probability of transitioning from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to any of the allowed $l=1$ states must be 1 (if we only consider these decay channels). Since there are three equally probable intermediate states, the probability of the atom taking any specific path is:\n\n$P(\\text{path}) = \\frac{1}{\\text{Number of equally probable paths}} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nSo, the probabilities for the first step are:\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = 1/3$\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n\nOnce the atom is in an intermediate state, it will proceed to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The question asks for the transition route and its corresponding probability. This refers to the probability of the specified sequence of events occurring. The branching ratio for each of the three possible decay routes is $1/3$.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**: This route is allowed and the probability is correct.\n*   **B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The probability is incorrect.\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The probability is incorrect.\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**: The probability is incorrect.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
