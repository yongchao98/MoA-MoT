    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n**1. Identification of Compound X from Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The very broad peak in the range of **3400–2500 cm-1** is a classic sign of the O-H stretching of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   The sharp absorption at **1720 cm-1** is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid, which may be conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   The peaks at **1610 cm-1** and **1450 cm-1** indicate C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n    *   From the IR data, we can infer that Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This highly deshielded, broad singlet confirms the presence of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets, each representing two protons, are characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxyl group, while the 7.2 ppm signal corresponds to the protons next to an alkyl group.\n    *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:**\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons suggests a methyl group (-CH3) next to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH3) next to a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons is consistent with a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to both a methine and a methyl group.\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton, shifted downfield, is the benzylic proton (the -CH- group directly attached to the aromatic ring). It is coupled to the protons of the two different methyl groups and the methylene group.\n    *   Assembling these pieces, the alkyl substituent is a **sec-butyl group**: -CH(CH3)CH2CH3.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Compound X:** Based on the combined spectral data, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option (D).\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) is reacted with red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This set of reagents is a powerful reducing system. It is known to completely reduce carboxylic acids (-COOH) to their corresponding alkanes (specifically, to a methyl group, -CH3). The reaction R-COOH + 6HI → R-CH3 + 2H2O + 3I2 illustrates this transformation. The red phosphorus helps to regenerate the HI in the reaction mixture.\n\n**3. Determination of the Final Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group at position 1 of the benzene ring is reduced to a methyl group. The sec-butyl group at position 4 is unaffected by these reagents.\n*   **Final Product:** The resulting molecule is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**4. Matching with Options**\n\n*   A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect. The alkyl group is sec-butyl, not isobutyl.\n*   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect.\n*   C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - **Correct.**\n*   D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - Incorrect. This is the starting material.\n\n<<<C>>>"
