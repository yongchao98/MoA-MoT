    "This problem requires an understanding of the selective reactivity of two different reducing agents, Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) and Borane (BH₃), and how they affect the stereochemistry of the starting material.\n\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\n1.  **Starting Material Structure:** The options provide stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule is a derivative of pentanedioic acid (glutaric acid) where one carboxylic acid group is free, and the other has been converted to an isobutyl ester. The chiral center is at carbon 3, which has an ethyl group attached. The reactions start with either the (R) or (S) enantiomer of this compound.\n\n2.  **Reaction A:**\n    *   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n    *   **Mechanism:** In starting material A, LiBH₄ will reduce the isobutyl ester group (`-CO-O-iBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), while leaving the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) untouched.\n    *   **Lactonization:** The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) causes the molecule to undergo intramolecular esterification. The newly formed alcohol group attacks the carboxylic acid group, forming a stable six-membered cyclic ester, which is called a lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and lactonization reactions do not affect the chiral center at carbon 3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the product will be the same as the stereochemistry of the starting material. Since the product is **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, starting material A must be **(R)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n3.  **Reaction B:**\n    *   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent known to selectively reduce carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n    *   **Mechanism:** In starting material B, BH₃ will reduce the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), while leaving the isobutyl ester group (`-CO-O-iBu`) untouched.\n    *   **Lactonization:** The acidic workup (H⁺) then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed alcohol attacks the ester, displacing isobutanol and forming the same six-membered lactone.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the chemical transformations do not alter the existing stereocenter. The configuration of the product will match the configuration of the starting material. Since the product is **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, starting material B must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   To produce (R)-lactone with LiBH₄, the starting material **A** must be **(R)**.\n*   To produce (S)-lactone with BH₃, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
