    "This multi-step synthesis problem requires a careful deduction of the intermediates, products 1, 2, and 3.\n\n*   **Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n    1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with a strong base (KOH) at high temperature. This harsh condition promotes a skeletal rearrangement. The starting material has a molecular formula of C10H14Br2. The spectroscopic data for product 1 (IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ for a ketone, and a ¹H NMR indicating 14 protons) suggests a formula of C10H14O. This reaction is a known rearrangement-hydrolysis that produces **protoadamantan-4-one** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]decan-4-one). While the given ¹H NMR signal at 4.79 ppm is anomalous for this structure based on typical chemical shifts, it's a necessary intermediate for the subsequent steps to be plausible.\n\n*   **Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n    Product 1 (protoadamantan-4-one) is treated with aluminum isopropoxide. This reagent is standard for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which converts ketones to alcohols. The subsequent reaction is ozonolysis, which cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds. Since the alcohol product of the MPV reduction would be saturated and thus unreactive to ozone, an additional reaction must occur. The conditions (\"heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide\") suggest that after the reduction of the ketone to an alcohol (protoadamantan-4-ol), a base-catalyzed dehydration occurs. This elimination of water forms an alkene. The most likely alkene formed is **protoadamant-4-ene**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n    Product 2 (protoadamant-4-ene) is subjected to ozonolysis (O₃ followed by DMS). This reaction cleaves the double bond (C4=C5 in protoadamant-4-ene) and replaces it with two carbonyl groups. The ozonolysis of protoadamant-4-ene opens up the cage structure to form a bicyclic dicarbonyl compound. The resulting product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione**.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n    The final step is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded, non-exchangeable hydrogen atom in bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione.\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule possesses a high degree of symmetry (C2v). It consists of two fused six-membered rings in a chair-chair conformation, with carbonyl groups at positions 3 and 7.\n    *   **Most Deshielded Proton:** The most deshielded protons are the two equivalent bridgehead protons at C1 and C5. While they are gamma (γ) to the carbonyl groups, their unique position alpha to two carbons on two separate bridges, and their fixed orientation relative to the two carbonyl groups, results in significant deshielding.\n    *   **Coupling Pattern:** Let's analyze the splitting for the proton at C1. According to the correct structure of the bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane skeleton, the C1 bridgehead is bonded to C2, C8, and C9. Due to the molecule's C2v symmetry, the two axial protons on C2 and C8 are equivalent, and the two equatorial protons on C2 and C8 are also equivalent from the perspective of H1. Therefore, H1 is coupled to two equivalent axial protons with a large coupling constant (J_ax) and two equivalent equatorial protons with a smaller coupling constant (J_eq). This coupling to two distinct pairs of equivalent protons results in a **triplet of triplets**. The coupling to the protons on the C9 bridge is often considered negligible or may contribute to further fine splitting.\n\nTherefore, the coupling pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen atom is a triplet of triplets.\n\n<<<A>>>"
