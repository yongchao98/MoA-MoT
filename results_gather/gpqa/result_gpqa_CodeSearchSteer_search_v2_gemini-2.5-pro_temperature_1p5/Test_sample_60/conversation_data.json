    "The reaction proceeds through the following steps:\n\n*   **Step 1: Nitration of Benzene.** Benzene reacts with a mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO₃) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) in an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction to form nitrobenzene (Product 1).\n\n*   **Step 2: Bromination of Nitrobenzene.** Nitrobenzene is treated with bromine (Br₂) and a catalyst, such as iron powder (which forms FeBr₃ in situ). The nitro group (–NO₂) is a deactivating, meta-directing group. Therefore, the bromine is added at the position meta to the nitro group, yielding 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene (Product 2).\n\n*   **Step 3: Reduction of the Nitro Group.** 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene is treated with hydrogen gas (H₂) over a palladium-on-carbon catalyst (Pd/C). This reaction, known as catalytic hydrogenation, reduces the nitro group to an amino group (–NH₂), forming 3-bromoaniline (Product 3).\n\n*   **Step 4: Diazotization.** 3-bromoaniline is treated with sodium nitrite (NaNO₂) and tetrafluoroboric acid (HBF₄). This process converts the primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt, specifically 3-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate (Product 4).\n\n*   **Step 5: Gomberg-Bachmann Reaction.** Product 4 is heated and treated with anisole (methoxybenzene). This is a Gomberg-Bachmann aryl-aryl coupling reaction. The diazonium salt forms a 3-bromophenyl radical. Anisole has a methoxy group (–OCH₃), which is an ortho, para-directing activator. The radical attacks the anisole ring, primarily at the para position due to less steric hindrance. This results in the formation of the final product, 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl (Product 5).\n\nBased on this five-step synthesis, the final product is 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl.\n\n<<<A>>>"
