    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], we need to calculate its mole fraction (α₂) relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species.\n\nThe equilibria for the formation of the thiocyanato complexes are:\nCo²⁺ + n SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)ₙ]²⁻ⁿ\n\nThe concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free Co²⁺ concentration, the free thiocyanate concentration [SCN⁻], and the overall stability constants (βₙ):\n*   [Co²⁺]\n*   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of all these species:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThe mole fraction of a specific complex, for instance [Co(SCN)₂] (where n=2), is given by the formula:\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\nBy substituting the expressions above, we get:\nα₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))\n\nThe [Co²⁺] term cancels out, simplifying the formula for the mole fraction to:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, let's calculate the denominator (let's call it D):\n*   1 = 1\n*   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n*   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nD = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nNext, we calculate the numerator for α₂, which is β₂[SCN⁻]²:\nNumerator = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4\n\nFinally, we calculate the mole fraction α₂:\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThus, the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex in the solution is approximately 16.9%. While the blue color in cobalt thiocyanate solutions is typically associated with the tetrathiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻, the question specifically asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato species, [Co(SCN)₂].\n\n<<<B>>>"
