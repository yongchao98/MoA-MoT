    "### Analyzing the Transit Probability of Two Exoplanets\n\nTo determine which of the two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 or Planet_2, has a higher probability of transiting its host star, we must first understand the factors that influence transit probability. For a planet with a circular orbit, the geometric probability of a transit is the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital semi-major axis.\n\nThe formula for transit probability (p) is:\n*   p = R_s / a\n\nwhere:\n*   **R_s** is the radius of the host star.\n*   **a** is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nThe semi-major axis can be determined using Kepler's Third Law, which relates the orbital period (P), the semi-major axis (a), and the mass of the host star (M_s). The law can be expressed as:\n*   a³ ∝ (M_s * P²)\n\nFrom this, we can derive that the semi-major axis is proportional to:\n*   a ∝ (M_s * P²)^(1/3)\n\nBy substituting this into the transit probability formula, we find the relationship between transit probability and the given planetary and stellar parameters:\n*   p ∝ R_s / [(M_s * P²)^(1/3)]\n*   p ∝ R_s * M_s^(-1/3) * P^(-2/3)\n\nWe are given the following information for Planet_1 and Planet_2:\n*   The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2 (P₁ = P₂ / 3).\n*   The mass of the star hosting Planet_1 is twice that of the star hosting Planet_2 (M_s₁ = 2 * M_s₂).\n*   Both host stars have the same radii (R_s₁ = R_s₂).\n\nNow, we can calculate the ratio of the transit probabilities (p₁ / p₂) for the two planets:\n\n*   p₁ / p₂ = [R_s₁ * M_s₁^(-1/3) * P₁^(-2/3)] / [R_s₂ * M_s₂^(-1/3) * P₂^(-2/3)]\n\nSubstituting the known relationships:\n\n*   p₁ / p₂ = [R_s₂ * (2 * M_s₂)^(-1/3) * (P₂ / 3)^(-2/3)] / [R_s₂ * M_s₂^(-1/3) * P₂^(-2/3)]\n\nAfter canceling out the common terms (R_s₂, M_s₂^(-1/3), and P₂^(-2/3)), we are left with:\n\n*   p₁ / p₂ = (2)^(-1/3) * (1/3)^(-2/3)\n*   p₁ / p₂ = (3^(2/3)) / (2^(1/3))\n*   p₁ / p₂ ≈ 2.080 / 1.260\n*   p₁ / p₂ ≈ 1.65\n\nThis calculation shows that the probability of Planet_1 transiting its host star is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.\n\n<<<C>>>"
