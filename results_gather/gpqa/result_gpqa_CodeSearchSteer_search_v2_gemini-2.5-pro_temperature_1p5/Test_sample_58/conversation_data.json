    "To determine the pH of the final solution, we must first calculate the initial moles of the acidic and basic components and then determine which component is in excess after neutralization reactions.\n\n**1. Calculate Initial Moles of Each Component:**\n\n*   **Acetic Acid (CH3COOH - a weak acid):**\n    *   Moles = Volume × Concentration\n    *   Moles = 0.500 L × 0.1 M = 0.050 mol of CH3COOH\n\n*   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl - a strong acid):**\n    *   Moles = Volume × Concentration\n    *   Moles = 0.400 L × 0.2 M = 0.080 mol of HCl\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, providing 0.080 mol of H⁺ ions.\n\n*   **Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)2 - a strong base):**\n    *   Moles = Volume × Concentration\n    *   Moles = 0.300 L × 0.3 M = 0.090 mol of Ba(OH)2\n    *   Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that dissociates to yield two hydroxide ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻).\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol of OH⁻.\n\n**2. Perform Neutralization Reactions:**\n\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will react with all the available acid. The reaction proceeds in two steps: first with the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) and then with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   **Step 2a: Strong Acid - Strong Base Neutralization**\n    *   The 0.180 mol of OH⁻ reacts with the 0.080 mol of H⁺ from HCl.\n    *   H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol.\n    *   All the strong acid is consumed.\n\n*   **Step 2b: Weak Acid - Strong Base Neutralization**\n    *   The remaining 0.100 mol of OH⁻ reacts with the 0.050 mol of CH3COOH.\n    *   CH3COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n    *   The weak acid (CH3COOH) is the limiting reactant here. It will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ consumed in this step = 0.050 mol.\n    *   Final excess moles of OH⁻ = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol.\n\n**3. Calculate Final Concentration and pH:**\n\nThe final solution contains a significant amount of excess strong base (OH⁻). The pH will be primarily determined by this excess OH⁻ concentration.\n\n*   **Total Volume of the Solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L.\n\n*   **Final Concentration of OH⁻:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ 0.04167 M.\n\n*   **Calculate pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    *   At 25 °C, the relationship between pH and pOH is: pH + pOH = 14.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.\n\nThe final pH of the solution is approximately 12.62.\n\n<<<B>>>"
