    "To evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the vector field **f**(r), we can use the Divergence Theorem, also known as Gauss's Theorem. The vector field is given by **f**(r) = (1/r²) **r̂**, where **r̂** is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n### Analysis of the Divergence\n\nFirst, let's compute the divergence of **f**(r) using spherical coordinates. The formula for the divergence of a radial vector field **f**(r) = f(r) **r̂** is:\n∇ ⋅ **f** = (1/r²) * ∂(r² * f(r))/∂r.\n\nIn this case, f(r) = 1/r², so the divergence is:\n∇ ⋅ **f** = (1/r²) * ∂(r² * (1/r²))/∂r = (1/r²) * ∂(1)/∂r = 0.\n\nThis calculation shows that the divergence of the field is zero everywhere except, potentially, at the origin (r=0), where the field itself is undefined. This singularity at the origin is crucial. A naive integration of the divergence (which is 0) over the volume would incorrectly yield a result of 0.\n\n### Applying the Divergence Theorem\n\nThe Divergence Theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume V is equal to the surface integral of the field over the closed surface S that encloses the volume.\n\n∫∫∫ᵥ (∇ ⋅ **f**) dV = ∮∮ₛ (**f** ⋅ d**S**)\n\nBecause the vector field has a singularity at r=0, we cannot directly apply the theorem to the entire sphere of radius R. However, we can apply it to the volume excluding a small sphere of radius ε around the origin and then take the limit as ε approaches zero. A more direct approach is to calculate the flux through the outer surface S, which is the sphere of radius R.\n\nThe integral on the right-hand side is the flux of the vector field through the surface of the sphere of radius R.\n\n1.  **The Vector Field at the Surface:** On the surface of the sphere, r = R, so the vector field is **f**(R) = (1/R²) **r̂**.\n2.  **The Surface Element:** The differential surface element for a sphere in the outward direction is d**S** = R² sin(θ) dθ dφ **r̂**.\n3.  **The Dot Product:** The dot product of the field and the surface element is:\n    **f** ⋅ d**S** = [(1/R²) **r̂**] ⋅ [R² sin(θ) dθ dφ **r̂**] = sin(θ) dθ dφ.\n4.  **The Surface Integral (Flux):** We now integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for θ are from 0 to π, and for φ are from 0 to 2π.\n\n    ∮∮ₛ (**f** ⋅ d**S**) = ∫₀²π ∫₀π sin(θ) dθ dφ\n\n5.  **Evaluating the Integral:**\n    *   First, integrate with respect to θ:\n        ∫₀π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]₀π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 2.\n    *   Now, integrate with respect to φ:\n        ∫₀²π 2 dφ = 2 [φ]₀²π = 2(2π) = 4π.\n\nThe result of the surface integral is 4π. According to the Divergence Theorem, this is equal to the volume integral of the divergence. The singularity at the origin acts as a source, and its strength is captured by the flux through the enclosing surface. In the language of distributions, the divergence of this field is 4πδ³(**r**), where δ³ is the Dirac delta function, and its integral over any volume containing the origin is 4π.\n\nTherefore, the value of the integral is 4π.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 4 π\nB) 1\nC) 0\nD) 4/3 π R\n\nThe most appropriate answer is 4π.\n\n<<<A>>>"
