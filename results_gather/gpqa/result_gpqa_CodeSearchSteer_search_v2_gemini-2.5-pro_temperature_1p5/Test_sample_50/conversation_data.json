    "To solve this problem, we use the method of image charges.\n\n1.  **The Setup**: We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. A grounded sphere is held at a potential of zero.\n\n2.  **The Method of Images**: The electric field and potential outside the sphere can be modeled by replacing the sphere with an \"image charge,\" `q'`, placed at a specific location inside the sphere. This arrangement must satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at r = R) is zero.\n\n3.  **Image Charge and Position**: For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` is given by:\n    `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n\n    And its position `b` from the center, along the line connecting the center and `q`, is:\n    `b = R² / d`\n\n4.  **Potential Energy Calculation**: The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d` from the center of the sphere. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charge on the sphere, which is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\n    The potential at the location of charge `q` due to the image charge `q'` is:\n    `V_image = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n    where `k` is Coulomb's constant (`1 / 4πε₀`).\n\n    The distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d`.\n\n    So, the potential created by the image charge at the position of the real charge is:\n    `V_image = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d² - R²)/d] = -k * qR / (d² - R²)`\n\n5.  **Final Energy Formula**: The potential energy `U` of the charge `q` in the potential of the induced charge (represented by the image charge) is given by `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`. The factor of 1/2 is crucial and arises because the total energy of the system includes the interaction energy between the charge `q` and the induced surface charge, as well as the self-energy of the induced surface charge itself. A more detailed derivation shows that the total work done is half the interaction energy between the real and image charges.\n\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d² - R²)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n6.  **Comparing with the Options**:\n    *   A) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n    *   B) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n    *   C) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n    *   D) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n\n    Our derived formula matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
