    "The reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in condensed ammonia is a classic example of an aromatic nucleophilic substitution that proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a benzyne intermediate. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of possible organic products.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates\n\nThe strong base, amide anion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from a position ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two such positions:\n*   **Position 6:** Contains a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position 2:** Contains a deuterium atom (D), a stable isotope of hydrogen.\n\nDue to the kinetic isotope effect, breaking a C-H bond is faster than breaking a C-D bond. However, both abstractions are possible and lead to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n1.  **H-abstraction (major pathway):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n2.  **D-abstraction (minor pathway):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the ring. This intermediate is **non-deuterated benzyne**.\n\n### Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates\n\nThe amide anion (NH₂⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the highly reactive \"triple\" bond of the benzyne intermediates.\n\n**Addition to 3-Deuterobenzyne:**\nThis intermediate is asymmetrical. The amide ion can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C6), leading to two different products after protonation by the ammonia solvent.\n*   **Attack at C1:** The amino group (-NH₂) attaches to C1. After protonation, the final product has the amino group at position 1 and the deuterium at position 2. This is **2-deuteroaniline** (or *o*-deuteroaniline).\n*   **Attack at C6:** The amino group attaches to C6. After protonation, the final product has the amino group at position 6 (which is renumbered to 1 for nomenclature) and the deuterium at position 2 relative to the original bromine, which becomes position 3 relative to the new amino group. This is **3-deuteroaniline** (or *m*-deuteroaniline).\n\n**Addition to Non-deuterated Benzyne:**\nThis intermediate is symmetrical. Attack of the amide ion at either carbon of the triple bond, followed by protonation, leads to a single product.\n*   The product is simple **aniline**, with no deuterium.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the outcomes from both pathways, a total of three distinct organic products are formed in this reaction:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-Deuteroaniline\n3.  3-Deuteroaniline\n\nTherefore, there are three possible organic products.\n\n<<<C>>>"
