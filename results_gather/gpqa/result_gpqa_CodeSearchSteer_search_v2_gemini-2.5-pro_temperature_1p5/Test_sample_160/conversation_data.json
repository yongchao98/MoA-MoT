    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2:\n\n1.  **Define the Mean Free Paths (MFP):**\n    *   **λ1:** This is the mean free path of the residual gas molecules colliding *with each other*. The vacuum is in an ultra-high state (< 10⁻⁹ Torr), but not perfect, so there are still gas molecules present.\n    *   **λ2:** This is the mean free path of the high-energy electrons from the beam scattering (colliding) *with the residual gas molecules*.\n\n2.  **Formulas for Mean Free Path:**\n    *   The mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the number density of target particles (n) and the collision cross-section (σ).\n    *   **For λ1 (gas-gas collisions):** The formula is λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas). Here, *n* is the number density of gas molecules and *σ_gas* is the kinetic cross-section of one gas molecule colliding with another. The factor of √2 is crucial; it accounts for the fact that the target molecules are also in random thermal motion, which increases the collision frequency compared to stationary targets.\n    *   **For λ2 (electron-gas collisions):** The formula is λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_e-gas). Here, *n* is the same number density of gas molecules, but *σ_e-gas* is the total scattering cross-section for an electron interacting with a gas molecule. Notice the absence of the √2 factor. This is because the electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, giving them extremely high velocity compared to the thermal motion of the gas molecules. From the perspective of a high-speed electron, the gas molecules are essentially stationary targets.\n\n3.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections:**\n    *   **σ_gas (Kinetic Cross-Section):** This is related to the physical size of the gas molecules. For a molecule-molecule collision to occur, their centers must approach each other within a distance of their molecular diameter.\n    *   **σ_e-gas (Electron Scattering Cross-Section):** This is the effective area a gas molecule presents to an incoming electron for a scattering event. For a very high-energy electron (1000 keV), the probability of interacting with a gas molecule is quite low. The electron is moving so fast that it spends very little time in the vicinity of any given gas molecule, reducing the chance of being significantly deflected (scattered). Theoretical and experimental data show that electron scattering cross-sections decrease significantly as electron energy increases into the keV range. This high-energy electron scattering cross-section (σ_e-gas) is considerably *smaller* than the physical kinetic cross-section of the gas molecule (σ_gas).\n\n4.  **Derive the Relationship between λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   From the formulas, we can establish a ratio:\n        λ₂ / λ₁ = [1 / (n * σ_e-gas)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas)]\n    *   Simplifying this gives:\n        λ₂ / λ₁ = (√2 * σ_gas) / σ_e-gas\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   We have established two key points:\n        1.  The formula for λ₁ has a √2 in the denominator that λ₂ does not.\n        2.  The electron scattering cross-section at high energy (σ_e-gas) is much smaller than the gas kinetic cross-section (σ_gas). So, the ratio (σ_gas / σ_e-gas) is a number significantly greater than 1.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio λ₂ / λ₁ is the product of √2 (which is ~1.414) and a number much larger than 1.\n    *   This means λ₂ must be significantly larger than λ₁, and specifically, it must be larger than 1.414 * λ₁.\n    *   Reviewing the options:\n        *   A) λ₂ >= 1.22*λ₁: This is consistent with our finding that λ₂ is significantly larger than λ₁.\n        *   B) λ₂ = λ₁, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: This is incorrect.\n        *   C) λ₂ < λ₁: This is incorrect; the mean free path for the high-energy electrons is much longer.\n        *   D) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22*λ₁: This is incorrect because our analysis shows λ₂ must be greater than 1.414*λ₁.\n\nThe only physically plausible conclusion is that λ₂ is substantially larger than λ₁. Option A aligns with this conclusion.\n\n<<<A>>>"
