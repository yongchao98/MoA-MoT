    "Based on the principles of particle and condensed matter physics, here is the breakdown of each particle's relationship with spontaneously-broken symmetry:\n\n*   **A) Magnon:** A magnon is the quasiparticle representing a spin wave. In a ferromagnet, the spins of atoms align in a particular direction, spontaneously breaking the global rotational symmetry of the system. Magnons are the collective excitations (Goldstone bosons) that correspond to this broken symmetry.\n\n*   **B) Pion:** In the theory of the strong nuclear force (quantum chromodynamics), pions are identified as the pseudo-Goldstone bosons that arise from the spontaneous breaking of a fundamental approximate symmetry called chiral symmetry. This symmetry breaking is what gives protons and neutrons the vast majority of their mass.\n\n*   **D) Phonon:** A phonon is the quasiparticle of a quantized vibration in a crystal lattice. The continuous translational symmetry of empty space is spontaneously broken by the formation of a periodic crystal lattice. Phonons are the Goldstone bosons resulting from this broken translational symmetry.\n\n*   **C) Skyrmion:** A skyrmion is not a Goldstone boson. Instead, it is a topologically stable, particle-like configuration within a field. Its existence and stability are due to its topologyâ€”it can be thought of as a \"knot\" in a field that cannot be easily untied. While skyrmions can emerge in phases that are formed through spontaneous symmetry breaking, they are not the direct, massless excitations (Goldstone bosons) associated with that symmetry breaking.\n\nTherefore, the skyrmion is the particle not inherently associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry in the same way as the others.\n\n<<<C>>>"
