    "The process described, $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$, is the creation of an electron-positron pair from the collision of a high-energy gamma-ray (Î³) and a low-energy photon from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). For this interaction to occur, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame must be at least the rest mass energy of the two particles created, which are an electron and a positron.\n\nThe threshold energy for this reaction can be calculated based on the principles of special relativity. The minimum energy for the high-energy gamma-ray is required when it has a head-on collision (an angle of 180 degrees) with a CMB photon. The formula for this threshold energy ($E_\\gamma$) is:\n\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $m_e c^2$ is the rest mass energy of an electron.\n*   $E_{CMB}$ is the energy of the CMB photon.\n\nBased on the provided information and physical constants:\n*   The rest mass energy of an electron ($m_e c^2$) is approximately 0.511 MeV.\n*   The average energy of a CMB photon ($E_{CMB}$) is given as $10^{-3}$ eV.\n\nFirst, we must ensure all energy units are consistent. Let's convert the electron's rest mass energy from MeV to eV:\n$0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV} = 511,000 \\text{ eV}$\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the threshold energy formula:\n\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{(511,000 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{2.61121 \\times 10^{11} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n\n$E_\\gamma = 2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}$\n\nThe question's options are given in giga-electron-volts (GeV). To convert our result from eV to GeV, we use the conversion factor $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$:\n\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 2.61121 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis calculated value of approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV represents the minimum energy a gamma-ray must have for its lifetime in the universe to be limited by pair production with CMB photons. This value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
