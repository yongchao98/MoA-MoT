    "The selection of reagents is based on two classic organic chemistry reactions.\n\nFor the first reaction, butan-2-one is converted to 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction. It involves the nucleophilic addition of a cyanide ion (from NaCN) to the carbonyl carbon of the ketone. The resulting alkoxide intermediate is then protonated to yield the final hydroxyl group. An acidic workup, represented by H3O+, is a standard way to provide this proton.\n\nFor the second reaction, a cyanohydrin is converted to a carboxylic acid. This reaction is a hydrolysis of the nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base in the presence of water. Strong acids such as hydrochloric acid (HCl) are commonly used to facilitate this reaction, often with heating. The process involves the protonation of the nitrile, followed by attack by water and subsequent steps that lead to the carboxylic acid and an ammonium salt.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n*   **Reagent A** is H3O+ for the protonation step in cyanohydrin formation.\n*   **Reagent B** is HCl for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the nitrile.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
