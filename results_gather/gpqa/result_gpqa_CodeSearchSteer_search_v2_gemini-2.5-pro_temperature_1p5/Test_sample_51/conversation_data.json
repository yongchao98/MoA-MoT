    "The problem asks for the factor by which the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two different energy levels changes as the star's effective temperature shifts due to star spots. This can be solved using the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical distribution of atoms in various energy states in a system in thermal equilibrium.\n\nThe ratio of the number of atoms in a higher energy state (N₂) to a lower energy state (N₁) is given by the Boltzmann equation:\nN₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\nWhere:\n*   N₂ and N₁ are the populations of the two energy levels.\n*   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights of the levels (which are constant for the levels in question).\n*   ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels.\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nWe need to find the factor by which this ratio changes. This is the ratio without spots divided by the ratio with spots:\nFactor = [Ratio at T_nospots] / [Ratio at T_spots]\n\nThe temperatures are given as:\n*   T_nospots = 6000 K\n*   T_spots = 5500 K\n\nThe statistical weights (g₂/g₁) cancel out, leaving:\nFactor = exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))\nFactor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]\n\nNext, we must calculate the energy difference (ΔE) from the given wavelength (λ) of the transition, which is 1448 Å (1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m). The relationship between a photon's energy and its wavelength is:\nΔE = h * c / λ\n\nWhere:\n*   h is the Planck constant (approximately 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n*   c is the speed of light (approximately 3.0 x 10⁸ m/s).\n\nLet's calculate the term ΔE/k:\nΔE/k = (h * c) / (λ * k)\nΔE/k = (6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s * 3.0 x 10⁸ m/s) / (1448 x 10⁻¹⁰ m * 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K)\nΔE/k ≈ 99400 K\n\nNow, substitute this value back into the factor equation:\nFactor = exp[ 99400 * (1/5500 - 1/6000) ]\nFactor = exp[ 99400 * ( (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) ) ]\nFactor = exp[ 99400 * (500 / 33,000,000) ]\nFactor = exp[ 99400 / 66000 ]\nFactor = exp(1.506)\nFactor ≈ 4.5\n\nThus, the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in the two energy levels is approximately 4.5 times higher when the star has no spots compared to when it is 40% covered by spots.\n\n<<<D>>>"
