    "To determine how long the journey to Earth will take from the astronaut's perspective, we must account for the effects of time dilation, a consequence of Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity.\n\n### 1. Distance to Earth\n\nThe Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is a satellite galaxy of our own Milky Way. Its distance from Earth is approximately 163,000 light-years. This means that light, traveling at speed *c*, takes 163,000 years to cover this distance.\n\n### 2. Time of Travel in Earth's Frame of Reference\n\nFrom the perspective of an observer on Earth, the time it would take for the spacecraft to arrive can be calculated by dividing the distance by the spacecraft's speed. Given the speed is 0.99999987*c*, the travel time from Earth's frame of reference would be:\n\n*Time (Earth)* = 163,000 light-years / 0.99999987*c* ≈ 163,002.12 years\n\n### 3. Time Dilation\n\nAccording to the theory of special relativity, a moving clock runs slower than a stationary one as observed by a stationary observer. The time experienced by the astronaut (the proper time, Δt₀) is related to the time measured by an observer on Earth (the relative time, Δt) by the time dilation formula:\n\nΔt = γ * Δt₀\n\nwhere γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as:\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nGiven the spacecraft's velocity (v) of 0.99999987*c*:\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - (0.99999987c)²/c²)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.99999987²)\nγ ≈ 1 / √(2.6 x 10⁻⁷)\nγ ≈ 1961.16\n\n### 4. Time of Travel for the Astronaut\n\nWe can now calculate the time that passes for the astronaut by rearranging the time dilation formula:\n\n*Time (Astronaut)* = Time (Earth) / γ\n*Time (Astronaut)* = 163,002.12 years / 1961.16\n*Time (Astronaut)* ≈ 83.11 years\n\nSince the astronaut is 22 years old and the average lifespan of their species is 150 years, they have 128 years of life remaining. Therefore, the journey is survivable. The time elapsed for the astronaut is approximately 83 years.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 77 years\nB) 81 years\nC) 72 years\nD) The astronaut will die before reaching the Earth.\n\nThe calculated time of approximately 83 years is closest to 81 years. The minor difference can be attributed to slight variations in the reported distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud.\n\n<<<B>>>"
