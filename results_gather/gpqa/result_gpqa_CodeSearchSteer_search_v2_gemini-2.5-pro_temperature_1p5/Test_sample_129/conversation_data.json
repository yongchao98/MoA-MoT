    "To be detected by optical ground-based telescopes, the light from a distant object must have a wavelength that can pass through Earth's atmosphere. The atmosphere effectively blocks most light in the ultraviolet (UV) part of the spectrum. The atmospheric cutoff for ground-based observatories is approximately 320-350 nanometers (nm), or 3200-3500 Angstroms (Å).\n\nThe Lyman-alpha line has a rest wavelength (λ_emit) of about 1216 Å. This wavelength is in the far-ultraviolet and is completely absorbed by the atmosphere. For this absorption line to be detectable from the ground, it must be shifted to a longer wavelength by the expansion of the universe, an effect known as redshift (z).\n\nThe relationship between the rest wavelength and the observed wavelength (λ_obs) is given by the formula:\n\nλ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + z)\n\nTo find the minimum redshift, we need to calculate the 'z' value that shifts the 1216 Å line to the minimum observable wavelength, which is around 3500 Å.\n\nz = (λ_obs / λ_emit) - 1\nz = (3500 Å / 1216 Å) - 1\nz ≈ 2.88 - 1\nz ≈ 1.88\n\nThis calculation shows that a redshift of approximately 1.9 would shift the Lyman-alpha line to about 3526 Å, making it observable from the ground. Scientific literature confirms that the Lyman-alpha forest can be observed by ground-based telescopes at redshifts greater than 2.\n\nLet's check the options provided:\n*   A redshift of 1.2 would shift the line to ~2675 Å, which is still too far in the UV to penetrate the atmosphere.\n*   A redshift of 1.9 shifts the line to ~3526 Å, which is just at the edge of the optical window for ground-based telescopes.\n*   Redshifts of 2.4 and 3 would shift the line to 4134 Å and 4864 Å respectively, both of which are well within the visible spectrum and easily detectable.\n\nTherefore, the lowest redshift at which these objects can be detected from the given choices is 1.9.\n\n<<<B>>>"
