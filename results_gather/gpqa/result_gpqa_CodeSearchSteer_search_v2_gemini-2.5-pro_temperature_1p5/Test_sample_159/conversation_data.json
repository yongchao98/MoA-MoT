    "An N-sided polygon where N approaches infinity is a circle. The problem states that the apothem of the polygon is of length 'a'. For a regular polygon, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. As the number of sides becomes infinitely large, this apothem becomes the radius of the resulting circle. Therefore, the aperture is a circle with radius R = a, and its diameter is D = 2a.\n\nWhen monochromatic light passes through a circular aperture, it creates a diffraction pattern known as an Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a bright central disk surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings. The angular positions of the dark rings (minima) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x).\n\nUsing the small angle approximation, the angular position, θ, of the minima is given by the formula:\nθ = (constant * λ) / D\n\nWhere λ is the wavelength of the light and D is the diameter of the aperture.\n\nA more precise formulation gives the positions of the minima as:\nsin(θ) ≈ θ = cₙ * λ / D\n\nWhere the constants cₙ for the first few minima are:\n*   For the first minimum: c₁ ≈ 1.220\n*   For the second minimum: c₂ ≈ 2.233\n\nIn this problem, the diameter of the circular aperture is D = 2a.\n\nThe angular position of the first minimum (θ₁) is:\nθ₁ ≈ 1.220 * λ / (2a) = 0.610 * λ / a\n\nThe angular position of the second minimum (θ₂) is:\nθ₂ ≈ 2.233 * λ / (2a) ≈ 1.1165 * λ / a\n\nThe question asks for the angular distance between these first two minima, which is Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁.\n\nΔθ = (1.1165 * λ / a) - (0.610 * λ / a)\nΔθ = (1.1165 - 0.610) * λ / a\nΔθ = 0.5065 * λ / a\n\nThis result is closest to option B. The small discrepancy arises from using more precise values for the constants, which are derived from the zeros of the Bessel function. The value for the second minimum is often cited as 2.23, and the calculation using this gives a result of 0.505. The option 0.506 accounts for a more precise value.\n\n<<<B>>>"
