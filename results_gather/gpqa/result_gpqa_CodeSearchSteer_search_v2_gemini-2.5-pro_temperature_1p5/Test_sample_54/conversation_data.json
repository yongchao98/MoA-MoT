    "### Analysis of the Unknown Organic Compound\n\nThe provided 1H NMR data allows for a systematic identification of the unknown compound. Here is a breakdown of the spectral data and how it corresponds to the correct structure:\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, singlet):** This signal is characteristic of the three protons of a methyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon of an acetate functional group (-O-C(=O)-CH₃). The singlet multiplicity indicates that there are no adjacent protons to couple with. All four possible compounds contain an acetate group, so this signal is consistent with all options.\n\n*   **Signals in the Vinylic Region (7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm):** The presence of signals between 4.5 and 7.5 ppm indicates protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (vinylic protons). The signal at 7.0 ppm and the one at 5.5 ppm confirm the presence of a C=C double bond in the molecule.\n\n*   **The Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** The signal at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a coupling constant (J) of 16.0 Hz. This value is a crucial piece of information. The magnitude of the coupling constant between two vinylic protons depends on their geometric arrangement. Protons in a *trans* configuration (on opposite sides of the double bond) typically show a large coupling constant, usually in the range of 11-18 Hz. In contrast, protons in a *cis* configuration (on the same side) show a smaller coupling constant, typically between 6-15 Hz. The observed J value of 16.0 Hz strongly indicates a *trans* relationship between the two vinylic protons. This allows the elimination of the *cis* isomers: Cis-propenyl acetate and Cis-butenyl acetate.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, doublet):** This signal represents a methyl group in the allylic position (attached to a carbon that is adjacent to the C=C double bond). The doublet multiplicity means it is coupled to a single proton.\n\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, doublet of quartets):** This vinylic proton signal is split into a doublet by the other vinylic proton (at 7.0 ppm) and into a quartet by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (at 1.6 ppm). This splitting pattern (dq) confirms the connectivity CH₃-CH=CH-.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the evidence:\n1.  The presence of an acetate group is confirmed by the singlet at 2.1 ppm.\n2.  The J value of 16.0 Hz confirms a *trans* double bond.\n3.  The combination of signals at 5.5 ppm (dq), 1.6 ppm (d), and 7.0 ppm (d) perfectly describes the `trans-CH₃-CH=CH-` fragment attached to the acetate's oxygen.\n\nThis structure corresponds to **Trans-propenyl acetate**. The structure of Trans-butenyl acetate (e.g., trans-crotyl acetate, CH₃CH=CHCH₂OAc) would show a different spectrum, most notably a signal for the -CH₂- protons, which is absent in the provided data.\n\n<<<B>>>"
