    "To determine the radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to its host star, we must first calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the starspots and then equate this to the transit depth of an exoplanet.\n\n### 1. Brightness Variation due to Starspots\n\nThe flux (F) emitted by a star is proportional to the fourth power of its effective temperature (T), according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law (F ∝ T⁴). We can analyze the relative flux from the star at its maximum and minimum brightness.\n\n*   **Maximum Brightness (F_max):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The entire visible disk has the star's effective temperature, T_star = 6000K. The flux is proportional to T_star⁴.\n    *   F_max ∝ 6000⁴\n\n*   **Minimum Brightness (F_min):** This occurs when the hemisphere covered in spots is facing the observer. This hemisphere has two components: the unspotted surface (80% of the area) and the cooler dark spots (20% of the area).\n    *   Temperature of spots: T_spot = T_star - 1000K = 5000K\n    *   The flux from this hemisphere is a weighted average of the flux from the hot and cool areas. The filling factor of the spots is f = 0.20.\n    *   F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_star⁴ + f * T_spot⁴\n    *   F_min ∝ (0.80 * 6000⁴) + (0.20 * 5000⁴)\n\nThe amplitude of the star's brightness variation is the fractional drop in flux:\n\nAmplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\n\nSubstituting the expressions for the flux:\n\nAmplitude = (T_star⁴ - [(0.8 * T_star⁴) + (0.2 * T_spot⁴)]) / T_star⁴\nAmplitude = (0.2 * T_star⁴ - 0.2 * T_spot⁴) / T_star⁴\nAmplitude = 0.2 * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴)\n\nNow, we can plug in the temperature values:\n\nAmplitude = 0.2 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)\nAmplitude = 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)\nAmplitude ≈ 0.2 * (1 - 0.48225)\nAmplitude ≈ 0.2 * 0.51775\n**Amplitude ≈ 0.10355**\n\n### 2. Equivalent Exoplanet Transit Signal\n\nThe signal produced by a transiting exoplanet, known as the transit depth, is the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. This is equivalent to the square of the ratio of their radii (Rpl / Rstar).\n\nTransit Depth = (Rpl / Rstar)²\n\nTo find the exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude signal as the starspots, we set the transit depth equal to the calculated amplitude:\n\n(Rpl / Rstar)² = 0.10355\n\nNow, we solve for the relative radius (Rpl / Rstar) by taking the square root:\n\nRpl / Rstar = √0.10355\n**Rpl / Rstar ≈ 0.3218**\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.11\nB) ~0.07\nC) ~0.39\nD) ~0.32\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
