    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the substances and determine the molecular weight range of A4.\n\n**1. Identifying Element Y and Compound A2**\n\nThe most crucial piece of information is the mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) in compound A2, which is 31.96%. We can test several potential elements (Y) that are known to form multiple fluorides. Let the formula for A2 be YF_n_.\n\n*   **Hypothesis 1: Y is Antimony (Sb).**\n    *   If A2 is SbF₃, the molar mass is 121.76 + 3 * 18.998 = 178.75 g/mol.\n    *   The mass percentage of fluorine would be (3 * 18.998) / 178.75 = 31.88%. This value is extremely close to the given 31.96%.\n\n*   **Hypothesis 2: Y is Krypton (Kr).**\n    *   If A2 is KrF₂, the molar mass is 83.80 + 2 * 18.998 = 121.80 g/mol.\n    *   The mass percentage of fluorine would be (2 * 18.998) / 121.80 = 31.197%. This is reasonably close to 31.96%.\n\n*   **Hypothesis 3: Y is Plutonium (Pu).**\n    *   If A2 is PuF₆, the molar mass is 244 + 6 * 18.998 = 357.99 g/mol.\n    *   The mass percentage of fluorine would be (6 * 18.998) / 357.99 = 31.84%. This is also extremely close.\n\n*   **Hypothesis 4: Y is Platinum (Pt).**\n    *   If A2 is PtF₅, the molar mass is 195.08 + 5 * 18.998 = 290.07 g/mol.\n    *   The mass percentage of fluorine is about 32.75%, which is not as close as the others.\n\n**2. Evaluating the Hypotheses with Other Clues**\n\nLet's evaluate these possibilities based on the other information provided.\n\n*   **Clue for A1:** It is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (20 °C) into A2 and fluorine (A1 → A2 + F₂). This means A1 must have a higher oxidation state than A2. A1 also oxidizes xenon.\n\n    *   **If Y is Pu and A2 is PuF₆**: It's impossible for A1 to be a higher binary fluoride of plutonium that decomposes into PuF₆ and F₂. This hypothesis is incorrect.\n    *   **If Y is Sb and A2 is SbF₃**: Then A1 must be a higher fluoride, likely SbF₅. However, SbF₅ is a colorless liquid at room temperature and is stable; it does not decompose into SbF₃ and F₂ at 293 K. This contradicts the properties of A1.\n    *   **If Y is Kr and A2 is KrF₂**: Then A1 would be KrF₄. KrF₄ is known to be unstable and decompose into KrF₂ and F₂ at room temperature (293 K). KrF₄ is also a powerful oxidizing agent capable of reacting with xenon. The only discrepancy is its color; KrF₄ is a white/colorless solid, not bright-red. Given the other strong consistencies, the color description in the problem might be inaccurate.\n\n**3. Corroborating with A3, A4, and A5**\n\nLet's proceed with the most plausible hypothesis: **Y is Krypton (Kr)**.\n\n*   **A1 = KrF₄** (Decomposes to A2, oxidizes Xe)\n*   **A2 = KrF₂** (Product of decomposition, matches mass %)\n*   **A3**: Obtained by fluorination of element Y (Kr + F₂ → KrF₂), it also interacts with xenon (KrF₂ + Xe → XeF₂ + Kr). This perfectly describes **A3 = KrF₂**.\n*   **A4 and A5**: A hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4 reacts with Y (Krypton) in a 1:1 molar ratio to produce A5.\n    *   The reaction is Y + A4 → A5. This is a synproportionation reaction, where an element in oxidation state 0 (Kr) reacts with the same element in a higher oxidation state (in A4) to form an intermediate oxidation state (in A5).\n    *   For this to work with Krypton, A4 must be KrF₄ (Kr in +4 state) and A5 must be KrF₂ (Kr in +2 state).\n    *   The reaction is **Kr + KrF₄ → 2 KrF₂**. This reaction has a **1:1 molar ratio** of the reactants, perfectly matching the problem description.\n    *   Furthermore, A4 (KrF₄) is a colorless solid, so its solution would also be colorless. This fits the description.\n*   **Decomposition of A5**: In water, A5 (KrF₂) decomposes with the formation of two substances. The hydrolysis of KrF₂ produces Krypton gas, Oxygen gas, and aqueous hydrofluoric acid (2KrF₂ + 2H₂O → 2Kr + O₂ + 4HF). It's plausible that \"two substances\" refers to the elemental products, Krypton and Oxygen.\n\n**4. Determining the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\nBased on the consistent chain of evidence, substance A4 is Krypton Tetrafluoride (KrF₄).\n\n*   Molar Mass of Kr = ~83.80 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of F = ~18.998 g/mol\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 (KrF₄) = 83.80 + 4 * 18.998 = 159.792 g/mol.\n\nThis value falls within the range of **140-160**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
