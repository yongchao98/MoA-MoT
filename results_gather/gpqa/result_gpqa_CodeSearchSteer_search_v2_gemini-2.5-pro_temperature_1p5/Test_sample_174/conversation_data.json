    "An oscillating charge distribution, particularly one with a simple geometry like a spheroid oscillating along its symmetry axis, can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole, provided its size is much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation. The behavior of such a system is a fundamental concept in electromagnetism.\n\n### **Analysis of Radiated Power**\n\n1.  **Angular Distribution of Power:** The time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) by an oscillating electric dipole is not uniform in all directions. It follows the relationship:\n    `dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)`\n    where `θ` is the angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis in this problem).\n\n    The radiated power is zero along the axis of the dipole (`θ = 0°` and `θ = 180°`) and reaches its maximum value, `A`, in the plane perpendicular to the axis (`θ = 90°`), where `sin²(90°) = 1`.\n\n    To find the fraction of the maximum power radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`, we calculate `sin²(30°)`:\n    `sin(30°) = 1/2`\n    `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`\n\n    Therefore, the power radiated at 30° is 1/4 of the maximum power `A`.\n\n2.  **Wavelength Dependence:** The total power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the oscillation frequency (`ω⁴`). The relationship between angular frequency (`ω`) and wavelength (`λ`) is `ω = 2πc/λ`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n\n    Substituting this into the proportionality for power gives:\n    `Power ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ ∝ λ⁻⁴`\n\n    This `λ⁻⁴` dependence is characteristic of electric dipole radiation and is also famously seen in Rayleigh scattering. The power per unit solid angle, `f(λ, θ)`, will therefore have this dependence on wavelength.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nCombining these two findings:\n*   The fraction of maximum power at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n*   The possible form of the function `f` for radiated power has a wavelength dependence of **`λ⁻⁴`**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
