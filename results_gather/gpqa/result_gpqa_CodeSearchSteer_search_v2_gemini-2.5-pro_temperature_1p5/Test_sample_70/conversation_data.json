    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can follow these steps:\n\nFirst, the equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is proportional to the inverse square root of its orbital distance (semi-major axis, 'a'). This relationship can be expressed as:\n\nT_eq ∝ (1/a)¹/²\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2 is:\n\nT_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (a₂ / a₄)¹/²\n\nNext, we use Kepler's Third Law, which states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a). This is written as:\n\nP² ∝ a³\n\nFrom this law, we can establish a relationship for the ratio of the semi-major axes based on the ratio of the orbital periods:\n\n(a₂ / a₄)³ = (P₂ / P₄)²\na₂ / a₄ = (P₂ / P₄)²/³\n\nNow, we can substitute this back into our temperature ratio equation:\n\nT_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = [ (P₂ / P₄)²/³ ]¹/²\nT_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (P₂ / P₄)¹/³\n\nThe problem states that the orbital periods of the five planets are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. This gives us the period ratio for Planet_2 to Planet_4:\n\nP₂ / P₄ = 2 / 3.5\n\nFinally, we calculate the temperature ratio:\n\nT_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (2 / 3.5)¹/³\nT_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) ≈ (0.5714)¹/³\nT_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) ≈ 0.83\n\nThus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<B>>>"
