    "To determine which of the following compounds will exhibit optical activity, each molecule must be assessed for chirality. A molecule is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image, and it is not a meso compound.\n\n1.  ***(Z)*-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This alkene does not contain any chiral centers (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). Therefore, it is achiral and not optically active.\n\n2.  ***(3aR,7aS,E)*-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The IUPAC name specifies a single, distinct stereoisomer with defined chiral centers ((3aR,7aS)). The designation of a specific enantiomer indicates the compound is chiral and, therefore, optically active.\n\n3.  ***(2R,3S)*-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers. However, the (2R,3S) configuration results in a plane of symmetry within the molecule. This internal symmetry makes it a meso compound, which is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n4.  ***(2R,3R)*-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This stereoisomer also has two chiral centers. Unlike its (2R,3S) counterpart, it lacks an internal plane of symmetry. This makes the molecule chiral and thus optically active.\n\n5.  ***(R)*-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The name specifies the (R) enantiomer, indicating the presence of a chiral center at the carbon bearing the -OH group. A specific enantiomer of a chiral compound is optically active.\n\n6.  ***(1s,3s,5s)*-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This compound is more commonly known as *cis,cis*-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol. Although it has stereocenters, the symmetrical arrangement of the three hydroxyl groups on one side of the ring creates planes of symmetry. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: An analysis of this ketone's structure reveals no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups, meaning it lacks a chiral center. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry and is therefore achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione is **active**.\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is **active**.\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol is **active**.\n\nIn total, 3 of the compounds will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<D>>>"
