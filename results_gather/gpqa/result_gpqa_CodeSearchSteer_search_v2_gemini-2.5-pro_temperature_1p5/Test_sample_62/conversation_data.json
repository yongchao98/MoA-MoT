    "To determine the momentum of the absorbed photon, we first need to identify the initial and final energy states of the molecule and calculate the energy difference between them.\n\n**1. Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** The molecule is in its \"fundamental state,\" which is the ground state for both vibration and rotation. This corresponds to a vibrational quantum number `v = 0` and a rotational quantum number `J = 0`.\n*   **Final State:** The \"next state with the lowest possible energy\" requires exciting the molecule. There are two possibilities: a pure rotational transition or a rovibrational transition.\n    *   A pure rotational transition (v=0 → v=0, J=0 → J=1) has a very low energy, typically in the microwave region of the spectrum.\n    *   A rovibrational transition involves changing both the vibrational and rotational quantum numbers. Given the magnitude of the options, the question is referring to a transition to the next vibrational level, which requires significantly more energy and corresponds to infrared absorption.\n*   **Selection Rules:** For a photon to be absorbed, the transition must obey certain selection rules. For a rovibrational transition in a diatomic molecule, the rules are Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1.\n*   Starting from the ground state (v=0, J=0), the only possible transition to the next vibrational level (v=1) is to the rotational state J=1 (since J cannot decrease). Therefore, the final state is (v=1, J=1).\n\n**2. Energy Calculation**\n\nThe energy of a state in the quantum rotation-vibration model is given by:\n\nE(v, J) = (v + 1/2)ħω + B*J(J+1)\n\nWhere:\n*   `v` is the vibrational quantum number.\n*   `J` is the rotational quantum number.\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration (4 × 10¹⁴ rad/s).\n*   `B` is the rotational constant.\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon (ΔE) is the difference between the final and initial state energies:\n\nΔE = E(final) - E(initial)\nΔE = E(v=1, J=1) - E(v=0, J=0)\nΔE = [(1 + 1/2)ħω + B(1)(1+1)] - [(0 + 1/2)ħω + B(0)(0+1)]\nΔE = [3/2 ħω + 2B] - [1/2 ħω]\nΔE = ħω + 2B\n\nTo find ΔE, we need to calculate the rotational constant `B`, which depends on the molecule's moment of inertia (I).\n\n**3. Physical Constants and Calculations**\n\n*   **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n    μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)\n    μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu\n    Converting to kg: μ ≈ 1.818 * (1.6605 × 10⁻²⁷ kg/amu) ≈ 3.019 × 10⁻²⁷ kg.\n\n*   **Moment of Inertia (I):**\n    I = μ * R²\n    I ≈ (3.019 × 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m)²\n    I ≈ 1.2076 × 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m².\n\n*   **Rotational Constant (B):**\n    B = ħ² / (2I)\n    B ≈ (1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (2 * 1.2076 × 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²)\n    B ≈ 4.606 × 10⁻²³ J.\n\n*   **Transition Energy (ΔE):**\n    Now we can calculate the total energy of the transition.\n    Energy from vibration: ħω = (1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 × 10¹⁴ rad/s) ≈ 4.218 × 10⁻²⁰ J.\n    Energy from rotation: 2B = 2 * (4.606 × 10⁻²³ J) ≈ 9.212 × 10⁻²³ J.\n    ΔE = ħω + 2B ≈ 4.218 × 10⁻²⁰ J + 0.009212 × 10⁻²⁰ J ≈ 4.227 × 10⁻²⁰ J.\n\n**4. Photon Momentum**\n\nThe relationship between a photon's energy (E) and momentum (p) is E = pc, where `c` is the speed of light (2.998 × 10⁸ m/s).\n\np = ΔE / c\np ≈ (4.227 × 10⁻²⁰ J) / (2.998 × 10⁸ m/s)\np ≈ 1.41 × 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThis value is very close to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
