    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    where:\n    *   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   A is the planet's albedo.\n    *   R_star is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n    We need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [T_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]\n\n    Since both planets orbit the same star (T_star and R_star are constant) and have the same albedo (A1 = A2), the formula simplifies to:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\n2.  **Relating Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters**\n    The Doppler shift (Δλ) is related to the star's radial velocity (v_r) by the non-relativistic Doppler formula:\n    v_r = c * (Δλ / λ_0)\n    The maximum observed radial velocity is the amplitude, K.\n    *   K1 = c * (Δλ1 / λ_0)\n    *   K2 = c * (Δλ2 / λ_0)\n\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity amplitude (K) is given by:\n    K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * v_p * sin(i)\n    where M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, v_p is the planet's orbital velocity, and `i` is the inclination of the orbit.\n    The planet's orbital velocity is v_p = sqrt(G * M_star / a).\n    Since the planets are detected by the transit method, we can assume their orbits are edge-on, so the inclination `i` ≈ 90° and sin(i) ≈ 1.\n    Therefore, the formula for K becomes:\n    K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) = M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n\n3.  **Determining the Semi-Major Axis Ratio**\n    We can rearrange the formula for K to solve for the semi-major axis, `a`:\n    K^2 ≈ M_p^2 * G / (M_star * a)\n    a ≈ G * M_p^2 / (K^2 * M_star)\n\n    Now we can find the ratio a2 / a1. Since G and M_star are constant:\n    a2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) / (M_p1^2 / K1^2)\n    a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2\n\n4.  **Calculating the Ratios**\n    *   The ratio of the planet masses is:\n        M_p2 / M_p1 = (5 M_earth) / (7 M_earth) = 5/7\n    *   The ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes (K1 / K2) is equal to the ratio of their Doppler shifts (Δλ1 / Δλ2):\n        K1 / K2 = (c * Δλ1 / λ_0) / (c * Δλ2 / λ_0) = Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3/4\n\n5.  **Substituting the Ratios**\n    Now substitute these ratios back into the equation for a2 / a1:\n    a2 / a1 = (5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2 = (25/49) * (9/16) = 225 / 784\n\n6.  **Final Temperature Ratio Calculation**\n    Finally, substitute the value of a2 / a1 into the temperature ratio equation:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = sqrt(225 / 784)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\n    This value is approximately 0.53.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is A.\n<<<A>>>"
