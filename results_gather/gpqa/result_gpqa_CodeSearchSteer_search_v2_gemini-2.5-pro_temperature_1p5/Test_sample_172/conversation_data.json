    "To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy (ΔE) of the electron, we can use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\n**1. Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp):**\n\nFirst, we determine the minimum uncertainty in the electron's momentum (Δp) using the position-momentum uncertainty principle. The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in position (Δx) and the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) must be greater than or equal to the reduced Planck constant (ħ) divided by 2. To find the minimum uncertainty, we use the equality:\n\nΔp = ħ / (2 * Δx)\n\nGiven:\n*   Uncertainty in position (Δx) = 0.1 nm = 0.1 x 10⁻⁹ m = 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   Reduced Planck constant (ħ) ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n\nCalculation:\nΔp = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 * 10⁻¹⁰ m)\nΔp ≈ 5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s\n\n**2. Uncertainty in Energy (ΔE):**\n\nThe relationship between energy (E) and momentum (p) for a particle is described by the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)², where *v* is the velocity of the particle. For small uncertainties, the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) can be related to the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) by the particle's velocity (v):\n\nΔE ≈ v * Δp\n\nGiven:\n*   Speed of the electron (v) = 2 x 10⁸ m/s\n*   Calculated uncertainty in momentum (Δp) ≈ 5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s\n\nCalculation:\nΔE = (2 x 10⁸ m/s) * (5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s)\nΔE ≈ 10.54 x 10⁻¹⁷ J\nΔE ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe calculated minimum uncertainty in the energy is approximately 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J, which is closest to 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\n<<<C>>>"
