    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry Analysis\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound with its most common isotopes.\n*   **M+2 Peak:** A peak is observed at m/z = 158 with an intensity of 32%. This M+2 peak, having roughly one-third the intensity of the M+ peak, is a distinct isotopic signature for the presence of one chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl).\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound has a molecular weight of 156.5 g/mol and contains one chlorine atom. A search confirms that the molecular formula for chlorobenzoic acid is C₇H₅ClO₂, which has a molecular weight of approximately 156.57 g/mol.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H bond stretching in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is typical for the C=O (carbonyl) bond stretching of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion:** The IR spectrum strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This eliminates options B (an aldehyde) and D (a chloroformate ester).\n\n### 3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid. The chemical shift for this proton is often found above 10 ppm. Its integration as 1H confirms one such proton. This further supports the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region of the spectrum. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, points to a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. This symmetry means there are two distinct sets of aromatic protons.\n\n### 4. Structural Determination\n*   Based on the combined data, the unknown compound is a **chlorobenzoic acid**.\n*   The IR and NMR data confirm the carboxylic acid group.\n*   The MS data confirms the presence of one chlorine atom.\n*   The ¹H NMR splitting pattern (two doublets) specifically indicates a **para** (1,4) substitution on the benzene ring.\n*   Comparing this with the options:\n    *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This structure is a *para*-substituted chlorobenzoic acid, which perfectly matches all the spectral evidence. Published spectral data for 4-chlorobenzoic acid show very similar ¹H NMR shifts.\n    *   **B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Does not contain a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is *ortho*-substituted. The four aromatic protons would not be equivalent in pairs and would produce a more complex splitting pattern than two doublets.\n    *   **D) Phenyl chloroformate:** Is an ester and lacks the carboxylic acid group, which means it would not show the broad IR peak or the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly supports the identification of the compound as 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>"
