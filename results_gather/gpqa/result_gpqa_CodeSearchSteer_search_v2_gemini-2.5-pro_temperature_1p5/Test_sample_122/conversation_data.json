    "To determine the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame, we must use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\nHere is a step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Identify the given information**:\n    *   The relative velocity (v) between the ejecta and the Galaxy is 60,000 km/s.\n    *   The time that has passed in the ejecta's reference frame (the proper time, Δt₀) is 50 seconds.\n\n2.  **Understand the physics**: According to Einstein's theory of special relativity, time passes at different rates for observers in relative motion. An observer in a stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure time as passing more slowly for a moving object (the ejecta). This effect is known as time dilation. The time measured in the Galaxy's frame (Δt) will be longer than the proper time (Δt₀).\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ)**: The relationship between the two time intervals is given by the Lorentz factor, γ (gamma).\n    The formula for the Lorentz factor is:\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n    Where `c` is the speed of light (approximately 299,792.458 km/s, often rounded to 300,000 km/s for calculations).\n\n    First, let's find the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light:\n    v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2\n\n    Now, we can calculate γ:\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96\n    γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206\n\n4.  **Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (Δt)**: The formula for time dilation is Δt = γ * Δt₀.\n    Δt ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s\n    Δt ≈ 51.03 s\n\n    For the precision required by the multiple-choice answers, we can assume the time in the Galaxy frame is intended to be 51 seconds.\n\n5.  **Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame (d)**: The distance is the velocity multiplied by the time interval measured in the same reference frame.\n    d = v * Δt\n    d = 60,000 km/s * 51 s\n    d = 3,060,000 km\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option D. The classical calculation, which ignores time dilation, would have resulted in 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km (Option B), which is incorrect.\n\n<<<D>>>"
