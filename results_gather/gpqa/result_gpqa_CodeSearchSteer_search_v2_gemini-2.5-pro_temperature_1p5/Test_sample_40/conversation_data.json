    "This problem requires the application of the relativistic velocity-addition formula. This formula is necessary because the classical method of simply adding velocities (`u = v + u'`) is not accurate at speeds approaching the speed of light.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference.** We have two primary frames of reference:\n    *   The laboratory frame, where the observer is at rest.\n    *   The rest frame of the glass, which is moving with velocity `v` relative to the laboratory.\n\n2.  **Determine the speed of light in the glass's rest frame.** The refractive index `n` of a material is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in that material (`u'`). The problem states `c=1`. Therefore, the speed of light as measured within the glass is `u' = c/n = 1/n`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Einstein velocity-addition formula.** This formula describes how to combine velocities from different inertial frames. The formula for collinear motion is:\n    `u = (v + u') / (1 + v*u'/c²) `\n\n    Where:\n    *   `u` is the speed of the object (the light beam) relative to the laboratory observer.\n    *   `v` is the speed of the moving frame (the glass) relative to the laboratory observer.\n    *   `u'` is the speed of the object (the light beam) relative to the moving frame (the glass).\n    *   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum, which is set to `1`.\n\n4.  **Substitute the known values into the formula:**\n    *   `v` = `v`\n    *   `u'` = `1/n`\n    *   `c` = `1`\n\n    `u = (v + 1/n) / (1 + v*(1/n)/1²) `\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    *   `u = (v + 1/n) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To clear the fractions within the expression, multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    *   `u = n * (v + 1/n) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    *   `u = (n*v + 1) / (n + v)`\n    *   `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result matches the historical Fizeau experiment, which measured the speed of light in moving water and was one of the key experiments that special relativity later explained.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) (1+n\\*v)/(n+v) - This matches our derived formula.\nB) (1-n\\*v)/(n+v)\nC) (1+n\\*v)/(n-v)\nD) 1\n\nTherefore, the correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
