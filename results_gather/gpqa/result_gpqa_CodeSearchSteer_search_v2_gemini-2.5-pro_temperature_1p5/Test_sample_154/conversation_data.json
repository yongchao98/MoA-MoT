    "The uncertainty of an operator A in a quantum state is given by the formula $\\Delta A = \\sqrt{\\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2}$, where $\\langle O \\rangle$ denotes the expectation value of an operator $O$ in that state. To find the uncertainty in $P_z$, we first need to compute the expectation values $\\langle P_z \\rangle$ and $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$ for the given state of the system.\n\nThe state of the system, $|\\psi\\rangle$, is provided as the column vector:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe operator $P_z$ is represented by the matrix:\n$P_z = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**1. Calculation of the expectation value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$**\n\nThe expectation value is calculated as $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z | \\psi \\rangle$.\nFirst, we apply the operator $P_z$ to the state vector $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$P_z |\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNext, we take the inner product of the resulting vector with $\\langle \\psi |$, which is the conjugate transpose of $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$\\langle \\psi | = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\left( \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)(0) + \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\right)$\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left( \\frac{1}{4} + 0 - \\frac{1}{4} \\right) = 0$\n\n**2. Calculation of the expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$**\n\nNow, we calculate $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z^2 | \\psi \\rangle$.\nFirst, we determine the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$:\n$P_z^2 = \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)^2 = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & (-1)^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, we apply $P_z^2$ to $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nFinally, we compute the inner product with $\\langle \\psi |$:\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\left( \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)(0) + \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\right)$\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{4} + 0 + \\frac{1}{4} \\right) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\n**3. Calculation of the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$**\n\nUsing the formula for uncertainty:\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\nThe uncertainty of $P_z$ is $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n<<<C>>>"
