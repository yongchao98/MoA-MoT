    "Based on the detailed analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the chemical formula of the unknown compound is determined as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structural Components from the Spectra:**\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. The presence of only two signals for aromatic hydrogens in the ¹H NMR spectrum strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern. In a para-substituted ring, the four protons are chemically equivalent in two sets, leading to two distinct signals (often appearing as doublets). This aromatic core corresponds to a C₆H₄ unit.\n    *   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (-COO-), which contains a carbonyl (C=O) and a C-O bond. This group adds one carbon and two oxygen atoms to the molecule.\n    *   **Vinyl and Methyl Groups:** The ¹H NMR spectrum shows two vinyl-H signals (a doublet and a doublet of quartets). This splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split into a quartet by the -CH₃ and into a doublet by the other vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl proton is split only by its neighbor, appearing as a doublet. This fragment accounts for one vinyl C=C bond, two vinyl hydrogens, and one of the two methyl groups mentioned. This propenyl group has a formula of -C₃H₅.\n    *   **Second Methyl Group:** The spectrum shows a second signal for a –CH₃ group. Since there are no –CH₂ signals, this methyl group cannot be part of a larger alkyl chain like an ethyl group. Given the presence of an ester, this second methyl is most likely part of a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate group (-OCOCH₃). In either case, it's a -CH₃ group.\n    *   **No Methylene Groups:** The explicit absence of –CH₂ signals is crucial, as it rules out isomers containing ethyl, propyl, or other alkyl chains with methylene units. For example, ethyl cinnamate (C₁₁H₁₂O₂) is an isomer but would show -CH₂ signals.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula:**\n    *   **Carbon atoms:** 6 (from the C₆H₄ ring) + 1 (from the -COO- ester carbonyl) + 3 (from the C₃H₅ propenyl group) + 1 (from the second CH₃ group) = 11 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Hydrogen atoms:** 4 (from the C₆H₄ ring) + 5 (from the -C₃H₅ propenyl group) + 3 (from the second -CH₃ group) = 12 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Oxygen atoms:** 2 (from the -COO- ester group).\n\n    Combining these parts gives a molecular formula of **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. A potential structure fitting this data is methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate.\n\n3.  **Verify with Other Options:**\n    *   **C₁₁H₁₄O₂:** This formula would have fewer double bonds or rings than indicated by the NMR (vinyl protons require a C=C bond in addition to the aromatic ring). This option is incorrect.\n    *   **C₁₂H₁₂O₂ and C₁₂H₁₄O₂:** These formulas contain an additional carbon atom. To accommodate this and the NMR data, C₁₂H₁₄O₂ would need a -CH₂- group, which is explicitly ruled out. C₁₂H₁₂O₂ would require an additional degree of unsaturation (like another double bond or ring) which is not suggested by the provided data.\n\nTherefore, the spectral data uniquely and consistently point to the molecular formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<C>>>"
