    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the chemistry problem:\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe mixture of gases produced by heating the salts was passed through three tubes, and the mass changes were recorded. This allows us to identify the components of the gas mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds directly to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.015 g/mol ≈ **0.2 mol H₂O**\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which is used to detect acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂). Since the weight of this tube did not change, no acidic gases were produced during the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The mass increase of the tube is due to the oxygen atoms bonding with the copper to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). Therefore, the mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol O\n    *   Since oxygen exists as O₂ molecules, the moles of oxygen gas are:\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol O / 2 = **0.025 mol O₂**\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** The gas that remained after passing through all three tubes had a volume of 2.24 liters at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.1 mol Gas C**\n    *   This remaining gas did not react with a drying agent, a base, or hot copper. The most likely candidate for a gas produced from nitrogen-containing salts is the inert nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n### **2. Verification with Mass Conservation**\n\nLet's check if the mass of the products equals the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g).\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.025 mol × 32.00 g/mol = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ (assuming Gas C is N₂) = 0.1 mol × 28.02 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   **Total Mass of Products** = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = **7.20 g**\n\nThe total mass of the gaseous products perfectly matches the initial mass of the salt mixture. This confirms our identification of the products and their quantities: 0.2 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.1 mol N₂.\n\n### **3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe gaseous products contain Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen. This means the original salts must be composed of these elements. Since they are salts, they consist of a cation and an anion. Common ions formed from these elements are the ammonium cation (NH₄⁺) and the nitrite (NO₂⁻) and nitrate (NO₃⁻) anions. This strongly suggests that the salts are ammonium-based.\n\nLet's consider the decomposition of **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) **and **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n*   **Reaction 1:** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Reaction 2:** 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\nThe problem states the initial mixture was **equimolar**. Let 'n' be the number of moles for both salt A and salt B.\n*   Moles of A = n\n*   Moles of B = n\n\nBased on the stoichiometry of the reactions above, we can express the moles of each product in terms of 'n':\n*   **Total N₂ produced:** n (from NH₄NO₂) + n (from NH₄NO₃) = 2n\n*   **Total H₂O produced:** 2n (from NH₄NO₂) + 2n (from NH₄NO₃) = 4n\n*   **Total O₂ produced:** 0 (from NH₄NO₂) + n/2 (from NH₄NO₃) = n/2\n\nNow, we equate these with the moles calculated from the experimental results:\n*   Total N₂: 2n = 0.1 mol  =>  **n = 0.05 mol**\n*   Total H₂O: 4n = 0.2 mol  =>  **n = 0.05 mol**\n*   Total O₂: n/2 = 0.025 mol => **n = 0.05 mol**\n\nThe value of **n = 0.05 mol** is consistent for all three products, which strongly confirms that the salts are indeed Ammonium Nitrite and Ammonium Nitrate.\n\n### **4. Final Calculation: Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to calculate the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite - NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2\n    *   **Total atoms in A = 8**\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate - NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3\n    *   **Total atoms in B = 9**\n\n*   **Total atoms in salts A and B combined:** 8 + 9 = **17**\n\nThe total number of atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<B>>>"
