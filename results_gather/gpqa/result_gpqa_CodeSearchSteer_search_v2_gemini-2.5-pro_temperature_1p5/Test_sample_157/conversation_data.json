    "A dominant-negative mutation results in an altered protein that not only is nonfunctional but also interferes with the function of the wild-type protein produced by the other allele. In the case of a transcription factor that must dimerize to function, a dominant-negative effect often arises when the mutant subunit can still interact with the wild-type subunit, forming a non-functional or \"poisoned\" dimer complex.\n\nLet's analyze the options in the context of mutation Y in the dimerization domain:\n\n*   **A) loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype:** This is incorrect. If the mutant protein simply failed to dimerize, it would likely not interfere with the wild-type subunits, which could still form functional dimers. This scenario would lead to a recessive loss-of-function, not a dominant-negative phenotype.\n*   **B) protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele:** While degradation can be a consequence of some mutations, it is not the defining mechanism of a dominant-negative effect. The core of the dominant-negative mechanism is the interference with the wild-type protein's function.\n*   **C) change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype:** This is incorrect. A dominant-negative mutation, by definition, leads to a loss-of-function phenotype, as it inhibits the activity of the wild-type protein.\n*   **D) protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype:** This is a very plausible molecular mechanism for a dominant-negative effect. A mutation in the dimerization domain can cause the protein to misfold. These misfolded mutant proteins can then form aggregates, trapping or sequestering the functional, wild-type proteins within these non-functional clumps. This sequestration effectively removes the wild-type protein from the pool available for proper dimerization and gene transcription, leading to a dominant-negative loss-of-function phenotype. Several diseases are caused by mutations in dimerization domains that lead to pathological protein aggregation.\n\nTherefore, the most likely molecular phenotype is protein aggregation that traps the wild-type protein, resulting in a loss of function.\n\n<<<D>>>"
