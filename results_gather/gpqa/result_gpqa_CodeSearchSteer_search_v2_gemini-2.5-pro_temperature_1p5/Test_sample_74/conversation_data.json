    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the provided DNA sequence and determine why it fails to produce the expected protein.\n\n1.  **Analyze the N-terminus and HA Tag:** The construct is designed to have an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus of the GADD45G protein. The N-terminus of a protein is encoded by the 5' end of the mRNA (and the corresponding DNA strand). The standard amino acid sequence for an HA tag is YPYDVPDYA. The DNA sequence provided starts with `5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC...`. Let's translate this initial segment:\n    *   **ATG:** This is the universal start codon, which codes for Methionine (M). Translation begins here, setting the reading frame.\n    *   **TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC:** This sequence translates to Tyrosine (Y), Proline (P), Tyrosine (Y), Aspartic Acid (D), Valine (V), Proline (P), Aspartic Acid (D), Tyrosine (Y), and Alanine (A).\n    *   Therefore, the translated protein starts with `M-YPYDVPDYA...`. This correctly encodes the start codon followed by the HA tag sequence. This means option (A) is incorrect, as there is no missense mutation in the antigenic determinant.\n\n2.  **Look for Subsequent Codons:** Let's examine the DNA sequence immediately following the HA tag's coding sequence (`...TAC GCC`).\n    *   The sequence continues: `...AAATGA...`\n    *   The next codon in the reading frame is **AAA**, which codes for the amino acid Lysine (K).\n    *   The codon immediately after that is **TGA**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Problem:** In the standard genetic code, there are three stop codons that signal the termination of translation: UAA, UAG, and UGA (in mRNA, which corresponds to TAA, TAG, and TGA in the DNA coding strand). The presence of the **TGA** codon in the reading frame acts as a \"stop\" signal for the ribosome.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Consequences:** Because of this premature stop codon, the ribosome will detach from the mRNA after translating only the HA tag and a single lysine residue. The full-length GADD45G protein will not be synthesized. This directly explains the inability to detect the overexpressed protein.\n\n5.  **Assess the Options:**\n    *   A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation: This is incorrect; the HA tag sequence is translated correctly.\n    *   B) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain: While a linker can be important, the primary issue is that the full protein is not being made in the first place, not that it is being degraded after synthesis.\n    *   C) The ribosome terminated the translation early: This is correct. The TGA stop codon immediately after the tag sequence (and one additional amino acid) causes premature termination of translation.\n    *   D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse: This statement is incorrect for two reasons. First, stop codons are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs. Second, the premature stop codon in the sequence is TGA, not TAA.\n\n<<<C>>>"
