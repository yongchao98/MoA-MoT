    "To find the energy spectrum for the given potential, we first express the potential in Cartesian coordinates.\n\nThe potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ) as:\nV(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr²cos²(θ)\n\nThe transformation from polar to Cartesian coordinates is:\nx = r cos(θ)\ny = r sin(θ)\nr² = x² + y²\n\nSubstituting these into the potential energy equation:\nV(x, y) = (1/2)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)k(x²)\nV(x, y) = (1/2)kx² + (1/2)ky² + (3/2)kx²\nV(x, y) = (4/2)kx² + (1/2)ky²\nV(x, y) = 2kx² + (1/2)ky²\n\nThis potential represents a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. The potential is separable into two independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators, one in the x-direction and one in the y-direction.\n\nThe potential for a 1D harmonic oscillator is V(q) = (1/2)mω²q². By comparing this with the terms in our potential, we can find the angular frequencies ω_x and ω_y.\n\nFor the x-direction:\n(1/2)mω_x²x² = 2kx²\nω_x² = 4k/m\nω_x = 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n\nFor the y-direction:\n(1/2)mω_y²y² = (1/2)ky²\nω_y² = k/m\nω_y = sqrt(k/m)\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator are given by E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω. Since the potential is separable, the total energy is the sum of the energies for the independent oscillators in the x and y directions.\n\nE(n_x, n_y) = E_x + E_y\nE(n_x, n_y) = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x + (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for ω_x and ω_y:\nE(n_x, n_y) = (n_x + 1/2)ħ(2 * sqrt(k/m)) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ(sqrt(k/m))\n\nFactoring out the common term ħ * sqrt(k/m):\nE(n_x, n_y) = ħ * sqrt(k/m) * [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)]\nE(n_x, n_y) = ħ * sqrt(k/m) * [2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2]\nE(n_x, n_y) = ħ * sqrt(k/m) * (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)\n\nComparing this result with the given options, we find that it matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
