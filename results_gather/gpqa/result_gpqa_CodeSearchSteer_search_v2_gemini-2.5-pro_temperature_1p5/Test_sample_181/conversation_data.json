    "The Mott-Gurney equation describes current under specific idealized conditions. Analyzing the options based on the fundamental assumptions of the model reveals the correct statement.\n\nKey assumptions for the Mott-Gurney Law include:\n*   **Single-Carrier Device:** The current is assumed to be carried by only one type of charge carrier (either electrons or holes).\n*   **Trap-Free:** The standard equation is derived for a material without charge traps in the bandgap. If traps are present, the current-voltage relationship is altered.\n*   **Ohmic/Injecting Contact:** The model requires an Ohmic contact that can act as a perfect reservoir of charges, meaning it presents no energy barrier to carrier injection. A Schottky contact, which has an injection barrier, would lead to injection-limited current rather than space-charge-limited current.\n*   **Drift-Dominated Current:** A crucial assumption in the derivation is that the current is dominated by the drift of carriers in the electric field, and that the diffusion component of the current is negligible. This condition is met at sufficiently high applied voltages.\n\nLet's evaluate the given statements:\n*   **A) Negligible drift current:** This is incorrect. The Mott-Gurney law describes a current that is *dominated* by drift.\n*   **B) No carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current:** This statement aligns perfectly with the core assumptions. \"No carrier injection barrier\" is equivalent to a perfect Ohmic contact, and \"negligible diffusion current\" is a fundamental part of the derivation. The device must also be trap-free and single-carrier.\n*   **C) Two-carrier device:** This is incorrect. The model is specifically for single-carrier (unipolar) injection.\n*   **D) Schottky contact:** This is incorrect. A Schottky contact implies an injection barrier, which violates the assumption of a perfect, charge-injecting (Ohmic) contact.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement describing the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
