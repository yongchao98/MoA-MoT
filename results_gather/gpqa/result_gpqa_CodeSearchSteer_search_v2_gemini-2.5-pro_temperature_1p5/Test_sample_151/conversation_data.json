    "In the described experiment, a quorum-sensing peptide from *Lactobacillus acidophilus* induces shmoo formation in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. This process involves the arrest of the yeast cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle to prepare for mating. The assay aims to identify the proteome of *active chromatin* in these shmoo-forming cells. Active chromatin is characterized by ongoing or poised gene transcription.\n\nBased on the function of each complex in a G1-arrested, transcriptionally active cell:\n\n*   **A) Enhancer protein complex:** Enhancers and their associated proteins are crucial for activating gene expression, a key feature of the shmoo response. Therefore, these complexes would be abundant on active chromatin.\n*   **B) Pre-initiation complex (PIC):** The PIC, which includes RNA polymerase II and general transcription factors, assembles on promoters to initiate transcription. Since shmoo formation requires changes in gene expression, PICs are expected to be present and active. In yeast, the PIC assembles near the +1 nucleosome, which often contains the histone variant H2A.Z and obstructs the transcription start site, indicating the PIC is required to evict it.\n*   **D) Nucleosome histone complex:** Nucleosomes are the fundamental structural units of all chromatin, whether active or inactive. They would be abundantly recovered in any chromatin immunoprecipitation assay.\n\nThe complex that would be least observed is:\n\n*   **C) Pre-replication complex (pre-RC):** The pre-RC assembles on origins of replication during the G1 phase to license them for DNA synthesis, which occurs in the S phase. While these complexes are assembled during G1, the pheromone-induced shmoo formation *arrests* the cell cycle in G1, preventing entry into S phase. The cell's molecular machinery is dedicated to transcription for mating and polarization, not the initiation of genome-wide DNA replication. The function of the pre-RC is therefore stalled. Although some studies have identified replication-independent functions for the pre-RC, its primary and most abundant role is licensing origins, a process not central to the active transcriptional response of shmoo formation. Thus, compared to complexes directly involved in transcription (A and B) and the basic building block of chromatin (D), the pre-replication complex is the least likely to be enriched in an assay specifically targeting the proteome of *active chromatin*.\n\n<<<C>>>"
