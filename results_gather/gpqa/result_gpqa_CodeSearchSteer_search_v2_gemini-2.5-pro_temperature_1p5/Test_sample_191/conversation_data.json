    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the electric field at point P:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** The positive charge `+q` placed inside the cavity induces an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the cavity. Therefore, a charge of `-q` is induced on the wall of the spherical cavity.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Charge:** The spherical conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral). To maintain its overall neutrality, a charge of `+q` must appear somewhere else on the conductor. In a conductor, charges are free to move and will reside on the surface. Thus, a charge of `+q` is induced on the *outer surface* of the spherical conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** The conductor acts as an electrostatic shield. The electric field inside the conducting material is zero. For any point outside the conductor, the electric field is solely determined by the charge distribution on the outer surface. The arrangement of the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface has no net effect on the electric field outside the conductor.\n\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** Due to the spherical symmetry of the outer surface of the conductor, the induced charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over this surface. This happens regardless of the shape or position of the cavity inside.\n\n5.  **Electric Field Outside a Uniformly Charged Sphere:** According to Gauss's Law (and the Shell Theorem), the electric field at any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at a single point at its center.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** In this problem, the total charge on the outer surface is `+q`, and it is distributed uniformly on a sphere of radius `R` centered at the conductor's center. The point P is at a distance `L` from the center of the conductor. Therefore, the electric field at P is equivalent to that of a point charge `+q` located at the center of the spherical conductor.\n\nThe magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by Coulomb's law:\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThis means the distances `l`, `r`, `s` and the angle `Î¸` are not needed to determine the field outside the conductor. They are provided to test the understanding of electrostatic shielding.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
