    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dicarboxylic Acid Anhydride:** A *cis*-dicarboxylic acid was dehydrated to form an anhydride.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum shows a single peak at 7 ppm, indicating all protons are chemically equivalent and are in the alkene region.\n    *   The ¹³C NMR spectrum has two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons).\n    *   This data is characteristic of **maleic anhydride** (C₄H₂O₃). Due to its C₂v symmetry, it has only one type of proton and two types of carbons, matching the spectral data.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   This is a cyclopentadiene ring where the four hydrogens on the double-bonded carbons (C1, C2, C3, C4) are replaced by methyl groups. The C5 position remains a CH₂ group.\n    *   The molecular formula is C₉H₁₄.\n\n### **Step 2: The Reaction and Its Products**\n\n*   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n*   The molecular formula of the product is C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃ = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**, which matches the information given.\n*   This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative. It can produce two diastereomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   The **endo product is typically the major product** due to favorable secondary orbital interactions during the transition state.\n    *   The **exo product is the minor product**.\n\n### **Step 3: Structure and ¹H NMR Signal Assignment of the Products**\n\nLet's analyze the expected proton signals for the product:\n*   **Vinylic Methyls (6H):** The double bond in the product is between the original C2 and C3 of the diene. The two methyl groups on these carbons become vinylic. They are equivalent due to a plane of symmetry and should appear as a 6H singlet around 1.7–2.0 ppm.\n*   **Bridgehead Methyls (6H):** The methyl groups on the original C1 and C4 of the diene are now on saturated bridgehead carbons. They are also equivalent and should appear as a 6H singlet at a higher field, around 1.0–1.5 ppm.\n*   **Anhydride Protons (2H):** The two protons on the carbons from the maleic anhydride (let's call them H-anhydride) are equivalent. They should appear as a 2H singlet, likely deshielded by the anhydride group, around 3.5 ppm.\n*   **Methylene Bridge Protons (2H):** The two protons of the CH₂ group (C7 bridge) are diastereotopic (one *syn* to the double bond, one *anti*). They are expected to be non-equivalent and appear as two separate signals, likely doublets due to coupling with each other. A chemical shift of ~1.5 ppm is reasonable for one of these protons.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the NOESY Spectra to Distinguish *Endo* and *Exo* Products**\n\nNOESY spectroscopy detects protons that are close in space (< 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of two such protons. The problem states a specific cross-peak is present in the major product but absent or weak in the minor one.\n\n*   **Endo Adduct (Major Product):** In the *endo* configuration, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) with respect to the C7 methylene bridge. In this arrangement, the **H-anhydride protons** (on C5/C6) are far from the vinylic methyl groups but are relatively close to the *syn* proton of the C7-CH₂ bridge and also relatively close to the bridgehead methyl groups. However, a defining feature often used to distinguish endo/exo isomers is the interaction between protons on the dienophile part and protons on the diene part. Specifically, in the *endo* adduct, the **H-anhydride protons (at ~3.5 ppm) are spatially close to the vinylic methyl groups (at ~1.7 ppm)**.\n\n*   **Exo Adduct (Minor Product):** In the *exo* configuration, the anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the C7 bridge. This moves the H-anhydride protons away from the vinylic methyl groups, making their NOE interaction absent or very weak. Instead, in the exo-adduct, the H-anhydride protons become closer to the bridgehead methyl groups.\n\n### **Step 5: Correlate NOESY Data with the Options**\n\nWe are looking for a NOESY cross-peak present in the major (*endo*) product but absent in the minor (*exo*) product. This corresponds to an interaction unique or much stronger in the *endo* isomer. The key spatial proximity in the *endo* adduct that is lost in the *exo* adduct is between the anhydride protons and the substituents on the newly formed double bond.\n\nLet's re-examine the options based on our assignments:\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (**Bridgehead Methyls**) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (**Vinylic Methyls**). These two sets of methyl groups are relatively far apart in both isomers.\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (**Bridgehead Methyls**) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (**C7 Bridge Proton**). This interaction might exist but is not the most distinctive difference between the isomers.\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (**Vinylic Methyls**) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (**H-anhydride**). As determined above, the H-anhydride protons are close to the vinylic methyl groups in the major *endo* product, but far from them in the minor *exo* product. This matches the problem description perfectly.\n*   D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (**C7 Bridge Proton**) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (**H-anhydride**). These protons would be closer in the *exo* adduct, which is the minor product.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak that is present in the major product's spectrum and absent in the minor product's spectrum connects the vinylic methyls and the anhydride protons.\n\n<<<C>>>"
