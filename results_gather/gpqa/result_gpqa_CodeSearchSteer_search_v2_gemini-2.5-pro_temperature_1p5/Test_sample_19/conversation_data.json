    "The impulse approximation is a foundational concept in many-body nuclear physics that simplifies calculations of interactions with a nucleus. It posits that the complex interaction with the entire nucleus can be treated as a much simpler interaction with a single, quasi-free nucleon. For this approximation to be valid, a specific set of physical assumptions must be made.\n\nThe core assumptions that jointly define the impulse approximation are:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.** This is the \"one-body current\" assumption. It presumes that the incoming probe (e.g., a lepton or photon) interacts with just one nucleon at a time. Processes where the probe interacts simultaneously with two or more nucleons, known as two-body currents or meson-exchange currents, are neglected.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.** This implies that the incoming probe does not interact with other nucleons on its way to the target nucleon, and the struck nucleon does not re-interact with the remaining nuclear system as it exits. The latter part, concerning the outgoing particle, is often called neglecting \"final-state interactions\". The simplest version of this is the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA), which treats the final state particle as a plane wave.\n\n3.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.** During the brief moment of the high-energy interaction, the forces binding the target nucleon to the rest of the nucleus are considered negligible compared to the interaction energy. This allows the interaction itself to be described as if it were happening to a free particle, even though the nucleon is in a bound state before the collision.\n\nThe third statement in the prompt, regarding non-relativistic quarks, is not a defining feature of the impulse approximation. The impulse approximation treats the *nucleon* as the fundamental particle of the interaction, regardless of the internal dynamics of its constituent quarks. Both free and bound nucleons are understood to have a complex internal structure with relativistic quarks. This assumption relates to a different level of modeling (the constituent quark model) and not to the impulse approximation itself, which concerns the behavior of nucleons within the nucleus.\n\nTherefore, the three assumptions that collectively imply the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
