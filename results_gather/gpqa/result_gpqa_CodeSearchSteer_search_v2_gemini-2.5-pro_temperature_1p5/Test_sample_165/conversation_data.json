    "The provided question asks for the one-loop radiative correction to the mass squared of a pseudo-Goldstone boson, $H_2$, in a specific extension of the Standard Model. The calculation of such radiative corrections is famously described by the Coleman-Weinberg potential.\n\nA key principle of one-loop mass calculations is the relative sign between fermion and boson loops. Quantum loop corrections to a scalar's mass-squared from other particles are summed up, with contributions from bosons being positive and contributions from fermions being negative. This is a result of the spin-statistics theorem, which leads to a minus sign for fermion loops in calculations.\n\nThe general formula for the one-loop radiative mass squared ($M^2$) of a scalar is of the form:\n$M^2 \\approx \\frac{1}{V^2} \\sum_i C_i M_i^4$\nwhere $V$ is a vacuum expectation value (VEV) scale, $M_i$ are the masses of the particles running in the loop, and $C_i$ are coefficients which include a loop factor (like $1/8\\pi^2$ or $1/16\\pi^2$) and the crucial sign difference between particle types.\n\nLet's analyze the options based on these principles:\n*   The overall structure of the correct formula should have a denominator proportional to the square of the relevant VEVs, which in this model is given as `(x² + v²)`.\n*   The formula should sum the fourth power of the masses ($M_i^4$) of all heavy particles that couple to $H_2$.\n*   Contributions from all bosons (W, Z, and all scalars like $h_1$, $H^\\pm$, $H^0$, $A^0$) must have the same sign (positive).\n*   Contributions from all fermions (top quark `t` and the new singlet neutrinos $N_i$) must have the opposite sign (negative).\n\nNow, let's examine the choices:\n*   **A)** This option has `(x² + v²)` in the numerator, which is dimensionally incorrect for a mass-squared term calculated from radiative corrections. The correct formula should be inversely proportional to the VEV-squared.\n*   **B)** This option correctly places `(x² + v²)` in the denominator. It includes positive contributions from all the listed bosons ($h_1$, W, Z, $H^\\pm$, $H^0$, $A^0$) and negative contributions from both the top quark (`t`) and the new heavy neutrinos ($N_i$). This sign structure is consistent with the established theory of radiative corrections.\n*   **C)** This option is missing the contribution from the top quark (`- α₄Mₜ⁴`). The top quark is the heaviest Standard Model particle and its coupling to the Higgs sector is large, so its contribution to the radiative mass of other scalars cannot be neglected.\n*   **D)** This option is missing the contribution from the CP-odd scalar $A^0$. In a general extension with multiple scalar doublets, a CP-odd neutral scalar is expected to exist, and it would contribute to the loop corrections. Option B is more general and complete by including it.\n\nBased on this analysis, option B presents the most physically complete and correct formula for the radiative mass squared of the pseudo-Goldstone boson in this model. It correctly accounts for the dimensional analysis (VEVs in the denominator) and the relative signs between boson and fermion loops.\n\n<<<B>>>"
