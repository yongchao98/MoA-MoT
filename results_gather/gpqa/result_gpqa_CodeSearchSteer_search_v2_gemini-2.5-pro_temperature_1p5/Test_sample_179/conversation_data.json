    "To determine the minimum energy of the system, we must calculate the total electrostatic potential energy. The system consists of two parts for which we need to calculate the potential energy:\n1.  The interaction between the central charge (`Q_c`) and the 12 charges on the sphere (`U_center_shell`).\n2.  The interaction among the 12 charges on the surface of the sphere (`U_shell_shell`).\n\nThe total minimum energy is the sum of these two components: `E_total = U_center_shell + U_shell_shell`.\n\n**Given values:**\n*   Charge of each particle, `q = 2e`, where `e` is the elementary charge, approximately `1.602 x 10^-19` C. So, `q = 3.204 x 10^-19` C.\n*   Radius of the sphere, `R = 2` m.\n*   Coulomb's constant, `k ≈ 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C²`.\n\n**1. Potential Energy between the Central Charge and the Shell Charges (`U_center_shell`)**\n\nThe central charge is `Q_c = 2e`, and there are 12 charges `q_i = 2e` on the sphere. The distance between the central charge and each of the 12 charges is the radius of the sphere, `R`.\n\nThe potential energy of interaction between the central charge and a single charge on the sphere is:\n`U_single = k * Q_c * q_i / R = k * (2e) * (2e) / R = 4 * k * e^2 / R`\n\nSince there are 12 such identical charges, the total potential energy for this part is:\n`U_center_shell = 12 * U_single = 12 * (4 * k * e^2 / R) = 48 * k * e^2 / R`\n\nLet's calculate this value:\n`U_center_shell = 48 * (8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C²) * (1.602 x 10^-19 C)² / 2 m`\n`U_center_shell = 24 * (8.988 x 10^9) * (2.5664 x 10^-38) J`\n`U_center_shell ≈ 5.537 x 10^-27 J`\n\n**2. Potential Energy among the 12 Shell Charges (`U_shell_shell`)**\n\nFor the system to have minimum energy, the 12 charges on the surface of the sphere must arrange themselves in a configuration that maximizes their separation. This is a well-known problem called the Thomson problem, and for 12 charges, the solution is that they are located at the vertices of a regular icosahedron inscribed in the sphere.\n\nThe total potential energy of this subsystem is the sum of the potential energies for all unique pairs of charges. There are `12 * 11 / 2 = 66` such pairs.\n`U_shell_shell = Σ_{i<j} k * q_i * q_j / r_ij`\nSince all charges are identical (`q = 2e`), this simplifies to:\n`U_shell_shell = k * (2e)² * Σ_{i<j} (1/r_ij) = 4 * k * e² * Σ_{i<j} (1/r_ij)`\n\nTo calculate the sum of the inverse distances, we need to know the distances between the vertices of the icosahedron. For an icosahedron, there are three distinct distances between any two vertices:\n*   The distance to the 5 adjacent vertices (the edge length of the icosahedron), `d1`.\n*   The distance to the 5 next-nearest vertices, `d2`.\n*   The distance to the 1 antipodal (opposite) vertex, `d3`.\n\nFor an icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius `R`:\n*   The edge length is `d1 = a = 2R / sqrt(1 + φ²)`, where `φ` is the golden ratio, `(1 + sqrt(5))/2 ≈ 1.618`.\n*   The distance to the next-nearest vertices is `d2 = a * φ`.\n*   The distance to the antipodal vertex is `d3 = 2R`.\n\nThe total number of pairs is 66. By considering the perspective of each of the 12 vertices, we have 5 adjacent, 5 next-nearest, and 1 antipodal vertex. Summing these and dividing by 2 (to count each pair only once) gives:\n*   Number of pairs with distance `d1`: `12 * 5 / 2 = 30`.\n*   Number of pairs with distance `d2`: `12 * 5 / 2 = 30`.\n*   Number of pairs with distance `d3`: `12 * 1 / 2 = 6`.\n\nNow we calculate the distances for `R = 2 m`:\n`φ ≈ 1.618034`\n`φ² ≈ 2.618034`\n`d1 = a = (2 * 2) / sqrt(1 + 2.618034) = 4 / sqrt(3.618034) ≈ 4 / 1.90211 ≈ 2.103 m`\n`d2 = a * φ ≈ 2.103 * 1.618 ≈ 3.403 m`\n`d3 = 2 * R = 4 m`\n\nNow we calculate `U_shell_shell`:\n`Σ_{i<j} (1/r_ij) = 30/d1 + 30/d2 + 6/d3`\n`Σ_{i<j} (1/r_ij) ≈ 30/2.103 + 30/3.403 + 6/4 ≈ 14.265 + 8.816 + 1.5 ≈ 24.581 m⁻¹`\n\n`U_shell_shell = 4 * k * e² * (24.581 m⁻¹) `\n`U_shell_shell ≈ 4 * (8.988 x 10^9) * (1.602 x 10^-19)² * (24.581)`\n`U_shell_shell ≈ 4 * (2.307 x 10^-28 J·m) * (24.581 m⁻¹) `\n`U_shell_shell ≈ 2.268 x 10^-26 J`\n\n**3. Total Minimum Energy (`E_total`)**\n\n`E_total = U_center_shell + U_shell_shell`\n`E_total ≈ (5.537 x 10^-27 J) + (2.268 x 10^-26 J)`\n`E_total ≈ (0.5537 x 10^-26 J) + (2.268 x 10^-26 J)`\n`E_total ≈ 2.8217 x 10^-26 J`\n\nRounding to three decimal places, the minimum energy is `2.822 x 10^-26 J`.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
