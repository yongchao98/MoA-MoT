    "Here is the step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product and the number of its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of a Reactive Intermediate**\n\nThe reaction begins by combining 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene with 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide. The key transformation in this step is the reaction between 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide. This specific reaction is known in organic synthesis to produce **semibullvalene** (C₈H₈), a complex and highly fluxional molecule.\n\n**Step 2: Cycloaddition to form Product 1**\n\nSemibullvalene, formed in situ, undergoes a cycloaddition reaction with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. The norbornadiene acts as a scaffold, reacting with two molecules of semibullvalene. This forms a large, polycyclic cage molecule, **Product 1**. Norbornadiene is a well-known dienophile in Diels-Alder reactions, though the exact nature of its cycloaddition with semibullvalene is complex.\n\n**Step 3: Deprotection to form Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid. The acidic conditions cleave the tert-butyl ether protecting group at the C7 position of the norbornadiene core, converting it into a hydroxyl (-OH) group. This results in the formation of **Product 2**, the alcohol analog of Product 1.\n\n**Step 4: Oxidation to form Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 is then treated with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO. This combination of reagents is known as the Parikh-Doering oxidation, which is a mild method for oxidizing secondary alcohols to ketones. The hydroxyl group in Product 2 is oxidized to a carbonyl group (C=O), yielding **Product 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Thermal Decomposition to form Final Product 4**\n\nFinally, Product 3 is heated to 150°C. This temperature induces a retro-cycloaddition reaction. The bonds formed in Step 2 break, causing the large cage molecule to fragment. This releases the original cycloaddition components:\n*   Two molecules of **semibullvalene**.\n*   One molecule of the scaffold, which is now bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one.\n\nThe bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one intermediate is known to be thermally unstable and readily undergoes a cheletropic extrusion, losing a molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) to form the highly stable aromatic molecule, benzene.\n\nThe final stable organic products of the reaction are therefore benzene and semibullvalene. Given the context of the problem and the answer choices, the \"final product 4\" refers to **semibullvalene**, a stable, isolable C₈H₈ hydrocarbon.\n\n**Determining the Number of Chemically Distinct Hydrogens in Product 4**\n\nProduct 4 is semibullvalene, which has the chemical structure tricyclo[3.3.0.0²﹐⁸]octa-3,6-diene.\n*   **Symmetry:** In its static form, semibullvalene possesses C₂ᵥ symmetry. This symmetry means that certain hydrogen atoms are in identical chemical environments.\n*   **Analysis of Protons:** Due to the C₂ᵥ symmetry, the 8 hydrogen atoms are partitioned into four distinct sets of two equivalent protons each. These sets are:\n    1.  The two allylic bridgehead protons {H1, H5}.\n    2.  The two cyclopropyl protons {H2, H8}.\n    3.  A pair of vinylic protons {H3, H7}.\n    4.  Another pair of vinylic protons {H4, H6}.\n\nEven though semibullvalene undergoes a rapid degenerate Cope rearrangement, the ¹H NMR spectrum at room temperature displays four distinct signals, corresponding to these four sets of protons. Therefore, semibullvalene has 4 chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
