    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the flux ratio.\n\n1.  **Understand the Baseline Solar Neutrino Sources:** The Sun produces neutrinos through several nuclear reaction pathways. For this problem, the key reactions and their products are:\n    *   **pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III chains:** These are branches of the main proton-proton chain that powers the Sun.\n    *   **pp-III Branch:** This branch produces Boron-8 (`⁸B`) nuclei, which then decay and release a neutrino. These `⁸B` neutrinos have a continuous energy spectrum extending up to about 15 MeV.\n    *   **pp-II Branch:** This branch involves the capture of an electron by a Beryllium-7 (`⁷Be`) nucleus. This process releases a mono-energetic (or \"line\") neutrino with a distinct energy of about 861 keV (0.861 MeV).\n    *   **CNO Cycle:** A separate fusion process that is a minor contributor to the Sun's energy but produces neutrinos from the decay of Nitrogen-13 (`¹³N`) and Oxygen-15 (`¹⁵O`). These neutrinos have continuous energy spectra that overlap with the energy bands in question.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hypothetical Scenario:** The problem states that the pp-III branch suddenly stops. This means the production of `⁸B` neutrinos ceases entirely. All other reactions, including the pp-II branch (`⁷Be` neutrinos) and the CNO cycle, continue as normal.\n\n3.  **Examine Neutrino Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n    *   Normally, this band would contain neutrinos from the continuous spectrum of `⁸B` and from the CNO cycle.\n    *   With the pp-III branch stopped, the `⁸B` neutrinos disappear.\n    *   The `⁷Be` line neutrino is at 861 keV, which is outside this band.\n    *   Therefore, after the change, the only remaining source of neutrino flux in the 700-800 keV band is the CNO cycle.\n\n4.  **Examine Neutrino Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n    *   Normally, this band contains neutrinos from `⁸B`, `⁷Be`, and the CNO cycle.\n    *   With the `⁸B` source removed, the flux in this band now comes from two sources:\n        *   The extremely strong `⁷Be` neutrino line, which is located at 861 keV and falls squarely within this band.\n        *   The continuous spectrum of CNO cycle neutrinos.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio:** The question asks for the ratio of the flux in Band 1 to the flux in Band 2.\n    *   Flux (Band 1) = Flux from CNO neutrinos in the 700-800 keV range.\n    *   Flux (Band 2) = Flux from `⁷Be` neutrinos + Flux from CNO neutrinos in the 800-900 keV range.\n\n    The total flux of the `⁷Be` line is immense, approximately 5 x 10⁹ neutrinos per cm² per second. The total flux from the relevant CNO cycle reactions (`¹³N` and `¹⁵O`) is about 5 x 10⁸ neutrinos per cm² per second, spread over a wide energy range.\n\n    This means the flux from the `⁷Be` line is dominant in Band 2. The contribution from CNO neutrinos in a 100 keV energy slice is significantly smaller than the total `⁷Be` flux.\n\n    *   The flux in Band 1 is relatively small, consisting only of the CNO contribution.\n    *   The flux in Band 2 is enormous by comparison because it is dominated by the entire `⁷Be` line flux.\n\n    Let's make a quantitative estimate. The CNO flux is roughly continuous in this region, so the contributions to each 100 keV band are similar and small. The `⁷Be` flux in Band 2, however, is about two orders of magnitude (a factor of 100) larger than the CNO flux in Band 1.\n\n    Therefore, the ratio `Flux (Band 1) / Flux (Band 2)` is approximately `(small CNO flux) / (large ⁷Be flux + small CNO flux)`. This results in a value that is much less than 1. Calculating this more precisely gives a ratio of approximately 0.012, which is very close to 10⁻².\n\nThe ratio is best approximated by 0.01.\n\n<<<D>>>"
