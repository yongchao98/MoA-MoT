    "The physics of a relativistic harmonic oscillator is governed by the conservation of total relativistic energy. The total energy E is the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy, the potential energy, and the rest mass energy.\n\nThe total energy can be expressed as:\nE = γmc² + U(x)\nwhere:\n*   γ is the Lorentz factor, γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n*   m is the rest mass of the oscillator\n*   c is the speed of light\n*   v is the speed of the oscillator\n*   U(x) is the potential energy, which for a harmonic oscillator is U(x) = (1/2)kx²\n\nThe total energy of the system remains constant throughout the oscillation. We can equate the total energy at two critical points in the oscillation: the point of maximum displacement and the equilibrium position.\n\n1.  **At maximum displacement (x = A):**\n    The oscillator is momentarily at rest, so its velocity v = 0. This makes the Lorentz factor γ = 1. The potential energy is at its maximum, U(A) = (1/2)kA².\n    The total energy at this point is:\n    E_total = (1)mc² + (1/2)kA² = mc² + (1/2)kA²\n\n2.  **At the equilibrium position (x = 0):**\n    The potential energy is zero, U(0) = 0. The speed of the oscillator is at its maximum, v = v_max. The Lorentz factor is therefore at its maximum, γ_max = 1 / √(1 - v_max²/c²).\n    The total energy at this point is:\n    E_total = γ_max * mc² + 0 = γ_max * mc²\n\nBy the principle of conservation of energy, the total energy at both points must be equal:\nγ_max * mc² = mc² + (1/2)kA²\n\nNow, we can solve for v_max. First, solve for γ_max by dividing by mc²:\nγ_max = 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²)\n\nNext, we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to solve for v_max:\nγ_max = 1 / √(1 - v_max²/c²)\n\nRearranging this equation gives:\nv_max²/c² = 1 - 1/γ_max²\n\nSubstitute the expression for γ_max that we found:\nv_max²/c² = 1 - 1 / (1 + (kA²)/(2mc²))²\n\nFinally, taking the square root and multiplying by c gives the maximum speed:\n$v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\nThis result corresponds to option C. As a check, in the non-relativistic limit where the potential energy is much smaller than the rest energy (kA² << mc²), this expression correctly reduces to the classical result, v_max = √(kA²/m).\n\n<<<C>>>"
