    "### Analysis of Tautomerism (A)\n\n**Benzoquinone:** For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have an α-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group). The structure of p-benzoquinone shows a six-membered ring with two ketone groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds. The carbon atoms that are part of the double bonds and are adjacent to the carbonyl groups do not have any hydrogen atoms attached; they are sp2-hybridized and bonded to other carbons in the ring. Therefore, p-benzoquinone lacks the necessary α-hydrogens and does not show tautomerism.\n\n**Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound possesses α-hydrogens on the carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6. Because of this, it can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is particularly stable because it is an aromatic compound. The presence of a stable aromatic enol form means that an equilibrium exists between the keto and enol forms.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Analysis of Optical Isomerism (B)\n\n**Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is a chiral center, a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The chemical name for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is methyl lactate. The second carbon atom in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is attached to four distinct groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). This carbon is a chiral center, meaning the molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism, existing as D and L isomers.\n\n**Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule is the trans-isomer of dimethyl butenedioate. It has a carbon-carbon double bond, and the structure is planar around this bond. Due to its symmetry (it possesses a center of inversion), it is achiral and cannot be optically active. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism. Its cis-isomer, dimethyl maleate, also has a plane of symmetry and is achiral.\n\nTherefore, the compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **(A)** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   **(B)** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
