    "To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ and the renormalizability of the theory, we first need to analyze the dimensions of each component of the interaction Lagrangian in four-dimensional spacetime.\n\nThe Lagrangian is given by:\n`L_int = κ * ψ̄ * σ_μν * ψ * F^μν`\n\nIn natural units (where ħ = c = 1), the action `S = ∫ d⁴x L` is dimensionless. Since the dimension of `d⁴x` is `[mass]⁻⁴`, the Lagrangian density `L` must have a mass dimension of 4.\n\nThe mass dimensions of the fields and operators are as follows:\n\n*   **Lagrangian density `[L]`:** As established, its mass dimension is 4.\n*   **Fermion field `[ψ]` and `[ψ̄]`:** The kinetic term for a Dirac fermion is `L_Dirac = ψ̄(iγ^μ∂_μ - m)ψ`. For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, the dimension of `ψ̄ψ` must be 3. Since `[ψ]` and `[ψ̄]` are equal, `2[ψ] = 3`, which gives `[ψ] = [ψ̄] = 3/2`.\n*   **Electromagnetic field strength tensor `[F^μν]`:** The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is `L_EM = -1/4 F_μν F^μν`. For this to have a dimension of 4, `2[F^μν]` must equal 4, so `[F^μν] = 2`.\n*   **Sigma tensor `[σ_μν]`:** The term `σ_μν = (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]` is constructed from the gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. Therefore, `σ_μν` is also dimensionless.\n\nNow, we can find the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ by ensuring the entire interaction Lagrangian term has a mass dimension of 4:\n`[L_int] = [κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ_μν] + [ψ] + [F^μν]`\n`4 = [κ] + 3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2`\n`4 = [κ] + 3 + 2`\n`4 = [κ] + 5`\n`[κ] = -1`\n\nThe mass dimension of κ is -1.\n\nNext, we assess the renormalizability of the theory. A key criterion for determining this is the mass dimension of the theory's coupling constants:\n*   If a coupling constant has a positive mass dimension, the theory is super-renormalizable.\n*   If a coupling constant is dimensionless (mass dimension 0), the theory is renormalizable.\n*   If a coupling constant has a negative mass dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable.\n\nSince the mass dimension of κ is -1, which is negative, the theory is non-renormalizable. This is because interactions with negative mass-dimension couplings become increasingly significant at higher energies, leading to divergences that cannot be absorbed by a finite number of counter-terms.\n\nTherefore, the mass dimension of κ is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable.\n\n<<<D>>>"
