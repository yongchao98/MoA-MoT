    "The reaction between an enol and bromine is a classic example of alpha-halogenation. In this type of reaction, the enol form of a carbonyl compound reacts with a halogen, like bromine (Br₂), to substitute a halogen atom for a hydrogen atom at the alpha-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n\nThe starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. Here, the double bond (\"-en\") and the hydroxyl group (\"-ol\") are both at carbon 1, defining it as an enol. The alpha-carbon is the other carbon of the double bond, C2.\n\nThe mechanism proceeds as follows:\n1.  The electron-rich double bond of the enol attacks the bromine molecule (Br₂).\n2.  A bromine atom adds to the alpha-carbon (C2).\n3.  The intermediate then loses a proton from the hydroxyl group, and the carbon-oxygen double bond (a carbonyl group) is formed.\n\nThis process results in the formation of a ketone with a bromine atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group. Applying this to the specific reactant:\n\n*   The starting five-membered ring with methyl groups at C4 remains intact.\n*   The enol at C1 becomes a ketone (a carbonyl group, C=O).\n*   A bromine atom is added to the alpha-carbon, which is C2.\n\nTherefore, the major product is 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.\n\nLet's examine the options:\n*   A) 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone: Incorrect. Halogenation occurs at the alpha-carbon (C2), not the remote, saturated C4.\n*   B) (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol: Incorrect. This suggests an addition reaction across the double bond while retaining the alcohol. The typical reaction for an enol is alpha-halogenation, leading to a ketone.\n*   C) 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone: Correct. This product results from the standard alpha-halogenation of the enol.\n*   D) (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol: Incorrect for the same reasons as B.\n\n<<<C>>>"
