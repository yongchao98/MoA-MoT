    "Based on the provided spectral data, the unknown compound is identified by analyzing the information from both FTIR and 1H NMR spectroscopy.\n\n### **Analysis of FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is a characteristic feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid dimer.\n*   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is indicative of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\nThis information confirms that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four possible options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this data confirms the functional group present but does not differentiate between the isomers.\n\n### **Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe key to identifying the correct structure lies in the complex splitting patterns described. A proton's signal is split into a specific pattern based on the number of non-equivalent protons on adjacent carbons. This is often referred to as spin-spin coupling.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This observation is consistent with all four proposed structures, as none contain carbon-carbon double bonds.\n*   **A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This complex splitting pattern arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: one proton on an adjacent carbon (giving a doublet), a set of two protons on another adjacent carbon (giving a triplet), and another distinct set of two protons on a third adjacent carbon (giving a second triplet).\n*   **A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This pattern occurs when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: one proton (causing a doublet), a group of two protons (causing a triplet), and a group of three protons (causing a quartet).\n\n### **Evaluation of Proposed Structures**\n\nLet's analyze the expected splitting patterns for the protons on the main chain of each candidate molecule.\n\n*   **A) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to one proton at C2 and two protons at C4, which would result in a doublet of triplets (dt).\n    *   The proton at C2 is coupled to one proton at C3, which would result in a doublet (d).\n    *   This structure does not produce the required `dtt` or `dtq` signals.\n\n*   **B) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *Let's analyze the proton `H(c)` at the C3 position: `CH3-CH(b)(Et)-CH(c)(Et)-CH2(d)-COOH`. This proton has three different adjacent carbons with protons: `CH(b)` (1 proton), `CH2(d)` (2 protons), and the `CH2` of the ethyl group attached to C3 (2 protons). This combination of neighbors (1H, 2H, 2H) will split the signal for `H(c)` into a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *Now let's analyze the proton `H(b)` at the C4 position: `CH3(a)-CH(b)(Et)-CH(c)(Et)-CH2-COOH`. This proton also has three different adjacent carbons with protons: `CH3(a)` (3 protons), `CH(c)` (1 proton), and the `CH2` of the ethyl group attached to C4 (2 protons). This combination of neighbors (3H, 1H, 2H) will split the signal for `H(b)` into a **quartet of doublets of triplets (qdt)**, which is the same multiplicity as a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *This structure is the only one that matches both complex splitting patterns described.\n\n*   **C) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at C3 has three neighboring sets of protons: the `CH2` of the main chain (2 protons), the proton at C2 (1 proton), and the `CH2` of the ethyl group on C3 (2 protons). This would indeed produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule is adjacent to sets of 1, 2, and 3 protons. For instance, the proton at C2 is adjacent to one proton (at C3) and two protons (on its ethyl group), giving a doublet of triplets (dt). Therefore, this structure lacks the required `dtq` signal.\n\n*   **D) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the proton at C4 (1H) and the `CH2` group at C2 (2H), which would give a doublet of triplets (dt).\n    *   The proton at C4 is coupled to the proton at C3 (1H) and the `CH3` group at C5 (3H), which would give a doublet of quartets (dq).\n    *   This structure does not produce the required `dtt` or `dtq` signals.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis, only structure B is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n<<<B>>>"
