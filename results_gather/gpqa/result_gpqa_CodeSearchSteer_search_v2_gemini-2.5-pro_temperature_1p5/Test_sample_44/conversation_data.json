    "Here is a step-by-step calculation for the energies of the system.\n\n### **Understanding the System**\n\n*   **Particles:** The system contains four identical spin-1/2 particles. Being spin-1/2 particles, they are fermions.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** As fermions, they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state is defined by all its quantum numbers, in this case, the energy level `n` and the spin `m_s`.\n*   **Potential Well:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The energy levels for a single particle in this potential are given by:\n    `E_n = n^2 * (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2mL^2)` where `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`\n*   **Energy Unit:** The problem defines the base energy unit as `E = (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2mL^2)`. Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as `E_n = n^2 * E`.\n*   **Spin States:** For each energy level `n`, there are two possible spin states (spin-up, `m_s = +1/2`, and spin-down, `m_s = -1/2`). This means each energy level `n` can hold at most two fermions.\n\n### **1. Ground State Energy**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four fermions, following the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n1.  The lowest energy level is `n=1`. We can place two fermions in this level, one with spin-up and one with spin-down. The energy contributed by these two particles is `2 * E_1 = 2 * (1^2 * E) = 2E`.\n2.  The next two fermions go into the `n=2` energy level, again with opposite spins. The energy contributed by these two particles is `2 * E_2 = 2 * (2^2 * E) = 8E`.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n**E_ground** = 2E + 8E = **10E**\n\n### **2. First Excited State Energy**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (`n=3`).\n\n*   The particle configuration becomes: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n\nThe total energy for the first excited state is:\n**E_first** = (2 * E₁) + (1 * E₂) + (1 * E₃) = (2 * 1² * E) + (1 * 2² * E) + (1 * 3² * E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**\n\n### **3. Second Excited State Energy**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We must consider the possible transitions that lead to the next lowest total energy:\n\n*   **Possibility A:** Promote the second particle from `n=2` (from the ground state) to `n=3`. The configuration would be two particles in `n=1` and two particles in `n=3`.\n    *   Energy = (2 * E₁) + (2 * E₃) = (2 * 1² * E) + (2 * 3² * E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n*   **Possibility B:** Promote the particle from `n=3` (in the first excited state) to the next level, `n=4`. The configuration would be two particles in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, and one in `n=4`.\n    *   Energy = (2 * E₁) + (1 * E₂) + (1 * E₄) = (2 * 1² * E) + (1 * 2² * E) + (1 * 4² * E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n*   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from `n=1` (from the ground state) to `n=3`. This leaves one particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, and one in `n=3`.\n    *   Energy = (1 * E₁) + (2 * E₂) + (1 * E₃) = (1 * 1² * E) + (2 * 2² * E) + (1 * 3² * E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n\nComparing the energies of these possible excited states (20E, 22E, 18E), the lowest energy is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the second excited state energy is:\n**E_second** = **18E**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe energies for the three states are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis sequence matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
