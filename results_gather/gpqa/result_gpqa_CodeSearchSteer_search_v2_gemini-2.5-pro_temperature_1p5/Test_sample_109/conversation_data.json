    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs.\n\n### **Observability Criteria**\n\nFirst, let's establish the criteria for a star to be observable by both instruments:\n\n1.  **Location (Visibility):** The star must be visible from both the Northern Hemisphere (W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii) and the Southern Hemisphere (Paranal Observatory in Chile). The prompt specifies to disregard pointing limits and telescope altitudes. This means we only need to consider if the star is fundamentally visible from both hemispheres. A star with a very high positive declination (far north) would not be visible from Chile, and a star with a very high negative declination (far south) would not be visible from Hawaii.\n    *   The Keck Observatory is at a latitude of approximately +20°. It can observe the northern celestial sphere and parts of the southern one.\n    *   The Paranal Observatory is at a latitude of approximately -25°. It can observe the southern celestial sphere and parts of the northern one.\n    *   A star at a declination of -75° (like Star1) is in the far southern sky and would not be visible from Keck in the Northern Hemisphere. All other stars have declinations between -48° and +60°, making them accessible from both locations, even if low in the sky for one of them.\n\n2.  **Brightness (Apparent Magnitude):** The star's apparent magnitude in the V band (m_V) must be brighter than the limiting magnitude of **both** instruments.\n    *   **ESPRESSO limit:** m_V < 17 mag\n    *   **HIRES limit:** m_V < 16 mag\n    *   Therefore, for a star to be observed by both, it must satisfy the stricter condition: **m_V < 16 mag**.\n\n### **Magnitude Calculation**\n\nFor stars where the apparent magnitude is not directly given, we use the distance modulus formula, including the term for interstellar absorption (A_V) where applicable:\n\n**m_V = M_V + 5 * log₁₀(d) - 5 + A_V**\n\nWhere:\n*   **m_V** is the apparent V magnitude (the observed brightness).\n*   **M_V** is the absolute V magnitude.\n*   **d** is the distance in parsecs (pc).\n*   **A_V** is the total absorption in the V band. It is calculated as A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V).\n\n---\n\n### **Star-by-Star Analysis**\n\n*   **Star1**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = -75°. This star is too far south to be observed from the Keck Observatory in the Northern Hemisphere.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by both instruments.\n\n*   **Star2**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = +55°. This is visible from both hemispheres.\n    *   **Brightness:** The apparent V magnitude is given as **16.5 mag**. This is fainter than the HIRES limit (16.5 > 16).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by both instruments as it is too faint for HIRES.\n\n*   **Star3**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = +48°. This is visible from both hemispheres.\n    *   **Brightness:** The apparent V magnitude is given as **15.5 mag**. This is brighter than the limit for both ESPRESSO (15.5 < 17) and HIRES (15.5 < 16). The additional information about E(B-V) seems intended to confuse, as the final apparent magnitude is already provided.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Can be observed by both instruments.**\n\n*   **Star4**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = -48°. This is visible from both hemispheres.\n    *   **Brightness:** We need to calculate the apparent magnitude.\n        *   M_V = 15.5 mag\n        *   d = 10 pc\n        *   A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag\n        *   m_V = 15.5 + 5 * log₁₀(10) - 5 + 1.24\n        *   m_V = 15.5 + 5 - 5 + 1.24 = **16.74 mag**\n    *   This is fainter than the HIRES limit (16.74 > 16).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by both instruments as it is too faint for HIRES.\n\n*   **Star5**\n    *   **Visibility:** DEC = +60°. This is visible from both hemispheres.\n    *   **Brightness:** We need to calculate the apparent magnitude.\n        *   M_V = 16.5 mag\n        *   d = 5 pc\n        *   A_V = 0 (not mentioned)\n        *   m_V = 16.5 + 5 * log₁₀(5) - 5\n        *   m_V = 16.5 + 5 * (0.699) - 5\n        *   m_V = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = **14.995 mag**\n    *   This is brighter than the limit for both ESPRESSO (15.0 < 17) and HIRES (15.0 < 16).\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Can be observed by both instruments.**\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nBased on the analysis, Star3 and Star5 are the only stars that are visible from both observatories and bright enough to be detected by both spectrographs.\n\n<<<B>>>"
