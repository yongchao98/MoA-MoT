    "The provided quantum mechanical system describes a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. The energy eigenvalues for this system are given by the formula:\n\nE_n = (n + 3/2)ħω\n\nwhere 'n' is the principal quantum number (n = 0, 1, 2, ...), ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, and ω is the angular frequency.\n\nThe energy levels are:\n*   **Ground State (n=0):** E₀ = (0 + 3/2)ħω = (3/2)ħω.\n*   **First Excited State (n=1):** E₁ = (1 + 3/2)ħω = (5/2)ħω.\n*   **Second Excited State (n=2):** E₂ = (2 + 3/2)ħω = (7/2)ħω.\n*   **Third Excited State (n=3):** E₃ = (3 + 3/2)ħω = (9/2)ħω.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the third excited state is (9/2)ħω.\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy level, which is known as its degeneracy. The degeneracy, gₙ, for a given energy level 'n' of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is calculated by the formula:\n\ngₙ = (n+1)(n+2) / 2\n\nFor the third excited state, we have n=3. Plugging this into the degeneracy formula:\n\ng₃ = (3+1)(3+2) / 2\ng₃ = (4)(5) / 2\ng₃ = 20 / 2\ng₃ = 10\n\nThus, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions possible for the energy eigenvalue of (9/2)ħω. This means the third excited state is 10-fold degenerate.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n*   Energy: (9/2)ħω\n*   Degeneracy: 10\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
