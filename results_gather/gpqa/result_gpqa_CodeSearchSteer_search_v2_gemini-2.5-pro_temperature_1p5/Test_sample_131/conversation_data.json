    "To determine which two compounds are in the mixture, we need to analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each option and compare it to the data provided.\n\n**Analysis of the Provided 1H NMR Data:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, in a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**Analysis of the Candidate Compounds:**\n\n1.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, it will show:\n    *   **Aromatic:** One singlet for the two equivalent aromatic protons (at C3 and C6).\n    *   **Aliphatic:** One singlet for the four equivalent methyl groups (12 protons).\n\n2.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has less symmetry. It will show:\n    *   **Aromatic:** Two singlets for the two non-equivalent aromatic protons (at C4 and C6).\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Three singlets for the three sets of non-equivalent methyl groups (C1/C3-methyls are equivalent, C2-methyl is unique, C5-methyl is unique), with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry. It will show:\n    *   **Aromatic:** One singlet for the two equivalent aromatic protons (at C5 and C6).\n    *   **Aliphatic:** Two singlets for the two sets of equivalent methyl groups (C1/C4-methyls are equivalent, C2/C3-methyls are equivalent), with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, or 1:1.\n\n4.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has a molecular formula of C10H14 and high symmetry. It will show:\n    *   **Aromatic:** One singlet for the four equivalent aromatic protons.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** A quartet for the methylene (-CH2-) protons and a triplet for the methyl (-CH3) protons. The signals are not singlets, so this compound can be ruled out. This eliminates option D.\n\n**Evaluating the Mixture Options:**\n\nLet's consider a 1:1 mixture for the remaining options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** This mixture would produce three signals in the aromatic region: one from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (2H) and two from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (1H each). The expected ratio would be 2:1:1. This does not match the observed 1:1 ratio of two singlets.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** This combination would also result in three aromatic signals: one from 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (2H) and two from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (1H each), giving a 2:1:1 ratio. This does not match the experimental data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this will result in **two singlets** with an equal integration, giving a **1:1 ratio**. This matches the description.\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one singlet (from 12 protons). 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives two singlets (each from 6 protons). In the 1:1 mixture, this results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to a **2:1:1 ratio**. This also perfectly matches the description.\n\nTherefore, the two compounds present in the mixture are 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
