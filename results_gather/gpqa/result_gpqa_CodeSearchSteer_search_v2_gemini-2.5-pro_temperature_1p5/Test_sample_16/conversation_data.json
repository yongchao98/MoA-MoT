    "To solve this problem, we need to consider the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\nThe formation of the complex is represented by the equilibrium:\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻\n\nThe formation constant (K_f) is given by:\nK_f = [[Ca(EDTA)]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\nThe question asks for the concentration of free Ca²⁺ ions, which results from the dissociation of the complex. The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n[Ca(EDTA)]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this dissociation (K_d), also known as the instability constant, is the inverse of the formation constant.\nK_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\nWe can set up an equilibrium table to find the concentration of Ca²⁺. Let 'x' be the change in concentration due to dissociation. The initial stoichiometric concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M.\n\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| [Ca(EDTA)]²⁻ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| Ca²⁺ | 0 | +x | x |\n| EDTA⁴⁻ | 0 | +x | x |\n\nNow, we can substitute these equilibrium concentrations into the dissociation constant expression:\nK_d = ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) / [[Ca(EDTA)]²⁻]\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n\nBecause the formation constant is very large (and thus the dissociation constant is very small), the amount of complex that dissociates, 'x', will be negligible compared to the initial concentration of the complex. Therefore, we can simplify the expression by approximating (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\nNow, we solve for x, which represents the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺ ions:\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * (0.02)\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\nTo solve for x, we can rewrite 4 x 10⁻¹³ as 40 x 10⁻¹⁴ to make the exponent an even number:\nx = √(40 x 10⁻¹⁴)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 2.0x10⁻² M\nB) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\nC) 1.0x10⁻² M\nD) 5.0x10⁻³ M\n\nThe calculated value matches option B. The problem assumes an ideal pH, which means we can use the given formation constant directly without adjusting for the protonation of EDTA.\n\n<<<B>>>"
