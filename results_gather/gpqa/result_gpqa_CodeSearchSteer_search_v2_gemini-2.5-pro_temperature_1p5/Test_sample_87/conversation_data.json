    "Here is an analysis of the provided scenario:\n\nThe experiment tracks an antigen (rotavirus proteins) delivered orally to the Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs in the intestine. Peyer's patches are known to have continuously active germinal centers, which are sites for B cell proliferation, differentiation, and the generation of mutated IgA-producing cells.\n\nInside these Peyer's patches, a population of proliferating cells is isolated. This proliferation is a key feature of an active immune response, specifically within germinal centers where B cells rapidly divide after encountering an antigen.\n\nThe most critical piece of information is that sequencing the variable heavy chain gene (VH) of these proliferating cells reveals high variability. This points directly to a process that introduces numerous mutations into the variable region of immunoglobulin genes *after* an initial B cell has been activated by an antigen.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\n*   **A) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a biological process that occurs in activated B cells within germinal centers. It introduces a high rate of point mutations specifically into the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes. The goal of SHM is to generate B cell variants with increased affinity for the antigen. This process is a hallmark of germinal center reactions in Peyer's patches and perfectly explains the \"high variability\" observed in the variable heavy chain gene of the proliferating cell population.\n\n*   **B) VDJ recombination:** This process is responsible for the initial diversity of the B cell repertoire. It occurs in developing B cells in the bone marrow (*primary* lymphoid organ) *before* they encounter an antigen. While it generates variability, it is not the process taking place in a *proliferating* population within a *secondary* lymphoid organ in response to an antigen. The variability in the experiment is generated from an already-recombined gene in an activated cell.\n\n*   **C) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate and adaptive immune system that involves a cascade of proteins to help clear pathogens. It does not involve any genetic changes to B cell receptors and is unrelated to the variability of the heavy chain gene.\n\n*   **D) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process also occurs in activated B cells in germinal centers, often at the same time as somatic hypermutation. However, CSR changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain (e.g., from IgM to IgA), which alters the antibody's function. It explicitly *does not* affect the variable region, which is where the high variability was found in the experiment.\n\nTherefore, the observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating B cells in the Peyer's patches after antigen stimulation is a direct result of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
