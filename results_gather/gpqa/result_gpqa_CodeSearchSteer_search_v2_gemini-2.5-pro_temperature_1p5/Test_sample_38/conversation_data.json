    "To find the numerical value of \"a,\" we must use the normalization condition from quantum mechanics. This principle states that the total probability of finding the particle somewhere in the space it can exist must be equal to 1.\n\nThe problem states that the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. Therefore, the integral of the probability density function, |Ψ(x)|², over this interval must be 1.\n\nThe wave function is given as:\nΨ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\nFirst, we calculate the probability density function, |Ψ(x)|², which is the product of the wave function and its complex conjugate:\n|Ψ(x)|² = Ψ*(x)Ψ(x)\n|Ψ(x)|² = [ (a / sqrt(1 + x)) + 0.5i ] * [ (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i ]\n|Ψ(x)|² = (a² / (1 + x)) + 0.25\n\nNow, we set up the normalization integral:\n∫[from 1 to 3] ( (a² / (1 + x)) + 0.25 ) dx = 1\n\nNext, we solve the integral:\n[ a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25x ] evaluated from 1 to 3 = 1\n[ (a² * ln(1 + 3) + 0.25 * 3) ] - [ (a² * ln(1 + 1) + 0.25 * 1) ] = 1\n[ a² * ln(4) + 0.75 ] - [ a² * ln(2) + 0.25 ] = 1\na² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.5 = 1\nUsing the logarithm property ln(b) - ln(c) = ln(b/c):\na² * ln(4/2) + 0.5 = 1\na² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nThe value of the natural logarithm of 2, ln(2), is approximately 0.693.\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.693147\na² ≈ 0.72134\na ≈ sqrt(0.72134)\na ≈ 0.849\n\nThis value is approximately 0.85.\n\n<<<A>>>"
