Since two of these are double bonds, the number of single C-C bonds is 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**Careful Point:** An accurate count of atoms and bonds is the foundation of the entire calculation. All candidate answers performed this step correctly.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactants**\nThe formation reaction from elements in their standard states is:\n12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\nWe need to calculate the energy required to convert these reactants into gaseous atoms (12 C(g) + 22 H(g)).\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon = 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   Energy to break 11 moles of H-H bonds = 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n*   **Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = 13100 kJ**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Product**\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the product, C12H22. It is the sum of all the bond energies.\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds = 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds = 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds = 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n*   **Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Product = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = 11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**Careful Point:** This value, 11200 kJ/mol, matches option A. This is a common distractor. This value represents the energy to break the molecule apart, not its enthalpy of formation.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf°)**\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to atomize the reactants and the energy released when the product is formed from its atoms (which is equal to the product's enthalpy of atomization).\n*   ΔHf° = [Enthalpy of atomization of reactants] - [Enthalpy of atomization of product]\n*   ΔHf° = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**Careful Point:** This numerical value, 1900, matches option D. However, option D has units of kJ/g, while the calculated value is in kJ/mol. This is another common distractor.\n\n**Step 5: Convert Units and Select the Final Answer**\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. To make a final decision, we must convert this value to kJ/g to compare it with option C.\n*   **Molar Mass of C12H22:** (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n*   **Convert ΔHf° to kJ/g:**\n    ΔHf° (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.4457 kJ/g**.\n\nThis value, when rounded, is 11.45 kJ/g, which corresponds to option C (11.44 kJ/g).\n\n**Final Decision:**\n*   A) 11200 kJ/mol is the enthalpy of atomization of the product. Incorrect.\n*   B) 67.4 kJ/mol is an incorrect value.\n*   C) 11.44 kJ/g matches our calculated value after unit conversion. **Correct.**\n*   D) 1900 kJ/g has the correct numerical value for the molar enthalpy but the wrong units. Incorrect.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the careful points needed to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula and Count the Bonds**\nFirst, we must accurately determine the number of atoms and the types of bonds in the molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n*   **Atom Count:**\n    *   Carbon (C): 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12 atoms.\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 atoms.\n    *   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n*   **Bond Count:**\n    *   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n    *   **C=C bonds:** The structure explicitly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds, so there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   **C-C bonds:** For an acyclic (non-ring) molecule, the total number of bonds in the carbon skeleton is the number of carbon atoms minus one (12 - 1 = 11). Since two of these are double bonds, the number of single C-C bonds is 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** An error in counting atoms or bonds will make the entire calculation incorrect. It is crucial to be systematic in this first step.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactants**\nThe formation reaction from elements in their standard states is: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g). We need to calculate the energy required to convert these reactants into gaseous atoms (12 C(g) + 22 H(g)).\n\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon: 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = **12000 kJ**.\n*   Energy to atomize 11 moles of H2 (breaking 11 H-H bonds): 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = **1100 kJ**.\n*   **Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants** = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Remember that elemental hydrogen is diatomic (H2). To get 22 H atoms, you must break the bonds in 11 H2 molecules.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Product**\nThis is the total energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the product, which is the sum of all its bond energies.\n\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds = 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ.\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds = 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ.\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds = 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ.\n*   **Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Product** = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** This value, 11200 kJ/mol, matches option A. This is a very common distractor. It represents the energy required to break the molecule apart, not its enthalpy of formation.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf°)**\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy needed to atomize the reactants and the energy released when the product is formed from its atoms (which is the product's enthalpy of atomization).\n\n*   ΔHf° = [Enthalpy of atomization of reactants] - [Enthalpy of atomization of product]\n*   ΔHf° = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The numerical value 1900 matches option C, but the units in option C are kJ/g. This is another distractor that tests attention to detail regarding units.\n\n**Step 5: Convert Units and Select the Final Answer**\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. To make a final decision, we must convert this value to kJ/g to check against option B.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of C12H22:** Using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the molar mass is (12 × 12) + (22 × 1) = **166 g/mol**.\n*   **Convert to kJ/g:**\n    ΔHf° (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.4457 kJ/g**.\n\nThis calculated value, when rounded, is 11.44 kJ/g. This matches option B.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   Option A (11200 kJ/mol) is the enthalpy of atomization of the product.\n*   Option B (11.44 kJ/g) is the correctly calculated enthalpy of formation with the correct units.\n*   Option C (1900 kJ/g) has the correct numerical value for the molar enthalpy but incorrect units.\n*   Option D (67.4 kJ/mol) is an incorrect value.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to systematically calculate the enthalpy of formation for the given compound by following the standard thermochemical method.

1 = 11). Since two of these are double bonds, the number of single C-C bonds is 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactants**\nThe formation reaction from elements in their standard states is:\n12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\nWe need to calculate the energy required to turn the reactants into gaseous atoms: 12 C(g) + 22 H(g).\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon = 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ.\n*   Energy to break 11 moles of H-H bonds = 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ.\n*   **Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = 13100 kJ**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Product (Sum of Bond Energies)**\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the product, C12H22.\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds = 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ.\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds = 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ.\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds = 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ.\n*   **Total Bond Energy of Product = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = 11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf°)**\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to atomize the reactants and the energy released when the product is formed from its gaseous atoms (which is equal to the product's enthalpy of atomization).\n*   ΔHf° = [Enthalpy of atomization of reactants] - [Enthalpy of atomization of product]\n*   ΔHf° = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n**Step 5: Convert Units and Select the Final Answer**\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol.

This is a common distractor.\n*   Option B (1900 kJ/g) has the correct numerical value for the molar enthalpy of formation (1900), but the units are incorrect (kJ/g instead of kJ/mol). This is also a distractor.\n*   Option C (67.4 kJ/mol) is an incorrect value.\n*   Option D (11.44 kJ/g) is in units of kJ/g. We must convert our calculated value to check it.\n\n**Unit Conversion:**\n*   First, calculate the molar mass of C12H22. Using integer atomic masses (C=12 g/mol, H=1 g/mol):\n    Molar Mass (M) = (12 × 12) + (22 × 1) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n*   Now, convert the enthalpy of formation from kJ/mol to kJ/g:\n    ΔHf° (kJ/g) = ΔHf° (kJ/mol) / M (g/mol)\n    ΔHf° (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166 ≈ **11.4457 kJ/g**.\n\nThis calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe code output confirms the step-by-step calculation performed in the reasoning process.\n\n1.  **Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants**: 13100 kJ\n2.  **Enthalpy of Atomization of Product**: 11200 kJ/mol (This matches option C, a distractor)\n3.  **Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf°)**: 1900 kJ/mol (The number 1900 matches option D, but the units are wrong)\n4.  **Molar Mass**: 166 g/mol\n5.  **Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf°) in kJ/g**: 11.4458 kJ/g\n\nThe final calculated value of approximately 11.45 kJ/g matches option A (11.44 kJ/g).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct final answer.\n\nThe calculation of the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) from bond energies and enthalpies of atomization follows a precise formula:\nΔHf° = [Σ Enthalpy of atomization of reactants] - [Σ Bond energies of the product]\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula and Bond Count**\n\nFirst, we must correctly identify the number of atoms and the types of bonds in the molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n*   **Atom Count:**\n    *   Carbon (C): 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12 atoms.\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 atoms.\n    *   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n*   **Bond Count:**\n    *   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n    *   **C=C bonds:** The structure explicitly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds, so there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   **C-C bonds:** For an acyclic molecule, the total number of bonds in the carbon skeleton is the number of carbon atoms minus one (12 - 1 = 11). Since two of these are double bonds, the number of single C-C bonds is 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**Careful Point:** An accurate count of atoms and bonds is the foundation of the entire calculation. A mistake here will lead to an incorrect result.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactants**\n\nThe formation reaction from elements in their standard states is: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g). We need to calculate the energy required to convert these reactants into gaseous atoms (12 C(g) + 22 H(g)).\n\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon = 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ.\n*   Energy to break 11 moles of H-H bonds = 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ.\n*   **Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = 13100 kJ.**\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Sum of Bond Energies of the Product**\n\nThis value represents the enthalpy of atomization of the product, which is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound.\n\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds = 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ.\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds = 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ.\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds = 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ.\n*   **Total Bond Energy of Product = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = 11200 kJ/mol.**\n\n**Careful Point:** This value, 11200 kJ/mol, matches option A. This is a common distractor, as it represents the energy required to break the molecule apart, not its enthalpy of formation.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf°)**\n\nNow, we apply the main formula using the results from Step 2 and Step 3.\n\n*   ΔHf° = [Reactant Atomization Energy] - [Product Bond Energy]\n*   ΔHf° = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol.**\n\n**Careful Point:** The numerical value of this result, 1900, matches option C (1900 kJ/g).

It is the sum of all the bond energies.\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds = 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds = 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds = 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n*   **Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Product = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = 11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**Careful Point:** This value, 11200 kJ/mol, matches option A. This is a common distractor. This value represents the energy to break the molecule apart, not its enthalpy of formation.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf°)**\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to atomize the reactants and the energy released when the product is formed from its atoms (which is equal to the product's enthalpy of atomization).\n*   ΔHf° = [Enthalpy of atomization of reactants] - [Enthalpy of atomization of product]\n*   ΔHf° = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**Careful Point:** This numerical value, 1900, matches option D. However, option D has units of kJ/g, while the calculated value is in kJ/mol. This is another common distractor.\n\n**Step 5: Convert Units and Select the Final Answer**\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. To make a final decision, we must convert this value to kJ/g to compare it with option C.\n*   **Molar Mass of C12H22:** (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n*   **Convert ΔHf° to kJ/g:**\n    ΔHf° (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.4457 kJ/g**.\n\nThis value, when rounded, is 11.45 kJ/g, which corresponds to option C (11.44 kJ/g).\n\n**Final Decision:**\n*   A) 11200 kJ/mol is the enthalpy of atomization of the product. Incorrect.\n*   B) 67.4 kJ/mol is an incorrect value.\n*   C) 11.44 kJ/g matches our calculated value after unit conversion. **Correct.**\n*   D) 1900 kJ/g has the correct numerical value for the molar enthalpy but the wrong units. Incorrect.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the careful points needed to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula and Count the Bonds**\nFirst, we must accurately determine the number of atoms and the types of bonds in the molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n*   **Atom Count:**\n    *   Carbon (C): 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12 atoms.\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 atoms.\n    *   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n*   **Bond Count:**\n    *   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n    *   **C=C bonds:** The structure explicitly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds, so there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   **C-C bonds:** For an acyclic (non-ring) molecule, the total number of bonds in the carbon skeleton is the number of carbon atoms minus one (12 - 1 = 11). Since two of these are double bonds, the number of single C-C bonds is 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** An error in counting atoms or bonds will make the entire calculation incorrect. It is crucial to be systematic in this first step.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactants**\nThe formation reaction from elements in their standard states is: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g). We need to calculate the energy required to convert these reactants into gaseous atoms (12 C(g) + 22 H(g)).\n\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon: 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = **12000 kJ**.\n*   Energy to atomize 11 moles of H2 (breaking 11 H-H bonds): 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = **1100 kJ**.\n*   **Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants** = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Remember that elemental hydrogen is diatomic (H2). To get 22 H atoms, you must break the bonds in 11 H2 molecules.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Product**\nThis is the total energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the product, which is the sum of all its bond energies.\n\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds = 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ.\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds = 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ.\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds = 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ.\n*   **Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Product** = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** This value, 11200 kJ/mol, matches option A. This is a very common distractor. It represents the energy required to break the molecule apart, not its enthalpy of formation.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf°)**\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy needed to atomize the reactants and the energy released when the product is formed from its atoms (which is the product's enthalpy of atomization).\n\n*   ΔHf° = [Enthalpy of atomization of reactants] - [Enthalpy of atomization of product]\n*   ΔHf° = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The numerical value 1900 matches option C, but the units in option C are kJ/g. This is another distractor that tests attention to detail regarding units.\n\n**Step 5: Convert Units and Select the Final Answer**\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. To make a final decision, we must convert this value to kJ/g to check against option B.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of C12H22:** Using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1), the molar mass is (12 × 12) + (22 × 1) = **166 g/mol**.\n*   **Convert to kJ/g:**\n    ΔHf° (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.4457 kJ/g**.\n\nThis calculated value, when rounded, is 11.44 kJ/g. This matches option B.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   Option A (11200 kJ/mol) is the enthalpy of atomization of the product.\n*   Option B (11.44 kJ/g) is the correctly calculated enthalpy of formation with the correct units.\n*   Option C (1900 kJ/g) has the correct numerical value for the molar enthalpy but incorrect units.\n*   Option D (67.4 kJ/mol) is an incorrect value.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to systematically calculate the enthalpy of formation for the given compound by following the standard thermochemical method.

We must now compare this to the given options and perform a unit conversion if necessary.\n*   **Molar Mass of C12H22:** (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n*   **Convert ΔHf° to kJ/g:** (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.4457 kJ/g**.\n\n**Careful Points and Analysis of Options:**\n\n1.  **Distractor 1 (Enthalpy of Atomization):** The calculated enthalpy of atomization of the product is 11200 kJ/mol. This matches **Option B**. This is a common mistake, confusing the energy required to break the molecule apart with the energy of its formation from elements.\n2.  **Distractor 2 (Incorrect Units):** The calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. **Option D** is 1900 kJ/g. This is a distractor that uses the correct numerical value but applies the wrong units.\n3.  **Correct Answer:** The calculated enthalpy of formation in kJ/g is ~11.45 kJ/g. This matches **Option C** (11.44 kJ/g). The minor difference is due to rounding.\n4.  **Incorrect Value:** **Option A** (67.4 kJ/mol) does not correspond to any of the key calculated values.\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis, the correct answer is 11.44 kJ/g.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, including all the careful points, to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula and Bond Count**\n\nFirst, we must correctly identify the number of atoms and bonds in the molecule `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`.\n\n*   **Atom Count:**\n    *   Carbon (C): 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = **12 C atoms**\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = **22 H atoms**\n    *   The molecular formula is **C₁₂H₂₂**.\n\n*   **Bond Count:**\n    *   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n    *   **C=C bonds:** The structure explicitly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds, so there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   **C-C bonds:** For an acyclic (non-ring) molecule, the total number of bonds in the carbon skeleton is the number of carbon atoms minus one (12 - 1 = 11). Since two of these are double bonds, the number of single C-C bonds is 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** An accurate count of atoms and bonds is the essential first step. Any error here will make the rest of the calculation incorrect.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactants**\n\nThe formation reaction from elements in their standard states is:\n12 C(s) + 11 H₂(g) → C₁₂H₂₂(g)\n\nWe need to calculate the energy required to convert these reactants into gaseous atoms (12 C(g) + 22 H(g)).\n\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon: 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = **12000 kJ**\n*   Energy to atomize 11 moles of H₂ gas (breaking 11 moles of H-H bonds): 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = **1100 kJ**\n*   **Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = 13100 kJ**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Remember that hydrogen's standard state is H₂(g), so you must use the number of moles of H₂ (which is half the number of H atoms) and the H-H bond energy.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Product**\n\nThis is the total energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the product, which is the sum of all its bond energies.\n\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds = 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds = 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds = 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n*   **Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Product = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = 11200 kJ/mol**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** This value, 11200 kJ/mol, matches option **B**. This is a very common distractor. It represents the energy to break the molecule apart, not its enthalpy of formation.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf°)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to atomize the reactants and the energy released when the product is formed from its atoms.\n\nΔHf° = [Σ ΔH_atom(reactants)] - [Σ ΔH_atom(product)]\nΔHf° = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The numerical value `1900` matches option **C**, but the units are incorrect (kJ/g instead of kJ/mol). This is another common distractor for those who don't check the units carefully.\n\n### **Step 5: Convert Units and Select the Final Answer**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. To compare this with all options, we must convert it to kJ/g.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of C₁₂H₂₂:**\n    M = (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n*   **Convert ΔHf° to kJ/g:**\n    ΔHf° (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.4457 kJ/g**.\n\nThis value, rounded to two decimal places, is 11.45 kJ/g, which corresponds to option **A**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter a thorough step-by-step calculation and careful consideration of all potential distractors, the final answer is determined.\n*   The enthalpy of formation is **1900 kJ/mol**.\n*   The enthalpy of formation is approximately **11.44 kJ/g**.\n*   Option A (11.44 kJ/g) is the correct answer.\n*   Option B (11200 kJ/mol) is the enthalpy of atomization of the product.\n*   Option C (1900 kJ/g) has the correct numerical value for the molar enthalpy but incorrect units.\n*   Option D (67.4 kJ/mol) is an incorrect value.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the provided candidate answers and the problem statement, here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the correct solution.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula and Bond Count**\nFirst, we must correctly identify the number of atoms and the types of bonds in the molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n*   **Atom Count:**\n    *   Carbon (C): 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 atoms\n    *   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n*   **Bond Count:**\n    *   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n    *   **C=C bonds:** The structure explicitly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds, so there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n    *   **C-C bonds:** For an acyclic (non-ring) molecule, the total number of bonds in the carbon skeleton is the number of carbon atoms minus one (12 - 1 = 11).

This is a common distractor. It represents the energy required to break the molecule apart (enthalpy of atomization), not the energy change when it is formed from its elements (enthalpy of formation).\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf°)**\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy needed to atomize the reactants and the energy released when the product is formed from its atoms (which equals the product's total bond energy).\n*   ΔHf° = [Enthalpy of atomization of reactants] - [Enthalpy of atomization of product]\n*   ΔHf° = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**Careful Point:** The numerical value `1900` matches option **D**, which is `1900 kJ/g`.
