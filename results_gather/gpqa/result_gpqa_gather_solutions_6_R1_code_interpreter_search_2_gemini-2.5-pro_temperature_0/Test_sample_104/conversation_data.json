Interestingly, this situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet.

Calculate the Amplitude of Brightness Variation from Starspots**\n\nThe brightness, or flux (F), of a radiating surface is governed by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that flux is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (`F ∝ T⁴`).\n\n*   **Given Parameters:**\n    *   Star's effective temperature, `T_eff` = 6000 K\n    *   Spot temperature, `T_spot` = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n    *   Spot filling factor on the spotted hemisphere, `f` = 20% = 0.20\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (`F_max`):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The flux is proportional to `T_eff⁴`.\n*   **Minimum Flux (`F_min`):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. The flux is a weighted average of the hot photosphere (fraction `1-f`) and the cooler spots (fraction `f`). The flux is proportional to `(1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴`.\n\nThe amplitude of the signal is the relative drop in brightness, which is what a light curve measures:\n`Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n\nThis simplifies to the standard formula for spot-induced amplitude:\n`Amplitude = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]`\n\nPlugging in the numerical values:\n`Amplitude = 0.20 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴]`\n`Amplitude = 0.20 * [1 - (5/6)⁴]`\n`Amplitude = 0.20 * [1 - 625 / 1296]`\n`Amplitude = 0.20 * [671 / 1296]`\n`Amplitude ≈ 0.20 * 0.51775`\n`Amplitude ≈ 0.10355`\n\nSo, the starspots cause a brightness variation with an amplitude of approximately 10.36%.\n\n**2. Calculate the Equivalent Exoplanet Transit Depth**\n\nThe drop in brightness caused by a transiting exoplanet (the transit depth, `δ`) is the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n\n`δ = Area_planet / Area_star = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\n**3. Equate the Signals and Solve for the Relative Radius**\n\nTo produce the same signal, the transit depth must equal the amplitude from the starspots.\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = Amplitude`\n`(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.10355`\n\nTo find the relative radius, we take the square root of the amplitude:\n`R_pl / R_star = √0.10355`\n`R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218`\n\n**4. Compare with Options**\n\nThe calculated value for the relative radius is approximately **0.32**. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~0.39\nB) ~0.07\nC) ~0.11\nD) ~0.32\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **T⁴ Dependence:** The most critical physical principle is that flux scales with the **fourth power of temperature (T⁴)**. A common mistake is to assume a linear relationship, which would lead to an incorrect result.\n2.  **R² Dependence:** The transit depth scales with the **square of the radius ratio (R²)**. It is crucial to remember to take the square root at the final step to solve for the radius ratio itself.\n3.  **Relative Amplitude:** The signal is a *relative* flux drop (`ΔF/F`), not an absolute one. The formula `A = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]` correctly models this relative change from the maximum (unspotted) brightness.\n4.  **Information Check:** The information that the star's radius is equal to the Sun's is extraneous, as the question asks for the *relative* radius `R_pl/R_star`, making the absolute size of the star irrelevant.\n5.  **Analysis of Candidate Answers:** All 15 candidate answers correctly performed the physics calculation, arriving at the same numerical result of `~0.32`. The discrepancies in their final letter choices indicate they were likely working with differently ordered multiple-choice options. The calculation itself is robust and consistently points to `0.32`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\nThe problem requires us to find the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet (`R_pl/R_star`) that would produce the same brightness variation as a rotating star with a large spotted region.\n\n**1.

First, I will calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the rotating star with a spotted hemisphere. Second, I will determine the size of a hypothetical exoplanet that would cause a transit of the same amplitude. By equating these two effects, I can solve for the planet's radius relative to the star's radius.\n\nHere are the key steps and careful points I will consider:\n1.  **Calculate the Starspot Signal Amplitude**: The brightness (or flux) of a star is governed by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that flux is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (`T⁴`). The amplitude of the signal from the rotating spotted star is the relative difference between the maximum flux (from the unspotted side) and the minimum flux (from the spotted side). The formula for this amplitude is `Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`, where `f` is the spot filling factor, `T_spot` is the spot temperature, and `T_eff` is the star's effective temperature.\n2.  **Calculate the Exoplanet Signal (Transit Depth)**: The brightness drop from a transiting exoplanet is simply the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. The formula is `Transit Depth = (R_pl / R_star)²`.\n3.  **Equate and Solve**: By setting the starspot amplitude equal to the transit depth, I can solve for the relative radius, `R_pl / R_star`. This will involve taking the square root of the calculated amplitude.\n4.  **Analyze Candidate Answers**: The provided candidate answers show a strong consensus on the calculation method, consistently arriving at a numerical result of approximately 0.32. The discrepancies in their final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) indicate that they were likely working with different or shuffled lists of options.

Calculate the Amplitude of Brightness Variation from Starspots**\n\nThe brightness, or flux (F), of a radiating surface is governed by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that flux is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (`F ∝ T⁴`).\n\n*   **Given Parameters:**\n    *   Star's effective temperature (`T_eff`): 6000 K\n    *   Spot temperature (`T_spot`): 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n    *   Spot filling factor on the spotted hemisphere (`f`): 20% or 0.20\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (`F_max`):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The flux is proportional to `T_eff⁴`.\n*   **Minimum Flux (`F_min`):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. The flux is a weighted average of the hot photosphere (fraction `1-f`) and the cooler spots (fraction `f`). The flux is proportional to `(1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴`.\n\nThe amplitude of the signal (`A`) is the relative drop in brightness from maximum to minimum:\n`A = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n\nThis simplifies to the formula:\n`A = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]`\n\nPlugging in the numerical values:\n`A = 0.20 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴]`\n`A = 0.20 * [1 - (5/6)⁴]`\n`A = 0.20 * [1 - 625 / 1296]`\n`A = 0.20 * [671 / 1296]`\n`A ≈ 0.20 * 0.51775`\n`A ≈ 0.10355`\n\nThe starspots cause a brightness variation with an amplitude of approximately 10.36%.\n\n**2. Calculate the Equivalent Exoplanet Transit Depth**\n\nThe drop in brightness caused by a transiting exoplanet (the transit depth, `δ`) is the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n\n`δ = Area_planet / Area_star = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\n**3. Equate the Signals and Solve for the Relative Radius**\n\nTo produce the same signal, the transit depth must equal the amplitude from the starspots.\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = A`\n`(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.10355`\n\nTo find the relative radius, we take the square root of the amplitude:\n`R_pl / R_star = √0.10355`\n`R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218`\n\n**4. Compare with Options and Conclude**\n\nThe calculated value for the relative radius is approximately 0.32. Comparing this to the options provided in the question:\nA) ~0.07\nB) ~0.32\nC) ~0.39\nD) ~0.11\n\nThe calculated value of `~0.3218` is a clear match for option B.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **T⁴ Dependence:** The most critical physical principle is that flux scales with the **fourth power of temperature**. A common mistake is to assume a linear relationship, which would lead to an incorrect result.\n*   **Transit Depth Formula:** The transit depth is proportional to the ratio of the **areas** (`R²`), not the radii (`R`). Forgetting to take the square root at the final step is a potential error.\n*   **Relative Amplitude:** The calculation must be for the *relative* change in flux (`ΔF/F`), which is what photometric instruments measure. The formula `A = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]` correctly models this.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The fact that the star's radius is equal to the Sun's is not needed for the calculation, as the question asks for the *relative* radius `R_pl/R_star`.\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers:** All 15 candidate answers correctly performed the physics calculation, arriving at the numerical result of `~0.32`. The discrepancies in their final letter choices were due to them being presented with shuffled multiple-choice options. The calculation itself is robust and consistently points to the same numerical value.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this problem by breaking it down into two main parts. First, I will calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the rotating star with a spotted hemisphere. Second, I will determine the size of a hypothetical exoplanet that would cause a transit of the same amplitude. By equating these two effects, I can solve for the planet's radius relative to the star's radius.\n\nHere are the key steps and careful points I will consider:\n1.  **Calculate the Starspot Signal Amplitude**: The brightness (or flux) of a star is governed by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that flux is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (`T⁴`). The amplitude of the signal from the rotating spotted star is the relative difference between the maximum flux (from the unspotted side) and the minimum flux (from the spotted side). The formula for this amplitude is `Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`, where `f` is the spot filling factor, `T_spot` is the spot temperature, and `T_eff` is the star's effective temperature.\n2.  **Calculate the Exoplanet Signal (Transit Depth)**: The brightness drop from a transiting exoplanet is simply the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. The formula is `Transit Depth = (R_pl / R_star)²`.\n3.  **Equate and Solve**: By setting the starspot amplitude equal to the transit depth, I can solve for the relative radius, `R_pl / R_star`. This will involve taking the square root of the calculated amplitude.\n4.  **Analyze Candidate Answers**: The provided candidate answers show a strong consensus on the calculation method, consistently arriving at a numerical result of approximately 0.32. The discrepancies in their final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) indicate that they were likely working with different or shuffled lists of options. My final step will be to match the robustly calculated numerical result to the specific list of options provided in the original question.\n\nI will now implement this plan in Python to find the definitive answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_exoplanet_radius_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves for the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet\n    that would produce the same brightness variation as a rotating spotted star.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the given physical parameters.\n    T_eff = 6000.0  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\n    T_spot = 5000.0 # Temperature of the spots (6000K - 1000K)\n    f = 0.20        # Filling factor of spots on the spotted hemisphere\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation from the spots.\n    # According to the Stefan-Boltzmann law (Flux ∝ T^4), the relative amplitude\n    # of the signal is given by the formula: A = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4].\n    try:\n        amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        print(\"Error: The star's effective temperature cannot be zero.\")\n        return\n\n    # Step 3: Equate the spot amplitude to the exoplanet transit depth.\n    # The transit depth is given by (R_planet / R_star)^2.\n    # To find the equivalent planet radius, we set the two signals equal:\n    # (R_pl / R_star)^2 = amplitude\n    # Therefore, R_pl / R_star = sqrt(amplitude).\n    if amplitude < 0:\n        print(\"Error: Calculated amplitude is negative, cannot take the square root.\")\n        return\n        \n    relative_radius = math.sqrt(amplitude)\n\n    # Step 4: Print the results and compare with the original options.\n    print(f\"The calculated amplitude of the brightness variation from spots is: {amplitude:.5f}\")\n    print(f\"The required radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the star (Rpl/Rstar) is: {relative_radius:.4f}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nComparing the result to the given options:\")\n    options = {\n        \"A\": 0.07,\n        \"B\": 0.32,\n        \"C\": 0.39,\n        \"D\": 0.11\n    }\n    \n    print(f\"A) ~{options['A']}\")\n    print(f\"B) ~{options['B']}\")\n    print(f\"C) ~{options['C']}\")\n    print(f\"D) ~{options['D']}\")\n\n    # Find the closest option based on the calculated value.\n    closest_option_letter = min(options, key=lambda k: abs(options[k] - relative_radius))\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe calculated value {relative_radius:.4f} is closest to option {closest_option_letter} (~{options[closest_option_letter]}).\")\n\n# Execute the function to find the solution.\nsolve_exoplanet_radius_problem()\n```\n<<<B>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The calculated amplitude of the brightness variation from spots is: 0.10355\nThe required radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the star (Rpl/Rstar) is: 0.3218\n\nComparing the result to the given options:\nA) ~0.07\nB) ~0.32\nC) ~0.39\nD) ~0.11\n\nThe calculated value 0.3218 is closest to option B (~0.32).\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Calculate the Amplitude of Brightness Variation from Starspots**\n    The first step is to determine the amplitude of the light curve variation caused by the star's rotation.

The discrepancies in the final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) stem from the fact that the options were likely presented in a different order for each candidate. The calculation itself is robust and consistent across all answers.\n\nHere is a definitive step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the question's option list.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Calculate the Amplitude of Brightness Variation from Starspots**\n\nThe first step is to determine the amplitude of the light curve variation caused by the star's rotation. This variation is due to the difference in flux between the unspotted hemisphere and the spotted hemisphere. The flux (F) emitted by a surface is governed by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that flux is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (`F ∝ T⁴`).\n\n*   **Given Parameters:**\n    *   Star's effective temperature, `T_eff` = 6000 K\n    *   Spot temperature, `T_spot` = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n    *   Spot filling factor on the spotted hemisphere, `f` = 20% = 0.20\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (`F_max`):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The flux is proportional to `T_eff⁴`.\n*   **Minimum Flux (`F_min`):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. The flux is a weighted average of the hot photosphere and the cooler spots: `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴`.\n\nThe amplitude of the signal (`A`) is the relative change in flux, which is what photometric observations measure:\n`A = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n\nThis simplifies to the widely used formula:\n`A = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]`\n\nPlugging in the numerical values:\n`A = 0.20 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴]`\n`A = 0.20 * [1 - (5/6)⁴]`\n`A = 0.20 * [1 - 625 / 1296]`\n`A = 0.20 * [671 / 1296]`\n`A ≈ 0.20 * 0.51775`\n`A ≈ 0.10355`\n\nThe starspots cause a brightness variation with an amplitude of approximately 10.36%.\n\n**2. Equate Spot Amplitude to Exoplanet Transit Depth**\n\nThe second step is to find the size of a hypothetical exoplanet that would cause the same brightness drop. The drop in brightness during a transit (the transit depth, `δ`) is the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n\n`δ = Area_planet / Area_star = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\nWe need to find the relative radius (`R_pl / R_star`) where the transit depth equals the amplitude from the starspots.\n`δ = A`\n`(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.10355`\n\n**3. Solve for the Relative Radius**\n\nTo find the relative radius, we take the square root of the amplitude:\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.10355)`\n`R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218`\n\n**4.

Comparing this to the options provided in the question:\n*   A) ~0.39\n*   B) ~0.11\n*   C) ~0.07\n*   D) ~0.32\n\nThe calculated value of `~0.3218` is an excellent match for option D.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **T⁴ Dependence:** The most critical physical principle is that flux scales with the **fourth power of temperature**. A common mistake in physics problems is to assume a linear relationship, which would lead to an incorrect result.\n*   **R² Dependence:** The transit depth is proportional to the ratio of the **areas**, which means it scales with the **square of the radius ratio**. A final square root is necessary to solve for the radius ratio.\n*   **Relative Amplitude:** The calculation must be for the *relative* flux drop (`ΔF/F_max`), not the absolute difference. The formula `A = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]` correctly models this.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The problem states the star's radius is equal to the Sun's. This information is not needed to find the *relative* radius (`R_pl/R_star`) and is included to test a complete understanding of the required variables.\n*   **Option Matching:** As seen in the candidate answers, correctly calculating the numerical value is only part of the task.

We need to calculate the relative amplitude of this brightness change.\n*   **Scenario 2: Exoplanet Transit.** A planet passes in front of the star, blocking a fraction of its light. The depth of this transit is determined by the relative sizes of the planet and the star.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Amplitude of the Starspot Signal**\n\nThe brightness (flux, F) of a radiating surface is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that flux is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (`F ∝ T⁴`).\n\n*   **Given Parameters:**\n    *   Star's effective temperature (`T_eff`): 6000 K\n    *   Spot temperature (`T_spot`): 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n    *   Spot filling factor on the spotted hemisphere (`f`): 20% or 0.20\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (`F_max`):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The flux is proportional to `T_eff⁴`.\n*   **Minimum Flux (`F_min`):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. The flux is a weighted average of the hot and cool parts: `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴`.\n\nThe amplitude (`A`) of the signal is the relative flux drop:\n`A = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n\nThis simplifies to the formula:\n`A = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]`\n\nPlugging in the numerical values:\n`A = 0.20 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴]`\n`A = 0.20 * [1 - (5/6)⁴]`\n`A = 0.20 * [1 - 625 / 1296]`\n`A = 0.20 * [671 / 1296]`\n`A ≈ 0.20 * 0.51775`\n`A ≈ 0.10355`\n\nSo, the star's brightness varies by approximately 10.4% due to the spots.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Equivalent Exoplanet Size**\n\nThe brightness drop caused by a transiting exoplanet (the transit depth, `δ`) is the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n\n`δ = (Area_planet / Area_star) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\nTo produce the same signal, the transit depth must equal the starspot amplitude:\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = A ≈ 0.10355`\n\nTo find the relative radius (`R_pl / R_star`), we take the square root:\n`R_pl / R_star = √0.10355`\n`R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218`\n\n### **Step 4: Compare with Options and Final Decision**\n\nThe calculated value for the relative radius is approximately **0.32**.

A linear approximation would yield an incorrect result.\n2.  **Amplitude Formula:** The amplitude of the spot signal is the *relative* flux drop, `(F_max - F_min) / F_max`. The derivation leads to the correct formula `f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]`.\n3.  **Transit Depth Formula:** The transit depth is proportional to the ratio of the *areas* (`R²`), not the radii (`R`). This necessitates taking a square root at the final step to find the radius ratio.\n4.  **Information Check:** The star's radius being equal to that of the Sun is extraneous information, as the question asks for the *relative* radius `R_pl/R_star`.\n5.  **Answer Matching:** The calculation consistently yields `~0.32`.

This involves two main calculations: finding the amplitude of the brightness variation from the spots and then equating it to the transit depth of an exoplanet.\n\n**1. Calculate the Amplitude of Brightness Variation from Starspots**\n\nThe brightness, or flux (F), emitted by a star's surface is governed by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that flux is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (`F ∝ T⁴`).\n\n*   **Given Parameters:**\n    *   Star's effective temperature, `T_eff` = 6000 K\n    *   Spot temperature, `T_spot` = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n    *   Spot filling factor on the spotted hemisphere, `f` = 20% = 0.20\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (`F_max`):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The flux is proportional to `T_eff⁴`.\n*   **Minimum Flux (`F_min`):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. The flux is a weighted average of the hot photosphere (fraction `1-f`) and the cooler spots (fraction `f`). The flux is proportional to `(1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴`.\n\nThe amplitude of the signal is the relative drop in brightness, which is what a light curve measures.\n`Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n\nThis simplifies to the standard formula for spot-induced amplitude:\n`Amplitude = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]`\n\nPlugging in the numerical values:\n`Amplitude = 0.20 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴]`\n`Amplitude = 0.20 * [1 - (5/6)⁴]`\n`Amplitude = 0.20 * [1 - 625 / 1296]`\n`Amplitude = 0.20 * [671 / 1296]`\n`Amplitude ≈ 0.20 * 0.51775`\n`Amplitude ≈ 0.10355`\n\nThe starspots cause a brightness variation with an amplitude of approximately 10.36%.\n\n**2. Equate Spot Amplitude to Exoplanet Transit Depth**\n\nThe drop in brightness caused by a transiting exoplanet (the transit depth, `δ`) is the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n\n`δ = Area_planet / Area_star = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\nTo produce the same signal, the transit depth must equal the amplitude from the starspots.\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = Amplitude`\n`(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.10355`\n\n**3. Solve for the Relative Radius**\n\nTo find the relative radius, we take the square root of the amplitude:\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.10355)`\n`R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218`\n\n**4. Compare with Options and Conclude**\n\nThe calculated value for the relative radius is approximately **0.32**. Comparing this to the options provided in the question:\n*   A) ~0.39\n*   B) ~0.07\n*   **C) ~0.32**\n*   D) ~0.11\n\nThe calculated value of `~0.3218` is a clear match for option C.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **T⁴ Dependence:** The most critical physical principle is that flux scales with the fourth power of temperature (Stefan-Boltzmann law). A common mistake in similar problems is to assume a linear relationship with temperature, which would lead to an incorrect result.\n*   **Transit Depth Formula:** The transit depth is proportional to the ratio of the *areas* (`R²`), not the radii (`R`). A final square root is necessary to find the radius ratio. Forgetting this step is a frequent error.\n*   **Relative Amplitude:** The calculation must be for the *relative* change in flux (`ΔF/F`), not the absolute difference. The formula `Amplitude = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]` correctly models this relative drop from the maximum (unspotted) brightness.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The fact that the star's radius is equal to the Sun's is extra information not needed for the calculation, as the question asks for the *relative* radius `R_pl/R_star`.\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers:** The provided candidate answers show a strong consensus on the numerical calculation, with all of them arriving at the value of `~0.32`. The discrepancies in their final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) indicate that they were likely working from different or scrambled lists of options. The calculation itself is robustly confirmed.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\nThe fundamental task is to calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the rotating spotted star and then determine the size of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce a transit signal of the same amplitude.\n\n**1.
