This is a chiral molecule with a single, defined stereocenter at the C5 position.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol by LAH. This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since the starting material is already chiral, the attack of the hydride on the planar carbonyl group results in the formation of two products. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected. The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n*   **Products:** The two products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** These two molecules are **diastereomers** because they differ in configuration at one stereocenter (C3) but are the same at another (C5).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols by excess NaBH₄, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Because the starting material is achiral and symmetric, we must consider all possible stereoisomers of the product.\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are non-superimposable mirror images, forming a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts from an achiral precursor, they are formed in a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same meso compound.\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: a pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in physical properties (e.g., polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Analysis:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers and have different physical properties. They will be separated into **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as **1 peak**.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, has different physical properties, and will elute as a separate, **second peak**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different (constitutional isomers) and will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks (Normal-Phase):** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can differentiate between all non-identical stereoisomers, including both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Analysis:**\n    *   The mixture contains five unique stereoisomers:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   A chiral column is designed to resolve all of them. Each of the five compounds will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n*   **Total Peaks (Chiral):** Each of the 5 stereoisomers will produce a distinct peak. Therefore, there will be **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule, provided as a single enantiomer with a defined stereocenter at the C5 position.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at the C3 position is reduced to a secondary alcohol using LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride). This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material is already chiral, the attack of the hydride ion on the planar carbonyl group can occur from two different faces, resulting in the formation of two products. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected. The two products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** These two molecules are **diastereomers** because they have two stereocenters, with one being the same (5S) and the other being different (3R vs. 3S).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetric, achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols using excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride), forming pentane-2,4-diol. This creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** Because the starting material is achiral and the product molecule is symmetric, we must consider all possible stereoisomers:\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two are non-superimposable mirror images, forming a pair of **enantiomers**.

(3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   A chiral column is designed to resolve all of these distinct stereoisomers.\n*   **Total Peaks (Chiral):** Each of the 5 stereoisomers will produce a distinct peak. Therefore, there will be **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to systematically determine the number of products from each reaction and their stereochemical relationships. Then, based on the principles of chromatography, I will calculate the number of peaks expected for the combined product mixture on both normal-phase (achiral) and chiral HPLC columns. Finally, I will match the calculated numbers to the given options.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n1.  **Analyze Reaction I:** Determine the number and type of stereoisomers formed from the reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n2.  **Analyze Reaction II:** Determine the number and type of stereoisomers formed from the reduction of pentane-2,4-dione.\n3.  **Calculate Normal-Phase HPLC Peaks:** Based on the combined product mixture, count the number of expected peaks on an achiral column.

This is a chiral molecule with a single, defined stereocenter at carbon C5.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at the C3 position is reduced to a secondary alcohol using LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride). This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material is already a single enantiomer, the attack of the hydride ion on the planar carbonyl group creates two products. The original stereocenter at C5 remains unchanged. The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have two stereocenters.

The (2S, 4R) configuration represents the same meso molecule.\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomeric products are formed (a pair of enantiomers and one meso compound).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle:** An achiral HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Analysis:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers.

This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule, meaning it is not superimposable on its mirror image. It has a single, defined stereocenter at carbon C5 with the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at the C3 position is reduced to a secondary alcohol using LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride). This chemical transformation creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products and Stereochemistry:** The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction. The attack of the hydride ion on the planar carbonyl group at C3 can occur from either face, leading to two possible configurations at the new stereocenter: (R) and (S). This results in the formation of two distinct products:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are **diastereomers**. Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical properties, such as polarity and boiling point.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral because it has an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols by excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride), forming pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products and Stereochemistry:** Since the starting material is achiral, we must consider all possible stereoisomers of the product. The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and (2R, 4S).\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, making them a pair of **enantiomers**. Because the reaction starts from an achiral precursor, they are formed in a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    2.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, which means it is superimposable on its mirror image ((2S, 4R)). It is therefore an achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomeric products are formed (a pair of enantiomers and one meso compound).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in physical properties, primarily polarity. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers because enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   **Peak Analysis:**\n    *   **From Reaction I:** The two products are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated by the column. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** The products are a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound. The enantiomers will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the enantiomers, has different physical properties and will be separated from them, giving a second peak. This results in **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different (constitutional isomers) and will have different retention times.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase. This chiral environment allows the column to interact differently with all unique stereoisomers, enabling the separation of enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Peak Analysis:** The combined mixture contains a total of five unique stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.

Therefore, there will be **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows there will be **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram.

The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have two stereocenters. They have the same configuration at one center (C5) but a different configuration at the other (C3). This makes them **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral because it has an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols using excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride), forming pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** Because the starting material is achiral and the product molecule is symmetric, we must consider all possible stereoisomers.\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They form a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts from an achiral precursor, they are formed in a 1:1 ratio, known as a racemic mixture.\n    2.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image ((2S, 4R)). It is therefore an achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomeric products are formed (a pair of enantiomers and one meso compound).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   **Peak Analysis:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The enantiomeric pair will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the pair, has different physical properties and will be separated from them. This gives **2 peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are structurally different molecules (constitutional isomers) and will have different retention times.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase. This allows it to interact differently with all non-identical stereoisomers, enabling the separation of enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Peak Analysis:** The combined mixture contains a total of five unique stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   A chiral column is designed to resolve all of these distinct molecules.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Each of the 5 unique stereoisomers will produce its own peak. Therefore, there will be **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows there will be **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule, provided as a single enantiomer with a defined stereocenter at the C5 position.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at the C3 position is reduced to a secondary alcohol using LAH. This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material is already chiral, the attack of the hydride on the planar carbonyl group can occur from two different faces, resulting in the formation of two products. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected. The two products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** These two molecules are **diastereomers** because they have two stereocenters, with one being the same (5S) and the other being different (3R vs. 3S).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetric, achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols using excess NaBH₄, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** Because the starting material is achiral and symmetric, we must consider all possible stereoisomers of the product.\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two are non-superimposable mirror images, forming a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts from achiral materials, they are produced in a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    2.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration is the same molecule.\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: a pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in physical properties (e.g., polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Analysis:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers and have different physical properties. They will be separated into **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as **1 peak**.\n    *   The meso compound from Reaction II is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, has different physical properties, and will be separated, giving another **1 peak**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇ ether-alcohols) are structurally distinct from the products of Reaction II (C₅ diols) and will have different retention times, so no peaks will accidentally overlap.\n*   **Total Peaks (Normal-Phase):** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with all non-identical stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Analysis:**\n    *   The combined mixture contains a total of five unique stereoisomers (two from Reaction I and three from Reaction II).\n    *   A chiral column is designed to resolve all of them. Each of the five compounds will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n*   **Total Peaks (Chiral):** Each of the 5 stereoisomers will produce a distinct peak. Therefore, there will be **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram.

The enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the enantiomers, has different physical properties and will be separated from them. This gives **2 peaks** for the products of Reaction II.\n    *   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different (constitutional isomers) and will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with all non-identical stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Analysis of the Mixture:**\n    *   The combined mixture contains a total of five unique stereoisomers: two from Reaction I and three from Reaction II.\n    *   A chiral column is designed to resolve all of them.

    "Here is a systematic analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n1.  **Stereochemistry of Reactions:** The key is to correctly identify the number of stereoisomers produced in each reaction and their relationships (enantiomers, diastereomers, meso compounds).\n2.  **Starting Material Chirality:** Reaction I starts with a single enantiomer (chiral), while Reaction II starts with an achiral molecule. This has a significant impact on the stereochemical outcome.\n3.  **Principles of HPLC Separation:** It is crucial to distinguish between the capabilities of achiral (normal-phase) and chiral HPLC columns.\n    *   **Normal-Phase (Achiral) HPLC:** Separates compounds with different physical properties.

Reaction II starts with an achiral molecule (pentane-2,4-dione).\n2.  **Creation of New Stereocenters:** Both reactions involve the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol, which can create new stereocenters. We must determine how many new centers are formed and what the stereochemical outcome is.\n3.  **Relationship Between Products:** Identify the relationship between the products formed in each reaction (e.g., enantiomers, diastereomers, meso compounds).\n4.  **Principles of HPLC Separation:**\n    *   **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral):** Separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers but **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n    *   **Chiral HPLC:** Uses a chiral stationary phase to separate all non-identical stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This molecule is chiral, with a defined stereocenter at C5.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at C3 is reduced by LAH to a secondary alcohol. This creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material is already chiral, the attack of the hydride on the planar carbonyl group creates two products. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected.\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are **diastereomers** because they have two stereocenters, with one being identical (5S) and the other being different (3R vs. 3S).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** **Two** diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is symmetric and achiral.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced by excess NaBH₄ to form pentane-2,4-diol. This creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** Because the starting material is achiral and the product molecule is symmetric, we must consider all possible stereoisomers:\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These are non-superimposable mirror images, forming a pair of **enantiomers**. They are produced as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    2.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** **Three** distinct stereoisomers are formed (a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound).\n\n**Step 3: Predict the Number of Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle:** An achiral column separates diastereomers but not enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis of the Mixture:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The enantiomers will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the pair, will be separated from them. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different (constitutional isomers) and will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral column separates all unique stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis of the Mixture:** The combined mixture contains a total of five unique stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n*   A chiral column is designed to resolve all of these distinct molecules.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Each of the 5 unique stereoisomers will produce its own peak. Therefore, there will be **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows there will be **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC**. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a detailed step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule with a single, defined stereocenter at carbon C5.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at the C3 position is reduced to a secondary alcohol using LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride). This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material is already a single enantiomer, the attack of the hydride ion on the planar carbonyl group creates two products. The original stereocenter at C5 remains unchanged. The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have two stereocenters. They have the same configuration at C5 but different configurations at C3. Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral because it has an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols by excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride), forming pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** Because the starting material is achiral and the product molecule is symmetric, we must consider all possible stereoisomers.\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These are non-superimposable mirror images, forming a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts from achiral materials, they are produced as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    2.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration represents the same meso molecule.\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomeric products are formed (a pair of enantiomers and one meso compound).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle:** An achiral HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Analysis:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, has different physical properties, and will be separated from them, giving a second peak. This results in **2 peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇ ether-alcohols) and Reaction II (C₅ diols) are structurally different (constitutional isomers) and will have different retention times.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with all non-identical stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Analysis:** The combined mixture contains a total of five unique stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   A chiral column is designed to resolve all of these distinct stereoisomers.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Each of the 5 unique stereoisomers will produce its own peak. Therefore, there will be **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule, meaning it is not superimposable on its mirror image. It has a single, defined stereocenter at carbon C5 with the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at the C3 position is reduced to a secondary alcohol using LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride). This chemical transformation creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products and Stereochemistry:** The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction. The attack of the hydride ion on the planar carbonyl group at C3 can occur from either face, leading to two possible configurations at the new stereocenter: (R) and (S). This results in the formation of two distinct products:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are **diastereomers**. Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical properties, such as polarity and boiling point.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral because it has an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols by excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride), forming pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products and Stereochemistry:** Since the starting material is achiral, we must consider all possible stereoisomers of the product. The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and (2R, 4S).\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, making them a pair of **enantiomers**. Because the reaction starts from an achiral precursor, they are formed in a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    2.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, which means it is superimposable on its mirror image ((2S, 4R)). It is therefore an achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomeric products are formed (a pair of enantiomers and one meso compound).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in physical properties, primarily polarity. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers because enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   **Peak Analysis:**\n    *   **From Reaction I:** The two products are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated by the column. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** The products are a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound. The enantiomers will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the enantiomers, has different physical properties and will be separated from them, giving a second peak. This results in **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different (constitutional isomers) and will have different retention times.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase. This chiral environment allows the column to interact differently with all unique stereoisomers, enabling the separation of enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Peak Analysis:** The combined mixture contains a total of five unique stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   A chiral column is designed to resolve all of these distinct molecules.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Each of the 5 unique stereoisomers will produce its own peak. Therefore, there will be **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows there will be **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram.

The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected. The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S). This results in the formation of (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two products are **diastereomers** because they differ in configuration at one stereocenter (C3) but are the same at another (C5).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two distinct diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.

This is a chiral molecule, provided as a single enantiomer with a defined stereocenter at the C5 position.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at the C3 position is reduced to a secondary alcohol using LAH. This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since the starting material is already chiral, the attack of the hydride ion on the planar carbonyl group can occur from either face, resulting in the formation of two products. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected.\n*   **Products:** The two products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** These two molecules are **diastereomers** because they have two stereocenters, with one being the same (5S) and the other being different (3R vs. 3S).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetric, achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols using excess NaBH₄, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Because the starting material is achiral and the resulting molecule is symmetric, we must consider all possible stereoisomers.\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two are non-superimposable mirror images, forming a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts from achiral materials, they are produced in a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    2.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same molecule.\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed (a pair of enantiomers and one meso compound).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Analysis:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated into **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as **1 peak**.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, has different physical properties, and will be separated from them, giving a **second peak**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different (different molecular formulas and connectivity) and will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks (Normal-Phase):** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with all non-identical stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Analysis:**\n    *   The total mixture contains five unique stereoisomers:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   A chiral column is designed to resolve all of these distinct stereoisomers.\n*   **Total Peaks (Chiral):** Each of the 5 stereoisomers will produce a distinct peak. Therefore, there will be **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram.

This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected by the reaction. The attack of the hydride ion on the planar carbonyl group at C3 can occur from either face, leading to the formation of two possible configurations at the new stereocenter: (R) and (S).\n*   **Products:** The reaction yields two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have one stereocenter in common (5S) and one that is different (3R vs. 3S).

This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since the starting material is achiral and the product molecule is symmetric, we must consider all possible stereoisomers.\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are non-superimposable mirror images. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts with achiral materials, they are formed in a 1:1 ratio (a racemic mixture).\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same molecule.\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomeric products are formed: one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase HPLC column is **achiral**. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity).

They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** The products are a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound. The enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will be separated from them, giving a second peak. This results in **2 peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n    *   **Overall:** The products from Reaction I (C₇ ether-alcohols) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C₅ diols) and will have different retention times. Therefore, no peaks will accidentally overlap.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a **chiral** stationary phase.

The enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the enantiomers, has different physical properties and will be separated from them. This gives **2 peaks** for the products of Reaction II.\n    *   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different (constitutional isomers) and will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with all non-identical stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Analysis of the Mixture:**\n    *   The combined mixture contains a total of five unique stereoisomers: two from Reaction I and three from Reaction II.\n    *   A chiral column is designed to resolve all of them. The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated, and the two enantiomers and the meso compound from Reaction II will also all be separated from each other.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Each of the 5 unique stereoisomers will produce its own peak. Therefore, there will be **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
