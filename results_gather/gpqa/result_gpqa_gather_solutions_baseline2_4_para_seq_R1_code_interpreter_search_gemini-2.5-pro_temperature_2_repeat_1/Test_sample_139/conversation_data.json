The discrepancies in the final letter choices among the candidates are solely due to the shuffling of the multiple-choice options for each instance. The correct reasoning is as follows:\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identification of Substance B and the Isotope:** The initial clue is the melting point of substance B being \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   **Calculation:** 277 K is equivalent to 3.85 °C (277 - 273.15).\n    *   **Identification:** This value is a near-perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) at 3.82 °C and is significantly different from the 0 °C melting point of normal water (H₂O).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Substance B is D₂O. This establishes that the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the problem is **Deuterium (D)**.\n\n2.  **Identification of Gas W:** Gas W is described as having molecules where the number of neutrons and protons are equal.\n    *   **Analysis:** A Deuterium atom (D or ²H) contains 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a molecule of Deuterium gas (D₂) contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Gas W is **D₂**, as it perfectly fits the description within the established chemical context.\n\n3.  **Identification of Substance X:** The identity of X is deduced from the organic chemistry clue.\n    *   **Analysis:** X reacts with a \"keto acid\" (which has at least 3 oxygen atoms) to yield a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. This transformation requires the reduction of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol group (-CH₂OH), a reaction that demands a very powerful reducing agent.\n    *   **Identification of the Analog:** The common laboratory reagent capable of this is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Milder reagents like Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) are not strong enough.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The \"very close analog\" is LiAlH₄. Since substance X is known to contain the Deuterium isotope, X must be **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n4.  **Verification of the Full Reaction:** The overall reaction scheme provides confirmation.\n    *   **Reaction:** `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)↑`.\n    *   This reaction is consistent with all clues: it is known to be violent; it produces a gas W (D₂); it forms a precipitate G (Aluminium Deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃); and heating G releases substance B (D₂O).\n\n**Final Calculation**\n\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in substance X (LiAlD₄).\n\n*   **Elements Present:** The elements are Hydrogen (H, Z=1), Lithium (Li, Z=3), and Aluminium (Al, Z=13).\n*   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminium (Al).\n*   **Mass Summation:** The task is to sum the integer mass numbers of all atoms of these two elements.\n    *   Mass of the heaviest element (Aluminium): There is one atom of ²⁷Al.

Total mass = 4 × 2 = **8**.\n*   **Cumulative Mass:** 27 + 8 = **35**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe logical reasoning is robust and consistently leads to a calculated value of 35. Matching this result to the options provided in the question:\nA) 31\nB) 29\nC) 25\nD) 35\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a systematic, step-by-step solution based on a synthesis of the reasoning provided.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Heavier Isotope and Substance B**\nThe first crucial clue is that Substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\".\n*   We convert this temperature to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 K = 3.85 °C.\n*   The melting point of standard water (H₂O) is 0 °C. However, the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope Deuterium (D or ²H), is 3.82 °C.\n*   The given value is a nearly perfect match for heavy water. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**, and the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned is **Deuterium (D)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Gas W**\nThe problem states that the gas W, released during the reaction, has molecules containing an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n*   Given that the reaction system involves Deuterium (which has 1 proton and 1 neutron), the most logical candidate is Deuterium gas, **D₂**.\n*   A molecule of D₂ consists of two deuterium atoms, for a total of **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. This perfectly matches the clue.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Substance X using all clues**\nSubstance X is identified by its chemical reactivity, particularly in an organic chemistry context.\n*   **The Analogy Clue**: X has a \"very close analog\" that is a common reagent in organic chemistry.\n*   **The Reduction Clue**: X reacts with a keto acid to yield a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid has a minimum of 3 oxygen atoms (one from the ketone group >C=O and two from the carboxylic acid group -COOH). To reduce the oxygen count to 2, the carboxylic acid must be reduced to a primary alcohol (-COOH → -CH₂OH).\n*   **Identifying the Reagent**: This powerful reduction is characteristic of a strong reducing agent. The most common reagent capable of this is **Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄)**. Milder reagents, like sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), are not strong enough.\n*   **Identifying X**: The \"analog\" is LiAlH₄. Since Substance X contains the deuterium isotope, **Substance X must be Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Complete Reaction Sequence**\nLet's confirm this identification fits all the clues:\n*   The reaction of LiAlD₄ (X) with a liquid (Y) must be with D₂O to produce the observed deuterated products.\n*   Reaction: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)↑`\n*   This reaction is famously **violent**.\n*   It produces **D₂ gas (W)**.\n*   It forms an insoluble precipitate **(G)**, which would be Aluminium Deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃.\n*   When G (Al(OD)₃) is heated, it decomposes to release B (D₂O) (`2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`).\n*   All clues are consistent with this scheme.\n\n**Step 5: Perform the Final Calculation**\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n*   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n*   The constituent elements are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminium (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n*   The **lightest element** by atomic number is Hydrogen.\n*   The **heaviest element** by atomic number is Aluminium.\n*   We sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements, using their integer isotopic mass numbers (as implied by the integer answer choices):\n    *   Mass of the four atoms of the lightest element (Hydrogen as Deuterium, ²H): 4 × 2 = **8**\n    *   Mass of the one atom of the heaviest element (Aluminium, ²⁷Al): 1 × 27 = **27**\n*   **Cumulative Sum = 8 + 27 = 35**\n\n**Step 6: Select the Final Answer**\nThe calculated result is 35. Comparing this to the options provided in the question:\nA) 35\nB) 29\nC) 31\nD) 25\n\nThe calculated value of 35 corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n**1. Synthesis of the Unanimous Reasoning**\n\nAll the candidate answers, despite their differing final letter choices, follow an identical and chemically sound logical path. This consistency across multiple analyses strongly supports the correctness of the reasoning.\n\n*   **Step 1: Identifying the Heavier Isotope and Substance B.** The clue that Substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\" is universally identified as the key starting point. 277 K is 3.85 °C. This is an almost perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) at 3.82 °C, and distinctly different from normal water (H₂O) at 0 °C. This establishes that **Substance B is D₂O** and the heavier isotope is **Deuterium (D or ²H)**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identifying Gas W.** The clue that the molecule of gas W contains an equal number of protons and neutrons is also consistently interpreted. Given the presence of Deuterium (1 proton, 1 neutron), the only logical candidate for the gas is **D₂**. A molecule of D₂ contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly fitting the description.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identifying Substance X.** The identification of substance X relies on multiple clues, primarily from organic chemistry.\n    *   The reaction of X with a \"keto acid\" to give a product with 2 oxygen atoms requires a powerful reducing agent, as it involves the reduction of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol group (-CH₂OH).\n    *   The well-known organic reagent capable of this is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Milder reagents are not strong enough.\n    *   Since X contains Deuterium, it is concluded that **Substance X is Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Verifying the Overall Reaction.** The complete reaction, `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G) + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)`, aligns with all remaining clues: it is a violent reaction, it produces a gas (W=D₂), and it forms a precipitate (G=Al(OD)₃) which, upon heating, releases heavy water (B=D₂O).\n\n**2. The Calculation**\n\nThe final task is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n\n*   **Identify the Elements:** The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminium (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n*   **Lightest and Heaviest:** Based on atomic number, the lightest element is Hydrogen (present as Deuterium) and the heaviest is Aluminium.\n*   **Sum the Masses:** Using the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes:\n    *   Mass of one atom of the heaviest element (²⁷Al) = **27**\n    *   Mass of four atoms of the lightest element (²H or D) = 4 × 2 = **8**\n*   **Cumulative Sum:** 27 + 8 = **35**\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis performed by all candidate agents consistently and correctly leads to the numerical answer of 35. The question's options are:\nA) 25\nB) 31\nC) 35\nD) 29\n\nThe calculated value of 35 matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the unanimous reasoning found in the candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B and the Heavier Isotope**: The first key clue is the melting point of substance B, which is \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   **Conversion:** 277 K is equivalent to 3.85 °C (by subtracting 273.15).\n    *   **Identification:** This value is an almost perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. This is significantly different from the 0 °C melting point of normal water (H₂O).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This confidently identifies **Substance B as D₂O** and reveals the \"heavier isotope\" to be **Deuterium (D or ²H)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W**: Gas W is described as having molecules with an equal number of protons and neutrons.\n    *   **Analysis:** In a chemical system confirmed to contain Deuterium (1 proton, 1 neutron), the most logical gaseous product is di-deuterium gas, **D₂**.\n    *   **Verification:** A D₂ molecule contains two deuterium atoms, for a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, which perfectly matches the clue.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X**: The identity of X is deduced from several clues, particularly its use in organic chemistry.\n    *   **The Analog:** The problem mentions a \"very close analog\" of X is a common organic reagent.\n    *   **The Reaction:** This reagent reduces a \"keto acid\" to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid has at least 3 oxygen atoms (one in the ketone group >C=O and two in the carboxylic acid group -COOH). To reduce the oxygen count to 2, the carboxylic acid group must be reduced to a primary alcohol (-COOH → -CH₂OH).\n    *   **Reagent Power:** This specific transformation requires a very powerful reducing agent. **Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄)** is the standard reagent for this, as weaker agents like Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) cannot perform this reaction.\n    *   **Conclusion for X:** The analog is LiAlH₄. Since Substance X contains the deuterium isotope, **Substance X must be Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n4.  **Verify the Entire Reaction Sequence**: The full reaction sequence must be consistent with all clues.\n    *   **Reaction:** `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4 D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4 D₂ (W)↑`.\n    *   This reaction is famously violent, releases D₂ gas (W), and forms an insoluble precipitate (G), which is Aluminium deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃. Upon heating, G (Al(OD)₃) decomposes to Al₂O₃ and D₂O (B). All parts of the problem are consistent with this identification.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X.\n\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements Present (by atomic number):** Hydrogen (Z=1), Lithium (Z=3), and Aluminium (Z=13).\n*   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminium (Al).\n*   **Mass Summation:** The task is to sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements, using their integer isotopic mass numbers.\n    *   Mass of the one atom of the heaviest element (Aluminium, ²⁷Al) = **27**.\n    *   Mass of the four atoms of the lightest element (Hydrogen as Deuterium, ²H) = 4 × 2 = **8**.\n*   **Cumulative Mass = 27 + 8 = 35**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe rigorous and consistent analysis across all candidate answers leads to a calculated value of 35.

A keto acid has at least 3 oxygen atoms (ketone + carboxylic acid). The reduction of the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to an alcohol group (-CH₂OH) removes one oxygen.\n    *   This is a powerful reduction that can only be accomplished by strong reducing agents. Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) is the classic reagent for this task.\n    *   Since Substance X contains Deuterium, it must be the deuterated analog.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Substance X is Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n\n4.  **Verification of the Entire Reaction**:\n    *   The proposed reaction is `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)↑`.\n    *   This reaction is known to be violent, produces D₂ gas, and forms a precipitate (Aluminium deuteroxide), which upon heating would yield D₂O.

Identification of Key Substances and Isotopes**\n\n*   **Substance B and the \"Heavier Isotope\"**: The first critical clue is that substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   **Analysis**: Converting the temperature from Kelvin to Celsius gives `277 K - 273.15 K = 3.85 °C`. This value is nearly identical to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C, and distinctly different from that of normal water (H₂O), which is 0 °C.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This confidently identifies **Substance B as D₂O**. It also establishes that the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the problem is **Deuterium (D, or ²H)**.\n\n*   **Gas W**: Gas W is described as having molecules with \"the same number of neutrons and protons.\"\n    *   **Analysis**: Given the presence of Deuterium (which has 1 proton and 1 neutron), the most logical candidate is Deuterium gas, D₂. A D₂ molecule contains two Deuterium atoms, resulting in a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This perfectly matches the description.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n*   **Substance X**: Several clues converge to reveal the identity of substance X.\n    *   **Analysis of Organic Chemistry Reaction**: X's \"very close analog\" is a common reagent that reduces a \"keto acid\" to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid possesses at least 3 oxygen atoms (one in the ketone group and two in the carboxylic acid group). For the final product to have only 2 oxygen atoms, the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) must be reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), a reaction that removes one oxygen atom. This powerful reduction requires a very strong reducing agent. Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) is the canonical reagent for this task, whereas milder agents like Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) are not strong enough. This identifies the \"analog\" as LiAlH₄.\n    *   **Conclusion on X**: Since Substance X contains the heavy isotope Deuterium, it must be the deuterated version of the analog, which is **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**2. Verification of the Entire Reaction**\n\nThe entire chemical process described must be consistent with the identified substances.\n*   The reaction is `LiAlD₄ (X) + Y → G + W`.\n*   To produce deuterated products like W (D₂), the liquid reactant **Y must be heavy water (D₂O)**.\n*   The full reaction is `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G) + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)`.\n*   This reaction is known to be violent, produces D₂ gas (W), and forms an insoluble precipitate (G), Aluminium deuteroxide `Al(OD)₃`. When this precipitate (G) is heated, it decomposes to release D₂O (B). This aligns perfectly with all the information given.\n\n**3.

The mass number of Deuterium is **2**. The total mass is `4 × 2 = 8`.\n    *   **Cumulative Sum**: `27 + 8 = 35`.\n\nThe final calculated value is 35.

The consensus among the agents is strong and provides a clear path to the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of Key Substances\n\nThe analysis begins by breaking down the clues to identify the unknown substances.\n\n*   **Substance B and the Heavier Isotope:** The first key clue is that substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   Converting the temperature to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   This value is a nearly perfect match for the melting point of **heavy water (D₂O)**, which is 3.82 °C. This is significantly different from the melting point of normal water (H₂O) at 0 °C.\n    *   This allows for the confident identification of **Substance B as D₂O**. This also establishes that the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the problem is **Deuterium (D or ²H)**, an isotope of hydrogen.\n\n*   **Gas W:** The gas W, produced during the reaction, has molecules with an equal number of protons and neutrons.\n    *   Given the established presence of Deuterium (1 proton, 1 neutron), the most logical candidate for the gas is **Deuterium gas (D₂)**.\n    *   A molecule of D₂ contains two deuterium atoms, for a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, which perfectly matches the description.\n\n*   **Substance X and the Organic Chemistry Reaction:**\n    *   We are told that a \"very close analog\" of Substance X is a common organic chemistry reagent.\n    *   Substance X reacts with a \"certain keto acid\" to produce a compound with only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid has a minimum of 3 oxygen atoms (one from a ketone group, >C=O, and two from a carboxylic acid group, -COOH). To reduce the oxygen count to 2, the carboxylic acid group must be reduced to a primary alcohol (-COOH → -CH₂OH).\n    *   This transformation requires a powerful reducing agent. **Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄)** is a classic reagent known for this capability, whereas milder reagents like Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) cannot perform this specific reduction.\n    *   Therefore, the \"analog\" is LiAlH₄. Since Substance X contains the deuterium isotope, **Substance X must be Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n### Step 2: Verification of the Overall Reaction\n\nThe proposed identities must fit the entire reaction sequence.\n*   The reaction is `X + Y → W + G`, which is described as violent.\n*   Substituting the identified substances: `LiAlD₄ (X) + Y → D₂ (W) + G`.\n*   For all products to be deuterated, the liquid reactant **Y must be D₂O**.\n*   The full reaction is: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)↑`.\n*   This reaction is famously violent, produces D₂ gas (W), and forms an insoluble precipitate, **Aluminium deuteroxide (G)**. When heated, this precipitate decomposes (`2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`) to release Substance B (D₂O). All clues are consistent.\n\n### Step 3: Performing the Final Calculation\n\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n*   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n*   The constituent elements, ordered by atomic number, are Hydrogen (Z=1), Lithium (Z=3), and Aluminium (Z=13).\n*   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen.\n*   The **heaviest element** is Aluminium.\n*   The calculation requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements, using the mass numbers for their specific isotopes.\n    *   The isotope of hydrogen present is Deuterium (D or ²H), which has a mass number of **2**. There are four deuterium atoms.\n    *   The stable isotope of aluminium is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of **27**. There is one aluminium atom.\n*   **Calculation**:\n    *   Total mass from Aluminium (heaviest element) = 1 × 27 = 27\n    *   Total mass from Hydrogen (lightest element, as Deuterium) = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   **Cumulative Sum = 27 + 8 = 35**\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer\n\nThe result of the calculation is 35. Comparing this to the provided options:\nA) 29\nB) 25\nC) 35\nD) 31\n\nThe calculated value of 35 matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem based on a synthesis of the correct reasoning paths.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Heavier Isotope and Key Substances**\n\n*   The first critical clue is the melting point of Substance B, which is \"very close to 277 K\". We convert this temperature to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 K = 3.85 °C. This value is almost a perfect match for the melting point of **heavy water (D₂O)**, which is 3.82 °C. This is distinctly different from the 0 °C melting point of normal water (H₂O). This allows us to confidently identify **Substance B as D₂O** and establishes that the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the problem is **Deuterium (D or ²H)**.\n*   The gas W released has molecules containing an equal number of neutrons and protons. Given the established context of Deuterium (1 proton, 1 neutron), the gas must be **di-deuterium (D₂)**. A D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly fitting the description.\n*   Since the products are deuterated (D₂O and D₂), the violent reaction must occur with a deuterated liquid, making liquid **Y = D₂O**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Substance X using the Organic Chemistry Clue**\n\n*   A \"very close analog\" of X is a common organic reagent.\n*   This reagent reacts with a \"keto acid\" to produce a compound with only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid has at least 3 oxygen atoms (e.g., from a ketone group, >C=O, and a carboxylic acid group, -COOH). To reduce the final oxygen count to 2, the carboxylic acid group must be reduced to a primary alcohol (-COOH → -CH₂OH).\n*   This is a very powerful reduction that cannot be achieved by milder reagents like sodium borohydride (NaBH₄). However, it is a characteristic reaction of the strong reducing agent **Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄)**.\n*   Therefore, the \"very close analog\" is LiAlH₄. Since Substance X contains the deuterium isotope, we can conclude that **Substance X is Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**Step 3: Verify the Complete Reaction**\n\nThe proposed reaction is `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)↑`.\n*   This reaction is famously violent, matching the description.\n*   It produces a precipitate (G), Aluminium Deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃).\n*   Heating this precipitate (`2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`) would release Substance B (D₂O).\n*   All the provided clues are consistent with X being LiAlD₄.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Final Calculation**\n\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n*   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n*   The elements present, ordered by atomic number (Z), are Hydrogen (Z=1), Lithium (Z=3), and Aluminium (Z=13).\n*   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen. The isotope present is Deuterium (²H), which has a mass number of 2. There are four such atoms.\n*   The **heaviest element** is Aluminium. Its stable isotope is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of 27. There is one such atom.\n*   We sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements:\n    *   Total mass from lightest element (Hydrogen as Deuterium): 4 atoms × 2 amu/atom = 8\n    *   Total mass from heaviest element (Aluminium): 1 atom × 27 amu/atom = 27\n    *   **Cumulative Sum = 8 + 27 = 35**\n\nComparing our result with the options:\nA) 25\nB) 29\nC) 35\nD) 31\n\nThe calculated value of 35 matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a highly consistent and logical approach to solving this multi-step chemistry problem. The final decision is based on a synthesis of this unanimous reasoning.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identification of Key Substances from Chemical Clues**\n\n*   **Substance B and the Heavier Isotope:** The starting point is the melting point of substance B, given as \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   **Conversion:** 277 K is equivalent to 3.85 °C (since 0 °C = 273.15 K).\n    *   **Analysis:** This value is an almost perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. It is distinctly different from the melting point of normal water (H₂O) at 0 °C.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This reliably identifies Substance B as **D₂O**. Consequently, the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the problem is **Deuterium (D)**, which is the isotope ²H.\n\n*   **Gas W:** The clue states that the molecule of gas W \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\"\n    *   **Analysis:** Given the context of a reaction involving deuterium (which has 1 proton and 1 neutron), the most logical candidate is deuterium gas, **D₂**. A D₂ molecule contains two deuterium atoms, resulting in a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, which perfectly matches the clue.\n\n*   **Substance X and the Organic Reaction:**\n    *   **Clue:** The \"very close analog\" of X is a common organic chemistry reagent that can reduce a \"keto acid\" to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms.\n    *   **Analysis:** A keto acid has at least 3 oxygen atoms (from a ketone group `>C=O` and a carboxylic acid group `-COOH`). To reduce the oxygen count to 2, the carboxylic acid group must be reduced to a primary alcohol (`-COOH` → `-CH₂OH`). This specific reduction is a difficult transformation that requires a very powerful reducing agent.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The well-known reagent capable of this is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (**LiAlH₄**). Therefore, the \"analog\" is LiAlH₄. Since Substance X contains the deuterium isotope, **Substance X must be Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**2. Verification of the Overall Reaction**\nThe full reaction is consistent with all the remaining clues:\n*   The reaction `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4 D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4 D₂ (W)↑` is known to be violent, produces D₂ gas (W), and forms a precipitate (G), which would be Aluminium deuteroxide. When heated, the precipitate G releases B (D₂O). All clues are consistent.\n\n**3. Final Calculation**\n\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements Present:** The elements, in order of increasing atomic number (Z), are Hydrogen (Z=1), Lithium (Z=3), and Aluminium (Z=13).\n*   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (H), present as its isotope Deuterium (D).\n*   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminium (Al).\n*   **Calculation:** The instruction requires summing the integer mass numbers of *all* atoms of these two elements.\n    *   Mass contribution from the **heaviest** element (Aluminium): There is one atom of ²⁷Al. Mass = 1 × 27 = **27**.\n    *   Mass contribution from the **lightest** element (Hydrogen as Deuterium): There are four atoms of ²H (Deuterium). Mass = 4 × 2 = **8**.\n    *   **Cumulative Sum = 27 + 8 = 35**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe detailed chemical analysis and the final calculation are consistently supported by all candidate answers, leading to the numerical result of **35**. Comparing this with the options provided in the question:\nA) 25\nB) 29\nC) 35\nD) 31\n\nThe calculated value of 35 matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of the provided candidate answers, there is a clear and unanimous consensus on the chemical reasoning and the final numerical result. The path to the solution can be broken down into the following careful steps.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identification of the Heavier Isotope and Key Substances**\n\n*   **Substance B and the Isotope:** The primary clue is the melting point of substance B, which is \"very close to 277 K\".

This value is an excellent match for the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) at 3.82 °C and is distinctly different from normal water (H₂O) at 0 °C.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Substance B is heavy water, D₂O. This establishes that the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned is Deuterium (D or ²H).\n\n*   **Gas W:** The clue for gas W is that its molecules contain an equal number of protons and neutrons. Given that the reaction involves Deuterium (1 proton, 1 neutron), the only logical gas is di-deuterium, D₂.\n    *   **Conclusion:** A D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly matching the description.

A keto acid has at least 3 oxygen atoms (one from a ketone, `>C=O`, and two from a carboxylic acid, `-COOH`). Reducing the final oxygen count requires the powerful reduction of the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH → -CH₂OH`).\n    *   **Clue 2: Reagent Identity:** This specific, powerful reduction is characteristic of Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄), ruling out milder reagents like Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The analog is LiAlH₄. Since Substance X contains the isotope Deuterium, **Substance X is Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**2. Verification of the Full Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   The proposed identities must fit the entire description of the reaction: `X reacts violently with liquid Y ... with the release of a gas W ... and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B`.\n*   Let's write the reaction with our identified substances:\n    `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)↑`\n*   This reaction chemistry is perfectly consistent with all clues:\n    *   The reaction is known to be violent.\n    *   Liquid Y must be D₂O to yield deuterated products.\n    *   Gas W (D₂) is released.\n    *   A precipitate G, Aluminium deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃), is formed.\n    *   Heating G (`2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`) correctly releases B (D₂O).\n\n**3.

X (or its \"very close analog\") reduces a \"keto acid\" to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid has at least 3 oxygen atoms (in the ketone >C=O and carboxylic acid -COOH groups). Reducing the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH) removes one oxygen atom.

Identification of the \"Heavier Isotope\" and Substance B**\nThe first crucial piece of information is the melting point of substance B, stated to be \"very close to 277 K\".\n*   **Conversion:** 277 K is equivalent to 3.85 °C (by subtracting 273.15).\n*   **Comparison:** This value is a near-perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. It is distinctly different from the 0 °C melting point of normal water (H₂O).\n*   **Conclusion:** This allows for a confident identification of **Substance B as D₂O**. This also establishes that the \"heavier isotope\" at the center of the problem is **Deuterium (D or ²H)**, an isotope of hydrogen.\n\n**2. Identification of Gas W**\nThe gas W released during the reaction is described as having molecules that contain \"the same number of neutrons and protons.\"\n*   **Analysis:** Based on the presence of deuterium (which has 1 proton and 1 neutron per atom), the most logical candidate is deuterium gas, D₂. A D₂ molecule consists of two deuterium atoms, giving it a total of **2 protons and 2 neutrons**.\n*   **Conclusion:** This perfectly matches the description, identifying **Gas W as D₂**.\n\n**3. Identification of Substance X**\nSeveral clues combine to reveal the identity of Substance X.\n*   **The Organic Chemistry Clue:** X's \"very close analog\" is a common reagent that reduces a \"keto acid\" to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid has at least 3 oxygen atoms (one in the ketone >C=O group and two in the carboxylic acid -COOH group). Reducing the product to only 2 oxygens requires the powerful reduction of the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol group (-COOH → -CH₂OH).\n*   **Identifying the Reagent:** This specific and powerful reduction is a hallmark of **Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄)**. Milder, common reducing agents like Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) are not strong enough to reduce carboxylic acids. Therefore, the \"analog\" is LiAlH₄.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since Substance X contains the deuterium isotope, it must be the deuterated version: **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**4. Verification of the Overall Reaction**\nWith all key substances identified, we can check for consistency with the remaining clues.\n*   **The Reaction:** The reaction is between X (LiAlD₄) and a liquid Y. Since all products are deuterated, Y must be heavy water (D₂O). The full reaction is: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4 D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4 D₂ (W)↑`.\n*   **Checking the Clues:** This reaction is famously violent, it releases D₂ gas (W), and it forms an insoluble precipitate, Aluminium deuteroxide (G), which upon heating would release D₂O (B). All clues are satisfied.\n\n**5. Final Calculation**\nThe final step is to calculate the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄.\n*   **Elements Present (by atomic number):** Hydrogen (Z=1), Lithium (Z=3), Aluminium (Z=13).\n*   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen.\n*   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminium.\n*   **Summing the Masses:** The calculation requires summing the integer mass numbers of the specific isotopes for all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n    *   Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen, as Deuterium): There are **four** atoms of Deuterium (²H), each with a mass number of 2.

Identification of Key Substances**\n\nThe consensus across all provided answers is correct and follows a clear logical path:\n*   **Substance B and the Heavier Isotope**: The clue is the melting point of substance B, \"very close to 277 K\". This translates to approximately 3.85 °C. This value is an almost perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) at 3.82 °C, and distinctly different from normal water (H₂O) at 0 °C. This is the crucial first step, establishing that the heavier isotope is **Deuterium (D, or ²H)**.\n*   **Gas W**: The gas W has molecules with an equal number of protons and neutrons.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, incorporating careful points identified from the candidate answers.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance B and the \"Heavier Isotope\"**\n\nThe first clue is that the melting point of substance B is \"very close to 277 K\".\n*   **Reasoning:** Convert the temperature from Kelvin to Celsius: `277 K - 273.15 K = 3.85 °C`. This value is a near-perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. This is distinctly different from the melting point of normal water (H₂O) at 0 °C.\n*   **Conclusion:** Substance B is heavy water, D₂O. This establishes that the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the reaction is Deuterium (D or ²H).\n*   **Careful Point 1:** Correctly converting the Kelvin temperature is the essential first step to identifying the substance.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Gas W**\n\nThe gas W is described as having molecules that contain an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n*   **Reasoning:** Since the reaction system contains Deuterium, which is an isotope with 1 proton and 1 neutron, the most logical candidate is Deuterium gas, D₂. A D₂ molecule contains two such atoms, for a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n*   **Conclusion:** Gas W is D₂.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** The clue applies to the entire molecule (2 protons, 2 neutrons), not the individual atoms, reinforcing the identification of the gas as D₂.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Substance X**\n\nThe identity of X is revealed by several clues, primarily its role in an organic reaction.\n*   **Reasoning:** X's \"very close analog\" reduces a \"keto acid\" to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid possesses at least 3 oxygen atoms (one from a ketone group >C=O, and two from a carboxylic acid group -COOH). For the product to have only 2 oxygen atoms, the carboxylic acid group must be reduced to a primary alcohol (-COOH → -CH₂OH). This is a difficult reaction that requires a very strong reducing agent. The canonical reagent for this transformation is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Since Substance X contains the heavy isotope Deuterium, it must be the deuterated version.\n*   **Conclusion:** Substance X is Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n*   **Careful Point 3:** Recognizing that reducing a carboxylic acid requires a powerful agent like LiAlH₄ (and not a milder one like NaBH₄) is a critical piece of chemical knowledge needed to solve the puzzle.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Entire Reaction**\n\nThe complete reaction scheme must be consistent with all given information.\n*   **Reasoning:** The violent reaction of X (LiAlD₄) with liquid Y produces W (D₂) and precipitate G. The liquid Y must be D₂O to yield deuterated products. The full reaction is: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)↑`. This reaction is famously violent. The precipitate G is Aluminium Deuteroxide, which when heated decomposes to release D₂O (B).\n*   **Conclusion:** All clues align perfectly with the identified substances.\n\n**Step 5: Perform the Final Calculation**\n\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements Present:** The constituent elements are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminium (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n*   **Lightest & Heaviest Elements:** The lightest element is Hydrogen (by lowest atomic number, Z=1). The heaviest element is Aluminium (by highest atomic number, Z=13).\n*   **Mass Summation:** The calculation requires summing the integer mass numbers of *all* atoms of these two elements, using their specific isotopes.\n    *   Mass of heaviest element (Aluminium): There is one atom of ²⁷Al. Mass contribution = **27**.\n    *   Mass of lightest element (Hydrogen as Deuterium): There are four atoms of ²H. Mass contribution = 4 × 2 = **8**.\n*   **Cumulative Sum:** 27 + 8 = **35**.\n*   **Careful Point 4:** The \"lightest\" and \"heaviest\" elements are determined by atomic number (Z), not the mass number of the specific isotope.\n*   **Careful Point 5:** The word \"cumulative\" and the plural \"masses\" indicate that the mass of *all four* atoms of the lightest element (Hydrogen) must be included.\n*   **Careful Point 6:** It is critical to use the mass number of the specific isotope involved (2 for Deuterium), not the mass of the most common hydrogen isotope (1) or the average atomic weight from the periodic table.\n\nThe calculation consistently and robustly yields the number 35. Comparing this to the given options:\n\nA) 35\nB) 25\nC) 29\nD) 31\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"

However, the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope Deuterium (D or ²H), is 3.82 °C.\n*   The given value is a nearly perfect match for heavy water. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**, and the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned is **Deuterium (D)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Gas W**\nThe problem states that the gas W, released during the reaction, has molecules containing an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n*   Given that the reaction system involves Deuterium (which has 1 proton and 1 neutron), the most logical candidate is Deuterium gas, **D₂**.\n*   A molecule of D₂ consists of two deuterium atoms, for a total of **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. This perfectly matches the clue.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Substance X using all clues**\nSubstance X is identified by its chemical reactivity, particularly in an organic chemistry context.\n*   **The Analogy Clue**: X has a \"very close analog\" that is a common reagent in organic chemistry.\n*   **The Reduction Clue**: X reacts with a keto acid to yield a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid has a minimum of 3 oxygen atoms (one from the ketone group >C=O and two from the carboxylic acid group -COOH). To reduce the oxygen count to 2, the carboxylic acid must be reduced to a primary alcohol (-COOH → -CH₂OH).\n*   **Identifying the Reagent**: This powerful reduction is characteristic of a strong reducing agent. The most common reagent capable of this is **Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄)**. Milder reagents, like sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), are not strong enough.\n*   **Identifying X**: The \"analog\" is LiAlH₄. Since Substance X contains the deuterium isotope, **Substance X must be Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Complete Reaction Sequence**\nLet's confirm this identification fits all the clues:\n*   The reaction of LiAlD₄ (X) with a liquid (Y) must be with D₂O to produce the observed deuterated products.\n*   Reaction: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)↑`\n*   This reaction is famously **violent**.\n*   It produces **D₂ gas (W)**.\n*   It forms an insoluble precipitate **(G)**, which would be Aluminium Deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃.\n*   When G (Al(OD)₃) is heated, it decomposes to release B (D₂O) (`2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`).\n*   All clues are consistent with this scheme.\n\n**Step 5: Perform the Final Calculation**\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n*   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n*   The constituent elements are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminium (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n*   The **lightest element** by atomic number is Hydrogen.\n*   The **heaviest element** by atomic number is Aluminium.\n*   We sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements, using their integer isotopic mass numbers (as implied by the integer answer choices):\n    *   Mass of the four atoms of the lightest element (Hydrogen as Deuterium, ²H): 4 × 2 = **8**\n    *   Mass of the one atom of the heaviest element (Aluminium, ²⁷Al): 1 × 27 = **27**\n*   **Cumulative Sum = 8 + 27 = 35**\n\n**Step 6: Select the Final Answer**\nThe calculated result is 35.

Synthesis of the Unanimous Reasoning**\n\nAll the candidate answers, despite their differing final letter choices, follow an identical and chemically sound logical path. This consistency across multiple analyses strongly supports the correctness of the reasoning.\n\n*   **Step 1: Identifying the Heavier Isotope and Substance B.** The clue that Substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\" is universally identified as the key starting point. 277 K is 3.85 °C. This is an almost perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) at 3.82 °C, and distinctly different from normal water (H₂O) at 0 °C. This establishes that **Substance B is D₂O** and the heavier isotope is **Deuterium (D or ²H)**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identifying Gas W.** The clue that the molecule of gas W contains an equal number of protons and neutrons is also consistently interpreted. Given the presence of Deuterium (1 proton, 1 neutron), the only logical candidate for the gas is **D₂**. A molecule of D₂ contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly fitting the description.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identifying Substance X.** The identification of substance X relies on multiple clues, primarily from organic chemistry.\n    *   The reaction of X with a \"keto acid\" to give a product with 2 oxygen atoms requires a powerful reducing agent, as it involves the reduction of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol group (-CH₂OH).\n    *   The well-known organic reagent capable of this is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Milder reagents are not strong enough.\n    *   Since X contains Deuterium, it is concluded that **Substance X is Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Verifying the Overall Reaction.** The complete reaction, `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G) + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)`, aligns with all remaining clues: it is a violent reaction, it produces a gas (W=D₂), and it forms a precipitate (G=Al(OD)₃) which, upon heating, releases heavy water (B=D₂O).\n\n**2. The Calculation**\n\nThe final task is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n\n*   **Identify the Elements:** The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminium (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n*   **Lightest and Heaviest:** Based on atomic number, the lightest element is Hydrogen (present as Deuterium) and the heaviest is Aluminium.\n*   **Sum the Masses:** Using the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes:\n    *   Mass of one atom of the heaviest element (²⁷Al) = **27**\n    *   Mass of four atoms of the lightest element (²H or D) = 4 × 2 = **8**\n*   **Cumulative Sum:** 27 + 8 = **35**\n\n**3.

This is significantly different from the 0 °C melting point of normal water (H₂O).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This confidently identifies **Substance B as D₂O** and reveals the \"heavier isotope\" to be **Deuterium (D or ²H)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W**: Gas W is described as having molecules with an equal number of protons and neutrons.\n    *   **Analysis:** In a chemical system confirmed to contain Deuterium (1 proton, 1 neutron), the most logical gaseous product is di-deuterium gas, **D₂**.\n    *   **Verification:** A D₂ molecule contains two deuterium atoms, for a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, which perfectly matches the clue.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X**: The identity of X is deduced from several clues, particularly its use in organic chemistry.\n    *   **The Analog:** The problem mentions a \"very close analog\" of X is a common organic reagent.\n    *   **The Reaction:** This reagent reduces a \"keto acid\" to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms.

Since Substance X contains the deuterium isotope, **Substance X must be Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n4.  **Verify the Entire Reaction Sequence**: The full reaction sequence must be consistent with all clues.\n    *   **Reaction:** `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4 D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4 D₂ (W)↑`.\n    *   This reaction is famously violent, releases D₂ gas (W), and forms an insoluble precipitate (G), which is Aluminium deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃.

A keto acid has at least 3 oxygen atoms (ketone + carboxylic acid). The reduction of the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to an alcohol group (-CH₂OH) removes one oxygen.\n    *   This is a powerful reduction that can only be accomplished by strong reducing agents. Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) is the classic reagent for this task.\n    *   Since Substance X contains Deuterium, it must be the deuterated analog.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Substance X is Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n\n4.  **Verification of the Entire Reaction**:\n    *   The proposed reaction is `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)↑`.\n    *   This reaction is known to be violent, produces D₂ gas, and forms a precipitate (Aluminium deuteroxide), which upon heating would yield D₂O.

Therefore, Substance B is D₂O, and the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the problem is **Deuterium (D or ²H)**.\n\n2.  **Identification of Gas W:**\n    Gas W is described as having molecules with an \"equal number of neutrons and protons.\"\n    *   **Analysis:** A Deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. The most logical candidate for gas W, within a deuterated system, is **D₂ gas**. A D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly fitting the description.\n\n3.  **Identification of Substance X:**\n    This step requires combining several clues, a process consistently followed by all candidates.\n    *   **Organic Chemistry Clue:** Substance X's \"very close analog\" reduces a keto acid (which has at least 3 oxygen atoms) to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms.

Identification of Key Substances and Isotopes**\n\n*   **Substance B and the \"Heavier Isotope\"**: The first critical clue is that substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   **Analysis**: Converting the temperature from Kelvin to Celsius gives `277 K - 273.15 K = 3.85 °C`. This value is nearly identical to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C, and distinctly different from that of normal water (H₂O), which is 0 °C.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This confidently identifies **Substance B as D₂O**. It also establishes that the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the problem is **Deuterium (D, or ²H)**.\n\n*   **Gas W**: Gas W is described as having molecules with \"the same number of neutrons and protons.\"\n    *   **Analysis**: Given the presence of Deuterium (which has 1 proton and 1 neutron), the most logical candidate is Deuterium gas, D₂. A D₂ molecule contains two Deuterium atoms, resulting in a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This perfectly matches the description.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Gas W is D₂**.\n\n*   **Substance X**: Several clues converge to reveal the identity of substance X.\n    *   **Analysis of Organic Chemistry Reaction**: X's \"very close analog\" is a common reagent that reduces a \"keto acid\" to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid possesses at least 3 oxygen atoms (one in the ketone group and two in the carboxylic acid group). For the final product to have only 2 oxygen atoms, the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) must be reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), a reaction that removes one oxygen atom. This powerful reduction requires a very strong reducing agent. Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) is the canonical reagent for this task, whereas milder agents like Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) are not strong enough. This identifies the \"analog\" as LiAlH₄.\n    *   **Conclusion on X**: Since Substance X contains the heavy isotope Deuterium, it must be the deuterated version of the analog, which is **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**2. Verification of the Entire Reaction**\n\nThe entire chemical process described must be consistent with the identified substances.\n*   The reaction is `LiAlD₄ (X) + Y → G + W`.\n*   To produce deuterated products like W (D₂), the liquid reactant **Y must be heavy water (D₂O)**.\n*   The full reaction is `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G) + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)`.\n*   This reaction is known to be violent, produces D₂ gas (W), and forms an insoluble precipitate (G), Aluminium deuteroxide `Al(OD)₃`. When this precipitate (G) is heated, it decomposes to release D₂O (B). This aligns perfectly with all the information given.\n\n**3. Final Calculation**\n\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n\n*   **Substance X**: LiAlD₄\n*   **Constituent Elements**: Lithium (Li, Atomic Number Z=3), Aluminium (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n*   **Lightest Element**: Hydrogen (identified by the lowest atomic number, Z=1).\n*   **Heaviest Element**: Aluminium (identified by the highest atomic number, Z=13).\n*   **Calculation**: The task requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements, using the mass numbers of their specific isotopes as found in the molecule.\n    *   Mass contribution from the **heaviest element** (Aluminium): There is one atom of Aluminium. Its stable isotope is ²⁷Al, so its mass number is **27**.\n    *   Mass contribution from the **lightest element** (Hydrogen): There are four atoms, all present as the isotope Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of Deuterium is **2**. The total mass is `4 × 2 = 8`.\n    *   **Cumulative Sum**: `27 + 8 = 35`.\n\nThe final calculated value is 35. Comparing this to the options given in the prompt: A) 35, B) 31, C) 29, D) 25. The correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, based on the logical reasoning presented in the candidate answers. The consensus among the agents is strong and provides a clear path to the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of Key Substances\n\nThe analysis begins by breaking down the clues to identify the unknown substances.\n\n*   **Substance B and the Heavier Isotope:** The first key clue is that substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   Converting the temperature to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   This value is a nearly perfect match for the melting point of **heavy water (D₂O)**, which is 3.82 °C. This is significantly different from the melting point of normal water (H₂O) at 0 °C.\n    *   This allows for the confident identification of **Substance B as D₂O**. This also establishes that the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the problem is **Deuterium (D or ²H)**, an isotope of hydrogen.\n\n*   **Gas W:** The gas W, produced during the reaction, has molecules with an equal number of protons and neutrons.\n    *   Given the established presence of Deuterium (1 proton, 1 neutron), the most logical candidate for the gas is **Deuterium gas (D₂)**.\n    *   A molecule of D₂ contains two deuterium atoms, for a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, which perfectly matches the description.\n\n*   **Substance X and the Organic Chemistry Reaction:**\n    *   We are told that a \"very close analog\" of Substance X is a common organic chemistry reagent.\n    *   Substance X reacts with a \"certain keto acid\" to produce a compound with only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid has a minimum of 3 oxygen atoms (one from a ketone group, >C=O, and two from a carboxylic acid group, -COOH). To reduce the oxygen count to 2, the carboxylic acid group must be reduced to a primary alcohol (-COOH → -CH₂OH).\n    *   This transformation requires a powerful reducing agent. **Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄)** is a classic reagent known for this capability, whereas milder reagents like Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) cannot perform this specific reduction.\n    *   Therefore, the \"analog\" is LiAlH₄. Since Substance X contains the deuterium isotope, **Substance X must be Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n### Step 2: Verification of the Overall Reaction\n\nThe proposed identities must fit the entire reaction sequence.\n*   The reaction is `X + Y → W + G`, which is described as violent.\n*   Substituting the identified substances: `LiAlD₄ (X) + Y → D₂ (W) + G`.\n*   For all products to be deuterated, the liquid reactant **Y must be D₂O**.\n*   The full reaction is: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)↑`.\n*   This reaction is famously violent, produces D₂ gas (W), and forms an insoluble precipitate, **Aluminium deuteroxide (G)**. When heated, this precipitate decomposes (`2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`) to release Substance B (D₂O). All clues are consistent.\n\n### Step 3: Performing the Final Calculation\n\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n*   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n*   The constituent elements, ordered by atomic number, are Hydrogen (Z=1), Lithium (Z=3), and Aluminium (Z=13).\n*   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen.\n*   The **heaviest element** is Aluminium.\n*   The calculation requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements, using the mass numbers for their specific isotopes.\n    *   The isotope of hydrogen present is Deuterium (D or ²H), which has a mass number of **2**. There are four deuterium atoms.\n    *   The stable isotope of aluminium is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of **27**. There is one aluminium atom.\n*   **Calculation**:\n    *   Total mass from Aluminium (heaviest element) = 1 × 27 = 27\n    *   Total mass from Hydrogen (lightest element, as Deuterium) = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   **Cumulative Sum = 27 + 8 = 35**\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer\n\nThe result of the calculation is 35. Comparing this to the provided options:\nA) 29\nB) 25\nC) 35\nD) 31\n\nThe calculated value of 35 matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem based on a synthesis of the correct reasoning paths.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Heavier Isotope and Key Substances**\n\n*   The first critical clue is the melting point of Substance B, which is \"very close to 277 K\". We convert this temperature to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 K = 3.85 °C. This value is almost a perfect match for the melting point of **heavy water (D₂O)**, which is 3.82 °C. This is distinctly different from the 0 °C melting point of normal water (H₂O). This allows us to confidently identify **Substance B as D₂O** and establishes that the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the problem is **Deuterium (D or ²H)**.\n*   The gas W released has molecules containing an equal number of neutrons and protons. Given the established context of Deuterium (1 proton, 1 neutron), the gas must be **di-deuterium (D₂)**. A D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly fitting the description.\n*   Since the products are deuterated (D₂O and D₂), the violent reaction must occur with a deuterated liquid, making liquid **Y = D₂O**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Substance X using the Organic Chemistry Clue**\n\n*   A \"very close analog\" of X is a common organic reagent.\n*   This reagent reacts with a \"keto acid\" to produce a compound with only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid has at least 3 oxygen atoms (e.g., from a ketone group, >C=O, and a carboxylic acid group, -COOH). To reduce the final oxygen count to 2, the carboxylic acid group must be reduced to a primary alcohol (-COOH → -CH₂OH).\n*   This is a very powerful reduction that cannot be achieved by milder reagents like sodium borohydride (NaBH₄). However, it is a characteristic reaction of the strong reducing agent **Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄)**.\n*   Therefore, the \"very close analog\" is LiAlH₄. Since Substance X contains the deuterium isotope, we can conclude that **Substance X is Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**Step 3: Verify the Complete Reaction**\n\nThe proposed reaction is `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)↑`.\n*   This reaction is famously violent, matching the description.\n*   It produces a precipitate (G), Aluminium Deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃).\n*   Heating this precipitate (`2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`) would release Substance B (D₂O).\n*   All the provided clues are consistent with X being LiAlD₄.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Final Calculation**\n\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n*   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n*   The elements present, ordered by atomic number (Z), are Hydrogen (Z=1), Lithium (Z=3), and Aluminium (Z=13).\n*   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen. The isotope present is Deuterium (²H), which has a mass number of 2. There are four such atoms.\n*   The **heaviest element** is Aluminium. Its stable isotope is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of 27. There is one such atom.\n*   We sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements:\n    *   Total mass from lightest element (Hydrogen as Deuterium): 4 atoms × 2 amu/atom = 8\n    *   Total mass from heaviest element (Aluminium): 1 atom × 27 amu/atom = 27\n    *   **Cumulative Sum = 8 + 27 = 35**\n\nComparing our result with the options:\nA) 25\nB) 29\nC) 35\nD) 31\n\nThe calculated value of 35 matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a highly consistent and logical approach to solving this multi-step chemistry problem. The final decision is based on a synthesis of this unanimous reasoning.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identification of Key Substances from Chemical Clues**\n\n*   **Substance B and the Heavier Isotope:** The starting point is the melting point of substance B, given as \"very close to 277 K\".\n    *   **Conversion:** 277 K is equivalent to 3.85 °C (since 0 °C = 273.15 K).\n    *   **Analysis:** This value is an almost perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. It is distinctly different from the melting point of normal water (H₂O) at 0 °C.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This reliably identifies Substance B as **D₂O**. Consequently, the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the problem is **Deuterium (D)**, which is the isotope ²H.\n\n*   **Gas W:** The clue states that the molecule of gas W \"contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\"\n    *   **Analysis:** Given the context of a reaction involving deuterium (which has 1 proton and 1 neutron), the most logical candidate is deuterium gas, **D₂**. A D₂ molecule contains two deuterium atoms, resulting in a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, which perfectly matches the clue.\n\n*   **Substance X and the Organic Reaction:**\n    *   **Clue:** The \"very close analog\" of X is a common organic chemistry reagent that can reduce a \"keto acid\" to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms.\n    *   **Analysis:** A keto acid has at least 3 oxygen atoms (from a ketone group `>C=O` and a carboxylic acid group `-COOH`). To reduce the oxygen count to 2, the carboxylic acid group must be reduced to a primary alcohol (`-COOH` → `-CH₂OH`). This specific reduction is a difficult transformation that requires a very powerful reducing agent.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The well-known reagent capable of this is Lithium Aluminium Hydride (**LiAlH₄**). Therefore, the \"analog\" is LiAlH₄. Since Substance X contains the deuterium isotope, **Substance X must be Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**2. Verification of the Overall Reaction**\nThe full reaction is consistent with all the remaining clues:\n*   The reaction `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4 D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4 D₂ (W)↑` is known to be violent, produces D₂ gas (W), and forms a precipitate (G), which would be Aluminium deuteroxide. When heated, the precipitate G releases B (D₂O). All clues are consistent.\n\n**3. Final Calculation**\n\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements Present:** The elements, in order of increasing atomic number (Z), are Hydrogen (Z=1), Lithium (Z=3), and Aluminium (Z=13).\n*   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (H), present as its isotope Deuterium (D).\n*   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminium (Al).\n*   **Calculation:** The instruction requires summing the integer mass numbers of *all* atoms of these two elements.\n    *   Mass contribution from the **heaviest** element (Aluminium): There is one atom of ²⁷Al. Mass = 1 × 27 = **27**.\n    *   Mass contribution from the **lightest** element (Hydrogen as Deuterium): There are four atoms of ²H (Deuterium). Mass = 4 × 2 = **8**.\n    *   **Cumulative Sum = 27 + 8 = 35**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe detailed chemical analysis and the final calculation are consistently supported by all candidate answers, leading to the numerical result of **35**.

Identification of the Heavier Isotope and Key Substances**\n\n*   **Substance B and the Isotope:** The primary clue is the melting point of substance B, which is \"very close to 277 K\". This translates to approximately 3.85 °C. This value is an excellent match for the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) at 3.82 °C and is distinctly different from normal water (H₂O) at 0 °C.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Substance B is heavy water, D₂O. This establishes that the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned is Deuterium (D or ²H).\n\n*   **Gas W:** The clue for gas W is that its molecules contain an equal number of protons and neutrons. Given that the reaction involves Deuterium (1 proton, 1 neutron), the only logical gas is di-deuterium, D₂.\n    *   **Conclusion:** A D₂ molecule contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly matching the description.

A keto acid has at least 3 oxygen atoms (one from a ketone, `>C=O`, and two from a carboxylic acid, `-COOH`). Reducing the final oxygen count requires the powerful reduction of the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH → -CH₂OH`).\n    *   **Clue 2: Reagent Identity:** This specific, powerful reduction is characteristic of Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄), ruling out milder reagents like Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The analog is LiAlH₄. Since Substance X contains the isotope Deuterium, **Substance X is Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**2. Verification of the Full Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   The proposed identities must fit the entire description of the reaction: `X reacts violently with liquid Y ... with the release of a gas W ... and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B`.\n*   Let's write the reaction with our identified substances:\n    `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)↑`\n*   This reaction chemistry is perfectly consistent with all clues:\n    *   The reaction is known to be violent.\n    *   Liquid Y must be D₂O to yield deuterated products.\n    *   Gas W (D₂) is released.\n    *   A precipitate G, Aluminium deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃), is formed.\n    *   Heating G (`2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`) correctly releases B (D₂O).\n\n**3.

Analysis of Chemical Clues and Substance Identification**\n\n*   **Identifying Substance B and the Heavier Isotope:** The initial clue states that Substance B has a melting point \"very close to 277 K.\"\n    *   **Careful Point:** Converting from Kelvin to Celsius (277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C) is the first step.\n    *   This temperature is a nearly perfect match for the melting point of **heavy water (D₂O)**, which is 3.82 °C, and distinctly different from that of normal water (H₂O), which melts at 0 °C.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This identifies Substance B as D₂O and, critically, establishes that the \"heavier isotope\" involved in the problem is **Deuterium (D or ²H)**, an isotope of hydrogen.\n\n*   **Identifying Gas W:** The gas W is described as having molecules with an equal number of neutrons and protons.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This clue must be interpreted within the context that the system contains Deuterium.\n    *   A single Deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a molecule of Deuterium gas (**D₂**) would have a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly matching the description.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Gas W is D₂.\n\n*   **Identifying Substance X:** This requires synthesizing multiple clues.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The key lies in understanding the specifics of the organic chemistry reaction. X (or its \"very close analog\") reduces a \"keto acid\" to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid has at least 3 oxygen atoms (in the ketone >C=O and carboxylic acid -COOH groups). Reducing the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH) removes one oxygen atom. This transformation requires a very powerful reducing agent.\n    *   **Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄)** is a famous, powerful reagent capable of this reduction, whereas other common, milder reagents (like NaBH₄) are not.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The analog is LiAlH₄. Since Substance X contains the isotope Deuterium, **Substance X must be Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n*   **Verifying the Entire Reaction:** The complete chemical picture validates these deductions. The reaction is `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)↑`. This is consistent with all clues: the reaction is violent, it produces D₂ gas (W), it forms a precipitate G (Aluminium Deuteroxide), and heating G would release B (D₂O).\n\n**2. Final Calculation**\n\n*   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄.\n*   **Elements Present:** Hydrogen (Z=1, as isotope D), Lithium (Z=3), and Aluminium (Z=13).\n*   **Lightest Element (by atomic number):** Hydrogen.\n*   **Heaviest Element (by atomic number):** Aluminium.\n*   **Careful Point:** The instruction is to sum the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements, using their specific integer isotopic mass numbers (as implied by the integer answer choices).\n    *   The isotope of hydrogen present is Deuterium (²H), which has a mass number of **2**. There are **four** such atoms.\n    *   The stable isotope of aluminium is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of **27**. There is **one** such atom.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Mass from heaviest element (Aluminium): 1 × 27 = 27\n    *   Mass from lightest element (Deuterium): 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   **Cumulative Sum = 27 + 8 = 35**\n\nThe unanimous and logically sound conclusion is that the calculated value is 35. Comparing this to the options provided in the question:\nA) 25\nB) 29\nC) 31\nD) 35\n\nThe correct answer is 35, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the definitive answer, synthesizing the unanimous reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identification of the \"Heavier Isotope\" and Substance B**\nThe first crucial piece of information is the melting point of substance B, stated to be \"very close to 277 K\".\n*   **Conversion:** 277 K is equivalent to 3.85 °C (by subtracting 273.15).\n*   **Comparison:** This value is a near-perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. It is distinctly different from the 0 °C melting point of normal water (H₂O).\n*   **Conclusion:** This allows for a confident identification of **Substance B as D₂O**. This also establishes that the \"heavier isotope\" at the center of the problem is **Deuterium (D or ²H)**, an isotope of hydrogen.\n\n**2. Identification of Gas W**\nThe gas W released during the reaction is described as having molecules that contain \"the same number of neutrons and protons.\"\n*   **Analysis:** Based on the presence of deuterium (which has 1 proton and 1 neutron per atom), the most logical candidate is deuterium gas, D₂. A D₂ molecule consists of two deuterium atoms, giving it a total of **2 protons and 2 neutrons**.\n*   **Conclusion:** This perfectly matches the description, identifying **Gas W as D₂**.\n\n**3. Identification of Substance X**\nSeveral clues combine to reveal the identity of Substance X.\n*   **The Organic Chemistry Clue:** X's \"very close analog\" is a common reagent that reduces a \"keto acid\" to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid has at least 3 oxygen atoms (one in the ketone >C=O group and two in the carboxylic acid -COOH group). Reducing the product to only 2 oxygens requires the powerful reduction of the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol group (-COOH → -CH₂OH).\n*   **Identifying the Reagent:** This specific and powerful reduction is a hallmark of **Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄)**. Milder, common reducing agents like Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) are not strong enough to reduce carboxylic acids. Therefore, the \"analog\" is LiAlH₄.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since Substance X contains the deuterium isotope, it must be the deuterated version: **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**4. Verification of the Overall Reaction**\nWith all key substances identified, we can check for consistency with the remaining clues.\n*   **The Reaction:** The reaction is between X (LiAlD₄) and a liquid Y. Since all products are deuterated, Y must be heavy water (D₂O). The full reaction is: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4 D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4 D₂ (W)↑`.\n*   **Checking the Clues:** This reaction is famously violent, it releases D₂ gas (W), and it forms an insoluble precipitate, Aluminium deuteroxide (G), which upon heating would release D₂O (B). All clues are satisfied.\n\n**5. Final Calculation**\nThe final step is to calculate the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄.\n*   **Elements Present (by atomic number):** Hydrogen (Z=1), Lithium (Z=3), Aluminium (Z=13).\n*   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen.\n*   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminium.\n*   **Summing the Masses:** The calculation requires summing the integer mass numbers of the specific isotopes for all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n    *   Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen, as Deuterium): There are **four** atoms of Deuterium (²H), each with a mass number of 2. Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminium): There is **one** atom of Aluminium (²⁷Al), with a mass number of 27. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Cumulative Sum:** 8 + 27 = **35**.\n\nThe step-by-step chemical analysis and the final calculation overwhelmingly and consistently point to the value 35. Comparing this result with the provided options:\n\nA) 35\nB) 31\nC) 25\nD) 29\n\nThe calculated value of 35 corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the logic from the candidate answers to arrive at a definitive solution.\n\n**1. Identification of Key Substances**\n\nThe consensus across all provided answers is correct and follows a clear logical path:\n*   **Substance B and the Heavier Isotope**: The clue is the melting point of substance B, \"very close to 277 K\". This translates to approximately 3.85 °C. This value is an almost perfect match for the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) at 3.82 °C, and distinctly different from normal water (H₂O) at 0 °C. This is the crucial first step, establishing that the heavier isotope is **Deuterium (D, or ²H)**.\n*   **Gas W**: The gas W has molecules with an equal number of protons and neutrons. A Deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a molecule of **D₂ gas** contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons, perfectly fitting the description within the established chemical context.\n*   **Substance X**: Its \"very close analog\" is a powerful organic reducing agent capable of reducing a keto acid to a product with 2 oxygen atoms. This means a carboxylic acid group (-COOH, with two oxygens) is reduced to an alcohol group (-CH₂OH, with one oxygen). This specific, powerful reduction is characteristic of **Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄)**. Since Substance X contains the deuterium isotope, it must be **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n*   **Verification**: The reaction `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G)↓ + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)↑` is consistent with all clues: it is violent, produces D₂ gas (W), forms a precipitate G (Aluminium deuteroxide), and this precipitate, when heated, would release D₂O (B).\n\n**2. Performing the Final Calculation**\n\nThe question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n*   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n*   **Elements Present:** The molecule contains Hydrogen (Z=1), Lithium (Z=3), and Aluminium (Z=13).\n*   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (by atomic number).\n*   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminium (by atomic number).\n*   **Summation of Masses:** The calculation requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements, using the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved.\n    *   **Mass from Aluminium (Heaviest):** There is one atom of Aluminium (Al). Its stable isotope has a mass number of 27.\n        *   Contribution = 1 × 27 = 27\n    *   **Mass from Hydrogen (Lightest):** There are four atoms of Hydrogen, present as the isotope Deuterium (D). Its mass number is 2.\n        *   Contribution = 4 × 2 = 8\n*   **Cumulative Sum:** 27 + 8 = **35**.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe detailed chemical analysis leads unequivocally to the numerical value of 35. Now we must match this value to the options provided in the question.\n\nA) 31\nB) 25\nC) 29\nD) 35\n\nThe calculated value of 35 matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
