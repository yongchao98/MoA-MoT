This is in excellent agreement with the analytical result `2 * ln(2) ≈ 1.38629`.\n3.  **Final Decision:** The calculated numerical value of `~1.386` must be compared to the provided options:\n    *   A) 1.38\n    *   B) 2.48\n    *   C) 0.25\n    *   D) 0\n\nThe calculated value `1.386` is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, highlighting all the careful points required to reach the correct solution.\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Non-Gaussianity (nG) Formula\nThe measure for non-Gaussianity is the relative entropy between the state `rho` and its reference Gaussian state `tau`:\n`del_b = trace(rho*ln(rho)) - trace(tau*ln(tau))`\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Use von Neumann Entropy.** This formula is more intuitively expressed using the von Neumann entropy, defined as `S(X) = -trace(X*ln(X))`. The formula then becomes:\n    `nG = S(tau) - S(rho)`\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Entropy of a Pure State.** The state `|psi>` is given as a state vector, not a statistical mixture. This means it is a **pure quantum state**. The von Neumann entropy `S(rho)` of any pure state is always exactly zero. This is a critical simplification.\n\nThe problem, therefore, reduces to calculating the entropy of the reference Gaussian state `tau`:\n`nG = S(tau)`\n\n### Step 2: Characterize the State and its Moments\nThe state is `|psi> =( cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> )/ N` with `phi = -pi/4` and `alpha = 0.5`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Identify the Specific State.** Substituting `phi = -pi/4` gives `cos(phi) = 1/√2` and `sin(phi) = -1/√2`. The state simplifies to `|psi> ∝ (|alpha> - |-alpha>)`. This is known as an \"odd Schrödinger cat state.\" Its symmetry properties are key.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Match Moments for the Reference State.** The reference state `tau` is a Gaussian state defined by having the same first and second moments as `rho`.\n    1.  **First Moment (Displacement):** Due to the symmetry of the odd cat state, the average displacement `<psi|a|psi> = <a>` is zero. Therefore, `tau` is a centered Gaussian state.\n    2.  **Second Moments (Covariance):** We must calculate the second moments for the odd cat state and assign them to `tau`. The standard formulas are:\n        *   `<a^2> = alpha^2`\n        *   `<n> = <a†a> = |alpha|^2 * coth(|alpha|^2)`\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Entropy of the Gaussian State `tau`\nThe entropy of a centered single-mode Gaussian state is a function of its symplectic eigenvalue, `ν`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 5: Use the Symplectic Eigenvalue.** The entropy is not calculated directly from `<n>` and `<a^2>`. First, one must calculate the symplectic eigenvalue `ν` using the formula:\n    `ν^2 = (<n> + 1/2)^2 - |<a^2>|^2`\n    Then, the entropy is found using:\n    `S(tau) = (ν + 1/2)ln(ν + 1/2) - (ν - 1/2)ln(ν - 1/2)`\n\n### Step 4: Perform the Numerical Calculation\nNow we substitute the value `alpha = 0.5`:\n1.  `alpha^2 = 0.25`, so `<a^2> = 0.25`.\n2.  `<n> = 0.25 * coth(0.25)`. Calculating this gives `<n> ≈ 1.0207`.\n3.  Calculate the symplectic eigenvalue `ν`:\n    *   `ν^2 ≈ (1.0207 + 0.5)^2 - (0.25)^2`\n    *   `ν^2 ≈ (1.5207)^2 - 0.0625 ≈ 2.3125 - 0.0625 = 2.25`\n4.  This gives `ν = sqrt(2.25) = 1.5`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 6: Analytical Exactness.** The result `ν = 1.5` is not an approximation; it is an exact analytical result for this state's parameters. Using this exact value prevents any rounding errors.\n\n5.  Substitute `ν = 1.5` into the entropy formula:\n    *   `nG = S(tau) = (1.5 + 0.5)ln(1.5 + 0.5) - (1.5 - 0.5)ln(1.5 - 0.5)`\n    *   `nG = 2*ln(2) - 1*ln(1)`\n    *   Since `ln(1) = 0`, the expression simplifies beautifully to `nG = 2*ln(2)`.\n\n6.  The final numerical value is `nG ≈ 2 * 0.693147 ≈ 1.38629`.\n\n### Final Decision\nThe calculated value of non-Gaussianity is `nG ≈ 1.386`. Comparing this to the provided options:\nA) 1.38\nB) 0\nC) 0.25\nD) 2.48\n\nThe calculated value is best represented by option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nBased on the analysis of the provided answers and a first-principles evaluation of the physics problem, here is a detailed step-by-step solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the Non-Gaussianity (nG) Measure**\n\nThe nG is defined as the relative entropy `del_b = trace(rho*ln(rho)) - trace(tau*ln(tau))`. This is more commonly expressed using the von Neumann entropy `S(X) = -trace(X*ln(X))`, which gives:\n`nG = S(tau) - S(rho)`\n\n*   **Careful Point**: The most critical simplification is to recognize that the state `|psi>` is a quantum mechanical *pure state*. For any pure state, the density matrix `rho = |psi><psi|` has one eigenvalue equal to 1 and all others equal to 0. Consequently, the von Neumann entropy `S(rho)` is always exactly zero (`S(rho) = -1*ln(1) = 0`).\n\nThis reduces the problem to calculating the entropy of the reference Gaussian state `tau`:\n`nG = S(tau)`\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Specific State and its Properties**\n\nThe state is defined with `phi = -pi/4` and `alpha = 0.5`. Substituting the phase angle gives:\n`|psi> ∝ cos(-pi/4)|alpha> + sin(-pi/4)|-alpha> = (1/√2)|alpha> - (1/√2)|-alpha>`\nThis simplifies to `|psi> ∝ |alpha> - |-alpha>`.\n\n*   **Careful Point**: This specific form is known as an \"odd Schrödinger cat state\". Its symmetry properties are key to simplifying the calculation of its moments.\n\n**Step 3: Define the Reference Gaussian State `tau`**\n\nThe reference state `tau` is a Gaussian state constructed to have the same first and second moments as the state `rho`.\n\n*   **Careful Point**: The first moment, or mean displacement `<a>`, is zero for the odd cat state due to its symmetry (`<psi|a|psi> = 0`). This means the reference state `tau` must also have a zero mean displacement, making it a *centered* Gaussian state (also known as a squeezed thermal state), which simplifies its definition. It is fully defined by its second moments.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Second Moments of the State**\n\nThe second moments of the odd cat state `rho` must be calculated to define `tau`. The standard formulas are:\n*   Mean photon number: `<n> = <a†a> = |alpha|^2 * coth(|alpha|^2)`\n*   Squeezing term: `<a^2> = <aa> = alpha^2`\n\nPlugging in `alpha = 0.5`, we get `alpha^2 = 0.25`.\n*   `<a^2> = 0.25`\n*   `<n> = 0.25 * coth(0.25)`. Using `coth(x) = (e^x + e^-x)/(e^x - e^-x)`, we find `coth(0.25) ≈ 4.083`, so `<n> ≈ 0.25 * 4.083 = 1.02075`.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Entropy of `tau`**\n\nThe entropy of a centered Gaussian state is found via its symplectic eigenvalue `nu`.\n\n1.  **Calculate the symplectic eigenvalue `nu`**: The formula is `nu^2 = (<n> + 1/2)^2 - |<a^2>|^2`.\n    *   **Careful Point**: It is important to use the correct formula and substitute the values properly.\n    *   `nu^2 ≈ (1.02075 + 0.5)^2 - |0.25|^2`\n    *   `nu^2 ≈ (1.52075)^2 - 0.0625 ≈ 2.3127 - 0.0625 = 2.2502`\n    *   This gives `nu = sqrt(2.2502) ≈ 1.5`. This result is in fact analytically exact: for this specific state, `nu` is precisely 1.5.\n\n2.  **Calculate the entropy `S(tau)`**: The entropy is given by `S(tau) = (nu + 1/2)ln(nu + 1/2) - (nu - 1/2)ln(nu - 1/2)`.\n    *   **Careful Point**: Substituting `nu = 1.5` simplifies the expression significantly.\n    *   `nG = S(tau) = (1.5 + 0.5)ln(1.5 + 0.5) - (1.5 - 0.5)ln(1.5 - 0.5)`\n    *   `nG = 2*ln(2) - 1*ln(1)`\n    *   Since `ln(1) = 0`, the final result is `nG = 2*ln(2)`.\n\n**Step 6: Final Numerical Result and Conclusion**\n\nThe final step is to calculate the value and match it to the options.\n*   `nG = 2 * ln(2) ≈ 2 * 0.693147 = 1.386294...`\n\nComparing this calculated value with the given options:\nA) 2.48\nB) 0\nC) 0.25\nD) 1.38\n\nThe calculated value of ~1.386 is best matched by option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided candidate answers and the underlying principles of the question, here is a detailed step-by-step solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the Non-Gaussianity (nG) Measure**\n\nThe nG measure is given by the relative entropy between the state `rho` and its reference Gaussian state `tau`:\n`del_b = trace(rho*ln(rho)) - trace(tau*ln(tau))`\nThis can be rewritten using the von Neumann entropy `S(X) = -trace(X*ln(X))`.\n`nG = S(tau) - S(rho)`\n\n*   **Careful Point**: A crucial first step is to recognize that the state `|psi>` is a state vector, representing a **pure quantum state**. The von Neumann entropy `S(rho)` for any pure state is exactly zero. This simplifies the problem significantly, reducing it to finding the entropy of the reference state:\n    `nG = S(tau)`\n\n**Step 2: Characterize the Quantum State**\n\nThe state is defined with parameters `phi = -pi / 4` and `alpha = 0.5`. Substituting the value of `phi`:\n`cos(-pi/4) = 1/√2`\n`sin(-pi/4) = -1/√2`\nThe state `|psi>` is therefore proportional to `|alpha> - |-alpha>`.\n\n*   **Careful Point**: This specific superposition is known as an \"odd Schrödinger cat state\". Its symmetry is a key property that simplifies the calculation of its statistical moments.\n\n**Step 3: Define the Reference Gaussian State `tau`**\n\nThe state `tau` is a Gaussian state that is constructed to have the same first and second statistical moments as the non-Gaussian state `rho`.\n\n*   **First Moment**: For the odd cat state, the average displacement (expectation value of the annihilation operator `a`) is zero due to symmetry: `<a> = <psi|a|psi> = 0`. Therefore, the reference state `tau` must also be a \"centered\" Gaussian state.\n*   **Second Moments**: A centered Gaussian state is fully defined by its second moments. The moments of `tau` must match those of `rho`. For an odd cat state, these are given by standard formulas:\n    *   Average photon number: `<n> = <a†a> = |alpha|^2 * coth(|alpha|^2)`\n    *   Squeezing parameter: `<a^2> = <aa> = alpha^2`\n\n**Step 4: Formulate and Calculate the Entropy of `tau`**\n\nThe entropy of a centered, single-mode Gaussian state is calculated from its symplectic eigenvalue, `nu`.\n\n*   The eigenvalue is found from the second moments: `nu^2 = (<n> + 1/2)^2 - |<a^2>|^2`.\n*   The entropy is then given by: `S(tau) = (nu + 1/2)ln(nu + 1/2) - (nu - 1/2)ln(nu - 1/2)`.\n\nLet's perform the numerical calculation with `alpha = 0.5`:\n1.  `alpha^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25`. This gives `<a^2> = 0.25`.\n2.  `<n> = 0.25 * coth(0.25)`. Since `coth(0.25) ≈ 4.083`, we have `<n> ≈ 0.25 * 4.083 = 1.02075`.\n3.  Calculate the symplectic eigenvalue `nu`:\n    *   `nu^2 ≈ (1.02075 + 0.5)^2 - (0.25)^2`\n    *   `nu^2 ≈ (1.52075)^2 - 0.0625 ≈ 2.31268 - 0.0625 = 2.25018`\n    *   This gives `nu ≈ sqrt(2.25) = 1.5`.\n*   **Careful Point**: It can be shown analytically that for this specific state, the symplectic eigenvalue `nu` is *exactly* 1.5. This leads to a very clean final expression.\n\n4.  Substitute `nu = 1.5` into the entropy formula:\n    *   `nG = S(tau) = (1.5 + 0.5)ln(1.5 + 0.5) - (1.5 - 0.5)ln(1.5 - 0.5)`\n    *   `nG = 2*ln(2) - 1*ln(1)`\n    *   Since `ln(1) = 0`, the final result is `nG = 2*ln(2)`.\n\n5.  The final numerical value is `nG ≈ 2 * 0.693147 = 1.38629...`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated value of non-Gaussianity is approximately `1.386`.

A fundamental property of any pure state is that its von Neumann entropy is zero. Therefore, `S(rho) = 0`.\n\nThis simplifies the problem significantly, reducing it to the calculation of the entropy of the reference Gaussian state:\n`nG = S(tau)`\n\n### **Step 2: Characterize the State and Define the Reference State**\nThe parameters given are `alpha = 0.5` and `phi = -pi/4`. Substituting `phi` into the state's definition:\n`cos(-pi/4) = 1/√2` and `sin(-pi/4) = -1/√2`\nThis makes the state proportional to `|alpha> - |-alpha>`, which is known as an \"odd Schrödinger cat state\".\n\n**Careful Point 2:** The reference state `tau` is a Gaussian state that must have the same first and second moments as the state `rho`.\n*   **First Moment (Mean):** For the odd cat state, the expectation value of displacement is zero (`<a> = 0`) due to symmetry.

Its name comes from the fact that it only contains odd photon number components in its Fock basis expansion. The symmetry of this state is key to determining its properties.\n\n### **Step 3: Define the Reference Gaussian State `tau`**\n\nThe state `tau` is a Gaussian state constructed to have the same first and second statistical moments as the non-Gaussian state `rho`.\n\n1.  **First Moment (`<a>`)**: For the odd cat state, the expectation value of the annihilation operator `<a> = <psi|a|psi>` is zero due to symmetry. Therefore, the reference state `tau` must also have zero displacement, making it a \"centered Gaussian state\" (a type of squeezed thermal state).\n2.  **Second Moments (`<n>` and `<a^2>`)**: A centered Gaussian state is fully defined by its second moments. We must match these to the moments of our cat state. For an odd cat state, these are given by standard formulas:\n    *   Mean photon number: `<n> = <a†a> = |alpha|^2 * coth(|alpha|^2)`\n    *   Squeezing parameter: `<a^2> = <aa> = alpha^2`\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Entropy of the Reference State `tau`**\n\nThe entropy of a centered single-mode Gaussian state `tau` is a well-known function of its symplectic eigenvalue, `ν` (nu).\n\n*   **The relationship between the eigenvalue and the moments is:** `ν^2 = (<n> + 1/2)^2 - |<a^2>|^2`\n*   **The entropy formula is:** `S(tau) = (ν + 1/2)ln(ν + 1/2) - (ν - 1/2)ln(ν - 1/2)`\n\n### **Step 5: Perform the Numerical Calculation**\n\nNow, we substitute the value `alpha = 0.5` into the formulas from the previous steps.\n\n1.  `alpha^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25`.\n2.  Calculate the second moments:\n    *   `<a^2> = 0.25`\n    *   `<n> = 0.25 * coth(0.25)`. Using `coth(x) = (e^x + e^-x) / (e^x - e^-x)`, we find `coth(0.25) ≈ 4.083`.\n    *   `<n> ≈ 0.25 * 4.083 = 1.02075`\n3.  Calculate the symplectic eigenvalue `ν`:\n    *   `ν^2 ≈ (1.02075 + 0.5)^2 - |0.25|^2`\n    *   `ν^2 ≈ (1.52075)^2 - 0.0625 ≈ 2.31268 - 0.0625 = 2.25018`\n    *   `ν ≈ sqrt(2.25018) ≈ 1.5`.\n    **Careful Point**: It can be shown through a more rigorous analytical derivation that for the odd cat state, this result is exact: `ν = 1.5`.\n4.  Substitute `ν = 1.5` into the entropy formula:\n    *   `nG = S(tau) = (1.5 + 0.5)ln(1.5 + 0.5) - (1.5 - 0.5)ln(1.5 - 0.5)`\n    *   `nG = 2*ln(2) - 1*ln(1)`\n    *   Since `ln(1) = 0`, this simplifies perfectly to: `nG = 2*ln(2)`\n    *   `nG ≈ 2 * 0.693147 = 1.38629...`\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe calculated value of non-Gaussianity is `nG ≈ 1.386`. We now compare this result to the given options:\nA) 2.48\nB) 0\nC) 0.25\nD) 1.38\n\nThe calculated value `1.386...` is closest to **1.38**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the consensus from the candidate answers and highlighting the crucial steps and careful points.\n\n### **Step 1: Simplify the Non-Gaussianity (nG) Formula**\nThe question defines non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure:\n`del_b = [trace(rho* ln(rho))-trace(tau* ln(tau))]`\n\nThis formula can be more intuitively expressed using the von Neumann entropy, defined as `S(X) = -trace(X*ln(X))`. The formula for nG then becomes:\n`nG = del_b = S(tau) - S(rho)`\n\n**Careful Point 1: The Entropy of a Pure State is Zero**\nThe state provided, `|psi>`, is a state vector, which describes a **pure quantum state**. A fundamental property of any pure state is that its von Neumann entropy is zero. Therefore, `S(rho) = S(|psi><psi|) = 0`. This is the most critical simplification of the problem.\n\nThe task is now reduced to calculating the entropy of the reference Gaussian state `tau`:\n`nG = S(tau)`\n\n### **Step 2: Identify the Specific State and its Properties**\nThe state is given by `|psi> =( cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> )/ N`, with the specific parameters `phi = -pi / 4` and `alpha = 0.5`.\n\n*   For `phi = -pi / 4`, we have `cos(phi) = 1/√2` and `sin(phi) = -1/√2`.\n*   Substituting these into the state equation gives a state proportional to `|alpha> - |-alpha>`.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Recognizing the State**\nThis form, `|psi> ∝ |alpha> - |-alpha>`, is known as an **\"odd Schrödinger cat state\"**.

For the odd cat state, these are given by well-established formulas which were correctly identified by the candidate answers:\n    *   Average photon number: `<n> = <a†a> = |alpha|^2 * coth(|alpha|^2)`\n    *   Squeezing parameter: `<a^2> = <aa> = alpha^2`\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Entropy of `tau`**\nThe entropy of a centered, single-mode Gaussian state `tau` can be calculated from its symplectic eigenvalue, `nu`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: The Entropy Formula**\n    The entropy is given by: `S(tau) = (nu + 1/2)ln(nu + 1/2) - (nu - 1/2)ln(nu - 1/2)`\n*   The relationship between the eigenvalue `nu` and the second moments is: `nu^2 = (<n> + 1/2)^2 - |<a^2>|^2`\n\n### **Step 5: Perform the Numerical Calculation**\nNow we substitute the value `alpha = 0.5`.\n\n1.  Calculate `alpha^2`: `alpha^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25`.\n2.  Calculate the second moments:\n    *   `<a^2> = alpha^2 = 0.25`\n    *   `<n> = 0.25 * coth(0.25)`. Using `coth(x) = (e^x + e^-x) / (e^x - e^-x)`, we find `coth(0.25) ≈ 4.083`.\n    *   Therefore, `<n> ≈ 0.25 * 4.083 = 1.02075`\n3.

The state `|psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>) / N` is a pure quantum state. The von Neumann entropy `S(rho)` of any pure state is exactly zero. Therefore, the problem reduces to calculating the entropy of the reference Gaussian state:\n`nG = S(tau)`\n\n**Careful Point 2: Characterizing the Specific Quantum State**\nThe problem specifies the parameters `phi = -pi/4` and `alpha = 0.5`. Substituting the value of `phi` into the state vector gives:\n`cos(-pi/4) = 1/√2`\n`sin(-pi/4) = -1/√2`\nThe state becomes `|psi> ∝ (|alpha> - |-alpha>)`.

Next, we calculate the mean photon number:\n    *   `<n> = 0.25 * coth(0.25)`\n    *   Using a calculator, `coth(0.25) ≈ 4.08298`, so `<n> ≈ 0.25 * 4.08298 ≈ 1.02075`.\n3.  Now, we calculate the symplectic eigenvalue `ν`:\n    *   `ν^2 ≈ (1.02075 + 0.5)^2 - (0.25)^2`\n    *   `ν^2 ≈ (1.52075)^2 - 0.0625 ≈ 2.31268 - 0.0625 = 2.25018`.\n4.  **Careful Point 4:** The value `ν^2` is extremely close to 2.25, and analytically, it is an exact result that `ν^2 = 2.25` for this state. Thus, we take `ν = sqrt(2.25) = 1.5`.\n5.  Finally, we substitute `ν = 1.5` into the entropy formula:\n    *   `nG = S(tau) = (1.5 + 0.5)ln(1.5 + 0.5) - (1.5 - 0.5)ln(1.5 - 0.5)`\n    *   `nG = 2*ln(2) - 1*ln(1)`\n6.  **Careful Point 5:** A simple but critical final step is knowing that `ln(1) = 0`. The formula simplifies beautifully to `nG = 2*ln(2)`.\n7.  Calculating the final value: `nG ≈ 2 * 0.693147 = 1.38629...`\n\n### **Final Decision**\nThe calculated value for the non-Gaussianity is `nG ≈ 1.386`.

A fundamental property of any pure state is that its von Neumann entropy is zero. Therefore, `S(rho) = 0`. This simplifies the problem significantly, and the non-Gaussianity is simply the entropy of the reference Gaussian state:\n`nG = S(tau)`\n\n### **Step 2: Identify the State and Its Properties**\nThe problem specifies the parameters `phi = -pi / 4` and `alpha = 0.5`.\nSubstituting `phi` into the state definition gives:\n`cos(-pi/4) = 1/√2`\n`sin(-pi/4) = -1/√2`\nSo the state becomes `|psi> ∝ (|alpha> - |-alpha>)`.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** This state is known as an \"odd Schrödinger cat state.\" Its symmetry properties are essential for determining its statistical moments.\n\n### **Step 3: Characterize the Reference Gaussian State `tau`**\nThe reference state `tau` is a Gaussian state defined to have the same first and second statistical moments as the non-Gaussian state `rho`.\n\n*   **First Moment (`<a>`)**: Due to the symmetry of the odd cat state, the expectation value of displacement is zero (`<a> = 0`). This means the reference state `tau` is a centered Gaussian state (i.e., a squeezed thermal state).\n*   **Second Moments (`<n>` and `<a^2>`)**: A centered Gaussian state is fully defined by its second moments. For an odd cat state, these are given by standard formulas:\n    *   Average photon number: `<n> = <a†a> = |alpha|^2 * coth(|alpha|^2)`\n    *   Squeezing parameter: `<a^2> = <aa> = alpha^2`\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Entropy of the Reference State `S(tau)`**\nThe entropy of a single-mode, centered Gaussian state is calculated from its symplectic eigenvalue, `nu`.\n\n*   **Entropy Formula**: `S(tau) = (nu + 1/2)ln(nu + 1/2) - (nu - 1/2)ln(nu - 1/2)`\n*   **Careful Point 3:** The symplectic eigenvalue `nu` is found from the second moments using the key relation: `nu^2 = (<n> + 1/2)^2 - |<a^2>|^2`.\n\n### **Step 5: Perform the Numerical Calculation**\nNow, we substitute the value `alpha = 0.5` into the formulas.\n1.  Calculate `alpha^2`: `alpha^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25`.\n2.  Calculate the second moments:\n    *   `<a^2> = 0.25`\n    *   `<n> = 0.25 * coth(0.25)`. Numerically, `coth(0.25) ≈ 4.083`, so `<n> ≈ 0.25 * 4.083 ≈ 1.02075`.\n3.  Calculate the symplectic eigenvalue `nu`:\n    *   `nu^2 ≈ (1.02075 + 0.5)^2 - (0.25)^2`\n    *   `nu^2 ≈ (1.52075)^2 - 0.0625 ≈ 2.31268 - 0.0625 = 2.25018`\n    *   This gives `nu = sqrt(2.25018) ≈ 1.5`. This result is analytically exact for these parameters; `nu = 1.5`.\n4.  Substitute the exact value `nu = 1.5` into the entropy formula:\n    *   `nG = S(tau) = (1.5 + 0.5)ln(1.5 + 0.5) - (1.5 - 0.5)ln(1.5 - 0.5)`\n    *   `nG = 2*ln(2) - 1*ln(1)`\n    *   Since `ln(1) = 0`, the expression simplifies to `nG = 2*ln(2)`.\n5.  Final numerical value: `nG ≈ 2 * 0.693147 = 1.38629...`\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\nThe calculated value of non-Gaussianity is `nG ≈ 1.386`. Comparing this with the provided options:\nA) 1.38\nB) 0\nC) 2.48\nD) 0.25\n\nThe result `1.386...` is best represented by option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question with a list of the careful points required to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the non-Gaussianity (nG) measure.**\nThe non-Gaussianity is given by the relative entropy `del_b = trace(rho*ln(rho)) - trace(tau*ln(tau))`. This can be expressed using the von Neumann entropy `S(X) = -trace(X*ln(X))`, which rewrites the formula as:\n`nG = S(tau) - S(rho)`\n\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The initial state `|psi>` is a state vector, representing a **pure quantum state**. A fundamental property of any pure state is that its von Neumann entropy is exactly zero. Therefore, `S(rho) = 0`. This simplifies the problem significantly, as the non-Gaussianity is simply the entropy of the reference Gaussian state: `nG = S(tau)`.\n\n**Step 2: Define the reference Gaussian state `tau`.**\nThe reference state `tau` is a Gaussian state constructed to have the same first and second statistical moments as the non-Gaussian state `rho`. First, we characterize `rho` with the given parameters `alpha = 0.5` and `phi = -pi / 4`. This results in the \"odd Schrödinger cat state,\" which is proportional to `|alpha> - |-alpha>`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2:** Due to the symmetry of the odd cat state, its first moment (the average displacement) is zero: `<a> = 0`. This means the reference state `tau` must also be a centered Gaussian state (i.e., a squeezed thermal state with zero displacement).\n\n*   **Careful Point 3:** A centered Gaussian state is fully defined by its second moments. These must match the moments of `rho`. For an odd cat state, these moments are given by standard formulas:\n    *   Mean photon number: `<n> = <a†a> = |alpha|^2 * coth(|alpha|^2)`\n    *   Squeezing parameter: `<a^2> = alpha^2`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the entropy of the reference state `tau`.**\nThe entropy of a centered, single-mode Gaussian state `tau` is calculated from its symplectic eigenvalue, `nu` (or `ν`).\n\n*   **Careful Point 4:** The formula for the symplectic eigenvalue `nu` is derived from the second moments: `nu^2 = (<n> + 1/2)^2 - |<a^2>|^2`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 5:** The formula for the entropy of the Gaussian state in terms of its eigenvalue is: `S(tau) = (nu + 1/2)ln(nu + 1/2) - (nu - 1/2)ln(nu - 1/2)`.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the numerical calculation.**\nNow we substitute the value `alpha = 0.5` and proceed with the calculation.\n\n1.  `alpha^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25`.\n2.  Calculate the second moments:\n    *   `<a^2> = 0.25`\n    *   `<n> = 0.25 * coth(0.25) ≈ 0.25 * 4.083 ≈ 1.02075`.\n3.  Calculate the symplectic eigenvalue `nu`:\n    *   `nu^2 ≈ (1.02075 + 0.5)^2 - (0.25)^2`\n    *   `nu^2 ≈ (1.52075)^2 - 0.0625 ≈ 2.31268 - 0.0625 = 2.25018`.\n4.  **Careful Point 6:** The result for `nu^2` is extremely close to 2.25. Analytically, this result is exact. Therefore, we can confidently use `nu = sqrt(2.25) = 1.5`.\n5.  Substitute `nu = 1.5` into the entropy formula:\n    *   `S(tau) = (1.5 + 0.5)ln(1.5 + 0.5) - (1.5 - 0.5)ln(1.5 - 0.5)`\n    *   `S(tau) = 2*ln(2) - 1*ln(1)`\n    *   Since `ln(1) = 0`, this simplifies to `S(tau) = 2*ln(2)`.\n6.  The final numerical result is `nG = S(tau) ≈ 2 * 0.6931 = 1.3862`.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion.**\nThe calculated value for the non-Gaussianity is `nG ≈ 1.386`. We now compare this to the provided options:\nA) 0\nB) 2.48\nC) 1.38\nD) 0.25\n\nThe calculated value of `1.386` is best matched by option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem with all the careful points highlighted, as requested.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the Non-Gaussianity (nG) Formula**\nThe problem defines non-Gaussianity as the relative entropy between the state's density matrix `rho` and that of a reference Gaussian state `tau`:\n`del_b = trace(rho*ln(rho)) - trace(tau*ln(tau))`\nThis formula can be expressed more cleanly using the von Neumann entropy, `S(X) = -trace(X*ln(X))`. The formula then becomes:\n`nG = del_b = S(tau) - S(rho)`\n\n*   **Careful Point 1**: The most crucial simplification is recognizing that the given state `|psi>` is a **pure state**. The von Neumann entropy `S(rho)` of any pure state is always exactly zero. This reduces the problem to calculating the entropy of the reference Gaussian state alone: `nG = S(tau)`.\n\n**Step 2: Characterize the Specific State (`rho`)**\nThe state is `|psi> =( cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> )/ N` with given parameters `phi = -pi/4` and `alpha = 0.5`.\nSubstituting `phi = -pi/4` into the trigonometric functions, we get `cos(-pi/4) = 1/√2` and `sin(-pi/4) = -1/√2`. The state then simplifies to:\n`|psi> ∝ (|alpha> - |-alpha>)`\n\n*   **Careful Point 2**: This specific superposition is known as an \"odd Schrödinger cat state\". Its symmetry is a key feature that simplifies the calculation of its statistical moments.\n\n**Step 3: Define the Reference Gaussian State (`tau`)**\nThe reference state `tau` is a Gaussian state that is constructed to have the same first and second statistical moments as the non-Gaussian state `rho`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3**: Because the odd cat state is symmetric, its first moment (the average displacement) is zero: `<a> = <psi|a|psi> = 0`. Therefore, the reference state `tau` must also have a zero mean displacement, making it a \"centered Gaussian state\" (a type of squeezed thermal state). This state is fully characterized by its second moments.\n\n**Step 4: Formulate the Calculation of `S(tau)`**\nThe entropy of a centered Gaussian state `tau` depends on its **symplectic eigenvalue**, `nu` (or `ν`). The calculation proceeds in two parts:\n1.  First, we find the second moments of `rho` to define `tau`. For an odd cat state, the standard formulas are:\n    *   Mean photon number: `<n> = <a†a> = |alpha|^2 * coth(|alpha|^2)`\n    *   Squeezing parameter: `<a^2> = <aa> = alpha^2`\n2.  Next, we use these moments to find the symplectic eigenvalue `nu`:\n    `nu^2 = (<n> + 1/2)^2 - |<a^2>|^2`\n3.  Finally, we calculate the entropy of `tau` using `nu`:\n    `S(tau) = (nu + 1/2)ln(nu + 1/2) - (nu - 1/2)ln(nu - 1/2)`\n\n*   **Careful Point 4**: It is essential to use the correct formulas for both the moments of the odd cat state and the subsequent entropy calculation for the Gaussian state. Mixing these up is a common source of error.\n\n**Step 5: Perform the Numerical Calculation**\nWe now substitute the given value `alpha = 0.5`.\n1.  `alpha^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25`. This gives `<a^2> = 0.25`.\n2.  `<n> = 0.25 * coth(0.25)`. Using a calculator, `coth(0.25) ≈ 4.083`, so `<n> ≈ 0.25 * 4.083 ≈ 1.02075`.\n3.  Calculate the symplectic eigenvalue `nu`:\n    `nu^2 ≈ (1.02075 + 0.5)^2 - (0.25)^2`\n    `nu^2 ≈ (1.52075)^2 - 0.0625 ≈ 2.31268 - 0.0625 = 2.25018`\n    `nu = sqrt(2.25018) ≈ 1.50006`\n\n*   **Careful Point 5**: This result for `nu` is extremely close to 1.5. In fact, it can be shown analytically that for this specific state, `nu` is *exactly* 1.5. Using `nu = 1.5` simplifies the final step.\n\n4.  Calculate the entropy with the exact value `nu = 1.5`:\n    `nG = S(tau) = (1.5 + 0.5)ln(1.5 + 0.5) - (1.5 - 0.5)ln(1.5 - 0.5)`\n    `nG = 2*ln(2) - 1*ln(1)`\n    Since `ln(1) = 0`, this simplifies to:\n    `nG = 2*ln(2) ≈ 2 * 0.693147 = 1.38629...`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated non-Gaussianity is `nG ≈ 1.386`.

Substituting the phase angle `phi` into the state's definition gives:\n`cos(-pi/4) = 1/√2` and `sin(-pi/4) = -1/√2`\nThis causes the state to be proportional to `|alpha> - |-alpha>`.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** This specific superposition is known as an **\"odd Schrödinger cat state.\"** The symmetry of this state is the key to determining its statistical moments.\n\n**Step 3: Characterize the Reference Gaussian State `tau`**\nThe reference state `tau` is a Gaussian state constructed to have the same first and second moments as the non-Gaussian state `rho`.\n*   **First Moment `<a>`:** Due to the odd symmetry of the state, the expectation value of the displacement `<a>` is zero.

The symplectic eigenvalue `nu` must be calculated from the second moments using the relation: `nu^2 = (<n> + 1/2)^2 - |<a^2>|^2`.\n2.  The entropy `S(tau)` is then calculated from `nu` using the formula: `S(tau) = (nu + 1/2)ln(nu + 1/2) - (nu - 1/2)ln(nu - 1/2)`.\n\n**Step 5: Perform the Numerical Calculation**\nNow, we substitute the value `alpha = 0.5`.\n1.  `alpha^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25`. Therefore, the squeezing term `<a^2>` is 0.25.\n2.  The mean photon number is `<n> = 0.25 * coth(0.25)`. The hyperbolic cotangent `coth(0.25)` is approx `4.083`, so `<n> ≈ 0.25 * 4.083 = 1.02075`.\n3.  Next, we calculate the symplectic eigenvalue `nu`:\n    `nu^2 ≈ (1.02075 + 0.5)^2 - (0.25)^2`\n    `nu^2 ≈ (1.52075)^2 - 0.0625 ≈ 2.3127 - 0.0625 = 2.2502`\n\n**Careful Point 4:** This numerical result `nu^2 ≈ 2.2502` is extremely close to `2.25`.

The formula then becomes:\n    `nG = S(tau) - S(rho)`\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Entropy of a Pure State.** The state `|psi>` is given as a state vector, not a statistical mixture. This means it is a **pure quantum state**. The von Neumann entropy `S(rho)` of any pure state is always exactly zero. This is a critical simplification.\n\nThe problem, therefore, reduces to calculating the entropy of the reference Gaussian state `tau`:\n`nG = S(tau)`\n\n### Step 2: Characterize the State and its Moments\nThe state is `|psi> =( cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> )/ N` with `phi = -pi/4` and `alpha = 0.5`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Identify the Specific State.** Substituting `phi = -pi/4` gives `cos(phi) = 1/√2` and `sin(phi) = -1/√2`. The state simplifies to `|psi> ∝ (|alpha> - |-alpha>)`. This is known as an \"odd Schrödinger cat state.\" Its symmetry properties are key.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Match Moments for the Reference State.** The reference state `tau` is a Gaussian state defined by having the same first and second moments as `rho`.\n    1.  **First Moment (Displacement):** Due to the symmetry of the odd cat state, the average displacement `<psi|a|psi> = <a>` is zero. Therefore, `tau` is a centered Gaussian state.\n    2.  **Second Moments (Covariance):** We must calculate the second moments for the odd cat state and assign them to `tau`. The standard formulas are:\n        *   `<a^2> = alpha^2`\n        *   `<n> = <a†a> = |alpha|^2 * coth(|alpha|^2)`\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Entropy of the Gaussian State `tau`\nThe entropy of a centered single-mode Gaussian state is a function of its symplectic eigenvalue, `ν`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 5: Use the Symplectic Eigenvalue.** The entropy is not calculated directly from `<n>` and `<a^2>`. First, one must calculate the symplectic eigenvalue `ν` using the formula:\n    `ν^2 = (<n> + 1/2)^2 - |<a^2>|^2`\n    Then, the entropy is found using:\n    `S(tau) = (ν + 1/2)ln(ν + 1/2) - (ν - 1/2)ln(ν - 1/2)`\n\n### Step 4: Perform the Numerical Calculation\nNow we substitute the value `alpha = 0.5`:\n1.  `alpha^2 = 0.25`, so `<a^2> = 0.25`.\n2.  `<n> = 0.25 * coth(0.25)`. Calculating this gives `<n> ≈ 1.0207`.\n3.  Calculate the symplectic eigenvalue `ν`:\n    *   `ν^2 ≈ (1.0207 + 0.5)^2 - (0.25)^2`\n    *   `ν^2 ≈ (1.5207)^2 - 0.0625 ≈ 2.3125 - 0.0625 = 2.25`\n4.  This gives `ν = sqrt(2.25) = 1.5`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 6: Analytical Exactness.** The result `ν = 1.5` is not an approximation; it is an exact analytical result for this state's parameters. Using this exact value prevents any rounding errors.\n\n5.

This is more commonly expressed using the von Neumann entropy `S(X) = -trace(X*ln(X))`, which gives:\n`nG = S(tau) - S(rho)`\n\n*   **Careful Point**: The most critical simplification is to recognize that the state `|psi>` is a quantum mechanical *pure state*. For any pure state, the density matrix `rho = |psi><psi|` has one eigenvalue equal to 1 and all others equal to 0. Consequently, the von Neumann entropy `S(rho)` is always exactly zero (`S(rho) = -1*ln(1) = 0`).\n\nThis reduces the problem to calculating the entropy of the reference Gaussian state `tau`:\n`nG = S(tau)`\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Specific State and its Properties**\n\nThe state is defined with `phi = -pi/4` and `alpha = 0.5`. Substituting the phase angle gives:\n`|psi> ∝ cos(-pi/4)|alpha> + sin(-pi/4)|-alpha> = (1/√2)|alpha> - (1/√2)|-alpha>`\nThis simplifies to `|psi> ∝ |alpha> - |-alpha>`.\n\n*   **Careful Point**: This specific form is known as an \"odd Schrödinger cat state\".

This means the reference state `tau` must also have a zero mean displacement, making it a *centered* Gaussian state (also known as a squeezed thermal state), which simplifies its definition. It is fully defined by its second moments.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Second Moments of the State**\n\nThe second moments of the odd cat state `rho` must be calculated to define `tau`. The standard formulas are:\n*   Mean photon number: `<n> = <a†a> = |alpha|^2 * coth(|alpha|^2)`\n*   Squeezing term: `<a^2> = <aa> = alpha^2`\n\nPlugging in `alpha = 0.5`, we get `alpha^2 = 0.25`.\n*   `<a^2> = 0.25`\n*   `<n> = 0.25 * coth(0.25)`. Using `coth(x) = (e^x + e^-x)/(e^x - e^-x)`, we find `coth(0.25) ≈ 4.083`, so `<n> ≈ 0.25 * 4.083 = 1.02075`.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Entropy of `tau`**\n\nThe entropy of a centered Gaussian state is found via its symplectic eigenvalue `nu`.\n\n1.  **Calculate the symplectic eigenvalue `nu`**: The formula is `nu^2 = (<n> + 1/2)^2 - |<a^2>|^2`.\n    *   **Careful Point**: It is important to use the correct formula and substitute the values properly.\n    *   `nu^2 ≈ (1.02075 + 0.5)^2 - |0.25|^2`\n    *   `nu^2 ≈ (1.52075)^2 - 0.0625 ≈ 2.3127 - 0.0625 = 2.2502`\n    *   This gives `nu = sqrt(2.2502) ≈ 1.5`. This result is in fact analytically exact: for this specific state, `nu` is precisely 1.5.\n\n2.  **Calculate the entropy `S(tau)`**: The entropy is given by `S(tau) = (nu + 1/2)ln(nu + 1/2) - (nu - 1/2)ln(nu - 1/2)`.\n    *   **Careful Point**: Substituting `nu = 1.5` simplifies the expression significantly.\n    *   `nG = S(tau) = (1.5 + 0.5)ln(1.5 + 0.5) - (1.5 - 0.5)ln(1.5 - 0.5)`\n    *   `nG = 2*ln(2) - 1*ln(1)`\n    *   Since `ln(1) = 0`, the final result is `nG = 2*ln(2)`.\n\n**Step 6: Final Numerical Result and Conclusion**\n\nThe final step is to calculate the value and match it to the options.\n*   `nG = 2 * ln(2) ≈ 2 * 0.693147 = 1.386294...`\n\nComparing this calculated value with the given options:\nA) 2.48\nB) 0\nC) 0.25\nD) 1.38\n\nThe calculated value of ~1.386 is best matched by option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided candidate answers and the underlying principles of the question, here is a detailed step-by-step solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the Non-Gaussianity (nG) Measure**\n\nThe nG measure is given by the relative entropy between the state `rho` and its reference Gaussian state `tau`:\n`del_b = trace(rho*ln(rho)) - trace(tau*ln(tau))`\nThis can be rewritten using the von Neumann entropy `S(X) = -trace(X*ln(X))`.\n`nG = S(tau) - S(rho)`\n\n*   **Careful Point**: A crucial first step is to recognize that the state `|psi>` is a state vector, representing a **pure quantum state**.

This simplifies the problem significantly, reducing it to finding the entropy of the reference state:\n    `nG = S(tau)`\n\n**Step 2: Characterize the Quantum State**\n\nThe state is defined with parameters `phi = -pi / 4` and `alpha = 0.5`. Substituting the value of `phi`:\n`cos(-pi/4) = 1/√2`\n`sin(-pi/4) = -1/√2`\nThe state `|psi>` is therefore proportional to `|alpha> - |-alpha>`.\n\n*   **Careful Point**: This specific superposition is known as an \"odd Schrödinger cat state\".

Therefore, the reference state `tau` must also be a \"centered\" Gaussian state.\n*   **Second Moments**: A centered Gaussian state is fully defined by its second moments. The moments of `tau` must match those of `rho`. For an odd cat state, these are given by standard formulas:\n    *   Average photon number: `<n> = <a†a> = |alpha|^2 * coth(|alpha|^2)`\n    *   Squeezing parameter: `<a^2> = <aa> = alpha^2`\n\n**Step 4: Formulate and Calculate the Entropy of `tau`**\n\nThe entropy of a centered, single-mode Gaussian state is calculated from its symplectic eigenvalue, `nu`.\n\n*   The eigenvalue is found from the second moments: `nu^2 = (<n> + 1/2)^2 - |<a^2>|^2`.\n*   The entropy is then given by: `S(tau) = (nu + 1/2)ln(nu + 1/2) - (nu - 1/2)ln(nu - 1/2)`.\n\nLet's perform the numerical calculation with `alpha = 0.5`:\n1.  `alpha^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25`. This gives `<a^2> = 0.25`.\n2.  `<n> = 0.25 * coth(0.25)`. Since `coth(0.25) ≈ 4.083`, we have `<n> ≈ 0.25 * 4.083 = 1.02075`.\n3.  Calculate the symplectic eigenvalue `nu`:\n    *   `nu^2 ≈ (1.02075 + 0.5)^2 - (0.25)^2`\n    *   `nu^2 ≈ (1.52075)^2 - 0.0625 ≈ 2.31268 - 0.0625 = 2.25018`\n    *   This gives `nu ≈ sqrt(2.25) = 1.5`.\n*   **Careful Point**: It can be shown analytically that for this specific state, the symplectic eigenvalue `nu` is *exactly* 1.5. This leads to a very clean final expression.\n\n4.  Substitute `nu = 1.5` into the entropy formula:\n    *   `nG = S(tau) = (1.5 + 0.5)ln(1.5 + 0.5) - (1.5 - 0.5)ln(1.5 - 0.5)`\n    *   `nG = 2*ln(2) - 1*ln(1)`\n    *   Since `ln(1) = 0`, the final result is `nG = 2*ln(2)`.\n\n5.

For the odd cat state, these are given by well-established formulas which were correctly identified by the candidate answers:\n    *   Average photon number: `<n> = <a†a> = |alpha|^2 * coth(|alpha|^2)`\n    *   Squeezing parameter: `<a^2> = <aa> = alpha^2`\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Entropy of `tau`**\nThe entropy of a centered, single-mode Gaussian state `tau` can be calculated from its symplectic eigenvalue, `nu`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: The Entropy Formula**\n    The entropy is given by: `S(tau) = (nu + 1/2)ln(nu + 1/2) - (nu - 1/2)ln(nu - 1/2)`\n*   The relationship between the eigenvalue `nu` and the second moments is: `nu^2 = (<n> + 1/2)^2 - |<a^2>|^2`\n\n### **Step 5: Perform the Numerical Calculation**\nNow we substitute the value `alpha = 0.5`.\n\n1.  Calculate `alpha^2`: `alpha^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25`.\n2.  Calculate the second moments:\n    *   `<a^2> = alpha^2 = 0.25`\n    *   `<n> = 0.25 * coth(0.25)`. Using `coth(x) = (e^x + e^-x) / (e^x - e^-x)`, we find `coth(0.25) ≈ 4.083`.\n    *   Therefore, `<n> ≈ 0.25 * 4.083 = 1.02075`\n3.  Calculate the symplectic eigenvalue `nu`:\n    *   `nu^2 ≈ (1.02075 + 0.5)^2 - (0.25)^2`\n    *   `nu^2 ≈ (1.52075)^2 - 0.0625 ≈ 2.31268 - 0.0625 = 2.25018`\n    *   `nu = sqrt(2.25018) ≈ 1.5`.\n\n**Careful Point 4: Analytical Result for `nu`**\nAs noted by many candidate answers, it can be shown analytically that for this specific state, the symplectic eigenvalue `nu` is *exactly* 1.5. Our numerical calculation confirms this.\n\n4.  Calculate the entropy with the exact value `nu = 1.5`:\n    *   `nG = S(tau) = (1.5 + 0.5)ln(1.5 + 0.5) - (1.5 - 0.5)ln(1.5 - 0.5)`\n    *   `nG = 2*ln(2) - 1*ln(1)`\n    *   Since `ln(1) = 0`, this simplifies to: `nG = 2*ln(2)`\n    *   `nG ≈ 2 * 0.693147 = 1.38629`\n\n### **Final Decision**\nThe calculated value for the non-Gaussianity is `nG ≈ 1.386`.

A critical simplification arises from the fact that the von Neumann entropy `S(rho)` of any pure state is exactly zero. This reduces the problem to calculating the entropy of the reference Gaussian state `tau`:\n`nG = S(tau)`\n\n**Careful Point 2: Identifying the Specific Quantum State**\n\nThe state is given by `|psi> =( cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> )/ N` with parameters `phi = -pi / 4` and `alpha = 0.5`. Substituting the phase `phi` gives:\n*   `cos(-pi/4) = 1/√2`\n*   `sin(-pi/4) = -1/√2`\nThe state thus becomes proportional to `|alpha> - |-alpha>`, which is the \"odd Schrödinger cat state.\" Recognizing this specific state is helpful as its properties are well-known.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Defining the Reference Gaussian State `tau`**\n\nThe reference state `tau` is a Gaussian state that must have the same first and second moments as our non-Gaussian state `rho`.\n*   **First Moment `<a>`:** For the odd cat state, the average displacement `<a> = <psi|a|psi>` is zero due to symmetry.

Calculate the second moments for `rho`:\n    *   `<a^2> = 0.25`.\n    *   `<n> = 0.25 * coth(0.25)`. Calculating `coth(0.25) = 1/tanh(0.25) ≈ 4.08298` gives `<n> ≈ 0.25 * 4.08298 ≈ 1.02075`.\n3.  Calculate the symplectic eigenvalue `nu`:\n    *   `nu^2 ≈ (1.02075 + 0.5)^2 - (0.25)^2`\n    *   `nu^2 ≈ (1.52075)^2 - 0.0625 ≈ 2.31268 - 0.0625 = 2.25018`\n    *   `nu ≈ sqrt(2.25018) ≈ 1.50006`. This is extremely close to `1.5`, and it is an analytically exact result for these parameters that `nu = 1.5`.\n4.  Substitute the exact value `nu = 1.5` into the entropy formula:\n    *   `S(tau) = (1.5 + 0.5)ln(1.5 + 0.5) - (1.5 - 0.5)ln(1.5 - 0.5)`\n    *   `S(tau) = 2*ln(2) - 1*ln(1)`\n5.  Since `ln(1) = 0`, the final result is `nG = S(tau) = 2*ln(2)`.\n6.  Numerically, `nG ≈ 2 * 0.693147 ≈ 1.38629`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated non-Gaussianity is `nG ≈ 1.386`.

The state `|psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>) / N` is a pure quantum state. The von Neumann entropy `S(rho)` of any pure state is exactly zero. Therefore, the problem reduces to calculating the entropy of the reference Gaussian state:\n`nG = S(tau)`\n\n**Careful Point 2: Characterizing the Specific Quantum State**\nThe problem specifies the parameters `phi = -pi/4` and `alpha = 0.5`. Substituting the value of `phi` into the state vector gives:\n`cos(-pi/4) = 1/√2`\n`sin(-pi/4) = -1/√2`\nThe state becomes `|psi> ∝ (|alpha> - |-alpha>)`. This is a well-known state called the \"odd Schrödinger cat state,\" and its properties are well-documented.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Defining the Reference Gaussian State `tau`**\nThe reference state `tau` is a Gaussian state that is constructed to have the same first and second statistical moments as the non-Gaussian state `rho`.\n*   **First Moment:** Due to the symmetry of the odd cat state, the average displacement (the expectation value of the annihilation operator `a`) is zero. `<a> = 0`. Consequently, the reference state `tau` must also be a \"centered\" Gaussian state.\n*   **Second Moments:** A centered Gaussian state is fully defined by its second moments, which are matched to those of the odd cat state. The standard formulas are:\n    *   Average photon number: `<n> = <a†a> = |alpha|^2 * coth(|alpha|^2)`\n    *   Squeezing term: `<a^2> = <aa> = alpha^2`\n\n**Careful Point 4: Calculating the Entropy of the Gaussian State `tau`**\nThe entropy of a centered, single-mode Gaussian state is not calculated directly from the moments, but via an intermediate quantity called the **symplectic eigenvalue**, `nu`.\n*   First, the eigenvalue `nu` is found from the second moments: `nu^2 = (<n> + 1/2)^2 - |<a^2>|^2`.\n*   Second, the entropy `S(tau)` is calculated using the formula: `S(tau) = (nu + 1/2)ln(nu + 1/2) - (nu - 1/2)ln(nu - 1/2)`.\n\n**Careful Point 5: Performing the Numerical Calculation**\nNow, we substitute `alpha = 0.5` into the formulas.\n1.  `alpha^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25`. This gives `<a^2> = 0.25`.\n2.  `<n> = 0.25 * coth(0.25)`. Using `coth(x) = (e^x + e^-x) / (e^x - e^-x)`, we find `coth(0.25) ≈ 4.083`, which results in `<n> ≈ 0.25 * 4.083 ≈ 1.02075`.\n3.  Next, we find the symplectic eigenvalue `nu`:\n    `nu^2 ≈ (1.02075 + 0.5)^2 - (0.25)^2`\n    `nu^2 ≈ (1.52075)^2 - 0.0625 ≈ 2.3127 - 0.0625 ≈ 2.25`\n4.  This gives `nu = sqrt(2.25) = 1.5`. This result is analytically exact.\n5.  Finally, we calculate the entropy `S(tau)` using `nu = 1.5`:\n    `nG = S(tau) = (1.5 + 0.5)ln(1.5 + 0.5) - (1.5 - 0.5)ln(1.5 - 0.5)`\n    `nG = 2*ln(2) - 1*ln(1)`\n6.

This can be expressed using the von Neumann entropy `S(X) = -trace(X*ln(X))`, which rewrites the formula as:\n`nG = S(tau) - S(rho)`\n\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The initial state `|psi>` is a state vector, representing a **pure quantum state**. A fundamental property of any pure state is that its von Neumann entropy is exactly zero. Therefore, `S(rho) = 0`. This simplifies the problem significantly, as the non-Gaussianity is simply the entropy of the reference Gaussian state: `nG = S(tau)`.\n\n**Step 2: Define the reference Gaussian state `tau`.**\nThe reference state `tau` is a Gaussian state constructed to have the same first and second statistical moments as the non-Gaussian state `rho`. First, we characterize `rho` with the given parameters `alpha = 0.5` and `phi = -pi / 4`. This results in the \"odd Schrödinger cat state,\" which is proportional to `|alpha> - |-alpha>`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2:** Due to the symmetry of the odd cat state, its first moment (the average displacement) is zero: `<a> = 0`. This means the reference state `tau` must also be a centered Gaussian state (i.e., a squeezed thermal state with zero displacement).\n\n*   **Careful Point 3:** A centered Gaussian state is fully defined by its second moments. These must match the moments of `rho`. For an odd cat state, these moments are given by standard formulas:\n    *   Mean photon number: `<n> = <a†a> = |alpha|^2 * coth(|alpha|^2)`\n    *   Squeezing parameter: `<a^2> = alpha^2`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the entropy of the reference state `tau`.**\nThe entropy of a centered, single-mode Gaussian state `tau` is calculated from its symplectic eigenvalue, `nu` (or `ν`).\n\n*   **Careful Point 4:** The formula for the symplectic eigenvalue `nu` is derived from the second moments: `nu^2 = (<n> + 1/2)^2 - |<a^2>|^2`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 5:** The formula for the entropy of the Gaussian state in terms of its eigenvalue is: `S(tau) = (nu + 1/2)ln(nu + 1/2) - (nu - 1/2)ln(nu - 1/2)`.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the numerical calculation.**\nNow we substitute the value `alpha = 0.5` and proceed with the calculation.\n\n1.  `alpha^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25`.\n2.  Calculate the second moments:\n    *   `<a^2> = 0.25`\n    *   `<n> = 0.25 * coth(0.25) ≈ 0.25 * 4.083 ≈ 1.02075`.\n3.  Calculate the symplectic eigenvalue `nu`:\n    *   `nu^2 ≈ (1.02075 + 0.5)^2 - (0.25)^2`\n    *   `nu^2 ≈ (1.52075)^2 - 0.0625 ≈ 2.31268 - 0.0625 = 2.25018`.\n4.  **Careful Point 6:** The result for `nu^2` is extremely close to 2.25. Analytically, this result is exact. Therefore, we can confidently use `nu = sqrt(2.25) = 1.5`.\n5.  Substitute `nu = 1.5` into the entropy formula:\n    *   `S(tau) = (1.5 + 0.5)ln(1.5 + 0.5) - (1.5 - 0.5)ln(1.5 - 0.5)`\n    *   `S(tau) = 2*ln(2) - 1*ln(1)`\n    *   Since `ln(1) = 0`, this simplifies to `S(tau) = 2*ln(2)`.\n6.  The final numerical result is `nG = S(tau) ≈ 2 * 0.6931 = 1.3862`.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion.**\nThe calculated value for the non-Gaussianity is `nG ≈ 1.386`. We now compare this to the provided options:\nA) 0\nB) 2.48\nC) 1.38\nD) 0.25\n\nThe calculated value of `1.386` is best matched by option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem with all the careful points highlighted, as requested.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the Non-Gaussianity (nG) Formula**\nThe problem defines non-Gaussianity as the relative entropy between the state's density matrix `rho` and that of a reference Gaussian state `tau`:\n`del_b = trace(rho*ln(rho)) - trace(tau*ln(tau))`\nThis formula can be expressed more cleanly using the von Neumann entropy, `S(X) = -trace(X*ln(X))`. The formula then becomes:\n`nG = del_b = S(tau) - S(rho)`\n\n*   **Careful Point 1**: The most crucial simplification is recognizing that the given state `|psi>` is a **pure state**. The von Neumann entropy `S(rho)` of any pure state is always exactly zero. This reduces the problem to calculating the entropy of the reference Gaussian state alone: `nG = S(tau)`.\n\n**Step 2: Characterize the Specific State (`rho`)**\nThe state is `|psi> =( cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> )/ N` with given parameters `phi = -pi/4` and `alpha = 0.5`.\nSubstituting `phi = -pi/4` into the trigonometric functions, we get `cos(-pi/4) = 1/√2` and `sin(-pi/4) = -1/√2`. The state then simplifies to:\n`|psi> ∝ (|alpha> - |-alpha>)`\n\n*   **Careful Point 2**: This specific superposition is known as an \"odd Schrödinger cat state\". Its symmetry is a key feature that simplifies the calculation of its statistical moments.\n\n**Step 3: Define the Reference Gaussian State (`tau`)**\nThe reference state `tau` is a Gaussian state that is constructed to have the same first and second statistical moments as the non-Gaussian state `rho`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3**: Because the odd cat state is symmetric, its first moment (the average displacement) is zero: `<a> = <psi|a|psi> = 0`. Therefore, the reference state `tau` must also have a zero mean displacement, making it a \"centered Gaussian state\" (a type of squeezed thermal state). This state is fully characterized by its second moments.\n\n**Step 4: Formulate the Calculation of `S(tau)`**\nThe entropy of a centered Gaussian state `tau` depends on its **symplectic eigenvalue**, `nu` (or `ν`). The calculation proceeds in two parts:\n1.  First, we find the second moments of `rho` to define `tau`. For an odd cat state, the standard formulas are:\n    *   Mean photon number: `<n> = <a†a> = |alpha|^2 * coth(|alpha|^2)`\n    *   Squeezing parameter: `<a^2> = <aa> = alpha^2`\n2.  Next, we use these moments to find the symplectic eigenvalue `nu`:\n    `nu^2 = (<n> + 1/2)^2 - |<a^2>|^2`\n3.  Finally, we calculate the entropy of `tau` using `nu`:\n    `S(tau) = (nu + 1/2)ln(nu + 1/2) - (nu - 1/2)ln(nu - 1/2)`\n\n*   **Careful Point 4**: It is essential to use the correct formulas for both the moments of the odd cat state and the subsequent entropy calculation for the Gaussian state. Mixing these up is a common source of error.\n\n**Step 5: Perform the Numerical Calculation**\nWe now substitute the given value `alpha = 0.5`.\n1.  `alpha^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25`. This gives `<a^2> = 0.25`.\n2.  `<n> = 0.25 * coth(0.25)`. Using a calculator, `coth(0.25) ≈ 4.083`, so `<n> ≈ 0.25 * 4.083 ≈ 1.02075`.\n3.  Calculate the symplectic eigenvalue `nu`:\n    `nu^2 ≈ (1.02075 + 0.5)^2 - (0.25)^2`\n    `nu^2 ≈ (1.52075)^2 - 0.0625 ≈ 2.31268 - 0.0625 = 2.25018`\n    `nu = sqrt(2.25018) ≈ 1.50006`\n\n*   **Careful Point 5**: This result for `nu` is extremely close to 1.5. In fact, it can be shown analytically that for this specific state, `nu` is *exactly* 1.5. Using `nu = 1.5` simplifies the final step.\n\n4.  Calculate the entropy with the exact value `nu = 1.5`:\n    `nG = S(tau) = (1.5 + 0.5)ln(1.5 + 0.5) - (1.5 - 0.5)ln(1.5 - 0.5)`\n    `nG = 2*ln(2) - 1*ln(1)`\n    Since `ln(1) = 0`, this simplifies to:\n    `nG = 2*ln(2) ≈ 2 * 0.693147 = 1.38629...`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated non-Gaussianity is `nG ≈ 1.386`. We now compare this value with the provided options:\nA) 0.25\nB) 0\nC) 2.48\nD) 1.38\n\nThe calculated value is best matched by option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
