The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound appears consistent with the expected molecule, with the exception of two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals (together they integrate to 1H - the expected integral); based on the coupling pattern, you can rule out spin-spin coupling as an explanation for the duplicate peaks. LC-MS analysis of the crude compound at elevated temperature shows two clearly defined peaks of equal intensities. Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected molecule. What is the most likely explanation for these observations?\n\nA) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers\nB) The compound is contaminated with a precursor\nC) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers\nD) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the most logical explanation for the experimental observations, synthesizing the common reasoning from the provided answers.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data.**\nThis is the most definitive starting point.\n*   **Observation:** The LC-MS analysis shows two distinct peaks in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace. Critically, the mass spectrum (MS) for **both peaks is identical** and matches the mass of the expected product molecule.\n*   **Careful Point/Conclusion:** This observation proves that the two species in the sample are **isomers**. Isomers are molecules that share the same chemical formula and thus the same molecular weight, but differ in the spatial arrangement of their atoms.\n*   **Elimination:** This fact immediately rules out any explanation that involves impurities with a different molecular weight.\n    *   **(A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** Incorrect. A precursor is a starting material or intermediate and would have a different (usually lower) mass.\n    *   **(C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** Incorrect. This side reaction would add an extra chemical group, resulting in a product with a different (higher) mass.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Chromatography (LC) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Data.**\nWith options A and C eliminated, we know the sample is a mixture of isomers. The remaining options are enantiomers (B) or diastereoisomers (D). The LC and NMR data are used to distinguish between them.\n*   **Observation 1 (LC):** The two isomers are physically separated into two distinct peaks by liquid chromatography.\n*   **Observation 2 (NMR):** A single type of proton (the alpha-proton) gives rise to two distinct signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n*   **Careful Point/Conclusion:** For two species to be separated by a standard LC column and be distinguishable by a standard NMR spectrometer, they must have **different physical and chemical properties** in an achiral environment.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Isomer Options.**\n*   **(B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n    *   Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other.\n    *   In a standard (achiral) environment, enantiomers have **identical** physical and chemical properties.\n    *   Therefore, they are **inseparable** by standard LC (they would elute as a single peak) and **indistinguishable** by standard NMR (they would produce a single, identical set of signals). This directly contradicts the experimental data.\n\n*   **(D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n    *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are **not** mirror images of each other. In peptide synthesis, this is often caused by epimerization (the inversion of one of several chiral centers) or the formation of stable cis/trans isomers around an amide bond (rotamers).\n    *   Crucially, diastereoisomers have **different** physical and chemical properties.\n    *   This difference perfectly explains all observations:\n        1.  As isomers, they have the **same mass** (consistent with MS data).\n        2.  Their different physical properties allow them to be **separated by standard LC** (consistent with two LC peaks).\n        3.  Their different 3D structures and chemical environments cause them to have **different NMR spectra** (consistent with two NMR signals for the same proton).\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe only explanation that is fully consistent with all pieces of experimental data (MS, LC, and NMR) is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, synthesizing the careful points from the provided evidence.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data\nThis is the most definitive starting point.\n*   **Observation**: The LC-MS analysis separates the sample into two distinct peaks in the liquid chromatogram (LC). Critically, the mass spectrum (MS) for *both* peaks is identical and matches the mass of the expected product molecule.\n*   **Careful Point**: The observation that both components have the same mass is crucial. It proves that they are not unrelated impurities but are in fact **isomers**—molecules with the same chemical formula and molecular weight, differing only in their atomic arrangement.\n*   **Conclusion**: This fact immediately allows for the elimination of options describing impurities with a different molecular weight.\n    *   **Eliminates Option A (Precursor)**: A precursor is a starting material or intermediate from the synthesis and would have a different (usually lower) mass.\n    *   **Eliminates Option B (Double coupling)**: This side reaction would create a product with an extra molecular group attached, resulting in a different (higher) mass.\n\n### Step 2: Differentiate Between the Remaining Isomer Types using LC and NMR Data\nWith options A and B ruled out, the sample must be a mixture of isomers. The remaining possibilities are enantiomers (Option C) or diastereoisomers (Option D).\n\n*   **Observation**:\n    1.  The two components are physically separated by liquid chromatography, resulting in two distinct peaks.\n    2.  The two components are chemically distinguishable by ¹H NMR, with a single type of proton showing two distinct signals.\n*   **Careful Point**: For two species to be separated and distinguished by standard (achiral) LC and NMR, they must possess different physical and chemical properties.\n*   **Evaluation of Option C (Mixture of enantiomers)**:\n    *   Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images. They have **identical** physical and chemical properties in an achiral environment (such as a standard LC column or NMR solvent).\n    *   Therefore, they are **inseparable** by standard LC and **indistinguishable** by standard NMR. They would produce a single peak in both techniques.\n    *   This is in direct contradiction to the experimental data, so Option C is incorrect.\n*   **Evaluation of Option D (Mixture of diastereoisomers)**:\n    *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are **not** mirror images of each other. This is a common situation in peptide synthesis, often occurring due to partial inversion of a chiral center (epimerization) or due to restricted rotation around a peptide bond creating stable *cis*/*trans* isomers (rotamers), which are a class of diastereomers.\n    *   Crucially, diastereoisomers have **different** physical and chemical properties.\n    *   This difference in properties perfectly explains all the experimental data:\n        *   They are separable by standard LC, accounting for the two chromatographic peaks.\n        *   They are chemically distinct, leading to different NMR spectra and explaining the two signals for the alpha-proton.\n        *   As isomers, they have the same mass, consistent with the MS data.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe combined evidence presents a classic analytical signature: the sample contains a mixture of two species that are isomers (same mass) but have different physical and chemical properties, allowing them to be separated by LC and distinguished by NMR.

Furthermore, this mass is consistent with the expected product molecule.\n*   **Careful Point / Conclusion:** This proves that the two species present in the mixture are **isomers**. Isomers are molecules that share the same chemical formula and thus the same molecular weight, but differ in the spatial arrangement of their atoms.\n*   **Elimination of Options:** This single fact allows us to immediately rule out any explanation that involves impurities with a different molecular weight.\n    *   **Option (D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would be an unreacted starting material or an intermediate from a previous step. It would have a different (usually lower) mass. This is inconsistent with the MS data.\n    *   **Option (B) 'Double coupling' has occurred...:** This side reaction describes the addition of an extra molecular fragment (like another amino acid). This would result in a product with a different (higher) mass. This is also inconsistent with the MS data.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Chromatography (LC) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Data**\nNow that we have established that the sample is a mixture of isomers, we must use the remaining data to distinguish between the two remaining possibilities: a mixture of enantiomers (Option A) or a mixture of diastereoisomers (Option C).\n\n*   **Observations:**\n    1.  The two species are physically separable into two distinct peaks by standard LC.\n    2.

This is a common situation in molecules with multiple chiral centers, such as peptides. Epimerization (the inversion of stereochemistry at a single chiral center) during synthesis is a frequent cause.\n    *   Critically, diastereoisomers have **different** physical and chemical properties.\n    *   This explanation is perfectly consistent with all experimental observations:\n        *   They are isomers, which fits the MS data (same mass).\n        *   Their different physical properties allow them to be separated by standard LC, explaining the two LC peaks.\n        *   Their different chemical structures give them different chemical environments, explaining the two distinct NMR signals for the same proton.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe combination of observing two species that have the same mass (are isomers) but are separable by standard chromatography and distinguishable by standard NMR spectroscopy is the classic analytical signature of a diastereomeric mixture.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n\n*   **Observation**: The LC-MS analysis separates the sample into two distinct peaks in the chromatogram (LC).

The ¹H NMR spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single type of proton (the alpha-proton).\n*   **Careful Point/Conclusion**: These observations indicate that the two isomers are physically and chemically distinct entities.

The remaining possibilities are a mixture of enantiomers (Option B) or a mixture of diastereoisomers (Option D).\n\n*   **Observation**:\n    1.  The liquid chromatogram shows two distinct, separable peaks.\n    2.  The ¹H NMR spectrum shows two distinct signals for a single type of proton (the alpha-proton).\n*   **Careful Point/Conclusion**: For two compounds to be separable by standard LC and distinguishable by standard NMR, they must have **different physical and chemical properties** in a standard (achiral) analytical environment.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Isomer Options**\n\n*   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers**:\n    *   Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other.

Therefore:\n    *   They would **not** separate on a standard LC column and would elute as a single peak.\n    *   They are **indistinguishable** in a standard NMR spectrum and would produce a single, identical set of signals.\n    *   This is in direct contradiction to both the LC and NMR observations. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are **not** mirror images of each other. This is a common situation in molecules with multiple stereocenters, like peptides, where a synthesis step might partially invert the stereochemistry at one (but not all) of the chiral centers (a process called epimerization).\n    *   Because diastereoisomers are not mirror images, they have **different** physical and chemical properties, even in an achiral environment.\n    *   This perfectly explains all the experimental data:\n        1.

To distinguish between these, we must analyze the remaining data.\n\n*   **Observation from NMR and LC**:\n    1.  The ¹H NMR spectrum shows two distinct signals for a single alpha-proton.\n    2.  The Liquid Chromatography (LC) separates the sample into two distinct peaks.\n*   **Careful Point**: These observations indicate that the two isomers are physically and chemically distinct. For them to be separated by a standard LC column and give different signals in a standard NMR experiment, they must have different properties in a standard (achiral) environment.\n\n*   **Evaluating Option C (Mixture of enantiomers)**:\n    *   Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images. A defining characteristic is that they possess **identical** physical and chemical properties in an achiral environment.\n    *   Because their properties are identical in this context, they are **indistinguishable** by standard ¹H NMR (they would produce a single set of signals) and **inseparable** by standard LC (they would elute as a single peak).\n    *   **Conclusion**: This option is in direct contradiction to both the NMR and LC data.\n\n*   **Evaluating Option B (Mixture of diastereoisomers)**:\n    *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are **not** mirror images of each other. A common example in peptide synthesis is epimerization, where one chiral center of a multi-center molecule inverts (e.g., an L-amino acid center inverts to a D-center, creating a diastereomer of the intended peptide).\n    *   **Consistency with Data**: Crucially, diastereoisomers have **different** physical and chemical properties in all environments (both chiral and achiral).\n        *   Their different physical properties explain why they separate into two peaks on an LC column.\n        *   Their different chemical properties and 3D structures explain why their NMR spectra are different, resulting in two distinct peaks for the alpha-proton.\n        *   Their status as isomers explains why they have the same mass, consistent with the MS data.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This explanation is perfectly consistent with every piece of experimental data provided.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe combination of observing two species that (1) have the same mass, (2) are separable by standard chromatography, and (3) are distinguishable by standard NMR spectroscopy is the definitive analytical signature for a mixture of **diastereoisomers**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided experimental evidence.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n\nThis is the most critical starting point as it provides the most definitive information about the molecular composition of the two species.\n\n*   **Careful Point**: The observation is that while the LC separates the sample into two peaks, both of these peaks yield the **exact same mass spectrum**. This mass is also consistent with the expected product molecule.\n*   **Conclusion**: This observation proves that the two species in the mixture are **isomers**. Isomers are molecules that share the same chemical formula and thus the same molecular weight, but differ in the spatial arrangement of their atoms.\n*   **Implication**: This fact immediately rules out any explanation involving impurities that would have a different molecular weight. Options (B) and (C) are therefore incorrect.\n    *   **Contamination with a precursor (C)**: A precursor would be a starting material or intermediate from the synthesis and would have a different (usually lower) molecular weight.\n    *   **'Double coupling' side reaction (B)**: This side reaction would create a product with an extra molecular group attached, resulting in a higher molecular weight.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Chromatography (LC) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Data**\n\nNow that we know the sample is a mixture of two isomers, we must distinguish between the two remaining possibilities: a mixture of enantiomers (A) or a mixture of diastereoisomers (D).\n\n*   **Careful Point**: The observation is that the two species are **separable by standard liquid chromatography** and are **distinguishable by standard ¹H NMR spectroscopy**. The separation by LC implies they have different physical properties (e.g., polarity, shape), causing them to interact differently with the chromatography column. The distinct NMR signals imply that the alpha-proton exists in a different chemical environment in each isomer.\n*   **Conclusion**: The two isomers must have different physical and chemical properties in a standard (achiral) environment.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Isomer Options**\n\n*   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n    *   Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. A key characteristic is that they have **identical** physical and chemical properties in a standard (achiral) environment.\n    *   Therefore, enantiomers are **inseparable by standard LC** and are **indistinguishable by standard NMR**. They would appear as a single peak in both experiments. This is in direct contradiction to the experimental data. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n    *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are **not** mirror images of each other. This is a common phenomenon in peptide synthesis, often occurring when one of the chiral centers inverts during a reaction step (a process called epimerization).\n    *   Crucially, diastereoisomers have **different physical and chemical properties**. This perfectly explains all observations:\n        1.  They are isomers, so they have the **same mass** (consistent with the MS data).\n        2.  They have different physical properties, so they can be **separated by standard LC** (consistent with the two LC peaks).\n        3.  They are chemically distinct, so their protons have different electronic environments, producing **different signals in an NMR spectrum** (consistent with the two NMR peaks).\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe collective evidence provides a classic analytical signature for a mixture of diastereoisomers.

What is the most likely explanation for these observations?\n\nA) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers\nB) The compound is contaminated with a precursor\nC) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers\nD) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the most logical explanation for the experimental observations, synthesizing the common reasoning from the provided answers.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data.**\nThis is the most definitive starting point.\n*   **Observation:** The LC-MS analysis shows two distinct peaks in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace. Critically, the mass spectrum (MS) for **both peaks is identical** and matches the mass of the expected product molecule.\n*   **Careful Point/Conclusion:** This observation proves that the two species in the sample are **isomers**. Isomers are molecules that share the same chemical formula and thus the same molecular weight, but differ in the spatial arrangement of their atoms.\n*   **Elimination:** This fact immediately rules out any explanation that involves impurities with a different molecular weight.\n    *   **(A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** Incorrect. A precursor is a starting material or intermediate and would have a different (usually lower) mass.\n    *   **(C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** Incorrect. This side reaction would add an extra chemical group, resulting in a product with a different (higher) mass.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Chromatography (LC) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Data.**\nWith options A and C eliminated, we know the sample is a mixture of isomers. The remaining options are enantiomers (B) or diastereoisomers (D). The LC and NMR data are used to distinguish between them.\n*   **Observation 1 (LC):** The two isomers are physically separated into two distinct peaks by liquid chromatography.\n*   **Observation 2 (NMR):** A single type of proton (the alpha-proton) gives rise to two distinct signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n*   **Careful Point/Conclusion:** For two species to be separated by a standard LC column and be distinguishable by a standard NMR spectrometer, they must have **different physical and chemical properties** in an achiral environment.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Isomer Options.**\n*   **(B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n    *   Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other.\n    *   In a standard (achiral) environment, enantiomers have **identical** physical and chemical properties.\n    *   Therefore, they are **inseparable** by standard LC (they would elute as a single peak) and **indistinguishable** by standard NMR (they would produce a single, identical set of signals). This directly contradicts the experimental data.\n\n*   **(D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n    *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are **not** mirror images of each other. In peptide synthesis, this is often caused by epimerization (the inversion of one of several chiral centers) or the formation of stable cis/trans isomers around an amide bond (rotamers).\n    *   Crucially, diastereoisomers have **different** physical and chemical properties.\n    *   This difference perfectly explains all observations:\n        1.  As isomers, they have the **same mass** (consistent with MS data).\n        2.  Their different physical properties allow them to be **separated by standard LC** (consistent with two LC peaks).\n        3.  Their different 3D structures and chemical environments cause them to have **different NMR spectra** (consistent with two NMR signals for the same proton).\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe only explanation that is fully consistent with all pieces of experimental data (MS, LC, and NMR) is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, synthesizing the careful points from the provided evidence.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data\nThis is the most definitive starting point.\n*   **Observation**: The LC-MS analysis separates the sample into two distinct peaks in the liquid chromatogram (LC). Critically, the mass spectrum (MS) for *both* peaks is identical and matches the mass of the expected product molecule.\n*   **Careful Point**: The observation that both components have the same mass is crucial. It proves that they are not unrelated impurities but are in fact **isomers**—molecules with the same chemical formula and molecular weight, differing only in their atomic arrangement.\n*   **Conclusion**: This fact immediately allows for the elimination of options describing impurities with a different molecular weight.\n    *   **Eliminates Option A (Precursor)**: A precursor is a starting material or intermediate from the synthesis and would have a different (usually lower) mass.\n    *   **Eliminates Option B (Double coupling)**: This side reaction would create a product with an extra molecular group attached, resulting in a different (higher) mass.\n\n### Step 2: Differentiate Between the Remaining Isomer Types using LC and NMR Data\nWith options A and B ruled out, the sample must be a mixture of isomers. The remaining possibilities are enantiomers (Option C) or diastereoisomers (Option D).\n\n*   **Observation**:\n    1.  The two components are physically separated by liquid chromatography, resulting in two distinct peaks.\n    2.  The two components are chemically distinguishable by ¹H NMR, with a single type of proton showing two distinct signals.\n*   **Careful Point**: For two species to be separated and distinguished by standard (achiral) LC and NMR, they must possess different physical and chemical properties.\n*   **Evaluation of Option C (Mixture of enantiomers)**:\n    *   Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images. They have **identical** physical and chemical properties in an achiral environment (such as a standard LC column or NMR solvent).\n    *   Therefore, they are **inseparable** by standard LC and **indistinguishable** by standard NMR. They would produce a single peak in both techniques.\n    *   This is in direct contradiction to the experimental data, so Option C is incorrect.\n*   **Evaluation of Option D (Mixture of diastereoisomers)**:\n    *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are **not** mirror images of each other. This is a common situation in peptide synthesis, often occurring due to partial inversion of a chiral center (epimerization) or due to restricted rotation around a peptide bond creating stable *cis*/*trans* isomers (rotamers), which are a class of diastereomers.\n    *   Crucially, diastereoisomers have **different** physical and chemical properties.\n    *   This difference in properties perfectly explains all the experimental data:\n        *   They are separable by standard LC, accounting for the two chromatographic peaks.\n        *   They are chemically distinct, leading to different NMR spectra and explaining the two signals for the alpha-proton.\n        *   As isomers, they have the same mass, consistent with the MS data.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe combined evidence presents a classic analytical signature: the sample contains a mixture of two species that are isomers (same mass) but have different physical and chemical properties, allowing them to be separated by LC and distinguished by NMR.

Critically, both of these peaks yield the **exact same mass spectrum**, and this mass is consistent with the expected product molecule.\n*   **Careful Point**: The fact that both species have the same mass proves that they are **isomers**. Isomers are molecules that share the same chemical formula and molecular weight but differ in the spatial arrangement of their atoms.\n*   **Conclusion**: This observation immediately rules out any explanation that involves impurities with a different molecular weight.\n    *   **Option (B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor**: This is incorrect. A precursor (a starting material or intermediate) would have a different, likely lower, molecular weight.\n    *   **Option (D) 'Double coupling' has occurred...**: This is incorrect. This side reaction describes the addition of an extra molecular fragment, which would result in a product with a different, higher, molecular weight.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Chromatography (LC) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Data\n\nWith options (B) and (D) eliminated, we know the sample is a mixture of isomers. The remaining possibilities are a mixture of enantiomers (C) or a mixture of diastereoisomers (A). The LC and NMR data allow us to distinguish between these two.\n\n*   **Observation**:\n    1.  The compound separates into two clearly defined peaks in the liquid chromatogram (LC).\n    2.  The ¹H NMR spectrum shows two distinct peaks for the same alpha-proton.\n*   **Careful Point**: For two species to be separated by a standard LC column and be distinguished by a standard NMR spectrometer, they must have **different physical and chemical properties** in a standard (achiral) environment.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Isomer Options\n\n*   **Option (C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers**:\n    *   Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images. They have **identical** physical and chemical properties in an achiral environment (like a standard LC column or NMR solvent).\n    *   Therefore, they are **inseparable** by standard LC and **indistinguishable** by standard NMR. They would produce only a single peak in both experiments. This is in direct contradiction to the observed data.\n\n*   **Option (A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**:\n    *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are **not** mirror images of each other. In peptide synthesis, this can commonly arise from the partial inversion of a chiral center (epimerization) or from the presence of stable cis/trans isomers of an amide bond (these are called rotamers, which are a class of diastereomer).\n    *   Crucially, diastereoisomers have **different physical and chemical properties**. This perfectly explains all observations:\n        *   Their status as isomers is consistent with the MS data (same mass).\n        *   Their different physical properties allow them to be separated by standard LC (two LC peaks).\n        *   Their different chemical environments cause them to produce distinct NMR spectra (two NMR peaks for the same proton).\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe combined experimental evidence—two species with the same mass (isomers) that are separable and distinguishable by standard chromatographic and spectroscopic methods—is the classic analytical signature for a mixture of **diastereoisomers**. This is the only option that fits all the facts.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided experimental evidence.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data.**\nThis is the most definitive piece of information provided. The LC-MS analysis separates the crude compound into two distinct peaks in the liquid chromatogram (LC). However, the mass spectrum (MS) for both of these peaks is identical and matches the mass of the expected molecule.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The fact that both species have the same mass proves they are **isomers**. Isomers are molecules that share the same chemical formula and molecular weight but differ in the arrangement of their atoms in three-dimensional space.\n*   **Conclusion:** This immediately rules out any explanation involving impurities that would have a different molecular weight.\n    *   Option (B) \"The compound is contaminated with a precursor\" is incorrect. A precursor molecule would be a starting material or intermediate from the synthesis and would have a different (usually lower) mass.\n    *   Option (C) \"'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction\" is incorrect. This side reaction describes the addition of an extra molecular fragment (like another amino acid), which would result in a product with a different (higher) mass.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Chromatography (LC) and NMR Data to Distinguish Between Isomers.**\nHaving eliminated options B and C, we are left with the two remaining possibilities, which are both types of isomers: enantiomers (A) and diastereoisomers (D). We must use the LC and NMR data to distinguish between them.\n\n*   **Observations:** The crude compound gives two distinct peaks in the liquid chromatogram. The ¹H NMR spectrum also shows two distinct peaks for the same alpha-proton.\n*   **Careful Point:** For two species to be separated by a standard liquid chromatography column and distinguished by a standard NMR spectrometer, they must have different physical and chemical properties in a standard (achiral) analytical environment.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Isomer Options.**\n\n*   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. In a standard (achiral) environment, they possess **identical** physical and chemical properties. Therefore:\n    *   They would **not** separate on a standard LC column and would elute as a single peak.\n    *   They are **indistinguishable** in a standard NMR spectrum and would produce a single, identical set of signals.\n    *   This is in direct contradiction to both the LC and NMR observations. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are **not** mirror images of each other. This is a common situation in molecules with multiple stereocenters, like peptides, where a synthesis step might partially invert the stereochemistry at one (but not all) of the chiral centers (a process called epimerization).\n    *   Because diastereoisomers are not mirror images, they have **different** physical and chemical properties, even in an achiral environment.\n    *   This perfectly explains all the experimental data:\n        1.  As isomers, they have the same mass, consistent with the MS data.\n        2.  Their different physical properties allow them to be separated by standard LC, explaining the two peaks in the chromatogram.\n        3.  Their different chemical structures place the alpha-proton in a distinct chemical environment in each molecule, explaining the two separate NMR signals.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe combined evidence—two species with the same mass, but separable and distinguishable by standard chromatographic and spectroscopic methods—is the classic analytical signature of a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on a synthesis of the provided reasoning and a careful look at the evidence.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data\n\nThis is the most critical piece of evidence and provides the most definitive starting point.\n\n*   **Observation**: The LC-MS analysis separates the sample into two distinct peaks in the chromatogram (LC). However, the mass spectrum (MS) for *both* peaks is identical and matches the mass of the expected target molecule.\n*   **Careful Point**: The fact that both peaks have the *same mass* proves they are isomers. Isomers are molecules that share the same chemical formula and molecular weight but differ in the spatial arrangement of their atoms.\n*   **Conclusion & Elimination**: This observation immediately rules out any explanation involving impurities with a different molecular weight.\n    *   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor**: This is incorrect.

This side reaction describes the addition of an extra molecular fragment, which would result in a product with a different (higher) molecular weight.\n\n### Step 2: Differentiate Between the Remaining Isomer Types Using LC and NMR Data\n\nAfter Step 1, we are left with two possibilities for the isomeric mixture: enantiomers (Option C) or diastereoisomers (Option B). To distinguish between these, we must analyze the remaining data.\n\n*   **Observation from NMR and LC**:\n    1.  The ¹H NMR spectrum shows two distinct signals for a single alpha-proton.\n    2.  The Liquid Chromatography (LC) separates the sample into two distinct peaks.\n*   **Careful Point**: These observations indicate that the two isomers are physically and chemically distinct. For them to be separated by a standard LC column and give different signals in a standard NMR experiment, they must have different properties in a standard (achiral) environment.\n\n*   **Evaluating Option C (Mixture of enantiomers)**:\n    *   Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images. A defining characteristic is that they possess **identical** physical and chemical properties in an achiral environment.\n    *   Because their properties are identical in this context, they are **indistinguishable** by standard ¹H NMR (they would produce a single set of signals) and **inseparable** by standard LC (they would elute as a single peak).\n    *   **Conclusion**: This option is in direct contradiction to both the NMR and LC data.\n\n*   **Evaluating Option B (Mixture of diastereoisomers)**:\n    *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are **not** mirror images of each other. A common example in peptide synthesis is epimerization, where one chiral center of a multi-center molecule inverts (e.g., an L-amino acid center inverts to a D-center, creating a diastereomer of the intended peptide).\n    *   **Consistency with Data**: Crucially, diastereoisomers have **different** physical and chemical properties in all environments (both chiral and achiral).\n        *   Their different physical properties explain why they separate into two peaks on an LC column.\n        *   Their different chemical properties and 3D structures explain why their NMR spectra are different, resulting in two distinct peaks for the alpha-proton.\n        *   Their status as isomers explains why they have the same mass, consistent with the MS data.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This explanation is perfectly consistent with every piece of experimental data provided.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe combination of observing two species that (1) have the same mass, (2) are separable by standard chromatography, and (3) are distinguishable by standard NMR spectroscopy is the definitive analytical signature for a mixture of **diastereoisomers**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided experimental evidence.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n\nThis is the most critical starting point as it provides the most definitive information about the molecular composition of the two species.\n\n*   **Careful Point**: The observation is that while the LC separates the sample into two peaks, both of these peaks yield the **exact same mass spectrum**. This mass is also consistent with the expected product molecule.\n*   **Conclusion**: This observation proves that the two species in the mixture are **isomers**. Isomers are molecules that share the same chemical formula and thus the same molecular weight, but differ in the spatial arrangement of their atoms.\n*   **Implication**: This fact immediately rules out any explanation involving impurities that would have a different molecular weight. Options (B) and (C) are therefore incorrect.\n    *   **Contamination with a precursor (C)**: A precursor would be a starting material or intermediate from the synthesis and would have a different (usually lower) molecular weight.\n    *   **'Double coupling' side reaction (B)**: This side reaction would create a product with an extra molecular group attached, resulting in a higher molecular weight.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Chromatography (LC) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Data**\n\nNow that we know the sample is a mixture of two isomers, we must distinguish between the two remaining possibilities: a mixture of enantiomers (A) or a mixture of diastereoisomers (D).\n\n*   **Careful Point**: The observation is that the two species are **separable by standard liquid chromatography** and are **distinguishable by standard ¹H NMR spectroscopy**. The separation by LC implies they have different physical properties (e.g., polarity, shape), causing them to interact differently with the chromatography column. The distinct NMR signals imply that the alpha-proton exists in a different chemical environment in each isomer.\n*   **Conclusion**: The two isomers must have different physical and chemical properties in a standard (achiral) environment.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Isomer Options**\n\n*   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n    *   Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. A key characteristic is that they have **identical** physical and chemical properties in a standard (achiral) environment.\n    *   Therefore, enantiomers are **inseparable by standard LC** and are **indistinguishable by standard NMR**. They would appear as a single peak in both experiments. This is in direct contradiction to the experimental data. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n    *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are **not** mirror images of each other. This is a common phenomenon in peptide synthesis, often occurring when one of the chiral centers inverts during a reaction step (a process called epimerization).\n    *   Crucially, diastereoisomers have **different physical and chemical properties**. This perfectly explains all observations:\n        1.  They are isomers, so they have the **same mass** (consistent with the MS data).\n        2.  They have different physical properties, so they can be **separated by standard LC** (consistent with the two LC peaks).\n        3.  They are chemically distinct, so their protons have different electronic environments, producing **different signals in an NMR spectrum** (consistent with the two NMR peaks).\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe collective evidence provides a classic analytical signature for a mixture of diastereoisomers. The two species have the same mass (are isomers), but can be separated by standard chromatography and distinguished by standard NMR because they have different physical and chemical properties.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided experimental evidence.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data.**\nThis is the most critical piece of evidence to interpret first.\n*   **Observation**: The LC-MS analysis separates the sample into two peaks. The mass spectrometer shows that both of these peaks have the *exact same mass spectrum*, and this mass is consistent with the expected product molecule.\n*   **Careful Point/Conclusion**: This is definitive proof that the two components in the mixture are **isomers**. Isomers are molecules that share the same chemical formula and thus the same molecular weight but have a different spatial arrangement of atoms. This fact immediately allows for the elimination of possibilities that involve impurities with a different mass.\n\n**Step 2: Eliminate Incorrect Options Based on Mass.**\n*   **Eliminate B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor**: A precursor is an unreacted starting material or an intermediate from a prior step.

A key defining feature is that they have **identical** physical and chemical properties in an achiral environment (such as a standard LC column or a standard NMR solvent).\n    *   Therefore, they cannot be separated by standard LC (they would elute as a single peak) and are indistinguishable by standard NMR (they would produce a single, identical set of signals).\n    *   This is in direct contradiction to the observed data. Option A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Consider C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**:\n    *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. This is a common situation in peptide synthesis, often occurring via epimerization (the inversion of stereochemistry at a single chiral center) or the formation of stable cis/trans isomers around an amide bond (known as rotamers).\n    *   Crucially, diastereoisomers have **different physical and chemical properties**.\n    *   This difference perfectly explains all the experimental data:\n        *   They are isomers, consistent with the MS data (same mass).\n        *   They have different physical properties, allowing them to be separated by LC (two peaks).\n        *   They are chemically distinct, so their corresponding protons exist in different electronic environments, leading to different chemical shifts in the NMR spectrum (two signals).\n    *   This is the only explanation that fits all the facts.
