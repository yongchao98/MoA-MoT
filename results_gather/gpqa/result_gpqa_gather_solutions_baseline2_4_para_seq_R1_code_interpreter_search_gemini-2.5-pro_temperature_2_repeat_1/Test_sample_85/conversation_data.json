Core Principles Analysis**\n\n*   **Structure of Starting Material**: The compound is `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. It features two functional groups susceptible to reduction: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`). It possesses a single chiral center at the C3 position.\n*   **Reagent Selectivity**:\n    *   `LiBH₄` (Lithium borohydride) is a chemoselective reducing agent that reduces **esters** to primary alcohols while leaving carboxylic acids intact under these conditions.\n    *   `BH₃` (Borane) has the opposite selectivity, reducing **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols while leaving esters intact.\n\n### **2. Stereochemical Analysis (The Decisive Step)**\n\nThe most critical part of the analysis is to determine how the chemical transformation affects the R/S designation of the chiral center. While no bonds are broken *at* the chiral center, the R/S label can change if the CIP priority ranking of the attached groups is altered.\n\n1.  **Assigning Priorities in the Starting Material**:\n    The four groups attached to the chiral center (C3) are H, `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl), `-CH₂COOH` (the \"acid arm\"), and `-CH₂COOiBu` (the \"ester arm\").\n    To compare the acid and ester arms, we find the first point of difference along the chains. In the ester's alkoxy group (`-O-`**C**`H₂-`...), the oxygen is bonded to a carbon. In the acid's hydroxyl group (`-O-`**H**), the oxygen is bonded to a hydrogen. Since Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen, the ester arm has a higher priority.\n    *   **Priority 1 (P1):** `-CH₂COOiBu`\n    *   **Priority 2 (P2):** `-CH₂COOH`\n    *   **Priority 3 (P3):** `-CH₂CH₃`\n    *   **Priority 4 (P4):** `-H`\n\n2.  **Analysis of Reaction A: A + LiBH₄ → (R)-Lactone**\n    *   **Pathway**: `LiBH₄` reduces the **ester group (P1)** to a primary alcohol. The acid group (P2) is unchanged. The resulting 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid then cyclizes to the lactone.\n    *   **Priority Change**: In the intermediate just before cyclization, we compare the new arms attached to the chiral center: the `-CH₂COOH` arm and the newly formed `-CH₂CH₂OH` arm. The carboxylic acid now has higher priority than the alcohol.\n    *   **Stereochemical Result**: The group that was originally P1 has become lower in priority than the group that was originally P2. The priority ranks of the top two groups are swapped. A swap in priorities **inverts** the R/S designation.\n    *   **Conclusion for A**: Since the reaction proceeds with inversion to produce the **(R)**-lactone, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Reaction B: B + BH₃ → (S)-Lactone**\n    *   **Pathway**: `BH₃` reduces the **carboxylic acid group (P2)** to a primary alcohol. The ester group (P1) is unchanged. The resulting 5-hydroxyester then cyclizes to the lactone.\n    *   **Priority Change**: We compare the new arms: the unchanged `-CH₂COOiBu` arm and the newly formed `-CH₂CH₂OH` arm. The ester arm still has higher priority than the alcohol arm.\n    *   **Stereochemical Result**: The group that was P1 remains the highest priority group. The priority order of the two main arms is **maintained**. This results in **retention** of the R/S designation.\n    *   **Conclusion for B**: Since the reaction proceeds with retention to produce the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **3. Final Determination**\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** is also **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nAn analysis of the provided answers reveals a remarkable consensus on the underlying chemical principles and the final conclusion, even though the selected letters (A, B, C, D) vary due to the shuffling of multiple-choice options. The correct approach to solving this problem involves two key steps: determining the chemoselectivity of the reducing agents and analyzing the stereochemical consequences of the reactions using Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze Reagent Selectivity**\n    *   The starting material, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, contains both a carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) and an ester group (`-COOiBu`).\n    *   **Reaction A (`LiBH₄`)**: Lithium borohydride is a selective reducing agent that reduces the **ester** group to a primary alcohol while leaving the carboxylic acid group intact.\n    *   **Reaction B (`BH₃`)**: Borane has the opposite selectivity, reducing the **carboxylic acid** group to a primary alcohol while leaving the ester group intact.\n\n2.  **Perform Stereochemical Analysis (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog Priorities)**\n    This is the most critical part of the problem. While the reactions do not break any bonds at the chiral center (C3), they modify the functional groups on the arms attached to the chiral center's chain. This can alter their priority ranking and potentially change the final R/S designation.\n\n    *   **Priorities in the Starting Material:** The four groups attached to the chiral center (C3) are -H, an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`), an acid-containing arm (`-CH₂COOH`), and an ester-containing arm (`-CH₂COOiBu`).\n        *   To rank the two main arms, we compare them atom by atom. The ester arm has a higher priority than the acid arm because the oxygen of its alkoxy group (`-O-C...`) is bonded to a Carbon atom, while the oxygen of the acid's hydroxyl group (`-O-H`) is bonded to a Hydrogen atom. Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen.\n        *   The priority order is: **P1:** `-CH₂COOiBu` > **P2:** `-CH₂COOH` > **P3:** `-CH₂CH₃` > **P4:** `-H`.\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction A: `A + LiBH₄ → (R)-Lactone`**\n    *   The `LiBH₄` reduces the **ester** group (P1) to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid group (P2) is unaffected.\n    *   In the resulting intermediate (a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid), the acid group (`-CH₂COOH`) now has a higher priority than the newly formed alcohol group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n    *   **Stereochemical Result**: The group that was originally P1 becomes a lower-priority group, and the group that was originally P2 becomes the new highest-priority group. Since the ranks of the top two priority groups have been swapped, the reaction proceeds with **INVERSION** of the stereochemical designation.\n    *   **Conclusion for A**: To obtain the **(R)** product through an inversion pathway, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n4.  **Analyze Reaction B: `B + BH₃ → (S)-Lactone`**\n    *   The `BH₃` reduces the **acid** group (P2) to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester group (P1) is unaffected.\n    *   In the resulting intermediate (a 5-hydroxy ester), the ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) is still a higher priority group than the newly formed alcohol group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n    *   **Stereochemical Result**: The group that was originally P1 remains the highest priority group. The priority order of the main arms is maintained. Therefore, the reaction proceeds with **RETENTION** of the stereochemical designation.\n    *   **Conclusion for B**: To obtain the **(S)** product through a retention pathway, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **Final Determination**\n\nBased on the complete analysis:\n*   Starting Material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting Material **B** must also be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to the option where both A and B are the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis is a complex organic chemistry problem that hinges on two key concepts: the chemoselectivity of reducing agents and the stereochemical outcome based on Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules. A rigorous analysis is required.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Reagent Selectivity**: The first step is to understand what each reagent does. The starting material, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, has both a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-COOiBu`) group.\n    *   **Reaction A (`LiBH₄`)**: Lithium borohydride is a selective reagent that reduces **esters** to primary alcohols while leaving carboxylic acids untouched.\n    *   **Reaction B (`BH₃`)**: Borane exhibits the opposite selectivity; it reduces **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols, leaving esters untouched.\n\n2.  **Stereochemical Analysis (The Deciding Factor)**: The R/S designation of the chiral center is determined by the priority of the attached groups. While these reactions do not break any bonds at the chiral center itself, they modify the groups attached to the main chain, which can change their priority and thus potentially \"invert\" the R/S label.\n\n    *   **Assigning Priorities in the Starting Material**:\n        The chiral center is C3, which is attached to four groups:\n        1.  `-H` (Hydrogen)\n        2.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl)\n        3.  The \"acid arm\": `-CH₂COOH`\n        4.  The \"ester arm\": `-CH₂COOiBu`\n\n        To prioritize the acid and ester arms, we compare them atom by atom starting from the chiral center. The point of difference occurs at the final oxygen atom: the acid has an `O-H` bond, while the ester has an `O-C` bond (to the isobutyl group). Since Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen, the ester arm has the higher priority.\n\n        The correct priority order is:\n        *   **Priority 1 (P1):** `-CH₂COOiBu`\n        *   **Priority 2 (P2):** `-CH₂COOH`\n        *   **Priority 3 (P3):** `-CH₂CH₃`\n        *   **Priority 4 (P4):** `-H`\n\n3.  **Analyzing Reaction A**: `A + LiBH₄ → (R)-Lactone`\n    *   **Mechanism**: The `LiBH₄` reduces the **ester group (P1)** to an alcohol. The acid group (P2) is unchanged.\n    *   **Priority Change**: In the resulting intermediate, we compare the acid group (`-CH₂COOH`) with the newly formed alcohol group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid group now has higher priority.\n    *   **Stereochemical Result**: The group that was originally P1 becomes the new P'2 (lower priority), and the group that was originally P2 becomes the new P'1 (higher priority). The priorities of the top two groups are swapped. A swap in priorities leads to an **INVERSION** of the stereochemical designation.\n    *   **Conclusion**: For the reaction `A → (R)-product` to proceed via inversion, the starting material **A must be (S)**.\n\n4.  **Analyzing Reaction B**: `B + BH₃ → (S)-Lactone`\n    *   **Mechanism**: The `BH₃` reduces the **acid group (P2)** to an alcohol. The ester group (P1) is unchanged.\n    *   **Priority Change**: In the resulting intermediate, we compare the unchanged ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) with the newly formed alcohol group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester group is still higher priority.\n    *   **Stereochemical Result**: The group that was originally P1 remains the highest priority group. The relative priority order is maintained. This leads to **RETENTION** of the stereochemical designation.\n    *   **Conclusion**: For the reaction `B → (S)-product` to proceed via retention, the starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\n### **Final Determination**\n\n*   Starting Material A must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting Material B must also be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nTherefore, both reactions start with the same (S)-enantiomer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to consolidate the provided answers and determine the single correct final answer.\n\nThe core of this problem lies in two areas of organic chemistry: the chemoselectivity of reducing agents and the stereochemical consequences of the reactions, determined by the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules. All of the provided analyses correctly identify these core principles.\n\n### **Step 1: Reagent Chemoselectivity**\n\nThis point is foundational and agreed upon by all analyses.\n*   **Reaction A uses Lithium borohydride (`LiBH₄`)**: This reagent selectively reduces the **ester** functional group (`-COO-iBu`) to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) untouched.\n*   **Reaction B uses Borane (`BH₃`)**: This reagent exhibits the opposite selectivity, reducing the **carboxylic acid** functional group to a primary alcohol, leaving the ester untouched.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of Stereochemistry (CIP Rules)**\n\nThis is the most critical step and where a detailed analysis is required. The absolute 3D arrangement of groups around the chiral center is preserved, but the R/S *designation* can change if the reaction alters the priority of the substituents.\n\n**A. Initial Priorities in the Starting Material**\n\n*   The chiral center is C3, which is attached to an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`), a hydrogen (`-H`), an \"acid arm\" (`-CH₂COOH`), and an \"ester arm\" (`-CH₂COOiBu`).\n*   To assign priority between the two main arms, we look at the first point of difference. For the ester arm, the ether oxygen is bonded to a carbon (of the isobutyl group). For the acid arm, the hydroxyl oxygen is bonded to a hydrogen.\n*   Since carbon has a higher atomic number than hydrogen, the ester arm has the higher priority.\n*   **The priority order is unanimously determined to be:**\n    *   **Priority 1 (P1):** `-CH₂COOiBu`\n    *   **Priority 2 (P2):** `-CH₂COOH`\n    *   **Priority 3 (P3):** `-CH₂CH₃`\n    *   **Priority 4 (P4):** `-H`\n\n**B. Stereochemical Consequence of Reaction A (`LiBH₄`)**\n\n*   **Transformation:** The ester group (P1) is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid group (P2) is unchanged.\n*   **Priority Change:** In the resulting hydroxy-acid intermediate, the unchanged acid group now has higher priority than the newly formed alcohol group.\n*   **Conclusion:** The group that was originally P1 has become lower priority than the group that was originally P2. This swapping of the top two priorities results in an **INVERSION** of the stereochemical designation. Therefore, to produce the **(R)**-lactone, the starting material **A must be (S)**.\n\n**C. Stereochemical Consequence of Reaction B (`BH₃`)**\n\n*   **Transformation:** The acid group (P2) is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester group (P1) is unchanged.\n*   **Priority Change:** In the resulting hydroxy-ester intermediate, the unchanged ester group is still higher priority than the newly formed alcohol group.\n*   **Conclusion:** The priority order of the top two groups is preserved. This results in **RETENTION** of the stereochemical designation. Therefore, to produce the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\n### **Step 3: Final Determination**\n\nThe detailed chemical analysis, which is consistent across all provided candidate answers, leads to a single, unambiguous conclusion:\n*   Starting Material **A** is **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting Material **B** is also **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis result must now be matched to the provided options.\n\nA) A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n**B) A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid , B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\nC) A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid , B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nD) A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThe correct choice is B. The variation in the final letters selected by the candidate answers stems from mismatches between their correct reasoning and the specific list of options they were shown, but the underlying chemical logic is sound and consistent.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem requires a careful analysis of two distinct chemical reactions, focusing on reagent selectivity and the stereochemical consequences, which are determined by the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify Reagent Selectivity**\n    *   The starting material, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, contains both a carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester group (`-COO-iBu`).\n    *   **Reaction A uses `LiBH₄`**: This reagent selectively reduces the **ester** to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid untouched.\n    *   **Reaction B uses `BH₃`**: This reagent selectively reduces the **carboxylic acid** to a primary alcohol, leaving the ester untouched.\n\n2.  **Assign Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priorities for the Starting Material**\n    This is the most critical step. We must determine the priorities of the groups attached to the chiral center (C3) to see how the R/S designation might change.\n    *   The four groups attached to the chiral carbon are: `-H`, `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl), the acid arm (`-CH₂COOH`), and the ester arm (`-CH₂COOiBu`).\n    *   To compare the acid and ester arms, we look for the first point of difference. The ester's alkoxy oxygen is bonded to a carbon (`-O-C...` in isobutyl), while the acid's hydroxyl oxygen is bonded to a hydrogen (`-O-H`).\n    *   Since carbon has a higher atomic number than hydrogen, the ester arm has a higher priority than the acid arm.\n    *   **Priority Order:** `(-CH₂COOiBu)` > `(-CH₂COOH)` > `(-CH₂CH₃)` > `(-H)`\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction A: `A + LiBH₄ → (R)-Lactone`**\n    *   **Transformation:** `LiBH₄` reduces the higher-priority ester arm. The lower-priority acid arm is unchanged and forms the carbonyl of the resulting lactone.\n    *   **Priority Change:** The original highest-priority arm (ester) is converted into an alcohol arm, which is now lower in priority than the acid arm. The priority of the top two groups is **swapped**.\n    *   **Stereochemical Outcome:** A swap in the priority of two groups at a chiral center results in an **INVERSION** of the stereochemical designation. To obtain the (R)-product via an inversion pathway, the starting material **A must be (S)**.\n\n4.  **Analyze Reaction B: `B + BH₃ → (S)-Lactone`**\n    *   **Transformation:** `BH₃` reduces the lower-priority acid arm. The higher-priority ester arm is unchanged and forms the carbonyl of the resulting lactone.\n    *   **Priority Change:** The original highest-priority arm (ester) remains the highest priority group. The relative priority order is maintained.\n    *   **Stereochemical Outcome:** Since the priority order is maintained, the reaction proceeds with **RETENTION** of the stereochemical designation. To obtain the (S)-product via a retention pathway, the starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   For reaction A to yield the (R)-product via inversion, starting material A must be the **(S)**-enantiomer.\n*   For reaction B to yield the (S)-product via retention, starting material B must also be the **(S)**-enantiomer.\n\nTherefore, both starting materials, A and B, are **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B in the list.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis problem requires a careful analysis of two distinct organic reactions, focusing on reagent selectivity and the resulting stereochemistry. Let's break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n### **Part 1: Reagent Chemoselectivity**\n\nThe starting material, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, contains two functional groups that can be reduced: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-COO-iBu`). The two reducing agents used have different preferences for these groups.\n\n*   **Reaction A uses LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This reagent is known to selectively reduce esters to primary alcohols. It is much less reactive towards carboxylic acids. Therefore, in reaction A, the **ester group is reduced**.\n*   **Reaction B uses BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent exhibits the opposite selectivity. It preferentially reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, reacting much more slowly with esters. Therefore, in reaction B, the **carboxylic acid group is reduced**.\n\n### **Part 2: Stereochemical Analysis via Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Rules**\n\nThis is the most critical step. The absolute 3D configuration of the chiral center does not change, but the R/S label can change if the chemical transformation alters the priority ranking of the attached groups.\n\n**Step 2a: Assign Initial CIP Priorities**\nThe chiral center (C3) is attached to four groups. We must rank them by priority:\n1.  -H (Hydrogen)\n2.  -CH₂CH₃ (Ethyl group)\n3.  The arm containing the carboxylic acid: `-CH₂COOH`\n4.  The arm containing the ester: `-CH₂COOiBu`\n\nTo rank the acid arm vs. the ester arm, we compare them atom by atom from the chiral center. The point of difference is in the hydroxyl/alkoxy part. In the acid arm's `-OH` group, the oxygen is bonded to a Hydrogen. In the ester arm's `-O-iBu` group, the oxygen is bonded to a Carbon. Since Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen, the ester arm has the higher priority.\n\nThe complete priority ranking for the starting material is:\n*   **Priority 1 (P1):** `-CH₂COOiBu` (Ester arm)\n*   **Priority 2 (P2):** `-CH₂COOH` (Acid arm)\n*   **Priority 3 (P3):** `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)\n*   **Priority 4 (P4):** `-H` (Hydrogen)\n\n**Step 2b: Analyze the Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction A**\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-Lactone`\n*   **Transformation:** The ester group (original **P1**) is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid group (original **P2**) is untouched.\n*   **Change in Priorities:** In the resulting intermediate, we now compare the untouched acid group (`-CH₂COOH`) with the new alcohol group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid group now has a higher priority.\n*   **Conclusion:** The group that was P1 is now lower priority than the group that was P2. The priority order of the top two groups is swapped. This results in an **INVERSION** of the stereochemical label (e.g., an S-reactant becomes an R-product).\n*   **For A:** To get an **(R)** product from a reaction that causes inversion, the starting material **A must be (S)**.\n\n**Step 2c: Analyze the Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction B**\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-Lactone`\n*   **Transformation:** The acid group (original **P2**) is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester group (original **P1**) is untouched.\n*   **Change in Priorities:** We now compare the untouched ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) with the new alcohol group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester group is still higher priority.\n*   **Conclusion:** The original P1 group remains the highest priority group. The relative priority order of the two main arms is maintained. This results in **RETENTION** of the stereochemical label (e.g., an S-reactant becomes an S-product).\n*   **For B:** To get an **(S)** product from a reaction that proceeds with retention, the starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\n### **Final Determination**\n\nOur analysis concludes:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** is also **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to the option where both A and B are the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis is an advanced organic chemistry problem that hinges on two key principles: the chemoselectivity of different reducing agents and the effect of the chemical transformations on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) stereochemical designations. An analysis of the candidate answers shows a remarkable consensus on the chemical reasoning, with disagreements only arising from apparent clerical errors in matching the correct reasoning to the final answer choices.\n\nHere is a definitive step-by-step breakdown:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reagent Selectivity**\n\nThis step determines which functional group on the starting material is transformed in each reaction.\n*   **Starting Material:** `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid` contains both a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`).\n*   **Reaction A (`LiBH₄`):** Lithium borohydride is a chemoselective reducing agent that reduces **esters** to primary alcohols while leaving carboxylic acids intact.\n*   **Reaction B (`BH₃`):** Borane shows the opposite selectivity, reducing **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols while leaving esters intact.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Stereochemical Consequences via CIP Priority Rules**\n\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis. While the 3D arrangement of atoms at the chiral center does not change, the R/S *label* can be inverted if the reaction alters the priority ranking of the chemical groups attached to the chiral center's chain.\n\n*   **Assigning Priorities in the Starting Material:**\n    The chiral center (C3) is attached to four groups:\n    1.  `-H` (Hydrogen)\n    2.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl)\n    3.  `-CH₂COOH` (The \"acid arm\")\n    4.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (The \"ester arm\")\n\n    To prioritize the acid vs. the ester arm, we look at the first point of difference along the chains. In the ester (`-O-`**C**`H₂-`), the alkoxy oxygen is attached to a carbon atom. In the acid (`-O-`**H**), the hydroxyl oxygen is attached to a hydrogen atom. Since Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen, the ester arm has a higher priority.\n\n    *   **The unanimous and correct priority order is:**\n        *   **Priority 1 (P1):** `-CH₂COOiBu`\n        *   **Priority 2 (P2):** `-CH₂COOH`\n        *   **Priority 3 (P3):** `-CH₂CH₃`\n        *   **Priority 4 (P4):** `-H`\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction A (`A + LiBH₄ → (R)-Lactone`)**\n\n1.  **Transformation:** The ester group (P1) is reduced to an alcohol. The acid group (P2) is unchanged.\n2.  **Priority Change:** In the resulting 5-hydroxy-acid intermediate, the unchanged acid group now has a higher priority than the newly formed alcohol group.\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** The group that was originally Priority 1 has become a lower priority group, while the group that was originally Priority 2 is now the highest priority group. Since the ranks of the top two groups have been swapped, this results in an **INVERSION** of the stereochemical designation.\n4.  **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the **(R)** product via an inversion pathway, the starting material **A must be (S)**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze Reaction B (`B + BH₃ → (S)-Lactone`)**\n\n1.  **Transformation:** The acid group (P2) is reduced to an alcohol. The ester group (P1) is unchanged.\n2.  **Priority Change:** In the resulting 5-hydroxy-ester intermediate, the unchanged ester group still has a higher priority than the newly formed alcohol group.\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** The original P1 group remains the highest priority group. The priority ranking of the two main arms is preserved. This results in **RETENTION** of the stereochemical designation.\n4.  **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the **(S)** product via a retention pathway, the starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\n### **Final Determination**\n\nThe chemical analysis unanimously concludes:\n*   Starting Material **A** is **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting Material **B** is also **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis result corresponds to option B in the provided list. The divergent answers from the other agents appear to stem from errors in mapping their correct chemical conclusions to the provided lettered options, rather than any disagreement on the underlying chemistry.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis problem requires a careful analysis of the chemoselectivity of two different reducing agents and the stereochemical consequences of each reaction, which is determined by the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Products**\n    *   **Starting Material**: `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule contains two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`). It possesses a single chiral center at the C3 position.\n    *   **Product**: `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone) formed by intramolecular cyclization after one of the functional groups is reduced to a primary alcohol.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reagent Chemoselectivity**\n    The two reactions use reagents with opposite selectivity, which determines the reaction pathway.\n    *   **Reaction A (`LiBH₄`):** Lithium borohydride is a reducing agent that selectively reduces **esters** to primary alcohols while leaving carboxylic acids unaffected.\n    *   **Reaction B (`BH₃`):** Borane selectively reduces **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols, leaving esters largely unreacted under the same conditions.\n\n3.  **Perform Stereochemical Analysis using CIP Rules (The Decisive Step)**\n    The R/S designation is determined by the priority of the groups attached to the chiral center. While no bonds are broken at the chiral center itself, the reaction modifies the functional groups, which can alter their CIP priority and thus potentially invert the R/S label.\n\n    *   **Priorities in the Starting Material (at C3):**\n        The four groups on the chiral center are `-H`, `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl), the \"acid arm\" (`-CH₂COOH`), and the \"ester arm\" (`-CH₂COOiBu`).\n        We must rank the acid arm and the ester arm. In the ester (`-O-iBu`), the alkoxy oxygen is bonded to a carbon atom. In the acid (`-O-H`), the hydroxyl oxygen is bonded to a hydrogen atom. Since Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen, the ester arm has a higher priority.\n        *   **Priority 1 (P1):** `-CH₂COOiBu` (Ester arm)\n        *   **Priority 2 (P2):** `-CH₂COOH` (Acid arm)\n        *   **Priority 3 (P3):** `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl)\n        *   **Priority 4 (P4):** `-H` (Hydrogen)\n\n4.  **Trace Reaction A: A + LiBH₄ → (R)-Lactone**\n    *   **Mechanism:** `LiBH₄` reduces the **ester group (P1)** to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The **acid group (P2)** is untouched and proceeds to form the carbonyl of the lactone.\n    *   **Priority Change:** In the resulting intermediate, we compare the unchanged acid arm (`-CH₂COOH`) with the new alcohol arm (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid arm now has higher priority than the alcohol arm.\n    *   **Stereochemical Result:** The group that was originally P1 has become lower in priority than the group that was originally P2. The priority ranks of the top two groups have been **swapped**. A swap in priorities results in an **inversion** of the stereochemical designation.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the **(R)**-product via a reaction that causes inversion, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n5.  **Trace Reaction B: B + BH₃ → (S)-Lactone**\n    *   **Mechanism:** `BH₃` reduces the **acid group (P2)** to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The **ester group (P1)** is untouched and proceeds to form the carbonyl of the lactone.\n    *   **Priority Change:** In the resulting intermediate, we compare the unchanged ester arm (`-CH₂COOiBu`) with the new alcohol arm (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester arm is still higher in priority than the alcohol arm.\n    *   **Stereochemical Result:** The group that was P1 remains the highest priority group. The relative priority order is maintained. This results in **retention** of the stereochemical designation.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the **(S)**-product via a reaction that causes retention, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\n*   For reaction A to yield an (R)-product via inversion, the starting material A must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   For reaction B to yield an (S)-product via retention, the starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBoth reactions start with the same (S)-enantiomer. This conclusion is unanimously supported by the reasoning of all provided candidate answers. Matching this result to the given options:\n\nA) A = (R)... , B = (R)...\nB) A = (S)... , B = (S)...\nC) A = (S)..., B = (R)...\nD) A = (R)..., B = (S)...\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem requires a careful analysis of the chemoselectivity of two different reducing agents and the subsequent effect on the stereochemistry of the chiral center. Let's break it down step by step, using the consensus logic from the provided answers.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Molecules and Reagents**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting compound is `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. It possesses two functional groups that can be reduced: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-COOiBu`). It also has a single chiral center at the C3 position.\n*   **Product:** The final product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, which is a six-membered lactone (a cyclic ester).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   **LiBH₄ (Lithium Borohydride):** This reagent selectively reduces the **ester** functional group to a primary alcohol while leaving the carboxylic acid untouched.\n    *   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent has the opposite selectivity; it reduces the **carboxylic acid** functional group to a primary alcohol while leaving the ester untouched.\n\n### **Step 2: Assign Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priorities**\n\nThis is the most critical step for determining the stereochemical outcome. We need to assign priorities to the four groups attached to the chiral center (C3) of the starting material.\n\n1.  The groups are: -H, -CH₂CH₃ (Ethyl), `-CH₂COOH` (the \"acid arm\"), and `-CH₂COOiBu` (the \"ester arm\").\n2.  To rank the acid and ester arms, we compare them atom-by-atom. In the ester's alkoxy group (`-O-iBu`), the oxygen is bonded to a carbon atom. In the acid's hydroxyl group (`-O-H`), the oxygen is bonded to a hydrogen atom.\n3.  Since Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen, the ester arm has a higher priority.\n4.  **Initial Priority Order:**\n    *   **Priority 1 (P1):** `-CH₂COOiBu`\n    *   **Priority 2 (P2):** `-CH₂COOH`\n    *   **Priority 3 (P3):** `-CH₂CH₃`\n    *   **Priority 4 (P4):** `-H`\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-Lactone`\n*   **Mechanism:** `LiBH₄` reduces the **ester** group (P1) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid group (P2) is unaffected and will form the carbonyl of the final lactone.\n*   **Priority Change:** In the resulting molecule, the acid group now has higher priority than the newly formed alcohol group. The group that was originally P1 becomes lower in priority than the group that was originally P2.\n*   **Stereochemical Result:** The ranks of the top two priority groups are swapped. A swap in priorities causes an **INVERSION** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** To get an **(R)** product from a reaction that proceeds with inversion, the starting material **A must be (S)**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-Lactone`\n*   **Mechanism:** `BH₃` reduces the **acid** group (P2) to a primary alcohol. The ester group (P1) is unaffected and will form the carbonyl of the final lactone.\n*   **Priority Change:** The ester group remains higher in priority than the newly formed alcohol group. The relative priority ordering of the two main arms is maintained.\n*   **Stereochemical Result:** The priority order is preserved. This results in **RETENTION** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** To get an **(S)** product from a reaction that proceeds with retention, the starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBased on a thorough analysis of both reaction pathways, which is unanimously agreed upon by the reasoning of all candidate answers:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must also be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to the option where both A and B are the (S)-enantiomer.\n\nA) A = (R)-acid, B = (S)-acid\nB) A = (S)-acid, B = (R)-acid\nC) A = (R)-acid, B = (R)-acid\nD) A = (S)-acid, B = (S)-acid\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis problem requires a detailed analysis of two different reactions, focusing on both the selectivity of the reducing agents and the resulting stereochemistry. A careful step-by-step approach is necessary.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reagent Selectivity**\n\nThe starting material, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, has two functional groups that can be reduced: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-COOiBu`). The two reagents used have opposite selectivities:\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium Borohydride)**: This reagent is known to selectively reduce **esters** to primary alcohols while leaving carboxylic acids largely unaffected.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane)**: This reagent has the opposite selectivity, preferentially reducing **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols, while being much less reactive towards esters.\n\n### **Step 2: Assign Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priorities**\n\nThis is the most critical step, as it determines how the reaction affects the R/S stereochemical designation. The label can change even if the 3D structure at the chiral center is preserved.\n\n1.  **Identify the chiral center:** The chiral center is the C3 carbon, which is bonded to a hydrogen (`-H`), an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`), a chain containing the carboxylic acid (`-CH₂COOH`, the \"acid arm\"), and a chain containing the ester (`-CH₂COOiBu`, the \"ester arm\").\n2.  **Rank the groups:** The key comparison is between the acid arm and the ester arm. According to CIP rules, we look at the first point of difference. In the ester's alkoxy group (`-O-iBu`), the oxygen is bonded to a carbon. In the acid's hydroxyl group (`-O-H`), the oxygen is bonded to a hydrogen. Since Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen, the ester arm has a higher priority.\n    *   **Priority 1 (P1):** `-CH₂COOiBu`\n    *   **Priority 2 (P2):** `-CH₂COOH`\n    *   **Priority 3 (P3):** `-CH₂CH₃`\n    *   **Priority 4 (P4):** `-H`\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-Lactone`\n*   **Pathway:** LiBH₄ reduces the **ester group (P1)** to a primary alcohol. The acid group (P2) is unchanged.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** In the resulting intermediate (a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid), the original acid arm (P2) now has a higher priority than the newly formed alcohol arm (which came from P1). The priorities of the top two groups have been **swapped**. This swap causes an **INVERSION** of the stereochemical designation.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the **(R)** product through an inversion pathway, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-Lactone`\n*   **Pathway:** BH₃ reduces the **carboxylic acid group (P2)** to a primary alcohol. The ester group (P1) is unchanged.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** In the resulting intermediate (a 5-hydroxy ester), the original ester arm (P1) is still higher in priority than the newly formed alcohol arm (which came from P2). The priority order of the top two groups has been **preserved**. This leads to **RETENTION** of the stereochemical designation.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the **(S)** product through a retention pathway, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Determination**\n\nBased on the analysis of both pathways:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** must also be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nTherefore, both reactions start with the same (S)-enantiomer. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses and a re-evaluation of the core chemical principles.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the Problem**\n\nThe question asks for the correct stereoisomers for two starting materials, A and B, which undergo different reactions to produce specific stereoisomers of a final product. The solution requires a two-fold analysis:\n*   **Chemoselectivity**: Understanding which functional group (carboxylic acid vs. ester) is reduced by each reagent (`LiBH₄` vs. `BH₃`).\n*   **Stereochemistry**: Determining how the chemical transformation affects the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the substituents, and thus whether the R/S designation of the chiral center is retained or inverted.\n\n### **2. Analysis of Reagent Selectivity**\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the standard selectivity of the reducing agents:\n*   **Reaction A (`LiBH₄`)**: Lithium borohydride is a chemoselective reducing agent that reduces **esters** to primary alcohols while leaving carboxylic acids intact under these conditions.\n*   **Reaction B (`BH₃`)**: Borane has the opposite selectivity, reducing **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols while leaving esters intact.\n\n### **3. The Decisive Step: Stereochemical Analysis via CIP Priority Rules**\n\nThis is the most critical part of the problem. While no bonds are broken at the chiral center itself (preserving the 3D arrangement of atoms), the *R/S* label can change if the chemical transformations alter the priority ranking of the groups. All the candidate answers correctly follow this line of reasoning.\n\n**A. Initial CIP Priorities in the Starting Material**\n*   The starting material is `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n*   The chiral center (C3) is attached to four groups: H, an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`), an \"acid arm\" (`-CH₂COOH`), and an \"ester arm\" (`-CH₂COOiBu`).\n*   When comparing the acid arm and the ester arm, the first point of difference occurs at the oxygen atom. In the ester, the oxygen is bonded to a carbon (of the isobutyl group), while in the acid, the hydroxyl oxygen is bonded to a hydrogen.\n*   Since carbon has a higher atomic number than hydrogen, the ester arm has higher priority.\n*   **Priority Order:** `(-CH₂COOiBu)` > `(-CH₂COOH)` > `(-CH₂CH₃)` > `(-H)`\n\n**B. Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction A (`LiBH₄`)**\n*   **Transformation:** `LiBH₄` reduces the **ester arm** (the higher priority group) to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid arm (the lower priority group) is unchanged.\n*   **Priority Change:** In the resulting intermediate, the acid arm now has higher priority than the newly formed alcohol arm.\n*   **Conclusion:** The group that was originally Priority #1 has become a lower priority group than the group that was originally Priority #2. The ranks of the top two groups have been **swapped**. This results in an **INVERSION** of the R/S designation.\n*   **To obtain the (R)-product via inversion, the starting material A must be (S).**\n\n**C. Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction B (`BH₃`)**\n*   **Transformation:** `BH₃` reduces the **acid arm** (the lower priority group) to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester arm (the higher priority group) is unchanged.\n*   **Priority Change:** In the resulting intermediate, the ester arm remains the higher priority group compared to the new alcohol arm.\n*   **Conclusion:** The priority order of the two main arms is maintained (the original highest-priority group remains the highest-priority group). This results in **RETENTION** of the R/S designation.\n*   **To obtain the (S)-product via retention, the starting material B must be (S).**\n\n### **4. Final Determination**\n\nThe detailed chemical analysis, which is consistent across all candidate answers, leads to the following conclusion:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** must also be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis conclusion, that both starting materials are the (S)-enantiomer, corresponds to option C in the provided list.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nAn analysis of the provided answers reveals a consistent and correct logical pathway, even though the final letter choice differs due to variations in the options presented to each agent. The core chemical reasoning is sound across all responses. Here is a consolidated step-by-step analysis to arrive at the final answer.\n\n### **1. Identify Core Chemical Principles**\n\nThe solution to this problem rests on two fundamental concepts in organic chemistry:\n*   **Chemoselectivity:** Different reagents react with specific functional groups at different rates. We must know the selectivity of Lithium borohydride (`LiBH₄`) and Borane (`BH₃`) toward esters and carboxylic acids.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction's effect on the stereochemical designation (R/S) of the chiral center must be determined. This requires applying the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules both before and after the chemical transformation.\n\n### **2. Analyze Reagent Selectivity**\n\nThere is a consensus among all agents, which is chemically correct:\n*   **Reaction A (`LiBH₄`)**: Lithium borohydride is a chemoselective reagent that reduces the **ester** functional group (`-COOiBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`) while leaving the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) intact.\n*   **Reaction B (`BH₃`)**: Borane exhibits the opposite selectivity. It reduces the **carboxylic acid** functional group to a primary alcohol while leaving the ester group intact.\n\n### **3. Perform Stereochemical Analysis (The Decisive Step)**\n\nWhile no bonds are broken at the chiral center itself (preserving its 3D arrangement), the R/S designation can change if the chemical modification alters the priority ranking of the substituent groups.\n\n*   **Step 3.1: Assign Priorities in the Starting Material**\n    The chiral center (C3) is attached to four groups: `-H`, `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl), a chain with a carboxylic acid (`-CH₂COOH`), and a chain with an ester (`-CH₂COOiBu`). The priority between the acid and ester arms is key.\n    *   In the ester arm, the ether oxygen is bonded to a carbon (`-O-C...`).\n    *   In the acid arm, the hydroxyl oxygen is bonded to a hydrogen (`-O-H`).\n    *   According to CIP rules, Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen, giving the ester arm higher priority.\n    *   **Initial Priority Order:** **P1**: `-CH₂COOiBu` > **P2**: `-CH₂COOH` > **P3**: `-CH₂CH₃` > **P4**: `-H`\n\n*   **Step 3.2: Analyze Reaction A (`A + LiBH₄ → (R)-Lactone`)**\n    *   **Transformation:** The ester group (original **P1**) is reduced to a primary alcohol. The acid group (original **P2**) is unchanged.\n    *   **Priority Change:** In the resulting hydroxy-acid intermediate, the unchanged acid group now has a higher priority than the newly formed alcohol group.\n    *   **Stereochemical Result:** The group that was P1 has become a lower-priority group, and the group that was P2 is now the highest-priority group. The ranks of the top two groups have been swapped. This causes a formal **inversion** of the R/S designation (an (S) starting material gives an (R) product).\n    *   **Conclusion:** To obtain the **(R)** product via this inversion pathway, starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n*   **Step 3.3: Analyze Reaction B (`B + BH₃ → (S)-Lactone`)**\n    *   **Transformation:** The acid group (original **P2**) is reduced to a primary alcohol. The ester group (original **P1**) is unchanged.\n    *   **Priority Change:** In the resulting hydroxy-ester intermediate, the unchanged ester group is still higher in priority than the newly formed alcohol group.\n    *   **Stereochemical Result:** The group that was P1 remains the highest priority group. The relative priority order is **maintained**. This results in **retention** of the R/S designation (an (S) starting material gives an (S) product).\n    *   **Conclusion:** To obtain the **(S)** product via this retention pathway, starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **4. Final Determination**\n\nBased on the consistent analysis derived from all agents:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must also be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBoth reactions start with the same (S)-enantiomer. Matching this result with the provided list of choices:\nA) A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid , B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nB) A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nC) A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nD) A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid , B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis is an organic chemistry problem that requires a two-pronged analysis: first, understanding the specific reactivity (chemoselectivity) of the different reducing agents, and second, meticulously tracking the stereochemical consequences of these reactions using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\nThe analysis can be broken down into four key steps. An overwhelming majority of the provided candidate answers agree on the chemical reasoning for each step, even if some make a clerical error in the final selection.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reagent Chemoselectivity**\n\n*   **Reaction A (`A + LiBH₄`)**: Lithium borohydride (`LiBH₄`) is a reagent that selectively reduces **esters** to primary alcohols while leaving carboxylic acids unreacted.\n*   **Reaction B (`B + BH₃`)**: Borane (`BH₃`) has the opposite selectivity; it reduces **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols while leaving esters unreacted.\n\n**Step 2: Assign Initial CIP Priorities to the Starting Material**\n\n*   The starting material is `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n*   The chiral center (C3) is attached to four groups:\n    1.  `-H` (Hydrogen)\n    2.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl)\n    3.  `-CH₂COOH` (The \"acid arm\")\n    4.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (The \"ester arm\")\n*   To assign priorities between the acid arm and the ester arm, we look at the first point of difference. The oxygen in the ester arm is bonded to a carbon (of the isobutyl group), while the oxygen in the acid arm is bonded to a hydrogen. Since Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen, the ester arm has the higher priority.\n*   **Initial Priority Order:**\n    *   **P1 (Highest):** `-CH₂COOiBu`\n    *   **P2:** `-CH₂COOH`\n    *   **P3:** `-CH₂CH₃`\n    *   **P4 (Lowest):** `-H`\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Stereochemical Consequence of Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ → (R)-lactone`\n*   **Transformation:** `LiBH₄` reduces the **ester group (P1)** to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid group (P2) remains untouched.\n*   **Change in Priority:** In the resulting intermediate, we compare the new arms: the unchanged acid arm (`-CH₂COOH`) now has higher priority than the new alcohol arm (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n*   **Result:** The group that was originally P1 has become the new lower-priority arm, and the group that was P2 has become the new higher-priority arm. The priorities of the top two groups have been **swapped**. A swap of priorities at a chiral center results in an **INVERSION** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** To get an **(R)** product via an inversion pathway, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Stereochemical Consequence of Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ → (S)-lactone`\n*   **Transformation:** `BH₃` reduces the **acid group (P2)** to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester group (P1) remains untouched.\n*   **Change in Priority:** In the resulting intermediate, we compare the new arms: the unchanged ester arm (`-CH₂COOiBu`) still has a higher priority than the new alcohol arm (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n*   **Result:** The group that was originally P1 remains the highest priority group. The relative priority order of the top two arms is **preserved**. This results in **RETENTION** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** To get an **(S)** product via a retention pathway, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBased on the consistent logical analysis from all four steps:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** must also be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis result, `A=(S)` and `B=(S)`, corresponds to option C in the question.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis problem requires a careful analysis of two separate chemical reactions. The solution depends on correctly identifying the selectivity of the reducing agents and the stereochemical consequences of the transformations.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material and Reagents**\n*   **Starting Material:** The problem uses stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule contains two functional groups susceptible to reduction: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`). It possesses a single chiral center at the C3 position.\n*   **Reagent for Reaction A:** `LiBH₄` (Lithium borohydride) is a chemoselective reducing agent that reduces esters to primary alcohols but does not readily reduce carboxylic acids.\n*   **Reagent for Reaction B:** `BH₃` (Borane) exhibits the opposite selectivity, readily reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols while reacting much more slowly with esters.\n\n**2. Perform Stereochemical Analysis using Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Rules**\nThis is the most critical step. The absolute 3D configuration of atoms at the chiral center does not change, but the R/S *designation* can be altered if the reaction changes the priority of the attached groups.\n\n*   **Assigning Priorities in the Starting Material:**\n    The four groups attached to the chiral center (C3) are: -H, `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl), the \"acid arm\" (`-CH₂COOH`), and the \"ester arm\" (`-CH₂COOiBu`).\n    To determine the priority between the acid and ester arms, we look at the first point of difference. The oxygen in the ester's alkoxy group is bonded to a carbon (of the isobutyl group), while the oxygen in the acid's hydroxyl group is bonded to a hydrogen. Since Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen, the ester arm has the higher priority.\n    The CIP priority order is:\n    1.  **P1:** `-CH₂COOiBu`\n    2.  **P2:** `-CH₂COOH`\n    3.  **P3:** `-CH₂CH₃`\n    4.  **P4:** `-H`\n\n**3. Trace Reaction A**\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone`\n*   **Pathway:** `LiBH₄` selectively reduces the **ester group (P1)** to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group (P2) is unaffected. The resulting 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid cyclizes.\n*   **Stereochemical Consequence:** The group that was originally P1 (the ester arm) is transformed into a new group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`) that is *lower* in priority than the untouched acid arm (P2). The priorities of the top two groups are swapped. A swap in the priority of two groups at a chiral center results in an **inversion** of the stereochemical designation.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Since the reaction proceeds with inversion, to obtain an **(R)** product, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n**4. Trace Reaction B**\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone`\n*   **Pathway:** `BH₃` selectively reduces the **carboxylic acid group (P2)** to a primary alcohol. The ester group (P1) is unaffected. The resulting 5-hydroxy ester cyclizes.\n*   **Stereochemical Consequence:** The group that was originally P1 (the ester arm) remains the highest priority group. The P2 group is modified into a new group that is still of lower priority than P1. Therefore, the relative priority ordering of the top groups is **preserved**. This results in **retention** of the stereochemical designation.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Since the reaction proceeds with retention, to obtain an **(S)** product, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **Final Determination**\nBased on the analysis of both reaction pathways:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** must also be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem requires a two-pronged analysis: first, understanding the specific reactivity (chemoselectivity) of the two reducing agents, and second, carefully determining the stereochemical consequences of each reaction using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n### **Step 1: Chemoselectivity of the Reducing Agents**\n\n*   **Starting Material**: `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule contains both a carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester group (`-COO-iBu`).\n*   **Reaction A uses LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**: This is a selective reducing agent that reduces **esters** to primary alcohols while leaving carboxylic acids unaffected under typical conditions. The intermediate formed will be a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid, which then cyclizes.\n*   **Reaction B uses BH₃ (Borane)**: This reagent has the opposite selectivity; it preferentially reduces **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols, leaving esters unaffected. The intermediate formed will be a 5-hydroxy ester, which then cyclizes.\n\n### **Step 2: Stereochemical Analysis via Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Rules**\n\nThis is the most critical step. Although the bonds at the chiral center itself are not broken or formed (meaning the 3D arrangement of groups is preserved), the R/S *label* can change if the reaction alters the CIP priority ranking of the chemical groups attached to the chiral center's main chain.\n\n**A. Assigning Priorities in the Starting Material**\nThe chiral center is C3, which is attached to four groups:\n1.  -H (Hydrogen)\n2.  -CH₂CH₃ (Ethyl group)\n3.  The \"acid arm\": `-CH₂COOH`\n4.  The \"ester arm\": `-CH₂COOiBu`\n\nTo rank the acid and ester arms, we compare them atom by atom starting from the chiral center. The point of first difference occurs at the oxygen atom of the carboxyl group. In the ester, this oxygen is bonded to a carbon atom (of the isobutyl group), while in the carboxylic acid, it is bonded to a hydrogen atom. Since carbon has a higher atomic number than hydrogen, the ester arm has higher priority.\n\n*   **The Priority Order is:** `-CH₂COOiBu` > `-CH₂COOH` > `-CH₂CH₃` > `-H`\n\n**B. Analysis of Reaction A: A + LiBH₄ → (R)-product**\n1.  **Chemical Transformation**: LiBH₄ reduces the higher-priority **ester arm** to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The lower-priority acid arm (`-CH₂COOH`) is unchanged.\n2.  **Change in Priorities**: In the resulting hydroxy-acid intermediate, the unchanged acid arm now has a higher priority than the newly formed alcohol arm.\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome**: The group that was originally Priority 1 (ester) has been transformed into a new group that is lower in priority than the original Priority 2 group (acid). The priority ranking of the top two arms has been swapped. A swap in priorities results in an **INVERSION** of the stereochemical designation.\n4.  **Conclusion for A**: To obtain the **(R)**-product via an inversion pathway, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n**C. Analysis of Reaction B: B + BH₃ → (S)-product**\n1.  **Chemical Transformation**: BH₃ reduces the lower-priority **acid arm** to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The higher-priority ester arm (`-CH₂COOiBu`) is unchanged.\n2.  **Change in Priorities**: In the resulting hydroxy-ester intermediate, the unchanged ester arm is still higher in priority than the newly formed alcohol arm.\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome**: The original Priority 1 group remains the highest priority group. The priority ranking of the top two arms is maintained. This results in **RETENTION** of the stereochemical designation.\n4.  **Conclusion for B**: To obtain the **(S)**-product via a retention pathway, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **Step 3: Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the rigorous analysis of both reaction pathways:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must also be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBoth starting materials are the same (S)-enantiomer.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the consensus reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reagent Chemoselectivity**\n\nThe core of this problem lies in understanding that the two reducing agents, `LiBH₄` and `BH₃`, target different functional groups within the same starting molecule.\n*   **Starting Material:** The base molecule is `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, which contains both an **ester** group (`-COOiBu`) and a **carboxylic acid** group (`-COOH`).\n*   **Reaction A (`LiBH₄`):** Lithium borohydride is a selective reagent that reduces **esters** to primary alcohols while leaving carboxylic acids unreacted.\n*   **Reaction B (`BH₃`):** Borane exhibits the opposite selectivity; it reduces **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols while leaving esters unreacted.\n\n### **Step 2: Assign Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priorities**\n\nThe stereochemical outcome depends on whether the chemical reaction changes the priority ranking of the groups attached to the chiral center (C3). This determines if the R/S label is retained or inverted.\n\n*   **Groups at the Chiral Center (C3):**\n    1.  `-H` (Hydrogen)\n    2.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl)\n    3.  `-CH₂COOH` (The \"acid arm\")\n    4.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (The \"ester arm\")\n*   **Priority Comparison:** The crucial comparison is between the acid arm and the ester arm. According to CIP rules, we look for the first point of difference moving away from the chiral center. In the ester arm, the ether oxygen is bonded to a **C**arbon (`-O-C...`). In the acid arm, the hydroxyl oxygen is bonded to a **H**ydrogen (`-O-H`). Since Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen, the ester arm has the higher priority.\n*   **The unanimous and correct priority order is:**\n    *   **Priority 1 (Highest):** `-CH₂COOiBu`\n    *   **Priority 2:** `-CH₂COOH`\n    *   **Priority 3:** `-CH₂CH₃`\n    *   **Priority 4 (Lowest):** `-H`\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction A and Determine Starting Material A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ → (R)-lactone`\n*   **Mechanism:** `LiBH₄` reduces the **ester arm** (the original Priority 1 group) to a primary alcohol. The acid arm (Priority 2) is unchanged.\n*   **Stereochemical Result:** In the resulting hydroxy-acid intermediate, the unchanged acid arm now has higher priority than the newly formed alcohol arm. The original Priority 1 group has become lower in priority than the original Priority 2 group. This swap in the ranks of the top two groups causes a formal **inversion** of the stereochemical designation.\n*   **Conclusion:** For the reaction `(S)-starting material → (R)-product`, an inversion pathway is required. Therefore, starting material **A must be the (S)-enantiomer**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze Reaction B and Determine Starting Material B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ → (S)-lactone`\n*   **Mechanism:** `BH₃` reduces the **acid arm** (the original Priority 2 group) to a primary alcohol. The ester arm (Priority 1) is unchanged.\n*   **Stereochemical Result:** In the resulting hydroxy-ester intermediate, the unchanged ester arm is still higher in priority than the newly formed alcohol arm. The original Priority 1 group remains the highest priority group. Therefore, the priority order is **preserved**. This results in **retention** of the stereochemical designation.\n*   **Conclusion:** For the reaction `(S)-starting material → (S)-product`, a retention pathway is required. Therefore, starting material **B must also be the (S)-enantiomer**.\n\n### **Final Determination**\n\nBased on a complete analysis of both reaction pathways, which is consistently supported by the reasoning in all candidate answers:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis conclusion must be matched to the provided options:\nA) A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nB) A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid , B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nC) A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid , B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nD) A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"

Core Principles Analysis**\n\n*   **Structure of Starting Material**: The compound is `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. It features two functional groups susceptible to reduction: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`). It possesses a single chiral center at the C3 position.\n*   **Reagent Selectivity**:\n    *   `LiBH₄` (Lithium borohydride) is a chemoselective reducing agent that reduces **esters** to primary alcohols while leaving carboxylic acids intact under these conditions.\n    *   `BH₃` (Borane) has the opposite selectivity, reducing **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols while leaving esters intact.\n\n### **2. Stereochemical Analysis (The Decisive Step)**\n\nThe most critical part of the analysis is to determine how the chemical transformation affects the R/S designation of the chiral center. While no bonds are broken *at* the chiral center, the R/S label can change if the CIP priority ranking of the attached groups is altered.\n\n1.  **Assigning Priorities in the Starting Material**:\n    The four groups attached to the chiral center (C3) are H, `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl), `-CH₂COOH` (the \"acid arm\"), and `-CH₂COOiBu` (the \"ester arm\").\n    To compare the acid and ester arms, we find the first point of difference along the chains. In the ester's alkoxy group (`-O-`**C**`H₂-`...), the oxygen is bonded to a carbon. In the acid's hydroxyl group (`-O-`**H**), the oxygen is bonded to a hydrogen. Since Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen, the ester arm has a higher priority.\n    *   **Priority 1 (P1):** `-CH₂COOiBu`\n    *   **Priority 2 (P2):** `-CH₂COOH`\n    *   **Priority 3 (P3):** `-CH₂CH₃`\n    *   **Priority 4 (P4):** `-H`\n\n2.  **Analysis of Reaction A: A + LiBH₄ → (R)-Lactone**\n    *   **Pathway**: `LiBH₄` reduces the **ester group (P1)** to a primary alcohol. The acid group (P2) is unchanged. The resulting 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid then cyclizes to the lactone.\n    *   **Priority Change**: In the intermediate just before cyclization, we compare the new arms attached to the chiral center: the `-CH₂COOH` arm and the newly formed `-CH₂CH₂OH` arm. The carboxylic acid now has higher priority than the alcohol.\n    *   **Stereochemical Result**: The group that was originally P1 has become lower in priority than the group that was originally P2. The priority ranks of the top two groups are swapped. A swap in priorities **inverts** the R/S designation.\n    *   **Conclusion for A**: Since the reaction proceeds with inversion to produce the **(R)**-lactone, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Reaction B: B + BH₃ → (S)-Lactone**\n    *   **Pathway**: `BH₃` reduces the **carboxylic acid group (P2)** to a primary alcohol. The ester group (P1) is unchanged. The resulting 5-hydroxyester then cyclizes to the lactone.\n    *   **Priority Change**: We compare the new arms: the unchanged `-CH₂COOiBu` arm and the newly formed `-CH₂CH₂OH` arm. The ester arm still has higher priority than the alcohol arm.\n    *   **Stereochemical Result**: The group that was P1 remains the highest priority group. The priority order of the two main arms is **maintained**. This results in **retention** of the R/S designation.\n    *   **Conclusion for B**: Since the reaction proceeds with retention to produce the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **3.

The correct approach to solving this problem involves two key steps: determining the chemoselectivity of the reducing agents and analyzing the stereochemical consequences of the reactions using Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze Reagent Selectivity**\n    *   The starting material, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, contains both a carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) and an ester group (`-COOiBu`).\n    *   **Reaction A (`LiBH₄`)**: Lithium borohydride is a selective reducing agent that reduces the **ester** group to a primary alcohol while leaving the carboxylic acid group intact.\n    *   **Reaction B (`BH₃`)**: Borane has the opposite selectivity, reducing the **carboxylic acid** group to a primary alcohol while leaving the ester group intact.\n\n2.  **Perform Stereochemical Analysis (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog Priorities)**\n    This is the most critical part of the problem. While the reactions do not break any bonds at the chiral center (C3), they modify the functional groups on the arms attached to the chiral center's chain. This can alter their priority ranking and potentially change the final R/S designation.\n\n    *   **Priorities in the Starting Material:** The four groups attached to the chiral center (C3) are -H, an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`), an acid-containing arm (`-CH₂COOH`), and an ester-containing arm (`-CH₂COOiBu`).\n        *   To rank the two main arms, we compare them atom by atom. The ester arm has a higher priority than the acid arm because the oxygen of its alkoxy group (`-O-C...`) is bonded to a Carbon atom, while the oxygen of the acid's hydroxyl group (`-O-H`) is bonded to a Hydrogen atom. Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen.\n        *   The priority order is: **P1:** `-CH₂COOiBu` > **P2:** `-CH₂COOH` > **P3:** `-CH₂CH₃` > **P4:** `-H`.\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction A: `A + LiBH₄ → (R)-Lactone`**\n    *   The `LiBH₄` reduces the **ester** group (P1) to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid group (P2) is unaffected.\n    *   In the resulting intermediate (a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid), the acid group (`-CH₂COOH`) now has a higher priority than the newly formed alcohol group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n    *   **Stereochemical Result**: The group that was originally P1 becomes a lower-priority group, and the group that was originally P2 becomes the new highest-priority group. Since the ranks of the top two priority groups have been swapped, the reaction proceeds with **INVERSION** of the stereochemical designation.\n    *   **Conclusion for A**: To obtain the **(R)** product through an inversion pathway, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n4.  **Analyze Reaction B: `B + BH₃ → (S)-Lactone`**\n    *   The `BH₃` reduces the **acid** group (P2) to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester group (P1) is unaffected.\n    *   In the resulting intermediate (a 5-hydroxy ester), the ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) is still a higher priority group than the newly formed alcohol group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n    *   **Stereochemical Result**: The group that was originally P1 remains the highest priority group. The priority order of the main arms is maintained. Therefore, the reaction proceeds with **RETENTION** of the stereochemical designation.\n    *   **Conclusion for B**: To obtain the **(S)** product through a retention pathway, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **Final Determination**\n\nBased on the complete analysis:\n*   Starting Material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting Material **B** must also be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to the option where both A and B are the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis is a complex organic chemistry problem that hinges on two key concepts: the chemoselectivity of reducing agents and the stereochemical outcome based on Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules. A rigorous analysis is required.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Reagent Selectivity**: The first step is to understand what each reagent does. The starting material, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, has both a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-COOiBu`) group.\n    *   **Reaction A (`LiBH₄`)**: Lithium borohydride is a selective reagent that reduces **esters** to primary alcohols while leaving carboxylic acids untouched.\n    *   **Reaction B (`BH₃`)**: Borane exhibits the opposite selectivity; it reduces **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols, leaving esters untouched.\n\n2.  **Stereochemical Analysis (The Deciding Factor)**: The R/S designation of the chiral center is determined by the priority of the attached groups. While these reactions do not break any bonds at the chiral center itself, they modify the groups attached to the main chain, which can change their priority and thus potentially \"invert\" the R/S label.\n\n    *   **Assigning Priorities in the Starting Material**:\n        The chiral center is C3, which is attached to four groups:\n        1.  `-H` (Hydrogen)\n        2.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl)\n        3.  The \"acid arm\": `-CH₂COOH`\n        4.  The \"ester arm\": `-CH₂COOiBu`\n\n        To prioritize the acid and ester arms, we compare them atom by atom starting from the chiral center. The point of difference occurs at the final oxygen atom: the acid has an `O-H` bond, while the ester has an `O-C` bond (to the isobutyl group). Since Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen, the ester arm has the higher priority.\n\n        The correct priority order is:\n        *   **Priority 1 (P1):** `-CH₂COOiBu`\n        *   **Priority 2 (P2):** `-CH₂COOH`\n        *   **Priority 3 (P3):** `-CH₂CH₃`\n        *   **Priority 4 (P4):** `-H`\n\n3.  **Analyzing Reaction A**: `A + LiBH₄ → (R)-Lactone`\n    *   **Mechanism**: The `LiBH₄` reduces the **ester group (P1)** to an alcohol. The acid group (P2) is unchanged.\n    *   **Priority Change**: In the resulting intermediate, we compare the acid group (`-CH₂COOH`) with the newly formed alcohol group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid group now has higher priority.\n    *   **Stereochemical Result**: The group that was originally P1 becomes the new P'2 (lower priority), and the group that was originally P2 becomes the new P'1 (higher priority). The priorities of the top two groups are swapped. A swap in priorities leads to an **INVERSION** of the stereochemical designation.\n    *   **Conclusion**: For the reaction `A → (R)-product` to proceed via inversion, the starting material **A must be (S)**.\n\n4.  **Analyzing Reaction B**: `B + BH₃ → (S)-Lactone`\n    *   **Mechanism**: The `BH₃` reduces the **acid group (P2)** to an alcohol. The ester group (P1) is unchanged.\n    *   **Priority Change**: In the resulting intermediate, we compare the unchanged ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) with the newly formed alcohol group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester group is still higher priority.\n    *   **Stereochemical Result**: The group that was originally P1 remains the highest priority group. The relative priority order is maintained. This leads to **RETENTION** of the stereochemical designation.\n    *   **Conclusion**: For the reaction `B → (S)-product` to proceed via retention, the starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\n### **Final Determination**\n\n*   Starting Material A must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting Material B must also be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nTherefore, both reactions start with the same (S)-enantiomer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to consolidate the provided answers and determine the single correct final answer.\n\nThe core of this problem lies in two areas of organic chemistry: the chemoselectivity of reducing agents and the stereochemical consequences of the reactions, determined by the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules. All of the provided analyses correctly identify these core principles.\n\n### **Step 1: Reagent Chemoselectivity**\n\nThis point is foundational and agreed upon by all analyses.\n*   **Reaction A uses Lithium borohydride (`LiBH₄`)**: This reagent selectively reduces the **ester** functional group (`-COO-iBu`) to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) untouched.\n*   **Reaction B uses Borane (`BH₃`)**: This reagent exhibits the opposite selectivity, reducing the **carboxylic acid** functional group to a primary alcohol, leaving the ester untouched.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of Stereochemistry (CIP Rules)**\n\nThis is the most critical step and where a detailed analysis is required. The absolute 3D arrangement of groups around the chiral center is preserved, but the R/S *designation* can change if the reaction alters the priority of the substituents.\n\n**A. Initial Priorities in the Starting Material**\n\n*   The chiral center is C3, which is attached to an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`), a hydrogen (`-H`), an \"acid arm\" (`-CH₂COOH`), and an \"ester arm\" (`-CH₂COOiBu`).\n*   To assign priority between the two main arms, we look at the first point of difference. For the ester arm, the ether oxygen is bonded to a carbon (of the isobutyl group). For the acid arm, the hydroxyl oxygen is bonded to a hydrogen.\n*   Since carbon has a higher atomic number than hydrogen, the ester arm has the higher priority.\n*   **The priority order is unanimously determined to be:**\n    *   **Priority 1 (P1):** `-CH₂COOiBu`\n    *   **Priority 2 (P2):** `-CH₂COOH`\n    *   **Priority 3 (P3):** `-CH₂CH₃`\n    *   **Priority 4 (P4):** `-H`\n\n**B. Stereochemical Consequence of Reaction A (`LiBH₄`)**\n\n*   **Transformation:** The ester group (P1) is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid group (P2) is unchanged.\n*   **Priority Change:** In the resulting hydroxy-acid intermediate, the unchanged acid group now has higher priority than the newly formed alcohol group.\n*   **Conclusion:** The group that was originally P1 has become lower priority than the group that was originally P2. This swapping of the top two priorities results in an **INVERSION** of the stereochemical designation. Therefore, to produce the **(R)**-lactone, the starting material **A must be (S)**.\n\n**C. Stereochemical Consequence of Reaction B (`BH₃`)**\n\n*   **Transformation:** The acid group (P2) is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester group (P1) is unchanged.\n*   **Priority Change:** In the resulting hydroxy-ester intermediate, the unchanged ester group is still higher priority than the newly formed alcohol group.\n*   **Conclusion:** The priority order of the top two groups is preserved. This results in **RETENTION** of the stereochemical designation. Therefore, to produce the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\n### **Step 3: Final Determination**\n\nThe detailed chemical analysis, which is consistent across all provided candidate answers, leads to a single, unambiguous conclusion:\n*   Starting Material **A** is **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting Material **B** is also **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis result must now be matched to the provided options.\n\nA) A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n**B) A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid , B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\nC) A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid , B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nD) A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThe correct choice is B. The variation in the final letters selected by the candidate answers stems from mismatches between their correct reasoning and the specific list of options they were shown, but the underlying chemical logic is sound and consistent.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem requires a careful analysis of two distinct chemical reactions, focusing on reagent selectivity and the stereochemical consequences, which are determined by the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify Reagent Selectivity**\n    *   The starting material, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, contains both a carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester group (`-COO-iBu`).\n    *   **Reaction A uses `LiBH₄`**: This reagent selectively reduces the **ester** to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid untouched.\n    *   **Reaction B uses `BH₃`**: This reagent selectively reduces the **carboxylic acid** to a primary alcohol, leaving the ester untouched.\n\n2.  **Assign Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priorities for the Starting Material**\n    This is the most critical step. We must determine the priorities of the groups attached to the chiral center (C3) to see how the R/S designation might change.\n    *   The four groups attached to the chiral carbon are: `-H`, `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl), the acid arm (`-CH₂COOH`), and the ester arm (`-CH₂COOiBu`).\n    *   To compare the acid and ester arms, we look for the first point of difference. The ester's alkoxy oxygen is bonded to a carbon (`-O-C...` in isobutyl), while the acid's hydroxyl oxygen is bonded to a hydrogen (`-O-H`).\n    *   Since carbon has a higher atomic number than hydrogen, the ester arm has a higher priority than the acid arm.\n    *   **Priority Order:** `(-CH₂COOiBu)` > `(-CH₂COOH)` > `(-CH₂CH₃)` > `(-H)`\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction A: `A + LiBH₄ → (R)-Lactone`**\n    *   **Transformation:** `LiBH₄` reduces the higher-priority ester arm. The lower-priority acid arm is unchanged and forms the carbonyl of the resulting lactone.\n    *   **Priority Change:** The original highest-priority arm (ester) is converted into an alcohol arm, which is now lower in priority than the acid arm. The priority of the top two groups is **swapped**.\n    *   **Stereochemical Outcome:** A swap in the priority of two groups at a chiral center results in an **INVERSION** of the stereochemical designation. To obtain the (R)-product via an inversion pathway, the starting material **A must be (S)**.\n\n4.  **Analyze Reaction B: `B + BH₃ → (S)-Lactone`**\n    *   **Transformation:** `BH₃` reduces the lower-priority acid arm. The higher-priority ester arm is unchanged and forms the carbonyl of the resulting lactone.\n    *   **Priority Change:** The original highest-priority arm (ester) remains the highest priority group. The relative priority order is maintained.\n    *   **Stereochemical Outcome:** Since the priority order is maintained, the reaction proceeds with **RETENTION** of the stereochemical designation. To obtain the (S)-product via a retention pathway, the starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   For reaction A to yield the (R)-product via inversion, starting material A must be the **(S)**-enantiomer.\n*   For reaction B to yield the (S)-product via retention, starting material B must also be the **(S)**-enantiomer.\n\nTherefore, both starting materials, A and B, are **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B in the list.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis problem requires a careful analysis of two distinct organic reactions, focusing on reagent selectivity and the resulting stereochemistry. Let's break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n### **Part 1: Reagent Chemoselectivity**\n\nThe starting material, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, contains two functional groups that can be reduced: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-COO-iBu`). The two reducing agents used have different preferences for these groups.\n\n*   **Reaction A uses LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This reagent is known to selectively reduce esters to primary alcohols. It is much less reactive towards carboxylic acids. Therefore, in reaction A, the **ester group is reduced**.\n*   **Reaction B uses BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent exhibits the opposite selectivity. It preferentially reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, reacting much more slowly with esters. Therefore, in reaction B, the **carboxylic acid group is reduced**.\n\n### **Part 2: Stereochemical Analysis via Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Rules**\n\nThis is the most critical step. The absolute 3D configuration of the chiral center does not change, but the R/S label can change if the chemical transformation alters the priority ranking of the attached groups.\n\n**Step 2a: Assign Initial CIP Priorities**\nThe chiral center (C3) is attached to four groups. We must rank them by priority:\n1.  -H (Hydrogen)\n2.  -CH₂CH₃ (Ethyl group)\n3.  The arm containing the carboxylic acid: `-CH₂COOH`\n4.  The arm containing the ester: `-CH₂COOiBu`\n\nTo rank the acid arm vs. the ester arm, we compare them atom by atom from the chiral center. The point of difference is in the hydroxyl/alkoxy part. In the acid arm's `-OH` group, the oxygen is bonded to a Hydrogen. In the ester arm's `-O-iBu` group, the oxygen is bonded to a Carbon. Since Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen, the ester arm has the higher priority.\n\nThe complete priority ranking for the starting material is:\n*   **Priority 1 (P1):** `-CH₂COOiBu` (Ester arm)\n*   **Priority 2 (P2):** `-CH₂COOH` (Acid arm)\n*   **Priority 3 (P3):** `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)\n*   **Priority 4 (P4):** `-H` (Hydrogen)\n\n**Step 2b: Analyze the Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction A**\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-Lactone`\n*   **Transformation:** The ester group (original **P1**) is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid group (original **P2**) is untouched.\n*   **Change in Priorities:** In the resulting intermediate, we now compare the untouched acid group (`-CH₂COOH`) with the new alcohol group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid group now has a higher priority.\n*   **Conclusion:** The group that was P1 is now lower priority than the group that was P2. The priority order of the top two groups is swapped. This results in an **INVERSION** of the stereochemical label (e.g., an S-reactant becomes an R-product).\n*   **For A:** To get an **(R)** product from a reaction that causes inversion, the starting material **A must be (S)**.\n\n**Step 2c: Analyze the Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction B**\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-Lactone`\n*   **Transformation:** The acid group (original **P2**) is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester group (original **P1**) is untouched.\n*   **Change in Priorities:** We now compare the untouched ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) with the new alcohol group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester group is still higher priority.\n*   **Conclusion:** The original P1 group remains the highest priority group. The relative priority order of the two main arms is maintained. This results in **RETENTION** of the stereochemical label (e.g., an S-reactant becomes an S-product).\n*   **For B:** To get an **(S)** product from a reaction that proceeds with retention, the starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\n### **Final Determination**\n\nOur analysis concludes:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** is also **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to the option where both A and B are the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis is an advanced organic chemistry problem that hinges on two key principles: the chemoselectivity of different reducing agents and the effect of the chemical transformations on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) stereochemical designations. An analysis of the candidate answers shows a remarkable consensus on the chemical reasoning, with disagreements only arising from apparent clerical errors in matching the correct reasoning to the final answer choices.\n\nHere is a definitive step-by-step breakdown:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reagent Selectivity**\n\nThis step determines which functional group on the starting material is transformed in each reaction.\n*   **Starting Material:** `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid` contains both a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`).\n*   **Reaction A (`LiBH₄`):** Lithium borohydride is a chemoselective reducing agent that reduces **esters** to primary alcohols while leaving carboxylic acids intact.\n*   **Reaction B (`BH₃`):** Borane shows the opposite selectivity, reducing **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols while leaving esters intact.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Stereochemical Consequences via CIP Priority Rules**\n\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis. While the 3D arrangement of atoms at the chiral center does not change, the R/S *label* can be inverted if the reaction alters the priority ranking of the chemical groups attached to the chiral center's chain.\n\n*   **Assigning Priorities in the Starting Material:**\n    The chiral center (C3) is attached to four groups:\n    1.  `-H` (Hydrogen)\n    2.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl)\n    3.  `-CH₂COOH` (The \"acid arm\")\n    4.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (The \"ester arm\")\n\n    To prioritize the acid vs. the ester arm, we look at the first point of difference along the chains. In the ester (`-O-`**C**`H₂-`), the alkoxy oxygen is attached to a carbon atom. In the acid (`-O-`**H**), the hydroxyl oxygen is attached to a hydrogen atom. Since Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen, the ester arm has a higher priority.\n\n    *   **The unanimous and correct priority order is:**\n        *   **Priority 1 (P1):** `-CH₂COOiBu`\n        *   **Priority 2 (P2):** `-CH₂COOH`\n        *   **Priority 3 (P3):** `-CH₂CH₃`\n        *   **Priority 4 (P4):** `-H`\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction A (`A + LiBH₄ → (R)-Lactone`)**\n\n1.  **Transformation:** The ester group (P1) is reduced to an alcohol. The acid group (P2) is unchanged.\n2.  **Priority Change:** In the resulting 5-hydroxy-acid intermediate, the unchanged acid group now has a higher priority than the newly formed alcohol group.\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** The group that was originally Priority 1 has become a lower priority group, while the group that was originally Priority 2 is now the highest priority group. Since the ranks of the top two groups have been swapped, this results in an **INVERSION** of the stereochemical designation.\n4.  **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the **(R)** product via an inversion pathway, the starting material **A must be (S)**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze Reaction B (`B + BH₃ → (S)-Lactone`)**\n\n1.  **Transformation:** The acid group (P2) is reduced to an alcohol. The ester group (P1) is unchanged.\n2.  **Priority Change:** In the resulting 5-hydroxy-ester intermediate, the unchanged ester group still has a higher priority than the newly formed alcohol group.\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome:** The original P1 group remains the highest priority group. The priority ranking of the two main arms is preserved. This results in **RETENTION** of the stereochemical designation.\n4.  **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the **(S)** product via a retention pathway, the starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\n### **Final Determination**\n\nThe chemical analysis unanimously concludes:\n*   Starting Material **A** is **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting Material **B** is also **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis result corresponds to option B in the provided list. The divergent answers from the other agents appear to stem from errors in mapping their correct chemical conclusions to the provided lettered options, rather than any disagreement on the underlying chemistry.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis problem requires a careful analysis of the chemoselectivity of two different reducing agents and the stereochemical consequences of each reaction, which is determined by the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Products**\n    *   **Starting Material**: `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule contains two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`). It possesses a single chiral center at the C3 position.\n    *   **Product**: `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone) formed by intramolecular cyclization after one of the functional groups is reduced to a primary alcohol.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reagent Chemoselectivity**\n    The two reactions use reagents with opposite selectivity, which determines the reaction pathway.\n    *   **Reaction A (`LiBH₄`):** Lithium borohydride is a reducing agent that selectively reduces **esters** to primary alcohols while leaving carboxylic acids unaffected.\n    *   **Reaction B (`BH₃`):** Borane selectively reduces **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols, leaving esters largely unreacted under the same conditions.\n\n3.  **Perform Stereochemical Analysis using CIP Rules (The Decisive Step)**\n    The R/S designation is determined by the priority of the groups attached to the chiral center. While no bonds are broken at the chiral center itself, the reaction modifies the functional groups, which can alter their CIP priority and thus potentially invert the R/S label.\n\n    *   **Priorities in the Starting Material (at C3):**\n        The four groups on the chiral center are `-H`, `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl), the \"acid arm\" (`-CH₂COOH`), and the \"ester arm\" (`-CH₂COOiBu`).\n        We must rank the acid arm and the ester arm. In the ester (`-O-iBu`), the alkoxy oxygen is bonded to a carbon atom. In the acid (`-O-H`), the hydroxyl oxygen is bonded to a hydrogen atom. Since Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen, the ester arm has a higher priority.\n        *   **Priority 1 (P1):** `-CH₂COOiBu` (Ester arm)\n        *   **Priority 2 (P2):** `-CH₂COOH` (Acid arm)\n        *   **Priority 3 (P3):** `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl)\n        *   **Priority 4 (P4):** `-H` (Hydrogen)\n\n4.  **Trace Reaction A: A + LiBH₄ → (R)-Lactone**\n    *   **Mechanism:** `LiBH₄` reduces the **ester group (P1)** to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The **acid group (P2)** is untouched and proceeds to form the carbonyl of the lactone.\n    *   **Priority Change:** In the resulting intermediate, we compare the unchanged acid arm (`-CH₂COOH`) with the new alcohol arm (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid arm now has higher priority than the alcohol arm.\n    *   **Stereochemical Result:** The group that was originally P1 has become lower in priority than the group that was originally P2. The priority ranks of the top two groups have been **swapped**. A swap in priorities results in an **inversion** of the stereochemical designation.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the **(R)**-product via a reaction that causes inversion, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n5.  **Trace Reaction B: B + BH₃ → (S)-Lactone**\n    *   **Mechanism:** `BH₃` reduces the **acid group (P2)** to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The **ester group (P1)** is untouched and proceeds to form the carbonyl of the lactone.\n    *   **Priority Change:** In the resulting intermediate, we compare the unchanged ester arm (`-CH₂COOiBu`) with the new alcohol arm (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester arm is still higher in priority than the alcohol arm.\n    *   **Stereochemical Result:** The group that was P1 remains the highest priority group. The relative priority order is maintained. This results in **retention** of the stereochemical designation.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the **(S)**-product via a reaction that causes retention, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\n*   For reaction A to yield an (R)-product via inversion, the starting material A must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   For reaction B to yield an (S)-product via retention, the starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBoth reactions start with the same (S)-enantiomer. This conclusion is unanimously supported by the reasoning of all provided candidate answers. Matching this result to the given options:\n\nA) A = (R)... , B = (R)...\nB) A = (S)... , B = (S)...\nC) A = (S)..., B = (R)...\nD) A = (R)..., B = (S)...\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem requires a careful analysis of the chemoselectivity of two different reducing agents and the subsequent effect on the stereochemistry of the chiral center. Let's break it down step by step, using the consensus logic from the provided answers.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Molecules and Reagents**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting compound is `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. It possesses two functional groups that can be reduced: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-COOiBu`). It also has a single chiral center at the C3 position.\n*   **Product:** The final product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, which is a six-membered lactone (a cyclic ester).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   **LiBH₄ (Lithium Borohydride):** This reagent selectively reduces the **ester** functional group to a primary alcohol while leaving the carboxylic acid untouched.\n    *   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent has the opposite selectivity; it reduces the **carboxylic acid** functional group to a primary alcohol while leaving the ester untouched.\n\n### **Step 2: Assign Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priorities**\n\nThis is the most critical step for determining the stereochemical outcome. We need to assign priorities to the four groups attached to the chiral center (C3) of the starting material.\n\n1.  The groups are: -H, -CH₂CH₃ (Ethyl), `-CH₂COOH` (the \"acid arm\"), and `-CH₂COOiBu` (the \"ester arm\").\n2.  To rank the acid and ester arms, we compare them atom-by-atom. In the ester's alkoxy group (`-O-iBu`), the oxygen is bonded to a carbon atom. In the acid's hydroxyl group (`-O-H`), the oxygen is bonded to a hydrogen atom.\n3.  Since Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen, the ester arm has a higher priority.\n4.  **Initial Priority Order:**\n    *   **Priority 1 (P1):** `-CH₂COOiBu`\n    *   **Priority 2 (P2):** `-CH₂COOH`\n    *   **Priority 3 (P3):** `-CH₂CH₃`\n    *   **Priority 4 (P4):** `-H`\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-Lactone`\n*   **Mechanism:** `LiBH₄` reduces the **ester** group (P1) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid group (P2) is unaffected and will form the carbonyl of the final lactone.\n*   **Priority Change:** In the resulting molecule, the acid group now has higher priority than the newly formed alcohol group. The group that was originally P1 becomes lower in priority than the group that was originally P2.\n*   **Stereochemical Result:** The ranks of the top two priority groups are swapped. A swap in priorities causes an **INVERSION** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** To get an **(R)** product from a reaction that proceeds with inversion, the starting material **A must be (S)**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-Lactone`\n*   **Mechanism:** `BH₃` reduces the **acid** group (P2) to a primary alcohol. The ester group (P1) is unaffected and will form the carbonyl of the final lactone.\n*   **Priority Change:** The ester group remains higher in priority than the newly formed alcohol group. The relative priority ordering of the two main arms is maintained.\n*   **Stereochemical Result:** The priority order is preserved. This results in **RETENTION** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** To get an **(S)** product from a reaction that proceeds with retention, the starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBased on a thorough analysis of both reaction pathways, which is unanimously agreed upon by the reasoning of all candidate answers:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must also be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to the option where both A and B are the (S)-enantiomer.\n\nA) A = (R)-acid, B = (S)-acid\nB) A = (S)-acid, B = (R)-acid\nC) A = (R)-acid, B = (R)-acid\nD) A = (S)-acid, B = (S)-acid\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis problem requires a detailed analysis of two different reactions, focusing on both the selectivity of the reducing agents and the resulting stereochemistry. A careful step-by-step approach is necessary.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reagent Selectivity**\n\nThe starting material, `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`, has two functional groups that can be reduced: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-COOiBu`). The two reagents used have opposite selectivities:\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium Borohydride)**: This reagent is known to selectively reduce **esters** to primary alcohols while leaving carboxylic acids largely unaffected.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane)**: This reagent has the opposite selectivity, preferentially reducing **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols, while being much less reactive towards esters.\n\n### **Step 2: Assign Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priorities**\n\nThis is the most critical step, as it determines how the reaction affects the R/S stereochemical designation. The label can change even if the 3D structure at the chiral center is preserved.\n\n1.  **Identify the chiral center:** The chiral center is the C3 carbon, which is bonded to a hydrogen (`-H`), an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`), a chain containing the carboxylic acid (`-CH₂COOH`, the \"acid arm\"), and a chain containing the ester (`-CH₂COOiBu`, the \"ester arm\").\n2.  **Rank the groups:** The key comparison is between the acid arm and the ester arm. According to CIP rules, we look at the first point of difference. In the ester's alkoxy group (`-O-iBu`), the oxygen is bonded to a carbon. In the acid's hydroxyl group (`-O-H`), the oxygen is bonded to a hydrogen. Since Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen, the ester arm has a higher priority.\n    *   **Priority 1 (P1):** `-CH₂COOiBu`\n    *   **Priority 2 (P2):** `-CH₂COOH`\n    *   **Priority 3 (P3):** `-CH₂CH₃`\n    *   **Priority 4 (P4):** `-H`\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-Lactone`\n*   **Pathway:** LiBH₄ reduces the **ester group (P1)** to a primary alcohol. The acid group (P2) is unchanged.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** In the resulting intermediate (a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid), the original acid arm (P2) now has a higher priority than the newly formed alcohol arm (which came from P1). The priorities of the top two groups have been **swapped**. This swap causes an **INVERSION** of the stereochemical designation.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the **(R)** product through an inversion pathway, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-Lactone`\n*   **Pathway:** BH₃ reduces the **carboxylic acid group (P2)** to a primary alcohol. The ester group (P1) is unchanged.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** In the resulting intermediate (a 5-hydroxy ester), the original ester arm (P1) is still higher in priority than the newly formed alcohol arm (which came from P2). The priority order of the top two groups has been **preserved**. This leads to **RETENTION** of the stereochemical designation.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the **(S)** product through a retention pathway, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Determination**\n\nBased on the analysis of both pathways:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** must also be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nTherefore, both reactions start with the same (S)-enantiomer. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses and a re-evaluation of the core chemical principles.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the Problem**\n\nThe question asks for the correct stereoisomers for two starting materials, A and B, which undergo different reactions to produce specific stereoisomers of a final product. The solution requires a two-fold analysis:\n*   **Chemoselectivity**: Understanding which functional group (carboxylic acid vs. ester) is reduced by each reagent (`LiBH₄` vs. `BH₃`).\n*   **Stereochemistry**: Determining how the chemical transformation affects the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the substituents, and thus whether the R/S designation of the chiral center is retained or inverted.\n\n### **2. Analysis of Reagent Selectivity**\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identify the standard selectivity of the reducing agents:\n*   **Reaction A (`LiBH₄`)**: Lithium borohydride is a chemoselective reducing agent that reduces **esters** to primary alcohols while leaving carboxylic acids intact under these conditions.\n*   **Reaction B (`BH₃`)**: Borane has the opposite selectivity, reducing **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols while leaving esters intact.\n\n### **3. The Decisive Step: Stereochemical Analysis via CIP Priority Rules**\n\nThis is the most critical part of the problem. While no bonds are broken at the chiral center itself (preserving the 3D arrangement of atoms), the *R/S* label can change if the chemical transformations alter the priority ranking of the groups. All the candidate answers correctly follow this line of reasoning.\n\n**A. Initial CIP Priorities in the Starting Material**\n*   The starting material is `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n*   The chiral center (C3) is attached to four groups: H, an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`), an \"acid arm\" (`-CH₂COOH`), and an \"ester arm\" (`-CH₂COOiBu`).\n*   When comparing the acid arm and the ester arm, the first point of difference occurs at the oxygen atom. In the ester, the oxygen is bonded to a carbon (of the isobutyl group), while in the acid, the hydroxyl oxygen is bonded to a hydrogen.\n*   Since carbon has a higher atomic number than hydrogen, the ester arm has higher priority.\n*   **Priority Order:** `(-CH₂COOiBu)` > `(-CH₂COOH)` > `(-CH₂CH₃)` > `(-H)`\n\n**B. Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction A (`LiBH₄`)**\n*   **Transformation:** `LiBH₄` reduces the **ester arm** (the higher priority group) to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid arm (the lower priority group) is unchanged.\n*   **Priority Change:** In the resulting intermediate, the acid arm now has higher priority than the newly formed alcohol arm.\n*   **Conclusion:** The group that was originally Priority #1 has become a lower priority group than the group that was originally Priority #2. The ranks of the top two groups have been **swapped**. This results in an **INVERSION** of the R/S designation.\n*   **To obtain the (R)-product via inversion, the starting material A must be (S).**\n\n**C. Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction B (`BH₃`)**\n*   **Transformation:** `BH₃` reduces the **acid arm** (the lower priority group) to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester arm (the higher priority group) is unchanged.\n*   **Priority Change:** In the resulting intermediate, the ester arm remains the higher priority group compared to the new alcohol arm.\n*   **Conclusion:** The priority order of the two main arms is maintained (the original highest-priority group remains the highest-priority group). This results in **RETENTION** of the R/S designation.\n*   **To obtain the (S)-product via retention, the starting material B must be (S).**\n\n### **4. Final Determination**\n\nThe detailed chemical analysis, which is consistent across all candidate answers, leads to the following conclusion:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** must also be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis conclusion, that both starting materials are the (S)-enantiomer, corresponds to option C in the provided list.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nAn analysis of the provided answers reveals a consistent and correct logical pathway, even though the final letter choice differs due to variations in the options presented to each agent. The core chemical reasoning is sound across all responses. Here is a consolidated step-by-step analysis to arrive at the final answer.\n\n### **1. Identify Core Chemical Principles**\n\nThe solution to this problem rests on two fundamental concepts in organic chemistry:\n*   **Chemoselectivity:** Different reagents react with specific functional groups at different rates. We must know the selectivity of Lithium borohydride (`LiBH₄`) and Borane (`BH₃`) toward esters and carboxylic acids.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction's effect on the stereochemical designation (R/S) of the chiral center must be determined. This requires applying the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules both before and after the chemical transformation.\n\n### **2. Analyze Reagent Selectivity**\n\nThere is a consensus among all agents, which is chemically correct:\n*   **Reaction A (`LiBH₄`)**: Lithium borohydride is a chemoselective reagent that reduces the **ester** functional group (`-COOiBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`) while leaving the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) intact.\n*   **Reaction B (`BH₃`)**: Borane exhibits the opposite selectivity. It reduces the **carboxylic acid** functional group to a primary alcohol while leaving the ester group intact.\n\n### **3. Perform Stereochemical Analysis (The Decisive Step)**\n\nWhile no bonds are broken at the chiral center itself (preserving its 3D arrangement), the R/S designation can change if the chemical modification alters the priority ranking of the substituent groups.\n\n*   **Step 3.1: Assign Priorities in the Starting Material**\n    The chiral center (C3) is attached to four groups: `-H`, `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl), a chain with a carboxylic acid (`-CH₂COOH`), and a chain with an ester (`-CH₂COOiBu`). The priority between the acid and ester arms is key.\n    *   In the ester arm, the ether oxygen is bonded to a carbon (`-O-C...`).\n    *   In the acid arm, the hydroxyl oxygen is bonded to a hydrogen (`-O-H`).\n    *   According to CIP rules, Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen, giving the ester arm higher priority.\n    *   **Initial Priority Order:** **P1**: `-CH₂COOiBu` > **P2**: `-CH₂COOH` > **P3**: `-CH₂CH₃` > **P4**: `-H`\n\n*   **Step 3.2: Analyze Reaction A (`A + LiBH₄ → (R)-Lactone`)**\n    *   **Transformation:** The ester group (original **P1**) is reduced to a primary alcohol. The acid group (original **P2**) is unchanged.\n    *   **Priority Change:** In the resulting hydroxy-acid intermediate, the unchanged acid group now has a higher priority than the newly formed alcohol group.\n    *   **Stereochemical Result:** The group that was P1 has become a lower-priority group, and the group that was P2 is now the highest-priority group. The ranks of the top two groups have been swapped. This causes a formal **inversion** of the R/S designation (an (S) starting material gives an (R) product).\n    *   **Conclusion:** To obtain the **(R)** product via this inversion pathway, starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n*   **Step 3.3: Analyze Reaction B (`B + BH₃ → (S)-Lactone`)**\n    *   **Transformation:** The acid group (original **P2**) is reduced to a primary alcohol. The ester group (original **P1**) is unchanged.\n    *   **Priority Change:** In the resulting hydroxy-ester intermediate, the unchanged ester group is still higher in priority than the newly formed alcohol group.\n    *   **Stereochemical Result:** The group that was P1 remains the highest priority group. The relative priority order is **maintained**. This results in **retention** of the R/S designation (an (S) starting material gives an (S) product).\n    *   **Conclusion:** To obtain the **(S)** product via this retention pathway, starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **4. Final Determination**\n\nBased on the consistent analysis derived from all agents:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must also be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBoth reactions start with the same (S)-enantiomer. Matching this result with the provided list of choices:\nA) A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid , B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nB) A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nC) A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\nD) A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid , B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis is an organic chemistry problem that requires a two-pronged analysis: first, understanding the specific reactivity (chemoselectivity) of the different reducing agents, and second, meticulously tracking the stereochemical consequences of these reactions using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\nThe analysis can be broken down into four key steps. An overwhelming majority of the provided candidate answers agree on the chemical reasoning for each step, even if some make a clerical error in the final selection.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reagent Chemoselectivity**\n\n*   **Reaction A (`A + LiBH₄`)**: Lithium borohydride (`LiBH₄`) is a reagent that selectively reduces **esters** to primary alcohols while leaving carboxylic acids unreacted.\n*   **Reaction B (`B + BH₃`)**: Borane (`BH₃`) has the opposite selectivity; it reduces **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols while leaving esters unreacted.\n\n**Step 2: Assign Initial CIP Priorities to the Starting Material**\n\n*   The starting material is `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n*   The chiral center (C3) is attached to four groups:\n    1.  `-H` (Hydrogen)\n    2.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl)\n    3.  `-CH₂COOH` (The \"acid arm\")\n    4.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (The \"ester arm\")\n*   To assign priorities between the acid arm and the ester arm, we look at the first point of difference. The oxygen in the ester arm is bonded to a carbon (of the isobutyl group), while the oxygen in the acid arm is bonded to a hydrogen. Since Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen, the ester arm has the higher priority.\n*   **Initial Priority Order:**\n    *   **P1 (Highest):** `-CH₂COOiBu`\n    *   **P2:** `-CH₂COOH`\n    *   **P3:** `-CH₂CH₃`\n    *   **P4 (Lowest):** `-H`\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Stereochemical Consequence of Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ → (R)-lactone`\n*   **Transformation:** `LiBH₄` reduces the **ester group (P1)** to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid group (P2) remains untouched.\n*   **Change in Priority:** In the resulting intermediate, we compare the new arms: the unchanged acid arm (`-CH₂COOH`) now has higher priority than the new alcohol arm (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n*   **Result:** The group that was originally P1 has become the new lower-priority arm, and the group that was P2 has become the new higher-priority arm. The priorities of the top two groups have been **swapped**. A swap of priorities at a chiral center results in an **INVERSION** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** To get an **(R)** product via an inversion pathway, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Stereochemical Consequence of Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ → (S)-lactone`\n*   **Transformation:** `BH₃` reduces the **acid group (P2)** to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester group (P1) remains untouched.\n*   **Change in Priority:** In the resulting intermediate, we compare the new arms: the unchanged ester arm (`-CH₂COOiBu`) still has a higher priority than the new alcohol arm (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n*   **Result:** The group that was originally P1 remains the highest priority group. The relative priority order of the top two arms is **preserved**. This results in **RETENTION** of the R/S designation.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** To get an **(S)** product via a retention pathway, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBased on the consistent logical analysis from all four steps:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** must also be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis result, `A=(S)` and `B=(S)`, corresponds to option C in the question.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis problem requires a careful analysis of two separate chemical reactions. The solution depends on correctly identifying the selectivity of the reducing agents and the stereochemical consequences of the transformations.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material and Reagents**\n*   **Starting Material:** The problem uses stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule contains two functional groups susceptible to reduction: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`). It possesses a single chiral center at the C3 position.\n*   **Reagent for Reaction A:** `LiBH₄` (Lithium borohydride) is a chemoselective reducing agent that reduces esters to primary alcohols but does not readily reduce carboxylic acids.\n*   **Reagent for Reaction B:** `BH₃` (Borane) exhibits the opposite selectivity, readily reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols while reacting much more slowly with esters.\n\n**2. Perform Stereochemical Analysis using Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Rules**\nThis is the most critical step. The absolute 3D configuration of atoms at the chiral center does not change, but the R/S *designation* can be altered if the reaction changes the priority of the attached groups.\n\n*   **Assigning Priorities in the Starting Material:**\n    The four groups attached to the chiral center (C3) are: -H, `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl), the \"acid arm\" (`-CH₂COOH`), and the \"ester arm\" (`-CH₂COOiBu`).\n    To determine the priority between the acid and ester arms, we look at the first point of difference. The oxygen in the ester's alkoxy group is bonded to a carbon (of the isobutyl group), while the oxygen in the acid's hydroxyl group is bonded to a hydrogen. Since Carbon has a higher atomic number than Hydrogen, the ester arm has the higher priority.\n    The CIP priority order is:\n    1.  **P1:** `-CH₂COOiBu`\n    2.  **P2:** `-CH₂COOH`\n    3.  **P3:** `-CH₂CH₃`\n    4.  **P4:** `-H`\n\n**3. Trace Reaction A**\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone`\n*   **Pathway:** `LiBH₄` selectively reduces the **ester group (P1)** to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group (P2) is unaffected. The resulting 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid cyclizes.\n*   **Stereochemical Consequence:** The group that was originally P1 (the ester arm) is transformed into a new group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`) that is *lower* in priority than the untouched acid arm (P2). The priorities of the top two groups are swapped. A swap in the priority of two groups at a chiral center results in an **inversion** of the stereochemical designation.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Since the reaction proceeds with inversion, to obtain an **(R)** product, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n**4. Trace Reaction B**\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone`\n*   **Pathway:** `BH₃` selectively reduces the **carboxylic acid group (P2)** to a primary alcohol. The ester group (P1) is unaffected. The resulting 5-hydroxy ester cyclizes.\n*   **Stereochemical Consequence:** The group that was originally P1 (the ester arm) remains the highest priority group. The P2 group is modified into a new group that is still of lower priority than P1. Therefore, the relative priority ordering of the top groups is **preserved**. This results in **retention** of the stereochemical designation.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Since the reaction proceeds with retention, to obtain an **(S)** product, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **Final Determination**\nBased on the analysis of both reaction pathways:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** must also be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem requires a two-pronged analysis: first, understanding the specific reactivity (chemoselectivity) of the two reducing agents, and second, carefully determining the stereochemical consequences of each reaction using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n### **Step 1: Chemoselectivity of the Reducing Agents**\n\n*   **Starting Material**: `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule contains both a carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester group (`-COO-iBu`).\n*   **Reaction A uses LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**: This is a selective reducing agent that reduces **esters** to primary alcohols while leaving carboxylic acids unaffected under typical conditions. The intermediate formed will be a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid, which then cyclizes.\n*   **Reaction B uses BH₃ (Borane)**: This reagent has the opposite selectivity; it preferentially reduces **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols, leaving esters unaffected. The intermediate formed will be a 5-hydroxy ester, which then cyclizes.\n\n### **Step 2: Stereochemical Analysis via Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Rules**\n\nThis is the most critical step. Although the bonds at the chiral center itself are not broken or formed (meaning the 3D arrangement of groups is preserved), the R/S *label* can change if the reaction alters the CIP priority ranking of the chemical groups attached to the chiral center's main chain.\n\n**A. Assigning Priorities in the Starting Material**\nThe chiral center is C3, which is attached to four groups:\n1.  -H (Hydrogen)\n2.  -CH₂CH₃ (Ethyl group)\n3.  The \"acid arm\": `-CH₂COOH`\n4.  The \"ester arm\": `-CH₂COOiBu`\n\nTo rank the acid and ester arms, we compare them atom by atom starting from the chiral center. The point of first difference occurs at the oxygen atom of the carboxyl group. In the ester, this oxygen is bonded to a carbon atom (of the isobutyl group), while in the carboxylic acid, it is bonded to a hydrogen atom. Since carbon has a higher atomic number than hydrogen, the ester arm has higher priority.\n\n*   **The Priority Order is:** `-CH₂COOiBu` > `-CH₂COOH` > `-CH₂CH₃` > `-H`\n\n**B. Analysis of Reaction A: A + LiBH₄ → (R)-product**\n1.  **Chemical Transformation**: LiBH₄ reduces the higher-priority **ester arm** to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The lower-priority acid arm (`-CH₂COOH`) is unchanged.\n2.  **Change in Priorities**: In the resulting hydroxy-acid intermediate, the unchanged acid arm now has a higher priority than the newly formed alcohol arm.\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome**: The group that was originally Priority 1 (ester) has been transformed into a new group that is lower in priority than the original Priority 2 group (acid). The priority ranking of the top two arms has been swapped. A swap in priorities results in an **INVERSION** of the stereochemical designation.\n4.  **Conclusion for A**: To obtain the **(R)**-product via an inversion pathway, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n**C. Analysis of Reaction B: B + BH₃ → (S)-product**\n1.  **Chemical Transformation**: BH₃ reduces the lower-priority **acid arm** to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The higher-priority ester arm (`-CH₂COOiBu`) is unchanged.\n2.  **Change in Priorities**: In the resulting hydroxy-ester intermediate, the unchanged ester arm is still higher in priority than the newly formed alcohol arm.\n3.  **Stereochemical Outcome**: The original Priority 1 group remains the highest priority group. The priority ranking of the top two arms is maintained. This results in **RETENTION** of the stereochemical designation.\n4.  **Conclusion for B**: To obtain the **(S)**-product via a retention pathway, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **Step 3: Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the rigorous analysis of both reaction pathways:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must also be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBoth starting materials are the same (S)-enantiomer. Matching this to the given options:\n\nA) A = (S)-acid, B = (R)-acid\nB) A = (S)-acid, B = (S)-acid\nC) A = (R)-acid, B = (S)-acid\nD) A = (R)-acid, B = (R)-acid\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
