The fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not change its intrinsic decay probability.\n\n2.  **Define the survival probability:** Let P(t) be the probability that the atom decays within time *t*, and S(t) be the probability that it survives (does not decay) for time *t*. The relationship is `P(t) = 1 - S(t)`. The survival probability is given by the formula `S(t) = e^(-λt)`, where λ is the decay constant.\n\n3.  **Calculate the decay constant (λ):** We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%.\n    *   `P(100) = 0.32`\n    *   Therefore, the survival probability for 100 minutes is `S(100) = 1 - P(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n\n    Using the survival formula:\n    *   `S(100) = e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`\n\n4.  **Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes:** Due to the memoryless nature of the decay, the 50 minutes that have already passed are irrelevant.

This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. The fact that the atom has not decayed for 50 minutes does not change its inherent decay probability.\n\nFirst, we must determine the decay constant (λ) from the information provided.

Probability of survival for 100 minutes = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n2.  Let S(t) be the survival probability for time t. So, S(100) = 0.68.\n3.  We need to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. Due to the memoryless nature of decay, this is simply the probability of decay in any 150-minute interval, which is 1 - S(150).\n4.  S(t) = e^(-λt). Therefore, S(150) = e^(-150λ) = (e^(-100λ))^(150/100) = (S(100))^1.5.\n5.  S(150) = (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607.\n6.

We don't need to calculate the exact value of `λ`; we can use this relationship directly.\n\n4.  **Define the Question Mathematically:**\n    We are asked for the probability that the atom will decay in the *next* 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\n    *   Let A be the event \"the atom decays in the next 150 minutes\" (i.e., between t=50 and t=200).\n    *   Let B be the event \"the atom has not decayed by t=50\".\n    We want to find the conditional probability P(A|B).\n\n5.  **Apply the Memoryless Property:**\n    Because of the memoryless nature of radioactive decay, the condition that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future decay. Therefore, the probability of it decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of a brand new atom decaying in 150 minutes.\n    So, we just need to calculate `P_decay(150)`.\n    `P_decay(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Probability:**\n    We need to find the value of `e^(-150λ)`. We can use the relationship we found in Step 3: `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`.\n    Using the rules of exponents:\n    `e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n    Now, substitute the known value:\n    `e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5`\n    Let's calculate this value:\n    `(0.68)^1.5 = 0.68 * (0.68)^0.5 = 0.68 * sqrt(0.68)`\n    `sqrt(0.68) ≈ 0.8246`\n    `(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.5607`\n    This is the probability of the atom *surviving* for 150 minutes.\n\n    The probability of it *decaying* in 150 minutes is:\n    `P_decay(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated probability is 0.4393, which is 43.93%. This is closest to option A, 44%.\n\n### Formal Conditional Probability (Optional Confirmation)\nThe probability of decaying between t=50 and t=200, given survival up to t=50 is:\n`P(decay in [50, 200] | survive up to 50) = P(decay in [50, 200] AND survive up to 50) / P(survive up to 50)`\nThe event \"decay in [50, 200] AND survive up to 50\" is the same as \"survive up to 50 and then decay before 200\". This is `P(survive up to 50) - P(survive up to 200)`.\nSo, the probability is `(P_survive(50) - P_survive(200)) / P_survive(50)`\n`= (e^(-50λ) - e^(-200λ)) / e^(-50λ)`\n`= 1 - e^(-200λ) / e^(-50λ)`\n`= 1 - e^(-200λ + 50λ)`\n`= 1 - e^(-150λ)`\nThis confirms that the result is simply the probability of decay in a 150-minute interval, as deduced from the memoryless property.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics of Radioactive Decay:** Radioactive decay is a random, memoryless process. This \"memoryless\" property is crucial: the probability that an atom will decay in a future time interval does not depend on how long it has already existed. Therefore, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to the probability of it decaying in the *next* 150 minutes. We simply need to calculate the probability that a new atom of this type would decay within a 150-minute period.\n\n2.  **Use the Given Information to Find the Decay Constant:** The probability of decay, `P(t)`, within a time `t` is given by the formula:\n    `P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n    where `λ` is the decay constant and `e` is the base of the natural logarithm.\n\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    `0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)`\n\n    Rearranging this, we can find the probability of *survival* for 100 minutes:\n    `e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability of Decay in 150 Minutes:** We want to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, which is `P(150)`.\n    `P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n\n    We can find the value of `e^(-λ * 150)` by using the value we found in the previous step:\n    `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n    `e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n    Now, we calculate the value:\n    `(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`\n\n    This is the probability of the atom *surviving* for 150 minutes. To find the probability of it *decaying*, we subtract this from 1:\n    `P(150) = 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393`\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes is approximately 0.4393, or 43.93%.

Radioactive decay follows an exponential distribution, which is a memoryless process. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. The fact that the atom has not decayed for 50 minutes does not change its probability of decaying in any future time period.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Define the survival probability.** The probability that an atom survives (does not decay) until time *t* is given by the exponential decay formula: P(survival) = e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant.\n\n2.  **Use the given information to find the decay constant (λ).** We are told that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%.

The key property of this distribution is that it is \"memoryless\". This means the probability of decay in a future time interval is independent of how long the atom has already survived.\n\nMy proposed solution path is as follows:\n1.  First, determine the decay constant, λ, from the initial information: a 32% probability of decay in 100 minutes. The survival probability, P(T > t), is given by e^(-λt). Therefore, the decay probability is 1 - e^(-λt).\n    *   1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32\n    *   e^(-100λ) = 0.68\n2.  Next, we need to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes. This is a conditional probability: P(T < 50 + 150 | T > 50).\n3.  Due to the memoryless property, this conditional probability is equal to the unconditional probability of the atom decaying in a 150-minute interval starting from time zero: P(T < 150).\n4.  Calculate P(T < 150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150).\n5.  From step 1, we have e^(-100λ) = 0.68. We can write e^(-150λ) as (e^(-100λ))^(1.5), which is 0.68^1.5.\n6.  The final probability is 1 - 0.68^1.5. I will use a search query to perform this calculation accurately.\n\nMy proposed action is to use a search engine to calculate the final numerical value.\n\nSkeptic: The reasoning seems solid, especially the application of the memoryless property, which is a fundamental concept in exponential decay processes. However, the entire answer hinges on the correct application of this principle and the subsequent calculation. My main concern is ensuring the calculation is precise, as the multiple-choice options are relatively close to each other. A search that also confirms the formula for conditional probability in radioactive decay would add confidence to the result.\n\nDecide: The proposed path is logical. The next step is to execute the calculation and verify the underlying principle. A combined search can achieve this.\n\nProposer: The search results confirm my initial approach. Result explicitly states the memoryless property of processes like radioactive decay: \"P(T > t + s | T > s) = P(T > t)\". This means the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is independent of the 50 minutes it has already survived. Therefore, the problem simplifies to finding the unconditional probability of decay within 150 minutes. My calculation path remains the same: find the decay constant λ from the first condition and then use it to find the probability for a 150-minute interval. The final calculation is `1 - 0.68^1.5`.\n\nSkeptic: I agree. The search results, particularly and, strongly support the use of the memoryless property for single-atom decay. The problem is now reduced to a straightforward calculation. The key is to perform this calculation accurately to select the correct multiple-choice option.\n\nDecide: The debate has converged. The physical principle is confirmed, and the calculation is clear. The next and final step is to perform the calculation and select the answer.\n\n**Calculation Steps:**\n\n1.  **Define Survival Probability:** The probability that an atom survives past time `t` is `P(T > t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n2.  **Use Given Information:** We are given that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%. This means the survival probability is 100% - 32% = 68%.\n    *   `P(T > 100) = e^(-100λ) = 0.68`\n3.  **Apply the Memoryless Property:** We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given it has survived for 50 minutes. This is `P(T < 50 + 150 | T > 50)`. Because radioactive decay is a memoryless process, this is equal to the probability of decay in any 150-minute interval, `P(T < 150)`.\n4.  **Calculate the Final Probability:**\n    *   `P(T < 150) = 1 - P(T > 150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`\n    *   We can rewrite `e^(-150λ)` as `(e^(-100λ))^(150/100)` or `(e^(-100λ))^1.5`.\n    *   From step 2, we know `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`.\n    *   Substituting this value gives: `1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n    *   Calculating the value: `0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`\n    *   The final probability is `1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`\n5.  **Conclusion:** The probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes is approximately 0.4393, or 43.93%.

The 50 minutes of survival time is extraneous information designed to test the understanding of this principle.\n*   **Decay vs. Survival:** It is essential to distinguish between the probability of decay (`1 - e^(-λt)`) and the probability of survival (`e^(-λt)`). The calculation involves converting the initial decay probability to a survival probability, performing the main calculation, and then converting the final survival probability back to a decay probability.\n*   **Exponent Manipulation:** The most elegant and least error-prone method is to manipulate the exponents (`e^(-150λ) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`) rather than explicitly calculating `λ` with logarithms, which could introduce rounding errors.\n*   **Final Answer Selection:** The majority of the candidate answers correctly calculate the value to be ~43.93% but then select different letters (A, B, C, D).

Because of the memoryless property, this is simply the probability that a new atom would decay within 150 minutes.\n\n    The probability of decay within 150 minutes is:\n    P(decay within 150 min) = 1 - P(survival for 150 min) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150).\n\n4.  **Solve for the unknown probability.** We can find the value of e^(-λ * 150) from the information we found in step 2:\n    From 0.68 = e^(-λ * 100), we can write e^(-λ) = 0.68^(1/100).\n\n    Now substitute this into the equation for 150 minutes:\n    P(survival for 150 min) = e^(-λ * 150) = (e^(-λ))^150 = (0.68^(1/100))^150 = 0.68^(150/100) = 0.68^1.5.\n\n    Calculating the value:\n    0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.5607\n\n    Finally, calculate the probability of decay:\n    P(decay within 150 min) = 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393.\n\nThis probability is approximately 43.93%, which rounds to 44%.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe model correctly identified the exponential decay nature of the problem and the crucial \"memoryless\" property. The 50 minutes that have passed do not alter the intrinsic decay probability of the atom. The task simplifies to finding the probability of decay in a 150-minute interval, given the decay constant derived from the initial condition.\n\n1.  **Find the decay constant (λ):**\n    *   Probability of decay in 100 minutes is 0.32.\n    *   `P(decay) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n    *   `0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)`\n    *   `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`\n    *   `-100λ = ln(0.68)`\n    *   `λ = -ln(0.68) / 100 ≈ 0.003857 min⁻¹`\n\n2.  **Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes:**\n    *   Due to the memoryless property, we calculate the probability of decay over a fresh 150-minute interval.\n    *   `P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n    *   `P = 1 - e^(-0.003857 * 150)`\n    *   `P ≈ 1 - e^(-0.5785)`\n    *   `P ≈ 1 - 0.5607`\n    *   `P ≈ 0.4393`\n\n3.  **Convert to percentage:**\n    *   `0.4393 * 100% ≈ 43.93%`\n\nThis value is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nProposer: The problem describes a classic scenario of radioactive decay, which follows an exponential distribution. The key property of this distribution is that it is \"memoryless\". This means the probability of decay in a future time interval is independent of how long the atom has already survived.\n\nMy proposed solution path is as follows:\n1.  First, determine the decay constant, λ, from the initial information: a 32% probability of decay in 100 minutes. The survival probability, P(T > t), is given by e^(-λt). Therefore, the decay probability is 1 - e^(-λt).\n    *   1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32\n    *   e^(-100λ) = 0.68\n2.  Next, we need to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes. This is a conditional probability: P(T < 50 + 150 | T > 50).\n3.  Due to the memoryless property, this conditional probability is equal to the unconditional probability of the atom decaying in a 150-minute interval starting from time zero: P(T < 150).\n4.  Calculate P(T < 150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150).\n5.  From step 1, we have e^(-100λ) = 0.68. We can write e^(-150λ) as (e^(-100λ))^(1.5), which is 0.68^1.5.\n6.  The final probability is 1 - 0.68^1.5. I will use a search query to perform this calculation accurately.\n\nMy proposed action is to use a search engine to calculate the final numerical value.\n\nSkeptic: The reasoning seems solid, especially the application of the memoryless property, which is a fundamental concept in exponential decay processes. However, the entire answer hinges on the correct application of this principle and the subsequent calculation. My main concern is ensuring the calculation is precise, as the multiple-choice options are relatively close to each other. A search that also confirms the formula for conditional probability in radioactive decay would add confidence to the result.\n\nDecide: The proposed path is logical. The next step is to execute the calculation and verify the underlying principle. A combined search can achieve this.\n\nProposer: The search results confirm my initial approach. Result explicitly states the memoryless property of processes like radioactive decay: \"P(T > t + s | T > s) = P(T > t)\". This means the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is independent of the 50 minutes it has already survived. Therefore, the problem simplifies to finding the unconditional probability of decay within 150 minutes. My calculation path remains the same: find the decay constant λ from the first condition and then use it to find the probability for a 150-minute interval. The final calculation is `1 - 0.68^1.5`.\n\nSkeptic: I agree. The search results, particularly and, strongly support the use of the memoryless property for single-atom decay. The problem is now reduced to a straightforward calculation. The key is to perform this calculation accurately to select the correct multiple-choice option.\n\nDecide: The debate has converged. The physical principle is confirmed, and the calculation is clear. The next and final step is to perform the calculation and select the answer.\n\n**Calculation Steps:**\n\n1.  **Define Survival Probability:** The probability that an atom survives past time `t` is `P(T > t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n2.  **Use Given Information:** We are given that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%. This means the survival probability is 100% - 32% = 68%.\n    *   `P(T > 100) = e^(-100λ) = 0.68`\n3.  **Apply the Memoryless Property:** We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given it has survived for 50 minutes. This is `P(T < 50 + 150 | T > 50)`. Because radioactive decay is a memoryless process, this is equal to the probability of decay in any 150-minute interval, `P(T < 150)`.\n4.  **Calculate the Final Probability:**\n    *   `P(T < 150) = 1 - P(T > 150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`\n    *   We can rewrite `e^(-150λ)` as `(e^(-100λ))^(150/100)` or `(e^(-100λ))^1.5`.\n    *   From step 2, we know `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`.\n    *   Substituting this value gives: `1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n    *   Calculating the value: `0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`\n    *   The final probability is `1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`\n5.  **Conclusion:** The probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes is approximately 0.4393, or 43.93%. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
