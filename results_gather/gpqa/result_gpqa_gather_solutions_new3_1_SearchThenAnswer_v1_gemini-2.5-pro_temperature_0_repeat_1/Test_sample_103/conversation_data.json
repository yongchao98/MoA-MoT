Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method\n\nThe radial velocity method detects exoplanets by observing the Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. A planet's gravitational pull causes its star to \"wobble\" around their common center of mass. This wobble results in a periodic shift in the star's spectral lines. The maximum shift in wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as K.\n\n### 2. Relate Wavelength Shift to Velocity Semi-Amplitude (K)\n\nThe relationship between the observed wavelength shift and the star's velocity is given by the Doppler effect. Therefore, the ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes of the two stars is equal to the ratio of their maximum observed wavelength shifts:\n\n*   $K_1 \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max,1} = 5$ miliangstrom\n*   $K_2 \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max,2} = 7$ miliangstrom\n\nSo, the ratio is:\n$K_2 / K_1 = 7 / 5 = 1.4$\n\n### 3. The Formula for Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude (K) of the star's radial velocity is given by the formula:\n\n$K = (2\\pi G / T)^{1/3} * (M_p \\sin(i) / M_{star}^{2/3})$\n\nWhere:\n*   T is the orbital period of the planet.\n*   $M_p$ is the mass of the planet.\n*   $M_{star}$ is the mass of the star.\n*   $i$ is the inclination of the planet's orbit relative to our line of sight.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n### 4. Apply the Given Information\n\nThe problem provides the following crucial pieces of information:\n*   The stars have identical masses: $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$.\n*   The planets have masses \"similar to that of Neptune.\" In the context of the RV method, this typically refers to the minimum mass ($M_p \\sin(i)$), which is the quantity that can be directly constrained by the measurement. This is a key assumption for solving the problem. Therefore, we assume $M_{p1} \\sin(i_1) \\approx M_{p2} \\sin(i_2)$.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods\n\nLet's set up a ratio of the semi-amplitudes for the two systems:\n\n$K_2 / K_1 = [(2\\pi G / T_2)^{1/3} * (M_{p2} \\sin(i_2) / M_{star2}^{2/3})] / [(2\\pi G / T_1)^{1/3} * (M_{p1} \\sin(i_1) / M_{star1}^{2/3})]$\n\nGiven our assumptions that the stellar masses and the minimum planet masses are equal, most terms cancel out:\n\n$K_2 / K_1 = (1 / T_2^{1/3}) / (1 / T_1^{1/3}) = (T_1 / T_2)^{1/3}$\n\nNow, we can substitute the known value of $K_2 / K_1$:\n\n$1.4 = (T_1 / T_2)^{1/3}$\n\nTo find the ratio of the periods ($T_2 / T_1$), we first solve for $T_1 / T_2$ by cubing both sides of the equation:\n\n$1.4^3 = T_1 / T_2$\n$2.744 = T_1 / T_2$\n\nFinally, we invert the fraction to get the desired ratio:\n\n$T_2 / T_1 = 1 / 2.744 \\approx 0.3644$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method**\n\nThe RV method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. The star \"wobbles\" as the planet orbits it, causing its light to be slightly blueshifted as it moves towards us and redshifted as it moves away.\n\nThe magnitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r) along our line of sight. The maximum observed shift corresponds to the maximum radial velocity, known as the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K).\n\nTherefore, we can establish a relationship between K and Δλ:\nK ∝ Δλ\n\nGiven the wavelength shifts for the two systems:\n*   Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ\n*   Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ\n\nThe ratio of their radial velocity semi-amplitudes is:\nK₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7\n\n**2. Relate Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters**\n\nThe formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is derived from Kepler's Laws and the conservation of momentum. The full formula is:\n\nK = [ (2πG) / T ]^(1/3) * [ Mₚ / (Mₛ + Mₚ)^(2/3) ] * sin(i)\n\nWhere:\n*   T is the orbital period.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n*   Mₚ is the mass of the planet.\n*   Mₛ is the mass of the star.\n*   i is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n\n**3. Simplify the Relationship for this Specific Problem**\n\nWe are given the following information:\n*   The stars have the same mass (Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂).\n*   The planets have the same mass (Mₚ₁ = Mₚ₂).\n*   The problem does not specify different orbital inclinations, so we assume they are the same (sin(i₁) = sin(i₂)). This is a standard assumption in such problems.\n\nSince G, Mₛ, Mₚ, and sin(i) are the same for both systems, we can see how K depends only on the orbital period, T:\n\nK ∝ 1 / T^(1/3)\n\n**4. Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods**\n\nUsing the proportionality from step 3, we can set up a ratio for the two systems:\n\nK₁ / K₂ = (1 / T₁^(1/3)) / (1 / T₂^(1/3))\nK₁ / K₂ = (T₂ / T₁)^(1/3)\n\nWe want to find the ratio T₂ / T₁. To do this, we can cube both sides of the equation:\n\n(T₂ / T₁) = (K₁ / K₂)³\n\nNow, substitute the ratio of the semi-amplitudes we found in step 1:\n\nT₂ / T₁ = (5 / 7)³\nT₂ / T₁ = 125 / 343\nT₂ / T₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This matches option A.\n\nThe star with the larger wavelength shift (Star 2) is moving faster, which implies its planet has a stronger gravitational pull at a closer distance, resulting in a shorter orbital period. Our result (T₂/T₁ < 1) is consistent with this physical intuition.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Physics:** The problem uses the Radial Velocity (RV) method. This method detects exoplanets by measuring the periodic Doppler shift in the light from their host star. The star \"wobbles\" as it and the planet orbit their common center of mass. This wobble causes the star's light to be blueshifted as it moves towards us and redshifted as it moves away. The amplitude of this periodic shift in wavelength is the key piece of information.\n\n2.  **Relate Observables to Physical Quantities:**\n    *   The Doppler shift formula relates the change in wavelength ($\\Delta \\lambda$) to the radial velocity ($v_s$) of the star: $\\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_s}{c}$.\n    *   The maximum periodic shift in wavelength ($\\Delta \\lambda_{max}$) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, which is called the velocity semi-amplitude, denoted as $K_s$.\n    *   Therefore, $K_s$ is directly proportional to $\\Delta \\lambda_{max}$.\n    *   We are given:\n        *   $\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 1} = 5$ miliangstrom for planet #1's system.\n        *   $\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 2} = 7$ miliangstrom for planet #2's system.\n    *   This means the ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes is:\n        $\\frac{K_{s2}}{K_{s1}} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 2}}{\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 1}} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$\n\n3.  **Derive the Relationship between Velocity Amplitude ($K_s$) and Orbital Period ($P$):**\n    *   The velocity semi-amplitude of the star is given by the formula:\n        $K_s = \\frac{2 \\pi a_s \\sin(i)}{P}$\n        where $P$ is the orbital period, $a_s$ is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit around the center of mass, and $i$ is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n    *   From the definition of the center of mass, we have $M_s a_s = m_p a_p$, where $M_s$ and $m_p$ are the masses of the star and planet, and $a_p$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass ($m_p \\ll M_s$), the planet's semi-major axis $a_p$ is nearly identical to the total separation $a$. So, we can write $a_s \\approx a \\frac{m_p}{M_s}$.\n    *   Now, we use Kepler's Third Law, which relates the orbital period $P$ to the semi-major axis $a$:\n        $P^2 = \\frac{4 \\pi^2}{G(M_s + m_p)} a^3$\n        Solving for $a$, we get $a = \\left( \\frac{G(M_s + m_p) P^2}{4 \\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3}$. This shows that $a$ is proportional to $P^{2/3}$ ($a \\propto P^{2/3}$), since $G$, $M_s$, and $m_p$ are constants for a given system.\n    *   Now, substitute the expressions for $a_s$ and $a$ back into the formula for $K_s$:\n        $K_s \\propto \\frac{a}{P} \\propto \\frac{P^{2/3}}{P} = P^{-1/3}$\n\n4.  **List Careful Points and Assumptions:**\n    *   We have established the key relationship: $K_s \\propto P^{-1/3}$.\n    *   This proportionality holds because other factors are constant between the two systems. The problem states that the star masses ($M_s$) are the same and the planet masses ($m_p$) are the same.\n    *   We must also assume that the orbital inclinations ($i$) are the same for both systems. In the absence of information to the contrary, this is a standard assumption for such comparative problems.\n\n5.  **Solve for the Ratio of Periods:**\n    *   Using the proportionality $K_s \\propto P^{-1/3}$, we can write the ratio for our two systems:\n        $\\frac{K_{s2}}{K_{s1}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n    *   We want to find the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$. Let's rearrange the equation:\n        $\\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \\left(\\frac{K_{s2}}{K_{s1}}\\right)^3$\n        $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_{s1}}{K_{s2}}\\right)^3$\n    *   Now, substitute the known values:\n        $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3$\n    *   Calculate the result:\n        $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \\frac{125}{343}$\n        $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\approx 0.3644$\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This makes sense intuitively: a larger velocity wobble ($K_s$) for the same masses implies the planet is closer to the star, which, by Kepler's laws, means it must have a shorter orbital period. The result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is the final answer.\n\nThe relationship between the periodic wavelength shift (Δλ) and the star's radial velocity amplitude (K) is linear, meaning Δλ ∝ K. Therefore, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts:\nK₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 miliangstrom / 5 miliangstrom = 1.4\n\nThe formula for the radial velocity amplitude K for a planet in a circular orbit is:\nK = (2πG / T)^(1/3) * (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) * sin(i)\n\nIn this problem, the star masses (M_star) are the same, and the planet masses (M_p) are the same. Assuming the orbital inclinations (i) are similar, we can establish a proportionality between K and the orbital period T:\nK ∝ T⁻¹/³\n\nUsing this proportionality, we can write the ratio of the velocity amplitudes in terms of the periods:\nK₂ / K₁ = (T₂)⁻¹/³ / (T₁)⁻¹/³ = (T₁ / T₂)^¹/³\n\nNow we can equate the two expressions for the ratio K₂ / K₁:\n1.4 = (T₁ / T₂)^¹/³\n\nTo find the ratio of the periods, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n(1.4)³ = T₁ / T₂\n2.744 = T₁ / T₂\n\nThe question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio T₂ / T₁. We can find this by taking the reciprocal:\nT₂ / T₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relating Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity:** The periodic shift in the spectral line (Δλ) is caused by the star's motion as it orbits the common center of mass with the planet. This motion, projected along our line of sight, is the radial velocity (RV). The amplitude of the RV, denoted as K, is directly proportional to the maximum observed wavelength shift (Δλ_max).\n    *   K ∝ Δλ_max\n\n    Therefore, the ratio of the RV amplitudes of the two stars is:\n    *   K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 miliangstrom / 5 miliangstrom = 1.4\n\n2.  **The Radial Velocity Amplitude Formula:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is given by the formula:\n    *   K ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))\n    *   Where:\n        *   P is the orbital period.\n        *   mₚ is the planet's mass.\n        *   M_star is the star's mass.\n        *   i is the inclination of the orbit.\n        *   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n3.  **Applying the Given Information:** The problem states that:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: M_star₁ = M_star₂.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: In the context of the RV method, this implies that the measured minimum mass, mₚ sin(i), is approximately the same for both planets. So, (mₚ sin(i))₁ ≈ (mₚ sin(i))₂.\n\n    Because M_star and mₚ sin(i) are the same for both systems, they can be treated as constants in the comparison. The formula simplifies to a proportionality between K and the orbital period P:\n    *   K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3) or K ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n4.  **Calculating the Period Ratio:** We can now set up a ratio between the two systems:\n    *   K₂ / K₁ = (P₂)^(-1/3) / (P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    We want to find the ratio P₂ / P₁, so we can invert the equation:\n    *   K₁ / K₂ = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Substitute the known values for the RV amplitudes (or the wavelength shifts):\n    *   5 / 7 = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n\n    To solve for P₂ / P₁, we cube both sides of the equation:\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343\n    *   P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\nThe orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo determine how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we need to find the ratio of their periods (P₂/P₁). This can be derived from the principles of the radial velocity (RV) method.\n\n### Key Principles:\n\n1.  **Doppler Shift and Radial Velocity:** The periodic shift in the wavelength (Δλ) of a star's spectral line is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r) caused by the orbiting planet. Therefore, the amplitude of the radial velocity variation, known as the semi-amplitude (K), is directly proportional to the maximum observed wavelength shift.\n    *   K₁ ∝ 5 miliangstrom\n    *   K₂ ∝ 7 miliangstrom\n    *   This gives the ratio of the semi-amplitudes: K₁/K₂ = 5/7.\n\n2.  **Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude Formula:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by the formula:\n    K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i) / M_star^(2/3))\n    where:\n    *   P is the orbital period.\n    *   mₚ is the planet's mass.\n    *   M_star is the star's mass.\n    *   i is the orbital inclination.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n### Applying the Principles to the Problem:\n\nWe are given the following information:\n*   The stars have the same mass: M_star₁ = M_star₂.\n*   The planets have similar masses: m_p₁ ≈ m_p₂.

The amplitude of this periodic wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K).\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes of the two stars is equal to the ratio of their observed wavelength shifts:\n\n*K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 milliangstrom / 7 milliangstrom = 5/7*\n\n### 2. The Radial Velocity Formula\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is given by the formula:\n\nK = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i) / Mₛ^(2/3))\n\nWhere:\n*   **P** is the orbital period of the planet.\n*   **G** is the gravitational constant.\n*   **mₚ** is the mass of the planet.\n*   **Mₛ** is the mass of the star.\n*   **i** is the inclination of the planet's orbit relative to our line of sight.\n\nThe term **mₚ sin(i)** is known as the \"minimum mass\" of the planet, which is the quantity that can be determined from RV measurements without knowing the inclination.\n\n### 3. Applying the Formula to the Two Systems\n\nWe are given the following information:\n*   The stars have the same mass: Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂.\n*   The planets were \"detected\" with \"masses similar to that of Neptune.\" In the context of the RV method, this implies that their minimum masses are similar: mₚ₁ sin(i₁) ≈ mₚ₂ sin(i₂).\n\nBased on these conditions, the term `(2πG)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i) / Mₛ^(2/3))` is constant for both systems. This simplifies the relationship between the radial velocity (K) and the orbital period (P) to:\n\n*K ∝ P^(-1/3)*\n\n### 4. Calculating the Ratio of the Orbital Periods\n\nWe can establish a relationship between the two systems:\n\n*K₁ * P₁^(1/3) = K₂ * P₂^(1/3)*\n\nTo find how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1 (P₂/P₁), we can rearrange the equation:\n\n*(P₂ / P₁)^(1/3) = K₁ / K₂*\n\nNow, we solve for the ratio P₂ / P₁:\n\n*P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)³*\n\nSubstituting the ratio of the radial velocities we found in the first step:\n\n*P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364*\n\nThus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe problem has been analyzed using a Monte Carlo simulation which was then confirmed with a deterministic physical derivation. The feedback indicates this approach was correct.\n\nThe core physics is as follows:\n1.  The star's radial velocity amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the observed spectral line shift `Δλ`. Therefore, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is `K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 5 / 7`.\n2.  For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity amplitude `K` is related to the planet's orbital period `P`, the star's mass `M_star`, and the planet's mass `m_p`. The relationship is `K ∝ m_p * M_star^(-2/3) * P^(-1/3)`.\n3.  Since both stars have the same mass (`M_star1 = M_star2`) and both planets have the same mass (`m_p1 = m_p2`), the relationship simplifies to `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`.\n4.  From this proportionality, we can write the ratio `K1 / K2 = (P1)^(-1/3) / (P2)^(-1/3) = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)`.\n5.  Combining the two results, we get `Δλ1 / Δλ2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)`.\n6.  To find the ratio of the periods `P2 / P1`, we cube both sides: `P2 / P1 = (Δλ1 / Δλ2)^3`.\n7.  Plugging in the given values: `P2 / P1 = (5 / 7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644`.\n\nThis value is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n### Self-Debate and Final Answer\n\n**Proposer:** The goal is to determine the ratio of the orbital periods of two exoplanets (T₂/T₁). The provided information includes the periodic wavelength shifts (Δλ) for each star, and the fact that the stars have identical masses and the planets have similar masses.\n\nThe proposed solution path is as follows:\n1.  The periodic wavelength shift (Δλ) is caused by the Doppler effect and is directly proportional to the star's maximum radial velocity (K). Therefore, the ratio Δλ₁/Δλ₂ is equal to the ratio K₁/K₂.\n2.  The star's radial velocity amplitude (K) is a function of the star's mass (M), the planet's mass (mₚ), and the semi-major axis of the orbit (a).\n3.  By establishing the relationship between K and 'a', we can use the known ratio of K₁/K₂ to find the ratio of a₂/a₁.\n4.  Using Kepler's Third Law, which relates the orbital period (T) to the semi-major axis (a) and the stellar mass (M), we can find the desired ratio T₂/T₁.\n\n**Skeptic:** This approach has potential flaws. First, the problem states the planets have \"similar\" masses, not identical ones. How does this ambiguity affect the result? Second, the measured radial velocity depends on the inclination of the orbit (sin *i*), which is unknown for both systems. If the inclinations are different, the ratio K₁/K₂ is not simply determined by the other orbital parameters.\n\n**Resolution:**\nThe multiple-choice format of the question suggests that a definitive answer can be reached. This implies that we should treat the \"similar\" masses as equal for the calculation. Any minor differences would lead to a result that is still approximately one of the given options. The issue of the unknown inclination angles is more significant. However, for the problem to be solvable, we must assume that the inclination angles are the same for both systems (or that the effect of inclination is already accounted for in the given shift values). Without this assumption, no solution is possible. Therefore, the debate converges on the conclusion that these idealizing assumptions are intended.\n\n### Derivation\nThe amplitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is proportional to the star's radial velocity amplitude (K).\nΔλ ∝ K\n\nFor a circular orbit, the star's velocity amplitude K is given by:\nK ∝ (mₚ / √(Mₛₜₐᵣ)) * (1 / √a)\nwhere mₚ is the planet's mass, Mₛₜₐᵣ is the star's mass, and 'a' is the semi-major axis.\n\nGiven that mₚ₁ ≈ mₚ₂ and Mₛₜₐᵣ₁ = Mₛₜₐᵣ₂, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is:\nK₁ / K₂ = √a₂ / √a₁\n\nSince Δλ ∝ K, we have:\nΔλ₁ / Δλ₂ = √a₂ / √a₁\n5 / 7 = √(a₂ / a₁)\na₂ / a₁ = (5 / 7)² = 25 / 49\n\nKepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period (T) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) and inversely proportional to the mass of the star (Mₛₜₐᵣ).\nT² ∝ a³ / Mₛₜₐᵣ\n\nThe ratio of the periods is therefore:\n(T₂ / T₁)² = (a₂³ / Mₛₜₐᵣ₂) / (a₁³ / Mₛₜₐᵣ₁)\n\nSince Mₛₜₐᵣ₁ = Mₛₜₐᵣ₂, this simplifies to:\n(T₂ / T₁)² = (a₂ / a₁)³\nT₂ / T₁ = (a₂ / a₁)^(3/2)\n\nSubstituting the value for a₂/a₁:\nT₂ / T₁ = ((5 / 7)²)^(3/2)\nT₂ / T₁ = (5 / 7)³\nT₂ / T₁ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Physical Principles\n\nThe problem requires understanding the Radial Velocity (RV) method for detecting exoplanets.\n\n*   **Step 1: Relate the observable to a physical quantity.** The observable is the periodic shift in a spectral line's wavelength (Δλ). This shift is a direct result of the Doppler effect caused by the star's velocity along our line of sight (the radial velocity). The maximum wavelength shift (Δλ_max) is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as K.\n    *   K ∝ Δλ_max\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes for the two stars is the same as the ratio of their wavelength shifts:\n        K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 miliangstrom / 5 miliangstrom = 1.4\n        or conversely, K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7.\n\n*   **Step 2: Relate the physical quantity (K) to the orbital parameters.** For a planet in a circular orbit (and assuming the planet's mass `m_p` is much less than the star's mass `M_star`), the formula for the velocity semi-amplitude is:\n    K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * [m_p * sin(i) / M_star^(2/3)]\n    where P is the orbital period, and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n*   **Step 3: Apply the problem's constraints.**\n    *   The stars have the same mass: M_star1 = M_star2.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: m_p1 ≈ m_p2.\n    *   The term `m_p * sin(i)` represents the minimum mass, which is what the RV method measures. The problem states the planets were detected with similar masses, which implies this measured value is similar for both systems: (m_p * sin(i))₁ ≈ (m_p * sin(i))₂.\n    *   Given these constraints, most terms in the formula for K are constant for both systems. The relationship simplifies to a proportionality between K and the orbital period P:\n        K ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n### 2. Calculation\n\nUsing the proportionality from Step 3, we can set up a ratio for the two systems. It is easier to start with the ratio that will directly solve for P₂/P₁.\n\n*   K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3)\n*   K₁ / K₂ = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n\nNow, we can solve for the desired ratio, P₂ / P₁:\n\n*   P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)³\n\nSubstitute the known values from Step 1:\n\n*   P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³\n*   P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343\n*   P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\n### 3.

A planet's gravitational pull causes its star to \"wobble\" around their common center of mass. This wobble results in a periodic shift in the star's spectral lines. The maximum shift in wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as K.\n\n### 2. Relate Wavelength Shift to Velocity Semi-Amplitude (K)\n\nThe relationship between the observed wavelength shift and the star's velocity is given by the Doppler effect. Therefore, the ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes of the two stars is equal to the ratio of their maximum observed wavelength shifts:\n\n*   $K_1 \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max,1} = 5$ miliangstrom\n*   $K_2 \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max,2} = 7$ miliangstrom\n\nSo, the ratio is:\n$K_2 / K_1 = 7 / 5 = 1.4$\n\n### 3. The Formula for Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude (K) of the star's radial velocity is given by the formula:\n\n$K = (2\\pi G / T)^{1/3} * (M_p \\sin(i) / M_{star}^{2/3})$\n\nWhere:\n*   T is the orbital period of the planet.\n*   $M_p$ is the mass of the planet.\n*   $M_{star}$ is the mass of the star.\n*   $i$ is the inclination of the planet's orbit relative to our line of sight.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n### 4.

Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method**\n\nThe RV method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. The star \"wobbles\" as the planet orbits it, causing its light to be slightly blueshifted as it moves towards us and redshifted as it moves away.\n\nThe magnitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r) along our line of sight. The maximum observed shift corresponds to the maximum radial velocity, known as the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K).\n\nTherefore, we can establish a relationship between K and Δλ:\nK ∝ Δλ\n\nGiven the wavelength shifts for the two systems:\n*   Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ\n*   Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ\n\nThe ratio of their radial velocity semi-amplitudes is:\nK₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7\n\n**2. Relate Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters**\n\nThe formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is derived from Kepler's Laws and the conservation of momentum.

This method detects exoplanets by measuring the periodic Doppler shift in the light from their host star. The star \"wobbles\" as it and the planet orbit their common center of mass. This wobble causes the star's light to be blueshifted as it moves towards us and redshifted as it moves away. The amplitude of this periodic shift in wavelength is the key piece of information.\n\n2.  **Relate Observables to Physical Quantities:**\n    *   The Doppler shift formula relates the change in wavelength ($\\Delta \\lambda$) to the radial velocity ($v_s$) of the star: $\\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_s}{c}$.\n    *   The maximum periodic shift in wavelength ($\\Delta \\lambda_{max}$) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, which is called the velocity semi-amplitude, denoted as $K_s$.\n    *   Therefore, $K_s$ is directly proportional to $\\Delta \\lambda_{max}$.\n    *   We are given:\n        *   $\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 1} = 5$ miliangstrom for planet #1's system.\n        *   $\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 2} = 7$ miliangstrom for planet #2's system.\n    *   This means the ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes is:\n        $\\frac{K_{s2}}{K_{s1}} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 2}}{\\Delta \\lambda_{max, 1}} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$\n\n3.  **Derive the Relationship between Velocity Amplitude ($K_s$) and Orbital Period ($P$):**\n    *   The velocity semi-amplitude of the star is given by the formula:\n        $K_s = \\frac{2 \\pi a_s \\sin(i)}{P}$\n        where $P$ is the orbital period, $a_s$ is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit around the center of mass, and $i$ is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n    *   From the definition of the center of mass, we have $M_s a_s = m_p a_p$, where $M_s$ and $m_p$ are the masses of the star and planet, and $a_p$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass ($m_p \\ll M_s$), the planet's semi-major axis $a_p$ is nearly identical to the total separation $a$. So, we can write $a_s \\approx a \\frac{m_p}{M_s}$.\n    *   Now, we use Kepler's Third Law, which relates the orbital period $P$ to the semi-major axis $a$:\n        $P^2 = \\frac{4 \\pi^2}{G(M_s + m_p)} a^3$\n        Solving for $a$, we get $a = \\left( \\frac{G(M_s + m_p) P^2}{4 \\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3}$. This shows that $a$ is proportional to $P^{2/3}$ ($a \\propto P^{2/3}$), since $G$, $M_s$, and $m_p$ are constants for a given system.\n    *   Now, substitute the expressions for $a_s$ and $a$ back into the formula for $K_s$:\n        $K_s \\propto \\frac{a}{P} \\propto \\frac{P^{2/3}}{P} = P^{-1/3}$\n\n4.  **List Careful Points and Assumptions:**\n    *   We have established the key relationship: $K_s \\propto P^{-1/3}$.\n    *   This proportionality holds because other factors are constant between the two systems. The problem states that the star masses ($M_s$) are the same and the planet masses ($m_p$) are the same.\n    *   We must also assume that the orbital inclinations ($i$) are the same for both systems. In the absence of information to the contrary, this is a standard assumption for such comparative problems.\n\n5.  **Solve for the Ratio of Periods:**\n    *   Using the proportionality $K_s \\propto P^{-1/3}$, we can write the ratio for our two systems:\n        $\\frac{K_{s2}}{K_{s1}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n    *   We want to find the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$.

This makes sense intuitively: a larger velocity wobble ($K_s$) for the same masses implies the planet is closer to the star, which, by Kepler's laws, means it must have a shorter orbital period. The result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is the final answer.\n\nThe relationship between the periodic wavelength shift (Δλ) and the star's radial velocity amplitude (K) is linear, meaning Δλ ∝ K. Therefore, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts:\nK₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 miliangstrom / 5 miliangstrom = 1.4\n\nThe formula for the radial velocity amplitude K for a planet in a circular orbit is:\nK = (2πG / T)^(1/3) * (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) * sin(i)\n\nIn this problem, the star masses (M_star) are the same, and the planet masses (M_p) are the same. Assuming the orbital inclinations (i) are similar, we can establish a proportionality between K and the orbital period T:\nK ∝ T⁻¹/³\n\nUsing this proportionality, we can write the ratio of the velocity amplitudes in terms of the periods:\nK₂ / K₁ = (T₂)⁻¹/³ / (T₁)⁻¹/³ = (T₁ / T₂)^¹/³\n\nNow we can equate the two expressions for the ratio K₂ / K₁:\n1.4 = (T₁ / T₂)^¹/³\n\nTo find the ratio of the periods, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n(1.4)³ = T₁ / T₂\n2.744 = T₁ / T₂\n\nThe question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio T₂ / T₁. We can find this by taking the reciprocal:\nT₂ / T₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relating Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity:** The periodic shift in the spectral line (Δλ) is caused by the star's motion as it orbits the common center of mass with the planet. This motion, projected along our line of sight, is the radial velocity (RV). The amplitude of the RV, denoted as K, is directly proportional to the maximum observed wavelength shift (Δλ_max).\n    *   K ∝ Δλ_max\n\n    Therefore, the ratio of the RV amplitudes of the two stars is:\n    *   K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 miliangstrom / 5 miliangstrom = 1.4\n\n2.  **The Radial Velocity Amplitude Formula:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is given by the formula:\n    *   K ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))\n    *   Where:\n        *   P is the orbital period.\n        *   mₚ is the planet's mass.\n        *   M_star is the star's mass.\n        *   i is the inclination of the orbit.\n        *   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n3.  **Applying the Given Information:** The problem states that:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: M_star₁ = M_star₂.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: In the context of the RV method, this implies that the measured minimum mass, mₚ sin(i), is approximately the same for both planets. So, (mₚ sin(i))₁ ≈ (mₚ sin(i))₂.\n\n    Because M_star and mₚ sin(i) are the same for both systems, they can be treated as constants in the comparison. The formula simplifies to a proportionality between K and the orbital period P:\n    *   K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3) or K ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n4.  **Calculating the Period Ratio:** We can now set up a ratio between the two systems:\n    *   K₂ / K₁ = (P₂)^(-1/3) / (P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    We want to find the ratio P₂ / P₁, so we can invert the equation:\n    *   K₁ / K₂ = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Substitute the known values for the RV amplitudes (or the wavelength shifts):\n    *   5 / 7 = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n\n    To solve for P₂ / P₁, we cube both sides of the equation:\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343\n    *   P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\nThe orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo determine how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we need to find the ratio of their periods (P₂/P₁). This can be derived from the principles of the radial velocity (RV) method.\n\n### Key Principles:\n\n1.  **Doppler Shift and Radial Velocity:** The periodic shift in the wavelength (Δλ) of a star's spectral line is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r) caused by the orbiting planet. Therefore, the amplitude of the radial velocity variation, known as the semi-amplitude (K), is directly proportional to the maximum observed wavelength shift.\n    *   K₁ ∝ 5 miliangstrom\n    *   K₂ ∝ 7 miliangstrom\n    *   This gives the ratio of the semi-amplitudes: K₁/K₂ = 5/7.\n\n2.  **Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude Formula:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by the formula:\n    K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i) / M_star^(2/3))\n    where:\n    *   P is the orbital period.\n    *   mₚ is the planet's mass.\n    *   M_star is the star's mass.\n    *   i is the orbital inclination.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n### Applying the Principles to the Problem:\n\nWe are given the following information:\n*   The stars have the same mass: M_star₁ = M_star₂.\n*   The planets have similar masses: m_p₁ ≈ m_p₂. In the context of the RV method, this implies that the measured minimum mass (mₚ sin(i)) is similar for both planets.\n*   Both orbits are circular.\n\nBased on these conditions, the term `(2πG)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i) / M_star^(2/3))` is approximately constant for both systems.\n\nThis simplifies the relationship between the semi-amplitude (K) and the orbital period (P) to:\nK ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)\n\n### Calculation:\n\nWe can establish a ratio between the two systems:\nK₁ / K₂ = (1 / P₁^(1/3)) / (1 / P₂^(1/3)) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n\nTo find the ratio of the orbital periods (P₂ / P₁), we can rearrange the equation:\nP₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3\n\nNow, we substitute the known ratio of the semi-amplitudes (which is the same as the ratio of the wavelength shifts):\nP₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)^3\n\nCalculating the final value:\nP₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThe orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This value corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nTo determine the ratio of the orbital periods, we can use the formula for the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude, K, which is the maximum velocity of the star along the line of sight.\n\nThe periodic shift in wavelength ($\\Delta\\lambda$) of a spectral line is caused by the star's motion, as described by the Doppler effect. The maximum wavelength shift is directly proportional to the RV semi-amplitude K:\n$K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$\n\nGiven the periodic shifts for the two planets:\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstrom\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstrom\n\nThe ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\n$K_1 / K_2 = 5 / 7$\n\nThe formula for the RV semi-amplitude for a planet in a circular orbit is:\n$K = (\\frac{2\\pi G}{P})^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3}}$\n(assuming the planet's mass $m_p$ is much smaller than the star's mass $M_{star}$, which is true for a Neptune-mass planet and a Sun-like star).\n\nHere:\n*   P is the orbital period.\n*   $m_p$ is the planet's mass.\n*   $M_{star}$ is the star's mass.\n*   i is the inclination of the orbit.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n\nWe are given that:\n*   The stars have the same mass: $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$.\n*   The planets have similar masses: $m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$.\n\nThe problem does not provide the inclination angles (i). In such problems, it is a standard assumption that the unknown factors are comparable, so we assume $\\sin i_1 \\approx \\sin i_2$.\n\nNow, we can set up the ratio of the semi-amplitudes for the two systems:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{(2\\pi G / P_1)^{1/3} \\cdot (m_{p1} \\sin i_1 / M_{star1}^{2/3})}{(2\\pi G / P_2)^{1/3} \\cdot (m_{p2} \\sin i_2 / M_{star2}^{2/3})}$\n\nUnder the given conditions and our assumption, most terms cancel out:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{(1/P_1)^{1/3}}{(1/P_2)^{1/3}} = (\\frac{P_2}{P_1})^{1/3}$\n\nNow, we substitute the known ratio of K:\n$\\frac{5}{7} = (\\frac{P_2}{P_1})^{1/3}$\n\nTo find the ratio of the orbital periods ($P_2/P_1$), we cube both sides of the equation:\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = (\\frac{5}{7})^3 = \\frac{125}{343}$\n\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\approx 0.3644$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to determine the ratio of the orbital periods.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Radial Velocity (RV) Method\n\nThe radial velocity method detects exoplanets by observing the Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. A planet's gravitational pull causes its star to \"wobble\" around their common center of mass. This movement along our line of sight changes the wavelength of the light we observe from the star. The amplitude of this periodic wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K).\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes of the two stars is equal to the ratio of their observed wavelength shifts:\n\n*K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 milliangstrom / 7 milliangstrom = 5/7*\n\n### 2. The Radial Velocity Formula\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is given by the formula:\n\nK = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i) / Mₛ^(2/3))\n\nWhere:\n*   **P** is the orbital period of the planet.\n*   **G** is the gravitational constant.\n*   **mₚ** is the mass of the planet.\n*   **Mₛ** is the mass of the star.\n*   **i** is the inclination of the planet's orbit relative to our line of sight.\n\nThe term **mₚ sin(i)** is known as the \"minimum mass\" of the planet, which is the quantity that can be determined from RV measurements without knowing the inclination.\n\n### 3. Applying the Formula to the Two Systems\n\nWe are given the following information:\n*   The stars have the same mass: Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂.\n*   The planets were \"detected\" with \"masses similar to that of Neptune.\" In the context of the RV method, this implies that their minimum masses are similar: mₚ₁ sin(i₁) ≈ mₚ₂ sin(i₂).\n\nBased on these conditions, the term `(2πG)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i) / Mₛ^(2/3))` is constant for both systems. This simplifies the relationship between the radial velocity (K) and the orbital period (P) to:\n\n*K ∝ P^(-1/3)*\n\n### 4. Calculating the Ratio of the Orbital Periods\n\nWe can establish a relationship between the two systems:\n\n*K₁ * P₁^(1/3) = K₂ * P₂^(1/3)*\n\nTo find how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1 (P₂/P₁), we can rearrange the equation:\n\n*(P₂ / P₁)^(1/3) = K₁ / K₂*\n\nNow, we solve for the ratio P₂ / P₁:\n\n*P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)³*\n\nSubstituting the ratio of the radial velocities we found in the first step:\n\n*P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364*\n\nThus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe problem has been analyzed using a Monte Carlo simulation which was then confirmed with a deterministic physical derivation. The feedback indicates this approach was correct.\n\nThe core physics is as follows:\n1.  The star's radial velocity amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the observed spectral line shift `Δλ`. Therefore, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is `K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 5 / 7`.\n2.  For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity amplitude `K` is related to the planet's orbital period `P`, the star's mass `M_star`, and the planet's mass `m_p`. The relationship is `K ∝ m_p * M_star^(-2/3) * P^(-1/3)`.\n3.  Since both stars have the same mass (`M_star1 = M_star2`) and both planets have the same mass (`m_p1 = m_p2`), the relationship simplifies to `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`.\n4.  From this proportionality, we can write the ratio `K1 / K2 = (P1)^(-1/3) / (P2)^(-1/3) = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)`.\n5.  Combining the two results, we get `Δλ1 / Δλ2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)`.\n6.  To find the ratio of the periods `P2 / P1`, we cube both sides: `P2 / P1 = (Δλ1 / Δλ2)^3`.\n7.  Plugging in the given values: `P2 / P1 = (5 / 7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644`.\n\nThis value is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n### Self-Debate and Final Answer\n\n**Proposer:** The goal is to determine the ratio of the orbital periods of two exoplanets (T₂/T₁). The provided information includes the periodic wavelength shifts (Δλ) for each star, and the fact that the stars have identical masses and the planets have similar masses.\n\nThe proposed solution path is as follows:\n1.  The periodic wavelength shift (Δλ) is caused by the Doppler effect and is directly proportional to the star's maximum radial velocity (K). Therefore, the ratio Δλ₁/Δλ₂ is equal to the ratio K₁/K₂.\n2.  The star's radial velocity amplitude (K) is a function of the star's mass (M), the planet's mass (mₚ), and the semi-major axis of the orbit (a).\n3.  By establishing the relationship between K and 'a', we can use the known ratio of K₁/K₂ to find the ratio of a₂/a₁.\n4.  Using Kepler's Third Law, which relates the orbital period (T) to the semi-major axis (a) and the stellar mass (M), we can find the desired ratio T₂/T₁.\n\n**Skeptic:** This approach has potential flaws. First, the problem states the planets have \"similar\" masses, not identical ones. How does this ambiguity affect the result? Second, the measured radial velocity depends on the inclination of the orbit (sin *i*), which is unknown for both systems. If the inclinations are different, the ratio K₁/K₂ is not simply determined by the other orbital parameters.\n\n**Resolution:**\nThe multiple-choice format of the question suggests that a definitive answer can be reached. This implies that we should treat the \"similar\" masses as equal for the calculation. Any minor differences would lead to a result that is still approximately one of the given options. The issue of the unknown inclination angles is more significant. However, for the problem to be solvable, we must assume that the inclination angles are the same for both systems (or that the effect of inclination is already accounted for in the given shift values). Without this assumption, no solution is possible. Therefore, the debate converges on the conclusion that these idealizing assumptions are intended.\n\n### Derivation\nThe amplitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is proportional to the star's radial velocity amplitude (K).\nΔλ ∝ K\n\nFor a circular orbit, the star's velocity amplitude K is given by:\nK ∝ (mₚ / √(Mₛₜₐᵣ)) * (1 / √a)\nwhere mₚ is the planet's mass, Mₛₜₐᵣ is the star's mass, and 'a' is the semi-major axis.\n\nGiven that mₚ₁ ≈ mₚ₂ and Mₛₜₐᵣ₁ = Mₛₜₐᵣ₂, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is:\nK₁ / K₂ = √a₂ / √a₁\n\nSince Δλ ∝ K, we have:\nΔλ₁ / Δλ₂ = √a₂ / √a₁\n5 / 7 = √(a₂ / a₁)\na₂ / a₁ = (5 / 7)² = 25 / 49\n\nKepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period (T) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) and inversely proportional to the mass of the star (Mₛₜₐᵣ).\nT² ∝ a³ / Mₛₜₐᵣ\n\nThe ratio of the periods is therefore:\n(T₂ / T₁)² = (a₂³ / Mₛₜₐᵣ₂) / (a₁³ / Mₛₜₐᵣ₁)\n\nSince Mₛₜₐᵣ₁ = Mₛₜₐᵣ₂, this simplifies to:\n(T₂ / T₁)² = (a₂ / a₁)³\nT₂ / T₁ = (a₂ / a₁)^(3/2)\n\nSubstituting the value for a₂/a₁:\nT₂ / T₁ = ((5 / 7)²)^(3/2)\nT₂ / T₁ = (5 / 7)³\nT₂ / T₁ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
