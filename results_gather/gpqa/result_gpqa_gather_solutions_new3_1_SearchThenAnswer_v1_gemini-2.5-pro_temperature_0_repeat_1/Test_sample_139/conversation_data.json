Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\n\nA) 25\nB) 35\nC) 29\nD) 31\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to identify Substance X and calculate the required atomic masses:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of B is very close to 277 K (4°C). This is the well-known melting point of water (H₂O) under normal conditions. Therefore, **B is water**.\n\n2.  **Identify Precipitate G:** Heating precipitate G releases water (B). This indicates that G is a hydrated compound, likely a metal hydroxide which upon heating decomposes to a metal oxide and water.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X and Gas W:**\n    *   Substance X is known to incorporate a heavier isotope and is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. This points towards common reducing agents where hydrogen is replaced by its heavier isotope, deuterium (D). Likely candidates are lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄) or sodium borodeuteride (NaBD₄).\n    *   Substance X reacts violently with a liquid Y (likely water, given the context) to release a gas W. The reaction of a deuteride with water would produce deuterium gas (D₂).\n    *   Gas W's molecules contain the same number of neutrons and protons. A deuterium atom (²H or D) contains one proton and one neutron. Therefore, a molecule of deuterium gas (D₂) contains two protons and two neutrons, fitting the description perfectly. So, **W is D₂**.\n    *   The violent reaction of LiAlD₄ with water (H₂O) produces lithium hydroxide (LiOH), aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)₃), and deuterium gas (D₂). Both LiOH and Al(OH)₃ can be considered precipitates (G), and aluminum hydroxide, when heated, releases water. This matches the clues.\n\n4.  **Confirm Substance X with the Keto Acid Reaction:**\n    *   The product of the reaction between a keto acid and substance X contains only two oxygen atoms.\n    *   Keto acids contain both a ketone (C=O) group and a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group.\n    *   Strong reducing agents like lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) and its analog LiAlD₄ reduce both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols. This would convert the keto acid (with three oxygens, R-CO-COOH) into a diol (with two oxygens, R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH), matching the clue.\n    *   Milder reducing agents like sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) and its analog NaBD₄ typically reduce ketones but not carboxylic acids. This reaction would result in a hydroxy acid (R-CH(OH)-COOH), which contains three oxygen atoms.\n    *   Therefore, the powerful reducing agent is the correct choice. **Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:**\n    *   The elements present in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D, an isotope of Hydrogen).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (present as its isotope Deuterium).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum.\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements, summing the masses of all atoms of those elements present in the molecule. We will use the mass numbers (the integer sum of protons and neutrons) for this calculation.\n    *   **Heaviest Element (Aluminum):** There is one atom of Aluminum. The only stable and naturally abundant isotope of aluminum is Aluminum-27.\n        *   Mass of Aluminum = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Lightest Element (Hydrogen/Deuterium):** There are four atoms of Deuterium. The mass number of Deuterium is 2 (1 proton + 1 neutron).\n        *   Mass of Deuterium = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Cumulative Sum:** The sum of the masses of the heaviest and lightest elements is:\n        *   27 (from Aluminum) + 8 (from Deuterium) = 35.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle and arrive at the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Clues\n\n1.  **Identifying Substance B:** The melting point of substance B is stated to be very close to 277 K.\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C).\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C). This is an extremely close match.\n    *   Therefore, **Substance B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n2.  **Identifying Substance X and its Properties:**\n    *   Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Since B is D₂O, the heavy isotope is deuterium (D).\n    *   Substance X and its close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its deuterated analog, Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄), fits this description perfectly.\n    *   The reaction of a keto acid with substance X yields a product with two oxygen atoms. LiAlH₄ is a strong reducing agent capable of reducing both the ketone and carboxylic acid functional groups of a keto acid to alcohols, resulting in a diol which contains two oxygen atoms. This supports the identification of X as a strong reducing agent like LiAlD₄.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Reaction:**\n    *   The clues describe the reaction: **X + Y → W (gas) + G (precipitate)**.\n    *   We have hypothesized that **X is LiAlD₄**. LiAlD₄ reacts violently with water and other protic compounds.\n    *   The gas **W** has an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's examine potential gas molecules:\n        *   Deuterium gas (D₂): Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits.\n        *   Helium-4 (He): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. Fits, but unlikely product.\n        *   Nitrogen-14 (¹⁴N₂): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. Fits, but unlikely product.\n    *   For D₂ gas to be produced, LiAlD₄ must react with a deuterium source. Let's assume liquid **Y is D₂O** (heavy water).\n    *   The reaction would be: **LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂**\n    *   This reaction produces **gas W = D₂**, which matches the clue.\n    *   It also produces a precipitate. Aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is a precipitate. Its deuterated analog, **aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃)**, would also be a precipitate. So, **G = Al(OD)₃**. This fits.\n\n4.  **Confirming the Final Clue:**\n    *   The final clue states that heating the precipitate G releases B.\n    *   Heating G (Al(OD)₃) would cause it to decompose. The thermal decomposition of aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)₃) yields alumina (Al₂O₃) and water (H₂O).\n    *   Therefore, heating aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃) would produce alumina (Al₂O₃) and heavy water (D₂O).\n    *   The reaction is: **2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O**\n    *   This means the released substance is D₂O, which we identified as substance B. This confirms our deductions.\n\n### Summary of Identified Substances:\n*   **Substance X:** Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄)\n*   **Liquid Y:** Heavy water (D₂O)\n*   **Gas W:** Deuterium gas (D₂)\n*   **Precipitate G:** Aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃)\n*   **Substance B:** Heavy water (D₂O)\n\n### Calculation\n\nThe final step is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄), considering that the masses of all instances of these elements must be summed.\n\n1.  **Identify elements in LiAlD₄:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D).\n2.  **Identify lightest and heaviest elements:**\n    *   Based on atomic number and mass, the lightest element is **Hydrogen**.\n    *   The heaviest element is **Aluminum**.\n3.  **Sum the masses of all atoms of these elements in the formula unit:**\n    *   **Lightest Element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains 4 atoms of the deuterium (²H or D) isotope. The mass number of deuterium is 2 (1 proton + 1 neutron).\n        *   Total mass from the lightest element = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   **Heaviest Element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains 1 atom of aluminum (²⁷Al). The mass number of the stable isotope of aluminum is 27.\n        *   Total mass from the heaviest element = 1 × 27 = 27\n4.  **Calculate the cumulative sum:**\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (Total mass of Hydrogen isotopes) + (Total mass of Aluminum isotopes)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the key substances based on the clues.**\n    *   **Clue 1 & 7:** \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\" and \"its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This points towards a common reagent where a hydrogen atom has been replaced by its heavier isotope, deuterium (D). A prime candidate is a deuterated reducing agent like Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄), whose analog is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄), or Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄), whose analog is Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄).\n\n    *   **Clue 3:** The reaction releases a gas W \"whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\" Let's analyze potential gases:\n        *   H₂ (Hydrogen): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (No)\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Yes)\n        *   ¹⁴N₂ (Nitrogen): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Possible, but less likely from this reaction type)\n        *   ¹²C¹⁶O (Carbon Monoxide): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Possible, but less likely)\n        The release of D₂ gas strongly supports that substance X contains deuterium and reacts to release it.\n\n    *   **Clue 2, 4, 5:** \"Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y... a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B... is very close to 277 K.\"\n        *   277 K is approximately 4°C. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0°C (273.15 K), but the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82°C (276.97 K). This is extremely close to 277 K. So, **B is D₂O**.\n        *   If B (D₂O) is released from heating G, then G must be a deuterated hydroxide.\n        *   Metal hydrides like LiAlH₄ react violently with water. So, X (LiAlD₄) would react violently with Y (D₂O).\n        *   The reaction is: LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂\n        *   This reaction produces D₂ gas (W), which fits our earlier deduction.\n        *   It also produces Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, which is a gelatinous precipitate. So, **G is Al(OD)₃**.\n        *   When G (Al(OD)₃) is heated, it decomposes: 2 Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O. This releases B (D₂O), fitting the clue perfectly.\n\n    *   **Clue 6:** \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n        *   A keto acid has the general structure R-C(=O)-COOH, containing 3 oxygen atoms.\n        *   LiAlH₄ (and thus LiAlD₄) is a strong reducing agent that can reduce both a ketone and a carboxylic acid. The reaction would be: R-C(=O)-COOH → R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH (a diol).\n        *   The final product, the diol, contains 2 oxygen atoms. This confirms that X must be a strong reducing agent like LiAlD₄. (A milder reagent like NaBD₄ would only reduce the ketone, leaving the carboxylic acid intact, resulting in a product with 3 oxygen atoms).\n\n2.  **Confirm the identity of Substance X.**\n    All clues consistently point to **Substance X being LiAlD₄** (Lithium Aluminum Deuteride).\n\n3.  **Perform the final calculation.**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen (present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum.\n    *   We need to find the sum of the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the molecule. We will use integer mass numbers for the calculation:\n        *   Mass number of Deuterium (²H or D) = 2\n        *   Mass number of Aluminum (²⁷Al) = 27\n    *   The formula is LiAlD₄.\n    *   Total mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen): There are 4 atoms of Deuterium. Mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Total mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is 1 atom of Aluminum. Mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Cumulative (summed) mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance B**\nThe problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n*   Convert Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n*   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n*   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n*   This strongly indicates that **Substance B is heavy water, D₂O**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the relationship between G and B**\nPrecipitate G, when heated, releases substance B (D₂O). This means that G is a deuterated hydrate, a compound that incorporates D₂O into its structure, which is released upon heating. For example, a metal deuteroxide, M(OD)ₓ, would decompose upon heating to a metal oxide and D₂O.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Gas W**\nGas W is released during the reaction of X and Y. Its molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's examine some common gases:\n*   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (p ≠ n)\n*   **D₂ (Deuterium gas):** 2 protons (1 per D atom), 2 neutrons (1 per D atom). **(p = n)**. This is a strong candidate, especially since we've already identified D₂O.\n*   N₂: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (p = n). Possible.\n*   O₂: 16 protons, 16 neutrons. (p = n). Possible.\n*   CO: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (p = n). Possible.\n*   HF: 10 protons, 10 neutrons. (p = n). Possible.\nGiven the context of deuterium, D₂ is the most likely candidate for W.\n\n**Step 4: Identify Substance X and the reaction**\n*   Substance X contains a heavier isotope. We've established this is likely deuterium (D).\n*   X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. A very common and powerful reducing agent is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄). This fits the description perfectly. Let's assume **X = LiAlD₄**.\n*   X reacts violently with liquid Y. The reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is extremely violent. It is logical to assume the reaction here is between LiAlD₄ (X) and D₂O (Y, a liquid that fits the context).\n*   Let's write the reaction: LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W).\n*   Let's check if this reaction matches the clues:\n    *   **Violent reaction:** Yes, the reaction of metal hydrides/deuterides with water/heavy water is violent.\n    *   **Gas W:** The gas produced is D₂. As determined in Step 3, D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (p=n). This fits.\n    *   **Precipitate G:** The reaction forms Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃. Aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is a gelatinous precipitate, so Al(OD)₃ would also be a precipitate. This fits.\n    *   **Heating G:** Heating Al(OD)₃ would cause decomposition: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This releases D₂O (Substance B). This fits.\n\n**Step 5: Verify with the final clue**\n*   The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X (LiAlD₄) contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\n*   A keto acid has a general structure R-C(=O)-COOH, containing one ketone group and one carboxylic acid group. It has a total of 3 oxygen atoms.\n*   LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols.\n*   R-C(=O)-COOH + LiAlD₄ (excess) → (workup) → R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH.\n*   The final product is a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups, -OH). This product contains **2 atoms of oxygen**. This clue confirms our identification of X.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the final answer**\nWe have identified **Substance X as LiAlD₄**. The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within this substance.\n\n*   **Elements in LiAlD₄:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Identify lightest and heaviest elements:**\n    *   Hydrogen (H, Z=1) is the lightest element.\n    *   Aluminum (Al, Z=13) is the heaviest element.\n    *   Lithium (Li, Z=3) is in between.\n*   **Sum the masses of these elements as they appear in the molecule:** The phrase \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed\" instructs us to count all atoms of the specified elements in the formula. We will use integer mass numbers for the calculation.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains 4 atoms of the deuterium isotope (D). The mass number of D is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains 1 atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass number of the most common isotope of Al is 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Calculate the cumulative mass:**\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (Mass from lightest element's atoms) + (Mass from heaviest element's atoms)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step deduction to identify the unknown substances, particularly Substance X.\n\n*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Identify Substance B from its physical properties.\n    2.  Deduce the nature of the reaction and other substances (G, W, Y) based on the identity of B and the reaction description.\n    3.  Use all the clues, including its use in organic chemistry, to identify Substance X.\n    4.  Once X is identified, calculate the cumulative atomic masses of its lightest and heaviest constituent elements.\n\n*   **Execution 1: Identify Substance B**\n    The problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n    277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    This melting point is characteristic of heavy water (D₂O), which melts at 3.82 °C.\n    Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n*   **Execution 2: Deduce G, W, Y and X**\n    *   Precipitate G releases B (D₂O) when heated. This is typical for a deuterated metal hydroxide, which decomposes to a metal oxide and D₂O. So, **G is a deuterated hydroxide**.\n    *   Gas W has an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's consider simple molecules. Deuterium gas (D₂) consists of two deuterium atoms (¹H₂). Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the description. So, **W is likely D₂**.\n    *   The reaction is: Substance X + Liquid Y → G (deuterated hydroxide) + W (D₂ gas).\n    *   For the products to be a deuterated hydroxide and deuterium gas, the reactants must supply the metal, the deuterium, and the oxygen. The most plausible reaction is a deuterated compound reacting with heavy water (D₂O).\n    *   Let's test the clue that X's analog is a common organic reagent. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a very common and powerful reducing agent. Its deuterated analog is **Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. This fits the description of \"incorporating a heavier isotope (D) of one of its constituent elements (H)\". Let's assume **X = LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The reaction of LiAlD₄ with heavy water (Y = D₂O) is:\n        LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂\n    *   This reaction is violent, produces a precipitate G (a mix of LiOD and Al(OD)₃), and releases gas W (D₂). This matches all the clues perfectly.\n\n*   **Execution 3: Verify with the final clue**\n    *   The reaction of a keto acid (containing both a ketone C=O and a carboxylic acid -COOH) with substance X (LiAlD₄, a strong reducing agent) is considered.\n    *   LiAlD₄ reduces both functional groups: the ketone is reduced to a secondary alcohol (-CH(OH)-) and the carboxylic acid is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    *   The resulting product is a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups). For example, pyruvic acid (CH₃COCOOH) would be reduced to propane-1,2-diol (CH₃CH(OH)CH₂OH).\n    *   This final product, the diol, contains exactly **2 atoms of oxygen**. This confirms our identification of X as LiAlD₄.\n\n*   **Execution 4: Calculate the final answer**\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The constituent elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D, an isotope of Hydrogen).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (present as Deuterium, atomic number 1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements. We will use integer masses for the calculation as is standard for this type of problem (D≈2, Al≈27).\n    *   Mass of the lightest element's atoms: There are 4 Deuterium atoms. Total mass = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass of the heaviest element's atoms: There is 1 Aluminum atom. Total mass = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Cumulative sum = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe step-by-step deduction to identify Substance X and calculate the required value is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of B is stated to be very close to 277 K. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C). This strongly indicates that substance B is heavy water.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The gas W released in the reaction has a molecule containing the same number of neutrons and protons. Deuterium gas (D₂) fits this description perfectly. A deuterium atom (D) has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n\n3.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** Substance X reacts with liquid Y to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases D₂O (Substance B). This implies that X is a deuterated compound that reacts with a deuterated liquid (Y, likely D₂O) to produce D₂ gas. The precipitate G must be a deuteroxide compound that decomposes upon heating to yield an oxide and D₂O.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Potential Candidates for Substance X:**\n    *   **Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄):** While it is a deuterated reagent used in organic chemistry, its reaction with D₂O (NaBD₄ + 4D₂O → NaOD + B(OD)₃ + 4D₂) would produce soluble products (sodium deuteroxide and boric acid/deuteroxide), not a precipitate. Therefore, NaBD₄ is not Substance X.\n    *   **Calcium Deuteride (CaD₂):** Its analog, calcium hydride (CaH₂), is used in organic chemistry as a drying agent. CaD₂ reacts with D₂O to produce D₂ gas and calcium deuteroxide (Ca(OD)₂). Calcium hydroxide is sparingly soluble in water and would form a precipitate (G). Heating Ca(OD)₂ would yield CaO and D₂O (B). This is a plausible candidate.\n    *   **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄):** Its analog, LiAlH₄, is a very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry, fitting the clue perfectly. LiAlD₄ reacts violently with water (or D₂O).

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how the clues lead to this conclusion:\n\n*   **Isotopic Composition and Reagent Type:** The substance incorporates a heavier isotope and is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, with a very close analog. This points to a deuterated reagent, with its regular hydrogen (protium) version being the common analog. LiAlD₄ fits this, with its widely used analog being Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). LiAlH₄ is a powerful reducing agent. The problem states that the reaction of a keto acid with substance X yields a product with two oxygen atoms, which is consistent with the strong reducing power of LiAlH₄ (and by extension, LiAlD₄) that can reduce both a ketone and a carboxylic acid group to alcohol groups.\n\n*   **Violent Reaction and Gaseous Product (W):** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W whose molecules contain an equal number of protons and neutrons. If Substance X is LiAlD₄ and it reacts with heavy water (D₂O) as liquid Y, the reaction produces deuterium gas (D₂). A deuterium atom has one proton and one neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has two protons and two neutrons, fitting the description of gas W. The reaction is: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂. This reaction is known to be violent, similar to the reaction of LiAlH₄ with water.\n\n*   **Precipitate (G) and Product B:** The reaction forms a precipitate G, which upon heating, releases B. In the proposed reaction, the precipitate G is aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃). Heating this compound causes it to decompose into aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) and heavy water (D₂O), which would be substance B.\n\n*   **Melting Point of B:** The melting point of B is very close to 277 K. Heavy water (D₂O) has a melting point of 3.82°C, which is 276.97 K. This is an extremely close match and strongly confirms that B is D₂O.\n\n### Calculation of Cumulative Atomic Masses\n\nHaving identified Substance X as LiAlD₄, the next step is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of its lightest and heaviest elements.\n\n1.  **Elements in LiAlD₄:** The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (present as its heavier isotope, Deuterium 'D').\n2.  **Lightest and Heaviest Elements:**\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n3.  **Summation of Masses:** The problem requires summing the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements in the molecule.\n    *   **Heaviest Element (Aluminum):** There is one atom of Aluminum. The mass number of its most stable isotope is 27.\n    *   **Lightest Element (Hydrogen):** There are four atoms of the Deuterium isotope. The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n    *   **Total Mass of Lightest Element's Isotopes:** 4 atoms × 2 amu/atom = 8 amu.\n4.  **Cumulative Atomic Mass:**\n    *   Sum = (Mass of Aluminum) + (Total mass of Deuterium atoms)\n    *   Sum = 27 + 8 = 35\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to identify Substance X and calculate the required atomic masses:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of B is stated to be very close to 277 K. Heavy water (D₂O) has a melting point of 276.97 K (3.82 °C), which fits this description perfectly.\n\n2.  **Identify Precipitate G and Gas W:** Precipitate G releases substance B (D₂O) upon heating, which suggests G is a deuterated hydroxide. The release of a gas (W) whose molecule contains an equal number of neutrons and protons points strongly to Deuterium gas (D₂). Each deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so the D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X and its Reaction:** Substance X contains a heavier isotope (deuterium) and reacts violently with liquid Y to produce D₂ gas. A well-known reagent in organic chemistry that fits this description is Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄). Its non-deuterated analog, Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄), is a very common and powerful reducing agent that reacts violently with water. The reaction that produces D₂ gas would be LiAlD₄ reacting with heavy water (D₂O), which would be liquid Y.\n    *   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n    *   This reaction is violent, produces deuterium gas (W), and forms a precipitate, Aluminium deuteroxide (G), which upon heating would yield heavy water (B).\n\n4.  **Confirm with the Keto Acid Clue:** LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent used in organic chemistry. It reduces both the ketone and carboxylic acid functional groups of a keto acid to hydroxyl groups. The resulting product, a diol, would contain two oxygen atoms, which is consistent with the clue.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:** Now we must find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements present in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope, Deuterium, D).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminium (atomic number 13).\n    *   The problem requires summing the masses of all atoms of these lightest and heaviest elements in the molecule.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 atoms of the Deuterium (²H) isotope. The mass of one deuterium atom is approximately 2 amu.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminium):** There is 1 atom of Aluminium. The stable isotope is ²⁷Al, with a mass of approximately 27 amu.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n    *   **Cumulative Mass:** 8 amu + 27 amu = 35 amu.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Gas W and Substance B**\n*   The problem states that gas W has a molecule with an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's examine some simple diatomic gases:\n    *   H₂ (¹H₂): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (p ≠ n)\n    *   D₂ (²H₂): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (p = n). This is a strong candidate. D is deuterium, a heavier isotope of hydrogen.\n    *   N₂ (¹⁴N₂): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (p = n).\n    *   O₂ (¹⁶O₂): 16 protons, 16 neutrons. (p = n).\n*   The problem states that a precipitate G, when heated, releases substance B, whose melting point is very close to 277 K.\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C.\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C.\n    *   This is a very close match. Therefore, substance **B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n*   Since B is D₂O, it strongly supports the idea that deuterium is involved. This makes **W = D₂ (deuterium gas)** the most likely candidate for the gas.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Substance X, Liquid Y, and Precipitate G**\n*   Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. We've established this is likely deuterium (D).\n*   X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate G. Heating G produces D₂O.\n*   For G to produce D₂O upon heating, it must be a deuterated hydroxide that dehydrates. A common example is Al(OH)₃ decomposing to Al₂O₃ and H₂O. The deuterated analog, Al(OD)₃, would decompose to Al₂O₃ and D₂O. So, **G is likely Al(OD)₃**, which is a precipitate.\n*   The reaction is: X + Y → D₂(g) + Al(OD)₃(s) + other products.\n*   To produce D₂ and Al(OD)₃, a logical choice for X is a powerful deuteride reducing agent, and for Y is a source of deuterium atoms, like D₂O.\n*   Let's test **X = LiAlD₄ (Lithium Aluminium Deuteride)** and **Y = D₂O (heavy water)**.\n    *   The reaction is: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD (soluble) + Al(OD)₃ (precipitate) + 4D₂ (gas).\n    *   This reaction is known to be violent.\n    *   It produces gas W = D₂ (p=n).\n    *   It forms precipitate G = Al(OD)₃.\n    *   Heating G (2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O) releases B = D₂O.\n    *   This set of substances fits all the clues perfectly.\n\n**Step 3: Verify with the remaining clues**\n*   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    *   A keto acid contains both a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). It has at least 3 oxygen atoms.\n    *   Substance X (LiAlD₄) is a strong reducing agent. It reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols.\n    *   R-C(=O)-R'-COOH --(1. LiAlD₄ / 2. Workup)--> R-CH(OH)-R'-CH₂(OH).\n    *   The product is a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups), which contains exactly 2 oxygen atoms. This clue is satisfied.\n*   \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"\n    *   The very close analog of X (LiAlD₄) is LiAlH₄ (Lithium Aluminium Hydride).\n    *   LiAlH₄ is one of the most common and powerful reducing agents used in organic synthesis. This clue is also satisfied.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final answer**\n*   We have confidently identified Substance **X as LiAlD₄**.\n*   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X. We must also consider the clause: \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n*   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (H, as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   Based on atomic number (Z), the lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1) and the heaviest is Aluminium (Z=13).\n*   We need to sum the masses of all atoms of the lightest element and all atoms of the heaviest element in the formula LiAlD₄. We will use integer mass numbers for the calculation as the options are integers.\n    *   **Lightest Element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 atoms of hydrogen, present as the isotope Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of D is 2.\n        *   Total mass of the lightest element = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Heaviest Element (Aluminium):** There is 1 atom of Aluminium. The most stable and common isotope is ²⁷Al. The mass number is 27.\n        *   Total mass of the heaviest element = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Cumulative Atomic Mass** = (Total mass of lightest element's atoms) + (Total mass of heaviest element's atoms)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThe evidence confirms the initial deductions. Here is a step-by-step derivation of the final answer based on the clues and the search results.\n\n*   **Identification of Substance X and related compounds:**\n    *   **Clue:** Substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry, particularly for reactions involving keto acids.\n    *   **Inference:** This points to a reducing agent. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a powerful reducing agent used to reduce carboxylic acids and ketones. Its deuterated analog is Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n    *   **Clue:** Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements.\n    *   **Inference:** LiAlD₄ contains deuterium (D or ²H), a heavier isotope of hydrogen. This fits the description, making **Substance X = LiAlD₄**. Its common analog is LiAlH₄.\n    *   **Clue:** The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\n    *   **Inference:** LiAlD₄ reduces both the ketone and carboxylic acid groups of a keto acid to alcohols. The resulting product is a diol, which contains two oxygen atoms. This is consistent with the properties of LiAlH₄ and by extension, LiAlD₄.\n\n*   **Identification of the reaction components (Y, W, G, B):**\n    *   **Clue:** Substance X (LiAlD₄) reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W.\n    *   **Inference:** LiAlD₄ reacts violently with water. If liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O), the reaction would be: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂.\n    *   **Clue:** Gas W's molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\n    *   **Inference:** The gas produced in the proposed reaction is D₂ (deuterium gas). A deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fitting the description. This confirms **Gas W = D₂** and **Liquid Y = D₂O**.\n    *   **Clue:** A precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B.\n    *   **Inference:** In the reaction products (LiOD and Al(OD)₃), aluminum hydroxide is a known precipitate, so Al(OD)₃ is the precipitate G. Heating aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)₃) yields alumina (Al₂O₃) and water (H₂O). Therefore, heating G (Al(OD)₃) will release B (D₂O).\n    *   **Clue:** The melting point of B is very close to 277 K.\n    *   **Inference:** The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C, which is 276.97 K. This is indeed very close to 277 K, confirming that **B = D₂O**.\n\n*   **Calculation of Cumulative Atomic Masses:**\n    *   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n    *   **Constituent Elements:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (Atomic Number 1).\n    *   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (Atomic Number 13).\n    *   **Isotopes present in LiAlD₄:**\n        *   For Hydrogen: Four atoms of the heavier isotope, Deuterium (D). The mass number of Deuterium is 2 (1 proton, 1 neutron).\n        *   For Aluminum: One atom. The only naturally occurring stable isotope is ²⁷Al (13 protons, 14 neutrons).\n        *   For Lithium: One atom. Naturally occurring lithium is a mix of ⁶Li and ⁷Li. We will use the most common isotope, ⁷Li, for identification, but it is not needed for the final calculation.\n    *   **The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present.** This means summing the masses of all aluminum atoms and all deuterium atoms in the molecule.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 atoms of Deuterium (D). Using the mass number, the total mass is 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is 1 atom of Aluminum (²⁷Al). The mass number is 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Atomic Mass:** 8 (from Deuterium) + 27 (from Aluminum) = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to identify Substance X and calculate the required value.\n\n1.  **Identifying Substance B**: The melting point of substance B is given as very close to 277 K. In Celsius, this is 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C. This value is the well-known melting point of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide, D₂O).\n\n2.  **Identifying Gas W**: The gas W, released during the reaction, has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's consider some simple gaseous molecules:\n    *   Hydrogen (H₂): 2 protons, 0 neutrons.\n    *   Deuterium (D₂): 2 protons (1 per D atom), 2 neutrons (1 per D atom). This is a perfect match.\n    *   Nitrogen (¹⁴N₂): 14 protons, 14 neutrons.\n    *   Carbon Monoxide (¹²C¹⁶O): 14 protons, 14 neutrons.\n    Given that heavy water is involved, D₂ is the most logical identity for gas W.\n\n3.  **Identifying the Reaction**: A violent reaction involving a deuterated substance (as implied by the presence of D₂O and D₂) that produces D₂ gas suggests the reaction of a strong deuterated reducing agent with heavy water. A very common class of reagents in organic chemistry are metal hydrides. The problem states an analog of substance X is a common reagent. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a powerful and widely used reducing agent. Its deuterated analog is Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n\n4.  **Confirming Substance X and the Reaction**: Let's assume Substance X is LiAlD₄ and liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O).\n    *   **Reaction**: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂\n    *   This reaction produces deuterium gas (W = D₂), which matches our deduction.\n    *   It forms a precipitate, aluminum deuteroxide (G = Al(OD)₃). Lithium deuteroxide is soluble.\n    *   Heating the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) would cause decomposition: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This releases heavy water (B = D₂O), which also matches our initial finding.\n    *   The reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is known to be violent, so the reaction of LiAlD₄ with D₂O would be as well.\n\n5.  **Verifying with the Keto Acid Clue**: The final clue states that the reaction of a keto acid with substance X yields a product with two oxygen atoms. A keto acid contains both a ketone and a carboxylic acid functional group. LiAlD₄ (like its analog LiAlH₄) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce both of these groups to alcohols.\n    *   R-C(=O)-COOH + LiAlD₄ → R-CD(OH)-CD₂(OH)\n    *   The resulting product is a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups), which contains exactly two oxygen atoms. This confirms that **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Cumulative Atomic Masses**: The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within LiAlD₄, summing the masses of all atoms for each of those two elements.\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n    *   Their atomic numbers are Li (3), Al (13), and H (1).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum.\n    *   The molecule contains four atoms of the hydrogen isotope Deuterium (D or ²H).

This is the well-known melting point of water (H₂O) under normal conditions. Therefore, **B is water**.\n\n2.  **Identify Precipitate G:** Heating precipitate G releases water (B). This indicates that G is a hydrated compound, likely a metal hydroxide which upon heating decomposes to a metal oxide and water.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X and Gas W:**\n    *   Substance X is known to incorporate a heavier isotope and is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. This points towards common reducing agents where hydrogen is replaced by its heavier isotope, deuterium (D). Likely candidates are lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄) or sodium borodeuteride (NaBD₄).\n    *   Substance X reacts violently with a liquid Y (likely water, given the context) to release a gas W. The reaction of a deuteride with water would produce deuterium gas (D₂).\n    *   Gas W's molecules contain the same number of neutrons and protons. A deuterium atom (²H or D) contains one proton and one neutron. Therefore, a molecule of deuterium gas (D₂) contains two protons and two neutrons, fitting the description perfectly. So, **W is D₂**.\n    *   The violent reaction of LiAlD₄ with water (H₂O) produces lithium hydroxide (LiOH), aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)₃), and deuterium gas (D₂). Both LiOH and Al(OH)₃ can be considered precipitates (G), and aluminum hydroxide, when heated, releases water. This matches the clues.\n\n4.  **Confirm Substance X with the Keto Acid Reaction:**\n    *   The product of the reaction between a keto acid and substance X contains only two oxygen atoms.\n    *   Keto acids contain both a ketone (C=O) group and a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group.\n    *   Strong reducing agents like lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) and its analog LiAlD₄ reduce both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols. This would convert the keto acid (with three oxygens, R-CO-COOH) into a diol (with two oxygens, R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH), matching the clue.\n    *   Milder reducing agents like sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) and its analog NaBD₄ typically reduce ketones but not carboxylic acids. This reaction would result in a hydroxy acid (R-CH(OH)-COOH), which contains three oxygen atoms.\n    *   Therefore, the powerful reducing agent is the correct choice. **Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:**\n    *   The elements present in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D, an isotope of Hydrogen).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (present as its isotope Deuterium).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum.\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements, summing the masses of all atoms of those elements present in the molecule. We will use the mass numbers (the integer sum of protons and neutrons) for this calculation.\n    *   **Heaviest Element (Aluminum):** There is one atom of Aluminum. The only stable and naturally abundant isotope of aluminum is Aluminum-27.\n        *   Mass of Aluminum = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Lightest Element (Hydrogen/Deuterium):** There are four atoms of Deuterium. The mass number of Deuterium is 2 (1 proton + 1 neutron).\n        *   Mass of Deuterium = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Cumulative Sum:** The sum of the masses of the heaviest and lightest elements is:\n        *   27 (from Aluminum) + 8 (from Deuterium) = 35.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle and arrive at the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Clues\n\n1.  **Identifying Substance B:** The melting point of substance B is stated to be very close to 277 K.\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C).\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C). This is an extremely close match.\n    *   Therefore, **Substance B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n2.  **Identifying Substance X and its Properties:**\n    *   Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Since B is D₂O, the heavy isotope is deuterium (D).\n    *   Substance X and its close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its deuterated analog, Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄), fits this description perfectly.\n    *   The reaction of a keto acid with substance X yields a product with two oxygen atoms. LiAlH₄ is a strong reducing agent capable of reducing both the ketone and carboxylic acid functional groups of a keto acid to alcohols, resulting in a diol which contains two oxygen atoms. This supports the identification of X as a strong reducing agent like LiAlD₄.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Reaction:**\n    *   The clues describe the reaction: **X + Y → W (gas) + G (precipitate)**.\n    *   We have hypothesized that **X is LiAlD₄**. LiAlD₄ reacts violently with water and other protic compounds.\n    *   The gas **W** has an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's examine potential gas molecules:\n        *   Deuterium gas (D₂): Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits.\n        *   Helium-4 (He): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. Fits, but unlikely product.\n        *   Nitrogen-14 (¹⁴N₂): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. Fits, but unlikely product.\n    *   For D₂ gas to be produced, LiAlD₄ must react with a deuterium source. Let's assume liquid **Y is D₂O** (heavy water).\n    *   The reaction would be: **LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂**\n    *   This reaction produces **gas W = D₂**, which matches the clue.\n    *   It also produces a precipitate. Aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is a precipitate. Its deuterated analog, **aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃)**, would also be a precipitate. So, **G = Al(OD)₃**. This fits.\n\n4.  **Confirming the Final Clue:**\n    *   The final clue states that heating the precipitate G releases B.\n    *   Heating G (Al(OD)₃) would cause it to decompose. The thermal decomposition of aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)₃) yields alumina (Al₂O₃) and water (H₂O).\n    *   Therefore, heating aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃) would produce alumina (Al₂O₃) and heavy water (D₂O).\n    *   The reaction is: **2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O**\n    *   This means the released substance is D₂O, which we identified as substance B. This confirms our deductions.\n\n### Summary of Identified Substances:\n*   **Substance X:** Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄)\n*   **Liquid Y:** Heavy water (D₂O)\n*   **Gas W:** Deuterium gas (D₂)\n*   **Precipitate G:** Aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃)\n*   **Substance B:** Heavy water (D₂O)\n\n### Calculation\n\nThe final step is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄), considering that the masses of all instances of these elements must be summed.\n\n1.  **Identify elements in LiAlD₄:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D).\n2.  **Identify lightest and heaviest elements:**\n    *   Based on atomic number and mass, the lightest element is **Hydrogen**.\n    *   The heaviest element is **Aluminum**.\n3.  **Sum the masses of all atoms of these elements in the formula unit:**\n    *   **Lightest Element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains 4 atoms of the deuterium (²H or D) isotope. The mass number of deuterium is 2 (1 proton + 1 neutron).\n        *   Total mass from the lightest element = 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   **Heaviest Element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains 1 atom of aluminum (²⁷Al). The mass number of the stable isotope of aluminum is 27.\n        *   Total mass from the heaviest element = 1 × 27 = 27\n4.  **Calculate the cumulative sum:**\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (Total mass of Hydrogen isotopes) + (Total mass of Aluminum isotopes)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the key substances based on the clues.**\n    *   **Clue 1 & 7:** \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\" and \"its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This points towards a common reagent where a hydrogen atom has been replaced by its heavier isotope, deuterium (D). A prime candidate is a deuterated reducing agent like Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄), whose analog is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄), or Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄), whose analog is Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄).\n\n    *   **Clue 3:** The reaction releases a gas W \"whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\" Let's analyze potential gases:\n        *   H₂ (Hydrogen): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (No)\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Yes)\n        *   ¹⁴N₂ (Nitrogen): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Possible, but less likely from this reaction type)\n        *   ¹²C¹⁶O (Carbon Monoxide): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Possible, but less likely)\n        The release of D₂ gas strongly supports that substance X contains deuterium and reacts to release it.\n\n    *   **Clue 2, 4, 5:** \"Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y... a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B... is very close to 277 K.\"\n        *   277 K is approximately 4°C. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0°C (273.15 K), but the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82°C (276.97 K). This is extremely close to 277 K. So, **B is D₂O**.\n        *   If B (D₂O) is released from heating G, then G must be a deuterated hydroxide.\n        *   Metal hydrides like LiAlH₄ react violently with water. So, X (LiAlD₄) would react violently with Y (D₂O).\n        *   The reaction is: LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂\n        *   This reaction produces D₂ gas (W), which fits our earlier deduction.\n        *   It also produces Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, which is a gelatinous precipitate. So, **G is Al(OD)₃**.\n        *   When G (Al(OD)₃) is heated, it decomposes: 2 Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O. This releases B (D₂O), fitting the clue perfectly.\n\n    *   **Clue 6:** \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n        *   A keto acid has the general structure R-C(=O)-COOH, containing 3 oxygen atoms.\n        *   LiAlH₄ (and thus LiAlD₄) is a strong reducing agent that can reduce both a ketone and a carboxylic acid. The reaction would be: R-C(=O)-COOH → R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH (a diol).\n        *   The final product, the diol, contains 2 oxygen atoms. This confirms that X must be a strong reducing agent like LiAlD₄. (A milder reagent like NaBD₄ would only reduce the ketone, leaving the carboxylic acid intact, resulting in a product with 3 oxygen atoms).\n\n2.  **Confirm the identity of Substance X.**\n    All clues consistently point to **Substance X being LiAlD₄** (Lithium Aluminum Deuteride).\n\n3.  **Perform the final calculation.**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen (present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum.\n    *   We need to find the sum of the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the molecule. We will use integer mass numbers for the calculation:\n        *   Mass number of Deuterium (²H or D) = 2\n        *   Mass number of Aluminum (²⁷Al) = 27\n    *   The formula is LiAlD₄.\n    *   Total mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen): There are 4 atoms of Deuterium. Mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Total mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is 1 atom of Aluminum. Mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Cumulative (summed) mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance B**\nThe problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n*   Convert Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n*   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n*   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n*   This strongly indicates that **Substance B is heavy water, D₂O**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the relationship between G and B**\nPrecipitate G, when heated, releases substance B (D₂O). This means that G is a deuterated hydrate, a compound that incorporates D₂O into its structure, which is released upon heating. For example, a metal deuteroxide, M(OD)ₓ, would decompose upon heating to a metal oxide and D₂O.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Gas W**\nGas W is released during the reaction of X and Y. Its molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's examine some common gases:\n*   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (p ≠ n)\n*   **D₂ (Deuterium gas):** 2 protons (1 per D atom), 2 neutrons (1 per D atom). **(p = n)**. This is a strong candidate, especially since we've already identified D₂O.\n*   N₂: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (p = n). Possible.\n*   O₂: 16 protons, 16 neutrons. (p = n). Possible.\n*   CO: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (p = n). Possible.\n*   HF: 10 protons, 10 neutrons. (p = n). Possible.\nGiven the context of deuterium, D₂ is the most likely candidate for W.\n\n**Step 4: Identify Substance X and the reaction**\n*   Substance X contains a heavier isotope. We've established this is likely deuterium (D).\n*   X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. A very common and powerful reducing agent is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄). This fits the description perfectly. Let's assume **X = LiAlD₄**.\n*   X reacts violently with liquid Y. The reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is extremely violent. It is logical to assume the reaction here is between LiAlD₄ (X) and D₂O (Y, a liquid that fits the context).\n*   Let's write the reaction: LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W).\n*   Let's check if this reaction matches the clues:\n    *   **Violent reaction:** Yes, the reaction of metal hydrides/deuterides with water/heavy water is violent.\n    *   **Gas W:** The gas produced is D₂. As determined in Step 3, D₂ has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (p=n). This fits.\n    *   **Precipitate G:** The reaction forms Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃. Aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is a gelatinous precipitate, so Al(OD)₃ would also be a precipitate. This fits.\n    *   **Heating G:** Heating Al(OD)₃ would cause decomposition: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This releases D₂O (Substance B). This fits.\n\n**Step 5: Verify with the final clue**\n*   The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X (LiAlD₄) contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\n*   A keto acid has a general structure R-C(=O)-COOH, containing one ketone group and one carboxylic acid group. It has a total of 3 oxygen atoms.\n*   LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent that reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols.\n*   R-C(=O)-COOH + LiAlD₄ (excess) → (workup) → R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH.\n*   The final product is a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups, -OH). This product contains **2 atoms of oxygen**. This clue confirms our identification of X.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the final answer**\nWe have identified **Substance X as LiAlD₄**. The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within this substance.\n\n*   **Elements in LiAlD₄:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Identify lightest and heaviest elements:**\n    *   Hydrogen (H, Z=1) is the lightest element.\n    *   Aluminum (Al, Z=13) is the heaviest element.\n    *   Lithium (Li, Z=3) is in between.\n*   **Sum the masses of these elements as they appear in the molecule:** The phrase \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed\" instructs us to count all atoms of the specified elements in the formula. We will use integer mass numbers for the calculation.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains 4 atoms of the deuterium isotope (D). The mass number of D is 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** The molecule contains 1 atom of Aluminum (Al). The mass number of the most common isotope of Al is 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Calculate the cumulative mass:**\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (Mass from lightest element's atoms) + (Mass from heaviest element's atoms)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step deduction to identify the unknown substances, particularly Substance X.\n\n*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Identify Substance B from its physical properties.\n    2.  Deduce the nature of the reaction and other substances (G, W, Y) based on the identity of B and the reaction description.\n    3.  Use all the clues, including its use in organic chemistry, to identify Substance X.\n    4.  Once X is identified, calculate the cumulative atomic masses of its lightest and heaviest constituent elements.\n\n*   **Execution 1: Identify Substance B**\n    The problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n    277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    This melting point is characteristic of heavy water (D₂O), which melts at 3.82 °C.\n    Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n*   **Execution 2: Deduce G, W, Y and X**\n    *   Precipitate G releases B (D₂O) when heated. This is typical for a deuterated metal hydroxide, which decomposes to a metal oxide and D₂O. So, **G is a deuterated hydroxide**.\n    *   Gas W has an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's consider simple molecules. Deuterium gas (D₂) consists of two deuterium atoms (¹H₂). Each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the description. So, **W is likely D₂**.\n    *   The reaction is: Substance X + Liquid Y → G (deuterated hydroxide) + W (D₂ gas).\n    *   For the products to be a deuterated hydroxide and deuterium gas, the reactants must supply the metal, the deuterium, and the oxygen. The most plausible reaction is a deuterated compound reacting with heavy water (D₂O).\n    *   Let's test the clue that X's analog is a common organic reagent. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a very common and powerful reducing agent. Its deuterated analog is **Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. This fits the description of \"incorporating a heavier isotope (D) of one of its constituent elements (H)\". Let's assume **X = LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The reaction of LiAlD₄ with heavy water (Y = D₂O) is:\n        LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂\n    *   This reaction is violent, produces a precipitate G (a mix of LiOD and Al(OD)₃), and releases gas W (D₂). This matches all the clues perfectly.\n\n*   **Execution 3: Verify with the final clue**\n    *   The reaction of a keto acid (containing both a ketone C=O and a carboxylic acid -COOH) with substance X (LiAlD₄, a strong reducing agent) is considered.\n    *   LiAlD₄ reduces both functional groups: the ketone is reduced to a secondary alcohol (-CH(OH)-) and the carboxylic acid is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    *   The resulting product is a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups). For example, pyruvic acid (CH₃COCOOH) would be reduced to propane-1,2-diol (CH₃CH(OH)CH₂OH).\n    *   This final product, the diol, contains exactly **2 atoms of oxygen**. This confirms our identification of X as LiAlD₄.\n\n*   **Execution 4: Calculate the final answer**\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The constituent elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D, an isotope of Hydrogen).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (present as Deuterium, atomic number 1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements. We will use integer masses for the calculation as is standard for this type of problem (D≈2, Al≈27).\n    *   Mass of the lightest element's atoms: There are 4 Deuterium atoms. Total mass = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Mass of the heaviest element's atoms: There is 1 Aluminum atom. Total mass = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Cumulative sum = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe step-by-step deduction to identify Substance X and calculate the required value is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of B is stated to be very close to 277 K. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C). This strongly indicates that substance B is heavy water.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The gas W released in the reaction has a molecule containing the same number of neutrons and protons. Deuterium gas (D₂) fits this description perfectly. A deuterium atom (D) has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n\n3.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** Substance X reacts with liquid Y to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases D₂O (Substance B). This implies that X is a deuterated compound that reacts with a deuterated liquid (Y, likely D₂O) to produce D₂ gas. The precipitate G must be a deuteroxide compound that decomposes upon heating to yield an oxide and D₂O.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Potential Candidates for Substance X:**\n    *   **Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄):** While it is a deuterated reagent used in organic chemistry, its reaction with D₂O (NaBD₄ + 4D₂O → NaOD + B(OD)₃ + 4D₂) would produce soluble products (sodium deuteroxide and boric acid/deuteroxide), not a precipitate. Therefore, NaBD₄ is not Substance X.\n    *   **Calcium Deuteride (CaD₂):** Its analog, calcium hydride (CaH₂), is used in organic chemistry as a drying agent. CaD₂ reacts with D₂O to produce D₂ gas and calcium deuteroxide (Ca(OD)₂). Calcium hydroxide is sparingly soluble in water and would form a precipitate (G). Heating Ca(OD)₂ would yield CaO and D₂O (B). This is a plausible candidate.\n    *   **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄):** Its analog, LiAlH₄, is a very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry, fitting the clue perfectly. LiAlD₄ reacts violently with water (or D₂O). The reaction with D₂O is: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD(aq) + Al(OD)₃(s) + 4D₂(g).\n        *   This reaction produces D₂ gas (W).\n        *   It forms a precipitate, aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃), as aluminum hydroxide is insoluble in water (G).\n        *   Heating aluminum deuteroxide (G) causes it to decompose, releasing heavy water (B).\n        *   LiAlD₄ is a classic reagent for reducing keto acids.\n    *   Comparing CaD₂ and LiAlD₄, the latter (and its analog LiAlH₄) is far more prominent as a reactive reagent for transformations like reducing keto acids, making it the stronger candidate.\n\n5.  **Confirm Substance X:** Based on the evidence, Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n\n6.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:** The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within LiAlD₄.\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D), which is an isotope of Hydrogen (H).\n    *   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen.\n    *   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum.\n    *   The formula contains one atom of the heaviest element (Al) and four atoms of the lightest element's isotope (D).\n    *   The calculation requires summing the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the formula.\n    *   Using the mass numbers of the most common isotopes:\n        *   Mass of one Aluminum (Al) atom ≈ 27.\n        *   Mass of one Deuterium (D) atom ≈ 2.\n        *   Total mass = (1 × Mass of Al) + (4 × Mass of D)\n        *   Total mass = (1 × 27) + (4 × 2) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\n### Deciphering the Chemical Puzzle\n\nBased on the provided clues, the mysterious **Substance X** is identified as **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how the clues lead to this conclusion:\n\n*   **Isotopic Composition and Reagent Type:** The substance incorporates a heavier isotope and is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, with a very close analog. This points to a deuterated reagent, with its regular hydrogen (protium) version being the common analog. LiAlD₄ fits this, with its widely used analog being Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). LiAlH₄ is a powerful reducing agent. The problem states that the reaction of a keto acid with substance X yields a product with two oxygen atoms, which is consistent with the strong reducing power of LiAlH₄ (and by extension, LiAlD₄) that can reduce both a ketone and a carboxylic acid group to alcohol groups.\n\n*   **Violent Reaction and Gaseous Product (W):** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W whose molecules contain an equal number of protons and neutrons. If Substance X is LiAlD₄ and it reacts with heavy water (D₂O) as liquid Y, the reaction produces deuterium gas (D₂). A deuterium atom has one proton and one neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has two protons and two neutrons, fitting the description of gas W. The reaction is: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂. This reaction is known to be violent, similar to the reaction of LiAlH₄ with water.\n\n*   **Precipitate (G) and Product B:** The reaction forms a precipitate G, which upon heating, releases B. In the proposed reaction, the precipitate G is aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃). Heating this compound causes it to decompose into aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) and heavy water (D₂O), which would be substance B.\n\n*   **Melting Point of B:** The melting point of B is very close to 277 K. Heavy water (D₂O) has a melting point of 3.82°C, which is 276.97 K. This is an extremely close match and strongly confirms that B is D₂O.\n\n### Calculation of Cumulative Atomic Masses\n\nHaving identified Substance X as LiAlD₄, the next step is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of its lightest and heaviest elements.\n\n1.  **Elements in LiAlD₄:** The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (present as its heavier isotope, Deuterium 'D').\n2.  **Lightest and Heaviest Elements:**\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n3.  **Summation of Masses:** The problem requires summing the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements in the molecule.\n    *   **Heaviest Element (Aluminum):** There is one atom of Aluminum. The mass number of its most stable isotope is 27.\n    *   **Lightest Element (Hydrogen):** There are four atoms of the Deuterium isotope. The mass number of Deuterium is 2.\n    *   **Total Mass of Lightest Element's Isotopes:** 4 atoms × 2 amu/atom = 8 amu.\n4.  **Cumulative Atomic Mass:**\n    *   Sum = (Mass of Aluminum) + (Total mass of Deuterium atoms)\n    *   Sum = 27 + 8 = 35\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to identify Substance X and calculate the required atomic masses:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of B is stated to be very close to 277 K. Heavy water (D₂O) has a melting point of 276.97 K (3.82 °C), which fits this description perfectly.\n\n2.  **Identify Precipitate G and Gas W:** Precipitate G releases substance B (D₂O) upon heating, which suggests G is a deuterated hydroxide. The release of a gas (W) whose molecule contains an equal number of neutrons and protons points strongly to Deuterium gas (D₂). Each deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so the D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X and its Reaction:** Substance X contains a heavier isotope (deuterium) and reacts violently with liquid Y to produce D₂ gas. A well-known reagent in organic chemistry that fits this description is Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄). Its non-deuterated analog, Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄), is a very common and powerful reducing agent that reacts violently with water. The reaction that produces D₂ gas would be LiAlD₄ reacting with heavy water (D₂O), which would be liquid Y.\n    *   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G) + 4D₂ (W)\n    *   This reaction is violent, produces deuterium gas (W), and forms a precipitate, Aluminium deuteroxide (G), which upon heating would yield heavy water (B).\n\n4.  **Confirm with the Keto Acid Clue:** LiAlD₄ is a strong reducing agent used in organic chemistry. It reduces both the ketone and carboxylic acid functional groups of a keto acid to hydroxyl groups. The resulting product, a diol, would contain two oxygen atoms, which is consistent with the clue.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:** Now we must find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements present in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope, Deuterium, D).\n    *   The lightest element is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminium (atomic number 13).\n    *   The problem requires summing the masses of all atoms of these lightest and heaviest elements in the molecule.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 atoms of the Deuterium (²H) isotope. The mass of one deuterium atom is approximately 2 amu.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminium):** There is 1 atom of Aluminium. The stable isotope is ²⁷Al, with a mass of approximately 27 amu.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n    *   **Cumulative Mass:** 8 amu + 27 amu = 35 amu.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Gas W and Substance B**\n*   The problem states that gas W has a molecule with an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's examine some simple diatomic gases:\n    *   H₂ (¹H₂): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (p ≠ n)\n    *   D₂ (²H₂): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (p = n). This is a strong candidate. D is deuterium, a heavier isotope of hydrogen.\n    *   N₂ (¹⁴N₂): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (p = n).\n    *   O₂ (¹⁶O₂): 16 protons, 16 neutrons. (p = n).\n*   The problem states that a precipitate G, when heated, releases substance B, whose melting point is very close to 277 K.\n    *   277 K is equivalent to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C.\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C.\n    *   This is a very close match. Therefore, substance **B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n*   Since B is D₂O, it strongly supports the idea that deuterium is involved. This makes **W = D₂ (deuterium gas)** the most likely candidate for the gas.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Substance X, Liquid Y, and Precipitate G**\n*   Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. We've established this is likely deuterium (D).\n*   X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate G. Heating G produces D₂O.\n*   For G to produce D₂O upon heating, it must be a deuterated hydroxide that dehydrates. A common example is Al(OH)₃ decomposing to Al₂O₃ and H₂O. The deuterated analog, Al(OD)₃, would decompose to Al₂O₃ and D₂O. So, **G is likely Al(OD)₃**, which is a precipitate.\n*   The reaction is: X + Y → D₂(g) + Al(OD)₃(s) + other products.\n*   To produce D₂ and Al(OD)₃, a logical choice for X is a powerful deuteride reducing agent, and for Y is a source of deuterium atoms, like D₂O.\n*   Let's test **X = LiAlD₄ (Lithium Aluminium Deuteride)** and **Y = D₂O (heavy water)**.\n    *   The reaction is: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD (soluble) + Al(OD)₃ (precipitate) + 4D₂ (gas).\n    *   This reaction is known to be violent.\n    *   It produces gas W = D₂ (p=n).\n    *   It forms precipitate G = Al(OD)₃.\n    *   Heating G (2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O) releases B = D₂O.\n    *   This set of substances fits all the clues perfectly.\n\n**Step 3: Verify with the remaining clues**\n*   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n    *   A keto acid contains both a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). It has at least 3 oxygen atoms.\n    *   Substance X (LiAlD₄) is a strong reducing agent. It reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols.\n    *   R-C(=O)-R'-COOH --(1. LiAlD₄ / 2. Workup)--> R-CH(OH)-R'-CH₂(OH).\n    *   The product is a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups), which contains exactly 2 oxygen atoms. This clue is satisfied.\n*   \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"\n    *   The very close analog of X (LiAlD₄) is LiAlH₄ (Lithium Aluminium Hydride).\n    *   LiAlH₄ is one of the most common and powerful reducing agents used in organic synthesis. This clue is also satisfied.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final answer**\n*   We have confidently identified Substance **X as LiAlD₄**.\n*   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X. We must also consider the clause: \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n*   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (H, as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   Based on atomic number (Z), the lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1) and the heaviest is Aluminium (Z=13).\n*   We need to sum the masses of all atoms of the lightest element and all atoms of the heaviest element in the formula LiAlD₄. We will use integer mass numbers for the calculation as the options are integers.\n    *   **Lightest Element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 atoms of hydrogen, present as the isotope Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of D is 2.\n        *   Total mass of the lightest element = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Heaviest Element (Aluminium):** There is 1 atom of Aluminium. The most stable and common isotope is ²⁷Al. The mass number is 27.\n        *   Total mass of the heaviest element = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n*   **Cumulative Atomic Mass** = (Total mass of lightest element's atoms) + (Total mass of heaviest element's atoms)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThe evidence confirms the initial deductions. Here is a step-by-step derivation of the final answer based on the clues and the search results.\n\n*   **Identification of Substance X and related compounds:**\n    *   **Clue:** Substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry, particularly for reactions involving keto acids.\n    *   **Inference:** This points to a reducing agent. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a powerful reducing agent used to reduce carboxylic acids and ketones. Its deuterated analog is Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n    *   **Clue:** Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements.\n    *   **Inference:** LiAlD₄ contains deuterium (D or ²H), a heavier isotope of hydrogen. This fits the description, making **Substance X = LiAlD₄**. Its common analog is LiAlH₄.\n    *   **Clue:** The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\n    *   **Inference:** LiAlD₄ reduces both the ketone and carboxylic acid groups of a keto acid to alcohols. The resulting product is a diol, which contains two oxygen atoms. This is consistent with the properties of LiAlH₄ and by extension, LiAlD₄.\n\n*   **Identification of the reaction components (Y, W, G, B):**\n    *   **Clue:** Substance X (LiAlD₄) reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W.\n    *   **Inference:** LiAlD₄ reacts violently with water. If liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O), the reaction would be: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂.\n    *   **Clue:** Gas W's molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\n    *   **Inference:** The gas produced in the proposed reaction is D₂ (deuterium gas). A deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fitting the description. This confirms **Gas W = D₂** and **Liquid Y = D₂O**.\n    *   **Clue:** A precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B.\n    *   **Inference:** In the reaction products (LiOD and Al(OD)₃), aluminum hydroxide is a known precipitate, so Al(OD)₃ is the precipitate G. Heating aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)₃) yields alumina (Al₂O₃) and water (H₂O). Therefore, heating G (Al(OD)₃) will release B (D₂O).\n    *   **Clue:** The melting point of B is very close to 277 K.\n    *   **Inference:** The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C, which is 276.97 K. This is indeed very close to 277 K, confirming that **B = D₂O**.\n\n*   **Calculation of Cumulative Atomic Masses:**\n    *   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n    *   **Constituent Elements:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (Atomic Number 1).\n    *   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (Atomic Number 13).\n    *   **Isotopes present in LiAlD₄:**\n        *   For Hydrogen: Four atoms of the heavier isotope, Deuterium (D). The mass number of Deuterium is 2 (1 proton, 1 neutron).\n        *   For Aluminum: One atom. The only naturally occurring stable isotope is ²⁷Al (13 protons, 14 neutrons).\n        *   For Lithium: One atom. Naturally occurring lithium is a mix of ⁶Li and ⁷Li. We will use the most common isotope, ⁷Li, for identification, but it is not needed for the final calculation.\n    *   **The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present.** This means summing the masses of all aluminum atoms and all deuterium atoms in the molecule.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 atoms of Deuterium (D). Using the mass number, the total mass is 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is 1 atom of Aluminum (²⁷Al). The mass number is 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Atomic Mass:** 8 (from Deuterium) + 27 (from Aluminum) = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to identify Substance X and calculate the required value.\n\n1.  **Identifying Substance B**: The melting point of substance B is given as very close to 277 K. In Celsius, this is 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C. This value is the well-known melting point of heavy water (Deuterium Oxide, D₂O).\n\n2.  **Identifying Gas W**: The gas W, released during the reaction, has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's consider some simple gaseous molecules:\n    *   Hydrogen (H₂): 2 protons, 0 neutrons.\n    *   Deuterium (D₂): 2 protons (1 per D atom), 2 neutrons (1 per D atom). This is a perfect match.\n    *   Nitrogen (¹⁴N₂): 14 protons, 14 neutrons.\n    *   Carbon Monoxide (¹²C¹⁶O): 14 protons, 14 neutrons.\n    Given that heavy water is involved, D₂ is the most logical identity for gas W.\n\n3.  **Identifying the Reaction**: A violent reaction involving a deuterated substance (as implied by the presence of D₂O and D₂) that produces D₂ gas suggests the reaction of a strong deuterated reducing agent with heavy water. A very common class of reagents in organic chemistry are metal hydrides. The problem states an analog of substance X is a common reagent. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a powerful and widely used reducing agent. Its deuterated analog is Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n\n4.  **Confirming Substance X and the Reaction**: Let's assume Substance X is LiAlD₄ and liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O).\n    *   **Reaction**: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂\n    *   This reaction produces deuterium gas (W = D₂), which matches our deduction.\n    *   It forms a precipitate, aluminum deuteroxide (G = Al(OD)₃). Lithium deuteroxide is soluble.\n    *   Heating the precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) would cause decomposition: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This releases heavy water (B = D₂O), which also matches our initial finding.\n    *   The reaction of LiAlH₄ with water is known to be violent, so the reaction of LiAlD₄ with D₂O would be as well.\n\n5.  **Verifying with the Keto Acid Clue**: The final clue states that the reaction of a keto acid with substance X yields a product with two oxygen atoms. A keto acid contains both a ketone and a carboxylic acid functional group. LiAlD₄ (like its analog LiAlH₄) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce both of these groups to alcohols.\n    *   R-C(=O)-COOH + LiAlD₄ → R-CD(OH)-CD₂(OH)\n    *   The resulting product is a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups), which contains exactly two oxygen atoms. This confirms that **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Cumulative Atomic Masses**: The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within LiAlD₄, summing the masses of all atoms for each of those two elements.\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n    *   Their atomic numbers are Li (3), Al (13), and H (1).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum.\n    *   The molecule contains four atoms of the hydrogen isotope Deuterium (D or ²H). The approximate atomic mass of Deuterium is 2 amu.\n    *   The molecule contains one atom of Aluminum. The only stable isotope of aluminum is ²⁷Al, with an approximate atomic mass of 27 amu.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen)**: 4 atoms × 2 amu/atom = 8 amu.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum)**: 1 atom × 27 amu/atom = 27 amu.\n    *   **Cumulative sum**: 8 amu + 27 amu = 35 amu.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
