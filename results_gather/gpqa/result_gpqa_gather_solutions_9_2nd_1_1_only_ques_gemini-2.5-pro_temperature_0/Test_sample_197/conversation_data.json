The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16.

Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the percentage of one specific cobalt complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) or `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total amount of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**2. Identify the Correct Method**\nThe percentage of a specific complex `[M(L)ₙ]` in a solution is found by calculating its mole fraction, `αₙ`, and multiplying by 100. The formula for the mole fraction, which all candidate answers correctly identified, is:\n`αₙ = (βₙ * [L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ(βᵢ * [L]ⁱ))`\n\nFor our specific complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, n=2, M=Co, and L=SCN⁻. The formula becomes:\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**3. Verify the Values and Assumptions**\n*   Ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M. This is a valid approximation for the free ligand concentration because the total thiocyanate (0.1 M) is in large excess compared to the total cobalt (0.01 M).\n*   Stability constants: `β₁=9`, `β₂=40`, `β₃=63`, `β₄=16`.\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\nThis is the most critical step. Let's calculate the numerator and the denominator separately.\n\n*   **Numerator**:\n    `β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\n*   **Denominator**:\n    *   Term for `Co²⁺` (n=0): `1`\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺` (n=1): `β₁ * [SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]` (n=2): `β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4`\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻` (n=3): `β₃ * [SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063`\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻` (n=4): `β₄ * [SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016`\n    *   **Sum of Denominator Terms**: `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n*   **Calculate the Fraction (α₂)**:\n    `α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n*   **Convert to Percentage**:\n    `Percentage = α₂ * 100% ≈ 16.916%`\n\n**5.

However, many of them made an error when matching this result to the lettered options. For example, Answer 2 calculated 16.9% but chose C (38.1%), and Answer 5 calculated 16.9% but chose A (42.3%).\n\nAnswers 1, 3, and 13 correctly performed the calculation AND correctly identified that 16.9% corresponds to option D. The consensus on the calculation is unanimous, and the correct mapping to the options leads to D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the final answer, a step-by-step analysis of the problem is performed, cross-referencing the methodologies presented in the candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal**: The objective is to calculate the percentage of one specific cobalt-containing species, the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt species in the solution.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Mole Fraction Equation**: The percentage of a specific complex is found by calculating its mole fraction (often denoted by the Greek letter alpha, α) and multiplying by 100. The mole fraction for the nth complex, αₙ, in a system with a metal M and ligand L is given by:\n    αₙ = ([MLₙ]) / c(M)\n    where c(M) is the total concentration of the metal.\n\n    This can be expressed in terms of the overall stability constants (β) and the free ligand concentration ([L]):\n    αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)\n\n    For our specific case, we want to find α₂, the fraction of `[Co(SCN)₂]`:\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n3.  **Assess the Given Data and Assumptions**:\n    *   Stability constants: β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16.\n    *   Total cobalt concentration: c(Co) = 10⁻² M (or 0.01 M).\n    *   Total thiocyanate concentration: [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M.\n\n    **Careful Point**: The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium, not the *total* concentration. However, since the total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is ten times larger than the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), the amount of thiocyanate bound in complexes is small compared to the total. Therefore, it is a valid and standard approximation to assume the free thiocyanate concentration is equal to its total concentration: `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`. All candidate answers correctly apply this assumption.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation**: Substitute the given values into the mole fraction formula.\n\n    *   **Numerator**:\n        Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n    *   **Denominator**:\n        Term 0 (for free Co²⁺): 1\n        Term 1 (for [Co(SCN)]⁺): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × (0.1) = **0.9**\n        Term 2 (for [Co(SCN)₂]): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = **0.4**\n        Term 3 (for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 63 × 0.001 = **0.063**\n        Term 4 (for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 16 × 0.0001 = **0.0016**\n\n        Sum of Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n    *   **Calculate the Fraction (α₂)**:\n        α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n5.  **Convert to Percentage**:\n    Percentage = α₂ × 100% = 0.16916 × 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll candidate answers correctly perform the calculation and arrive at the numerical result of approximately 16.9%. The discrepancies among the candidates are in matching this result to the correct lettered option. Based on the options provided in the problem description:\nA) 25.6%\nB) 42.3%\nC) 16.9%\nD) 38.1%\n\nThe calculated value of 16.9% corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first analyze the provided solutions to understand the consensus on the calculation method. Then, I will write a Python script to perform this calculation accurately. The core of the problem is to determine the mole fraction (α₂) of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, and then convert it to a percentage.\n\nThe mole fraction α₂ can be calculated using the following formula, which is consistently used across all candidate answers:\nα₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nHere are the steps for the calculation:\n1.  Define the given stability constants (β₁, β₂, β₃, β₄) and the thiocyanate concentration ([SCN⁻]).\n2.  A key assumption, noted in the candidate answers, is that since the thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is in large excess compared to the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), the free thiocyanate concentration at equilibrium can be approximated as 0.1 M.\n3.  Calculate the numerator of the fraction, which is the term corresponding to the desired complex: `β₂ * [SCN⁻]²`.\n4.  Calculate the denominator, which is the sum of terms for all possible cobalt species (from free Co²⁺, where the term is 1, up to the tetrathiocyanato complex).\n5.  Divide the numerator by the denominator to get the mole fraction α₂.\n6.  Multiply α₂ by 100 to get the final percentage.\n7.

Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the percentage of a specific chemical species, the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total amount of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**2. Identify the Relevant Chemical Principles**\nThis is a complexation equilibrium problem. The distribution of different complex species (`[Co(SCN)]⁺`, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, etc.) depends on the concentration of the free ligand (`[SCN⁻]`) and the overall stability constants (β) for each complex.\n\n**3. Formulate the Calculation**\nThe fraction of any given complex `[Co(SCN)ₙ]^(2-n)` is denoted by αₙ. The formula for αₙ is derived from the equilibrium expressions:\nαₙ = (βₙ[SCN⁻]ⁿ) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nWe are interested in the dithiocyanato complex, which means n=2. So, we need to calculate α₂:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**4. List the Given Values**\n*   Concentration of thiocyanate, `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n*   Stability constant for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`, β₁ = 9\n*   Stability constant for `[Co(SCN)₂]`, β₂ = 40\n*   Stability constant for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`, β₃ = 63\n*   Stability constant for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`, β₄ = 16\n\n**5. Perform the Calculation Step-by-Step**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Assumption about Ligand Concentration.** The total cobalt concentration (10⁻² M) is ten times smaller than the thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M). This means the thiocyanate is in large excess, and we can safely assume that the concentration of free thiocyanate at equilibrium is approximately equal to its initial total concentration, i.e., `[SCN⁻]` ≈ 0.1 M. This is a standard and valid assumption for this type of problem.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Role of Total Cobalt Concentration.** The formula for the fraction α₂ does not include the free metal ion concentration `[Co²⁺]` or the total metal concentration `c(Co)`, as these terms cancel out during the derivation. Therefore, the value `c(Co) = 10⁻² M` is not needed to find the percentage distribution.\n\n*   **Calculate the Numerator:**\n    Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n\n*   **Calculate the Denominator:**\n    The denominator is the sum of all terms `βₙ[SCN⁻]ⁿ` from n=0 to n=4 (where β₀ is defined as 1).\n    *   Term for n=0 (free Co²⁺): 1\n    *   Term for n=1: β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n    *   Term for n=2: β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4\n    *   Term for n=3: β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063\n    *   Term for n=4: β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n    *   Sum of Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\n*   **Calculate the Fraction (α₂):**\n    α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n*   **Convert to Percentage:**\n    Percentage = α₂ * 100% ≈ 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\n**6. Compare with Options and Conclude**\nThe calculated percentage is 16.9%. This matches option D.\nA) 42.3%\nB) 25.6%\nC) 38.1%\nD) 16.9%\n\nThe analysis of the candidate answers shows that while almost all of them performed the calculation correctly to arrive at 16.9%, many made an error in selecting the corresponding letter option. The calculation is robust and consistently points to 16.9%.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe calculation to determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, has been performed and verified.\n\n**Summary of the Calculation:**\n\n1.  **Formula:** The mole fraction (α₂) of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex is calculated using the formula:\n    α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n2.  **Values:**\n    *   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n    *   β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, β₄ = 16\n\n3.  **Result:**\n    *   Numerator = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4\n    *   Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n    *   α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n    *   Percentage = 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\nThe code execution confirms this result, yielding **16.9%**.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 38.1%\nB) 42.3%\nC) 16.9%\nD) 25.6%\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo decide the final answer, a step-by-step analysis of the problem is performed, incorporating the methods and careful points observed in the candidate answers.\n\n**1. Objective**\nThe goal is to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**2. Fundamental Principle**\nThe distribution of different complex species in a solution at equilibrium is determined by the free ligand concentration and the overall stability constants (β) of the complexes. The percentage of a specific complex, `[Co(L)n]`, is found by calculating its mole fraction (αₙ) and multiplying by 100.\n\n**3. Formula for Mole Fraction**\nThe mole fraction (α₂) for the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex is given by the formula:\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\nThis can be expressed in terms of the stability constants and the free ligand concentration, `[SCN⁻]`:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**4. Analysis of Given Data and Assumptions**\n*   Total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M (or 0.01 M).\n*   Total thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻]total = 0.1 M.\n*   Overall stability constants: β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Ligand Concentration**\nThe formula requires the *free* equilibrium concentration of the ligand, `[SCN⁻]`. Since the total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is ten times greater than the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), the amount of thiocyanate consumed to form complexes is small relative to the total amount. Therefore, it is a valid and standard approximation to assume the free thiocyanate concentration is equal to its total concentration.\n*   **Assumption:** `[SCN⁻]` ≈ 0.1 M.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Role of Total Cobalt Concentration**\nAs shown in the derivation of the mole fraction formula, the free cobalt ion concentration, `[Co²⁺]`, cancels out. This means the *percentage* distribution of the species is independent of the total metal ion concentration, although the absolute concentrations are not. The `c(Co)` value is primarily used to justify the assumption in Careful Point 1.\n\n**5. Calculation**\nUsing the formula for α₂ and the given values:\n\n*   **Numerator**:\n    Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4\n\n*   **Denominator**:\n    The denominator is the sum of all terms `βₙ[SCN⁻]ⁿ` from n=0 to n=4 (where β₀ is defined as 1).\n    *   Term (n=0): 1\n    *   Term (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × (0.1) = 0.9\n    *   Term (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 0.4\n    *   Term (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 0.063\n    *   Term (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n    *   Sum of Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\n*   **Mole Fraction (α₂)**:\n    α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n*   **Percentage**:\n    Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 0.16916 × 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\n**6.

For the dithiocyanato complex (n=2), the formula is:\n    α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\n    Where `c(Co)` is the total concentration of all cobalt species:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n    Using the overall stability constants (β), we can express each concentration in terms of the free metal ion `[Co²⁺]` and free ligand `[SCN⁻]`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n    `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n\n    By substituting these into the mole fraction equation, the `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, leaving a formula that depends only on the ligand concentration and the stability constants:\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n    This derivation is correctly performed by all candidate answers.\n\n3.  **Calculation:**\n    *   **Given Values:**\n        *   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n        *   β₁ = 9\n        *   β₂ = 40\n        *   β₃ = 63\n        *   β₄ = 16\n    *   **Numerator Calculation:**\n        Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = **0.4**\n    *   **Denominator Calculation:**\n        *   Term for Co²⁺ (n=0): 1\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * 0.1 = **0.9**\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = **0.4**\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = **0.063**\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = **0.0016**\n        *   Sum of Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n    *   **Mole Fraction (α₂) Calculation:**\n        α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n    *   **Percentage Calculation:**\n        Percentage = α₂ * 100% ≈ 16.916%\n\n4.  **Comparison with Options:**\n    The calculated value is approximately **16.9%**.

List of Careful Points**\n*   **Free Ligand Concentration**: The formula requires the *free* thiocyanate concentration at equilibrium. The problem provides the *total* concentration. However, since the total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is ten times larger than the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), the amount of thiocyanate that binds to cobalt is small in comparison. Therefore, it is a valid and standard approximation to assume the free thiocyanate concentration is equal to its total concentration: `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`.\n*   **Role of Total Cobalt Concentration**: The total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is not directly used in the mole fraction calculation because the free cobalt ion concentration, `[Co²⁺]`, cancels out from the numerator and denominator. Its value is primarily used to justify the approximation of the free ligand concentration.\n*   **Calculation Accuracy**: The calculation must be performed carefully. All candidate answers correctly performed the calculation, even if some made an error matching the result to the option letter.\n\n**5.

The mole fraction of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex, denoted as α₂, is given by the ratio of its concentration to the total concentration of all cobalt species, `c(Co)`.\n    *   `α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n\n    This can be expressed using the overall stability constants (β) and the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`. The concentration of the free metal ion `[Co²⁺]` cancels out in the derivation, leading to the following key formula:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n4.  **Check Assumptions (Careful Point):** The total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is ten times greater than the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M). This means the ligand is in large excess. Therefore, it is a valid and standard approximation to assume that the free ligand concentration at equilibrium, `[SCN⁻]`, is equal to its initial total concentration.\n    *   `[SCN⁻]` ≈ 0.1 M\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:** Substitute the given values into the formula:\n    *   `[SCN⁻] = 0.1` M\n    *   `β₁ = 9`\n    *   `β₂ = 40`\n    *   `β₃ = 63`\n    *   `β₄ = 16`\n\n    First, calculate the numerator:\n    *   Numerator = `β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\n    Next, calculate the terms in the denominator:\n    *   Term for `Co²⁺` (n=0): `1`\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺` (n=1): `β₁ * [SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]` (n=2): `β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4`\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻` (n=3): `β₃ * [SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063`\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻` (n=4): `β₄ * [SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016`\n\n    Sum the denominator terms:\n    *   Denominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n    Calculate the mole fraction α₂:\n    *   `α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n6.  **Convert to Percentage:**\n    *   Percentage = `α₂ * 100% ≈ 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\n7.  **Match with Options:** The calculated value is 16.9%.

For the target species `[Co(SCN)₂]`, the mole fraction (α₂) is given by the formula:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**3. Analyze Careful Points and Assumptions**\n*   **Free vs. Total Ligand Concentration**: The formula requires the *free* thiocyanate concentration at equilibrium, `[SCN⁻]`. The problem provides the *total* concentration (0.1 M). Since the total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is ten times larger than the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), the amount of thiocyanate consumed to form complexes is small. Therefore, it is a standard and valid approximation to assume the free thiocyanate concentration is equal to the total concentration: `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`. All candidate answers correctly apply this assumption.\n*   **Cancellation of Terms**: The formula for the mole fraction (α₂) does not depend on the total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)`, because the free cobalt concentration, `[Co²⁺]`, cancels out during the derivation. This means the `c(Co) = 10⁻² M` value is primarily used to justify the assumption about the ligand concentration.\n*   **Correctness of Calculation**: The calculation must be performed accurately. All candidate answers follow the same calculation steps.\n\n**4.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Objective**: The goal is to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n2.  **Governing Formula**: The percentage of a specific complex is found by calculating its mole fraction (αₙ) and multiplying by 100. The mole fraction for the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex (where n=2) is given by the following formula, which was unanimously used by all candidate agents:\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n3.  **Input Values**:\n    *   Stability constants: β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16\n    *   Thiocyanate concentration: [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n\n4.  **Careful Points and Assumptions**:\n    *   **Free Ligand Concentration**: The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium. The problem provides the *total* concentration of 0.1 M. A critical and valid assumption, made by all agents, is that the free thiocyanate concentration is approximately equal to its total concentration. This is justified because the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is in large excess (10-fold) compared to the total metal concentration (10⁻² M or 0.01 M).\n    *   **Role of Total Cobalt Concentration**: The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, is not directly used in the mole fraction calculation. Its value is primarily used to justify the assumption about the free ligand concentration. The *percentage* distribution of species is independent of the total metal concentration under these conditions.\n    *   **Denominator Term for Free Ion**: The '1' in the denominator is a crucial term representing the uncomplexed `Co²⁺` ion (where β₀ = 1). This was correctly included in all calculations.\n\n5.  **Calculation Verification**: The calculation is performed by substituting the values into the formula.\n    *   **Numerator**:\n        Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n    *   **Denominator**:\n        *   Term for Co²⁺ (n=0): 1\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × 0.1 = 0.9\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 0.4\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 0.063\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n        *   Sum of Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n    *   **Mole Fraction (α₂)**:\n        α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n    *   **Percentage**:\n        Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 16.916% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n6.  **Conclusion**:\nThe calculation robustly and consistently yields a value of approximately 16.9%.

The mole fraction for the nth complex, αₙ, in a system with a metal M and ligand L is given by:\n    αₙ = ([MLₙ]) / c(M)\n    where c(M) is the total concentration of the metal.\n\n    This can be expressed in terms of the overall stability constants (β) and the free ligand concentration ([L]):\n    αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)\n\n    For our specific case, we want to find α₂, the fraction of `[Co(SCN)₂]`:\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n3.  **Assess the Given Data and Assumptions**:\n    *   Stability constants: β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16.\n    *   Total cobalt concentration: c(Co) = 10⁻² M (or 0.01 M).\n    *   Total thiocyanate concentration: [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M.\n\n    **Careful Point**: The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium, not the *total* concentration. However, since the total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is ten times larger than the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), the amount of thiocyanate bound in complexes is small compared to the total. Therefore, it is a valid and standard approximation to assume the free thiocyanate concentration is equal to its total concentration: `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`. All candidate answers correctly apply this assumption.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation**: Substitute the given values into the mole fraction formula.\n\n    *   **Numerator**:\n        Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n    *   **Denominator**:\n        Term 0 (for free Co²⁺): 1\n        Term 1 (for [Co(SCN)]⁺): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × (0.1) = **0.9**\n        Term 2 (for [Co(SCN)₂]): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = **0.4**\n        Term 3 (for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 63 × 0.001 = **0.063**\n        Term 4 (for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 16 × 0.0001 = **0.0016**\n\n        Sum of Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n    *   **Calculate the Fraction (α₂)**:\n        α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n5.  **Convert to Percentage**:\n    Percentage = α₂ × 100% = 0.16916 × 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll candidate answers correctly perform the calculation and arrive at the numerical result of approximately 16.9%.

Then, I will write a Python script to perform this calculation accurately. The core of the problem is to determine the mole fraction (α₂) of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, and then convert it to a percentage.\n\nThe mole fraction α₂ can be calculated using the following formula, which is consistently used across all candidate answers:\nα₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nHere are the steps for the calculation:\n1.  Define the given stability constants (β₁, β₂, β₃, β₄) and the thiocyanate concentration ([SCN⁻]).\n2.  A key assumption, noted in the candidate answers, is that since the thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is in large excess compared to the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), the free thiocyanate concentration at equilibrium can be approximated as 0.1 M.\n3.  Calculate the numerator of the fraction, which is the term corresponding to the desired complex: `β₂ * [SCN⁻]²`.\n4.

Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the percentage of a specific chemical species, the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total amount of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**2. Identify the Relevant Chemical Principles**\nThis is a complexation equilibrium problem. The distribution of different complex species (`[Co(SCN)]⁺`, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, etc.) depends on the concentration of the free ligand (`[SCN⁻]`) and the overall stability constants (β) for each complex.\n\n**3. Formulate the Calculation**\nThe fraction of any given complex `[Co(SCN)ₙ]^(2-n)` is denoted by αₙ. The formula for αₙ is derived from the equilibrium expressions:\nαₙ = (βₙ[SCN⁻]ⁿ) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nWe are interested in the dithiocyanato complex, which means n=2. So, we need to calculate α₂:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**4. List the Given Values**\n*   Concentration of thiocyanate, `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n*   Stability constant for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`, β₁ = 9\n*   Stability constant for `[Co(SCN)₂]`, β₂ = 40\n*   Stability constant for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`, β₃ = 63\n*   Stability constant for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`, β₄ = 16\n\n**5. Perform the Calculation Step-by-Step**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Assumption about Ligand Concentration.** The total cobalt concentration (10⁻² M) is ten times smaller than the thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M). This means the thiocyanate is in large excess, and we can safely assume that the concentration of free thiocyanate at equilibrium is approximately equal to its initial total concentration, i.e., `[SCN⁻]` ≈ 0.1 M. This is a standard and valid assumption for this type of problem.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Role of Total Cobalt Concentration.** The formula for the fraction α₂ does not include the free metal ion concentration `[Co²⁺]` or the total metal concentration `c(Co)`, as these terms cancel out during the derivation. Therefore, the value `c(Co) = 10⁻² M` is not needed to find the percentage distribution.\n\n*   **Calculate the Numerator:**\n    Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n\n*   **Calculate the Denominator:**\n    The denominator is the sum of all terms `βₙ[SCN⁻]ⁿ` from n=0 to n=4 (where β₀ is defined as 1).\n    *   Term for n=0 (free Co²⁺): 1\n    *   Term for n=1: β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n    *   Term for n=2: β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4\n    *   Term for n=3: β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063\n    *   Term for n=4: β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n    *   Sum of Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\n*   **Calculate the Fraction (α₂):**\n    α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n*   **Convert to Percentage:**\n    Percentage = α₂ * 100% ≈ 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\n**6.

Objective**\nThe goal is to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**2. Fundamental Principle**\nThe distribution of different complex species in a solution at equilibrium is determined by the free ligand concentration and the overall stability constants (β) of the complexes. The percentage of a specific complex, `[Co(L)n]`, is found by calculating its mole fraction (αₙ) and multiplying by 100.\n\n**3. Formula for Mole Fraction**\nThe mole fraction (α₂) for the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex is given by the formula:\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\nThis can be expressed in terms of the stability constants and the free ligand concentration, `[SCN⁻]`:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**4. Analysis of Given Data and Assumptions**\n*   Total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M (or 0.01 M).\n*   Total thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻]total = 0.1 M.\n*   Overall stability constants: β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Ligand Concentration**\nThe formula requires the *free* equilibrium concentration of the ligand, `[SCN⁻]`. Since the total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is ten times greater than the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), the amount of thiocyanate consumed to form complexes is small relative to the total amount. Therefore, it is a valid and standard approximation to assume the free thiocyanate concentration is equal to its total concentration.\n*   **Assumption:** `[SCN⁻]` ≈ 0.1 M.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Role of Total Cobalt Concentration**\nAs shown in the derivation of the mole fraction formula, the free cobalt ion concentration, `[Co²⁺]`, cancels out. This means the *percentage* distribution of the species is independent of the total metal ion concentration, although the absolute concentrations are not.

For the dithiocyanato complex (n=2), the formula is:\n    α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\n    Where `c(Co)` is the total concentration of all cobalt species:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n    Using the overall stability constants (β), we can express each concentration in terms of the free metal ion `[Co²⁺]` and free ligand `[SCN⁻]`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n    `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n\n    By substituting these into the mole fraction equation, the `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, leaving a formula that depends only on the ligand concentration and the stability constants:\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n    This derivation is correctly performed by all candidate answers.\n\n3.  **Calculation:**\n    *   **Given Values:**\n        *   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n        *   β₁ = 9\n        *   β₂ = 40\n        *   β₃ = 63\n        *   β₄ = 16\n    *   **Numerator Calculation:**\n        Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = **0.4**\n    *   **Denominator Calculation:**\n        *   Term for Co²⁺ (n=0): 1\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * 0.1 = **0.9**\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = **0.4**\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = **0.063**\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = **0.0016**\n        *   Sum of Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n    *   **Mole Fraction (α₂) Calculation:**\n        α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n    *   **Percentage Calculation:**\n        Percentage = α₂ * 100% ≈ 16.916%\n\n4.  **Comparison with Options:**\n    The calculated value is approximately **16.9%**. This matches option **D**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Ligand Concentration Approximation:** The calculation assumes that the free thiocyanate concentration at equilibrium, `[SCN⁻]`, is equal to its initial total concentration of 0.1 M. This is a valid and standard approximation because the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is in large excess (10x) compared to the total metal ion concentration (0.01 M).\n*   **Independence from Total Cobalt Concentration:** The percentage distribution of the complexes is independent of the total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)`, as the `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out during the derivation of the mole fraction formula.\n*   **Correct Formula for Mole Fraction:** It is crucial to use the correct formula for the mole fraction, which includes the term '1' in the denominator to account for the free, uncomplexed `Co²⁺` ions.\n*   **Matching Calculation to Final Answer:** The numerical result of the calculation (16.9%) must be correctly matched to the corresponding lettered option. A review of the candidate answers shows that while most performed the calculation correctly, several failed to select the correct letter for their final answer.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculation consistently and correctly yields approximately 16.9%.

Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**2. Formulate the Governing Equation**\nThe percentage of any single cobalt complex species is determined by its mole fraction (α) in the solution. The mole fraction of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex, denoted as α₂, can be calculated using the overall stability constants (β) and the concentration of the free ligand ([SCN⁻]).\n\nThe formula for the mole fraction α₂ is:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**3. Identify and Analyze the Given Values**\n*   Total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M (or 0.01 M)\n*   Total thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   Stability constants: β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16\n\n**4. List of Careful Points**\n*   **Free Ligand Concentration**: The formula requires the *free* thiocyanate concentration at equilibrium. The problem provides the *total* concentration. However, since the total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is ten times larger than the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), the amount of thiocyanate that binds to cobalt is small in comparison. Therefore, it is a valid and standard approximation to assume the free thiocyanate concentration is equal to its total concentration: `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`.\n*   **Role of Total Cobalt Concentration**: The total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is not directly used in the mole fraction calculation because the free cobalt ion concentration, `[Co²⁺]`, cancels out from the numerator and denominator. Its value is primarily used to justify the approximation of the free ligand concentration.\n*   **Calculation Accuracy**: The calculation must be performed carefully.

This allows us to express the mole fraction `α₂` in a form that is independent of the unknown free cobalt ion concentration, `[Co²⁺]`, as this term cancels out from the numerator and denominator.\n    *   The resulting formula is:\n        `α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Terms and Calculate:**\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Ligand Concentration.** The problem provides the total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M), which is in ten-fold excess compared to the total cobalt concentration (10⁻² M). In such cases, it is a standard and valid approximation to assume that the concentration of the free ligand at equilibrium, `[SCN⁻]`, is equal to its total initial concentration. Therefore, we use `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Calculation.** We substitute the given values (`β₁=9`, `β₂=40`, `β₃=63`, `β₄=16`, and `[SCN⁻]=0.1`) into the formula.\n\n        *   **Numerator**: `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n        *   **Denominator**:\n            *   Term for `Co²⁺`: 1\n            *   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`: `β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n            *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]`: `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4`\n            *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`: `β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063`\n            *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`: `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016`\n        *   **Sum of Denominator Terms**: `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n    *   **Final Calculation**:\n        *   `α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n        *   Percentage = `0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The calculation consistently yields approximately 16.9%.

The formula for the mole fraction of `[Co(SCN)₂]` is derived from the stability constants (β) and the ligand concentration ([SCN⁻]):\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n    All candidate answers correctly identified and used this formula.\n\n3.  **Calculation**:\n    *   **Given Values**:\n        *   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n        *   β₁ = 9\n        *   β₂ = 40\n        *   β₃ = 63\n        *   β₄ = 16\n    *   **Numerator Calculation**:\n        *   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n    *   **Denominator Calculation**:\n        *   Term for Co²⁺: 1\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺: β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₂]: β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻: β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063\n        *   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻: β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016\n        *   Sum of Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n    *   **Mole Fraction (α₂) Calculation**:\n        *   α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n    *   **Percentage Calculation**:\n        *   Percentage = α₂ * 100% ≈ 16.916%\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: The calculated percentage is approximately 16.9%.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Ligand Concentration Approximation**: A crucial and correct assumption made in all answers is that the free thiocyanate concentration `[SCN⁻]` is approximately equal to its total concentration (0.1 M).

Many of the candidate answers performed the calculation correctly but failed to select the corresponding option letter accurately.\n\nBased on the consistent and correct calculation demonstrated across all candidate answers, the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is 16.9%.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo decide the final answer, a step-by-step analysis of the problem is performed, highlighting the key calculations and assumptions.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the percentage of one specific cobalt complex, the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total amount of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**2. Formulate the Governing Equation**\nThe percentage of a specific complex `[Co(L)ₙ]` in a solution is determined by its mole fraction, αₙ, multiplied by 100. The mole fraction can be calculated using the overall stability constants (β) and the concentration of the free ligand ([L]). For the target species `[Co(SCN)₂]`, the mole fraction (α₂) is given by the formula:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**3. Analyze Careful Points and Assumptions**\n*   **Free vs. Total Ligand Concentration**: The formula requires the *free* thiocyanate concentration at equilibrium, `[SCN⁻]`. The problem provides the *total* concentration (0.1 M). Since the total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is ten times larger than the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), the amount of thiocyanate consumed to form complexes is small. Therefore, it is a standard and valid approximation to assume the free thiocyanate concentration is equal to the total concentration: `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`. All candidate answers correctly apply this assumption.\n*   **Cancellation of Terms**: The formula for the mole fraction (α₂) does not depend on the total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)`, because the free cobalt concentration, `[Co²⁺]`, cancels out during the derivation. This means the `c(Co) = 10⁻² M` value is primarily used to justify the assumption about the ligand concentration.\n*   **Correctness of Calculation**: The calculation must be performed accurately. All candidate answers follow the same calculation steps.\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\nUsing the given values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator of the α₂ formula:\n*   Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\nNext, calculate each term in the denominator:\n*   Term for Co²⁺ (n=0): 1\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 × 0.1 = **0.9**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (n=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = **0.4**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = **0.063**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = **0.0016**\n\nSum the denominator terms:\n*   Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\nCalculate the mole fraction α₂:\n*   α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nFinally, convert the fraction to a percentage:\n*   Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ 0.16916 × 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n**5.
