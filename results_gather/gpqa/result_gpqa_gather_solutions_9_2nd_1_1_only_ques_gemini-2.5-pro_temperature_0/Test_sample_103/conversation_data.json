Both planets were found to be in circular orbits.\n\nPlanet #1 was detected from the up to 5 miliangstrom periodic shift of a spectral line at a given wavelength. The periodic wavelength shift of the same spectral line in the spectrum of the host of planet #2 was 7 miliangstrom.\n\nThe question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\n\nA) ~ 0.85\nB) ~ 0.36\nC) ~ 1.96\nD) ~ 1.40\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):**\n    The Radial Velocity (RV) method works by detecting the Doppler shift in a star's light. The observed periodic shift in wavelength (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r). The maximum value of this shift (Δλ_max) corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as K.\n    *   `K ∝ Δλ_max`\n    *   For system #1: Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ\n    *   For system #2: Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7`.\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P):**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the formula for the star's RV semi-amplitude is:\n    `K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3)`\n    (This uses the valid approximation that the planet's mass `m_p` is much smaller than the star's mass `M_star`).\n\n3.  **Apply the Problem's Conditions:**\n    The problem states that several key parameters are the same for both systems:\n    *   The stars have the same mass (`M_star1 = M_star2`).\n    *   The planets have similar masses (`m_p1 ≈ m_p2`).\n    *   For a unique solution, we must make the standard assumption that the orbital inclinations are also similar (`sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂)`).\n    With these parameters being constant, the formula simplifies to a direct proportionality between K and the orbital period P:\n    *   `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`\n\n4.  **Solve for the Ratio of the Orbital Periods:**\n    We can express the proportionality as a ratio for the two systems:\n    `K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n    We want to find the ratio `P₂ / P₁`. To do this, we can cube both sides of the equation:\n    `(K₁ / K₂)^3 = P₂ / P₁`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    Substitute the ratio of the velocity amplitudes (which is the same as the ratio of the wavelength shifts) into the equation:\n    `P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³`\n    `P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343`\n    `P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644`\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.36.\n\n### Careful Points and Sanity Check\n\n*   **Relationship Direction:** A larger wavelength shift (planet #2) implies a larger stellar velocity (K). A larger stellar velocity is caused by a planet in a closer, faster orbit, which means a *shorter* orbital period (P). Since K₂ > K₁, we must have P₂ < P₁, so the ratio P₂/P₁ must be less than 1. This immediately eliminates options A, B, and C.\n*   **Exponents:** The most common mistake is with the exponents. The relationship is `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`, which leads to `P ∝ K⁻³`. The final ratio of periods is the inverse ratio of the velocities (or wavelength shifts), cubed.\n*   **Assumptions:** The solution relies on the standard and necessary assumption that the `m_p * sin(i)` term is the same for both systems, as is implied by the problem's phrasing.\n*   **Option Mapping:** Many of the provided agent answers correctly calculate the value ~0.36 but assign it to the wrong letter. Based on the options provided in the question prompt, the value ~0.36 corresponds to option D.\n\nThe final calculation shows that the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on an analysis of the provided answers, here is a step-by-step derivation of the correct solution, highlighting the key points and potential pitfalls.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):**\n    The Radial Velocity (RV) method works by detecting the Doppler shift in a star's light. The magnitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's velocity along our line of sight. The maximum periodic shift (Δλ_max), given in the problem, corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity curve, denoted as K.\n    *   Therefore, K ∝ Δλ_max.\n    *   This allows us to find the ratio of the velocity amplitudes for the two stars:\n        K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P):**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:\n    K ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3)\n    where P is the orbital period, mₚ is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, and i is the orbital inclination.\n\n3.  **Apply the Problem's Conditions:**\n    The problem states that several key parameters are the same for both systems:\n    *   The stars have the same mass (M_star₁ = M_star₂).\n    *   The planets have similar masses (mₚ₁ ≈ mₚ₂).\n    *   A standard and necessary assumption for this type of problem is that the orbital inclinations are comparable, meaning sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂).\n    Because these terms are constant for both systems, the formula simplifies to a direct proportionality between K and P:\n    *   K ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n4.  **Solve for the Period Ratio (P₂ / P₁):**\n    We can now write a ratio for the two systems using this proportionality:\n    K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n    To find the ratio P₂ / P₁, we must cube both sides of the equation:\n    P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)³\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    Substitute the ratio of the velocity amplitudes (which is the same as the ratio of the wavelength shifts) into the equation:\n    P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³\n    P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343\n    P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Correct Proportionality:** The most common mistake is inverting the relationship. A larger velocity shift (K) implies a stronger gravitational tug at a closer distance, which means a *shorter* orbital period (P). Thus, K is inversely proportional to a power of P.\n*   **Correct Exponent:** The relationship is K ∝ P^(-1/3), not any other power. This leads to the final ratio being cubed, (K₁/K₂)³.\n*   **Correct Ratio:** The question asks for the period of planet #2 relative to planet #1 (P₂ / P₁). This requires using the ratio K₁ / K₂ (which is 5/7), not K₂ / K₁ (which is 7/5).\n*   **Matching to Options:** The calculated value is ~0.36. It is crucial to match this value to the correct option letter from the original prompt.\n    *   A) ~ 0.85\n    *   B) ~ 1.96\n    *   C) ~ 1.40\n    *   D) ~ 0.36\n    The calculated value clearly matches option D. Many of the candidate answers performed the calculation correctly but failed at this final step, either by selecting the wrong letter or by referencing a re-ordered list of options.\n\nThe overwhelming consensus from the derivations is that the ratio of the periods is approximately 0.36. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is my step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):**\n    The Radial Velocity (RV) method works by detecting the Doppler shift in a star's light. The observed maximum shift in wavelength, Δλ, is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, K.\n    *   K ∝ Δλ\n    *   This means the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts. We are given Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ and Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ.\n    *   The ratio is `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7`.\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P):**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the formula for the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude is:\n    `K ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3)`\n    where `P` is the orbital period, `m_p` is the planet's mass, `M_star` is the star's mass, and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n3.  **Apply the Problem's Conditions:**\n    The problem states that the star masses are identical (`M_star1 = M_star2`) and the planet masses are similar (`m_p1 ≈ m_p2`). For a unique solution, we must also assume the orbital inclinations are comparable (`sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂)`), which is a standard assumption in such problems. With these parameters being constant for both systems, the formula simplifies to a direct proportionality between K and P:\n    *   `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`\n\n4.  **Combine and Solve for the Period Ratio (P₂ / P₁):**\n    We can now write a ratio for the two systems using the proportionality from Step 3:\n    *   `K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n    We can now substitute the ratio we found in Step 1:\n    *   `5 / 7 = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n    To solve for the desired ratio `P₂ / P₁`, we cube both sides of the equation:\n    *   `P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value and Select the Correct Option:**\n    The final step is to calculate the numerical value of the ratio and compare it to the given options.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Correct Ratio:** The question asks for the ratio of the period of planet #2 to planet #1 (`P₂ / P₁`). It is crucial to set up the ratios correctly to solve for this specific quantity.\n*   **Exponents:** The relationship involves a power of -1/3, and the final calculation requires cubing the ratio. A mistake in the exponent is a common error.\n*   **Sanity Check:** Planet #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (7 mÅ > 5 mÅ), which implies a larger stellar velocity (K₂ > K₁). A larger velocity is typically caused by a planet in a closer, and therefore shorter-period, orbit. This means we should expect P₂ to be shorter than P₁, so the ratio `P₂ / P₁` must be less than 1. Our derived formula `(5/7)³` will indeed be less than 1, which confirms our reasoning is sound.\n*   **Matching to Options:** The provided candidate answers show significant confusion in matching the calculated result to the correct lettered option.

The observed shift in wavelength (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's velocity along our line of sight (v_r). The problem gives the maximum periodic shift, which corresponds to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity curve, denoted as K.\n    *   Therefore, `K ∝ Δλ`.\n    *   For planet #1, Δλ₁ = 5 miliangstrom.\n    *   For planet #2, Δλ₂ = 7 miliangstrom.\n    *   The ratio of the velocity amplitudes is `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7`.\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P):**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by the formula:\n    `K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3)`\n    (This is the standard formula where the planet's mass `m_p` is much smaller than the star's mass `M_star`).\n    Here, P is the orbital period, `m_p` is the planet's mass, `M_star` is the star's mass, and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n3.  **Apply the Given Conditions to Simplify the Relationship:**\n    The problem states:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: `M_star₁ = M_star₂`.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: `m_p₁ ≈ m_p₂`.\n    *   A crucial assumption in such problems is that the unknown orbital inclinations are comparable, meaning `sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂)`.\n    *   With these parameters being constant for both systems, the formula simplifies to a direct relationship between K and P:\n    `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`\n\n4.  **Formulate the Ratio of the Periods:**\n    From the relationship `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`, we can write a ratio for the two systems:\n    `K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n\n5.  **Solve for the Period Ratio (P₂ / P₁):**\n    To find the ratio `P₂ / P₁`, we need to isolate it. We can cube both sides of the equation:\n    `(K₁ / K₂)^3 = ( (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3) )^3`\n    `(K₁ / K₂)^3 = P₂ / P₁`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    Now, we substitute the ratio of the velocity amplitudes (which is the same as the ratio of the wavelength shifts) into the equation:\n    `P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)^3`\n    `P₂ / P₁ = 5³ / 7³ = 125 / 343`\n    `P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Proportionality:** It is essential to correctly identify that the measured wavelength shift is directly proportional to the star's velocity amplitude (K).\n*   **Key Formula:** The relationship `K ∝ P^(-1/3)` is the cornerstone of the solution. It is derived from the full RV formula by holding the star mass, planet mass, and inclination constant as per the problem's conditions.\n*   **Algebra:** The manipulation of the exponents is critical. A common mistake is to invert the ratio or use the wrong exponent. The final relationship is `P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3`.\n*   **Sanity Check:** Planet #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (7 mÅ > 5 mÅ), which implies a larger stellar velocity (K₂ > K₁). A larger velocity is caused by a stronger gravitational tug, which typically means the planet is in a closer, shorter-period orbit. Therefore, we should expect P₂ to be shorter than P₁, and the ratio `P₂ / P₁` to be less than 1.

The magnitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's velocity along our line of sight. The maximum periodic shift given in the problem (Δλ_max) corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as K.\n    *   Therefore, `K ∝ Δλ_max`.\n    *   We can establish a ratio for the two systems: `K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 mÅ / 5 mÅ = 1.4`.\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P):** For a planet in a circular orbit, the formula for the RV semi-amplitude is:\n    `K ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3)`\n    This assumes the planet's mass (`m_p`) is much smaller than the star's mass (`M_star`), which is true for a Neptune-like planet orbiting a Sun-like star.\n\n3.  **Apply the Problem's Conditions:** The problem states that the stars have identical masses (`M_star1 = M_star2`) and the planets have similar masses (`m_p1 ≈ m_p2`). In RV problems, the measured quantity is the minimum mass, `m_p * sin(i)`. The most logical interpretation is that this value is similar for both planets. With these parameters being constant for both systems, the formula simplifies to a core proportionality:\n    *   `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`\n\n4.  **Solve for the Period Ratio:** We can now use this proportionality to relate the two systems:\n    *   `K₂ / K₁ = (P₂)^(-1/3) / (P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)`\n\n    To find the desired ratio `P₂ / P₁`, we rearrange the equation:\n    *   `P₁ / P₂ = (K₂ / K₁)³`\n    *   `P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)³`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Substitute the ratio of the velocities (`K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7`):\n    *   `P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³`\n    *   `P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644`\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.36. This matches option C.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Proportionality:** The first key is understanding that the observed wavelength shift is directly proportional to the star's velocity amplitude (`K ∝ Δλ`).\n*   **The K-P Relationship:** The second key is correctly simplifying the RV formula to find the relationship between the velocity amplitude and the orbital period (`K ∝ P^(-1/3)`) when stellar and planetary masses are held constant.\n*   **Algebraic Inversion:** A common pitfall is inverting the ratios. Since `K` is inversely proportional to the cube root of `P`, a larger `K` means a smaller `P`. The final ratio for the periods `P₂ / P₁` must be the inverse of the cubed velocity ratio, `(K₁ / K₂)³`, not `(K₂ / K₁)³`.\n*   **Sanity Check:** Planet #2 induces a larger velocity shift in its star (`K₂ > K₁`). This implies a stronger gravitational interaction, which for planets of similar mass means a closer orbit. A closer orbit has a shorter period. Therefore, the result `P₂ / P₁` must be less than 1, which immediately eliminates options A and D.\n*   **Matching Result to Options:** Several of the provided candidate answers calculated the value 0.36 correctly but then matched it to the wrong letter.

The maximum periodic shift given in the problem (Δλ_max) corresponds to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity curve, a value known as the semi-amplitude (K).\n    *   Therefore: `K ∝ Δλ_max`\n    *   For the two systems, we can establish a ratio of their velocity amplitudes:\n        `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 mÅ / 7 mÅ = 5/7`\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P)**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by the formula:\n    `K ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3)`\n    This formula is valid when the planet's mass (`m_p`) is much smaller than the star's mass (`M_star`), which is true for a Neptune-like planet orbiting a Sun-like star.\n\n3.  **Apply the Problem's Conditions to Simplify the Relationship**\n    The problem states several conditions that allow us to simplify the formula for comparison:\n    *   The stars have \"exactly the same masses\" (`M_star₁ = M_star₂`).\n    *   The planets have \"masses similar to that of Neptune.\" In the context of the RV method, the measured quantity is the minimum mass, `m_p * sin(i)`. The problem's phrasing implies this measured value is similar for both planets (`m_p₁ * sin(i₁) ≈ m_p₂ * sin(i₂)`).\n    *   `G` (the gravitational constant) and `2π` are constants.\n\n    Because all terms except K and P are constant across both systems, the relationship simplifies to a direct proportionality:\n    `K ∝ P^(-1/3)` or `K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)`\n\n4.  **Combine Relationships and Solve for the Period Ratio**\n    We can now write a ratio for the two systems using this proportionality:\n    `K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n\n    We want to find the ratio of the periods, `P₂ / P₁`.

A larger wavelength shift (planet #2) implies a larger stellar velocity `K`. A larger velocity is caused by a stronger gravitational tug, which happens when the planet is closer and thus has a *shorter* orbital period `P`.

The observed maximum shift in wavelength, Δλ, is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, K.\n    *   K ∝ Δλ\n    *   This means the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts. We are given Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ and Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ.\n    *   The ratio is `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7`.\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P):**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the formula for the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude is:\n    `K ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3)`\n    where `P` is the orbital period, `m_p` is the planet's mass, `M_star` is the star's mass, and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n3.  **Apply the Problem's Conditions:**\n    The problem states that the star masses are identical (`M_star1 = M_star2`) and the planet masses are similar (`m_p1 ≈ m_p2`).

The problem gives the maximum periodic shift, which corresponds to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity curve, denoted as K.\n    *   Therefore, `K ∝ Δλ`.\n    *   For planet #1, Δλ₁ = 5 miliangstrom.\n    *   For planet #2, Δλ₂ = 7 miliangstrom.\n    *   The ratio of the velocity amplitudes is `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7`.\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P):**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by the formula:\n    `K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3)`\n    (This is the standard formula where the planet's mass `m_p` is much smaller than the star's mass `M_star`).\n    Here, P is the orbital period, `m_p` is the planet's mass, `M_star` is the star's mass, and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n3.  **Apply the Given Conditions to Simplify the Relationship:**\n    The problem states:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: `M_star₁ = M_star₂`.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: `m_p₁ ≈ m_p₂`.\n    *   A crucial assumption in such problems is that the unknown orbital inclinations are comparable, meaning `sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂)`.\n    *   With these parameters being constant for both systems, the formula simplifies to a direct relationship between K and P:\n    `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`\n\n4.  **Formulate the Ratio of the Periods:**\n    From the relationship `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`, we can write a ratio for the two systems:\n    `K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n\n5.  **Solve for the Period Ratio (P₂ / P₁):**\n    To find the ratio `P₂ / P₁`, we need to isolate it. We can cube both sides of the equation:\n    `(K₁ / K₂)^3 = ( (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3) )^3`\n    `(K₁ / K₂)^3 = P₂ / P₁`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    Now, we substitute the ratio of the velocity amplitudes (which is the same as the ratio of the wavelength shifts) into the equation:\n    `P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)^3`\n    `P₂ / P₁ = 5³ / 7³ = 125 / 343`\n    `P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Proportionality:** It is essential to correctly identify that the measured wavelength shift is directly proportional to the star's velocity amplitude (K).\n*   **Key Formula:** The relationship `K ∝ P^(-1/3)` is the cornerstone of the solution. It is derived from the full RV formula by holding the star mass, planet mass, and inclination constant as per the problem's conditions.\n*   **Algebra:** The manipulation of the exponents is critical. A common mistake is to invert the ratio or use the wrong exponent. The final relationship is `P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)^3`.\n*   **Sanity Check:** Planet #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (7 mÅ > 5 mÅ), which implies a larger stellar velocity (K₂ > K₁). A larger velocity is caused by a stronger gravitational tug, which typically means the planet is in a closer, shorter-period orbit. Therefore, we should expect P₂ to be shorter than P₁, and the ratio `P₂ / P₁` to be less than 1. Our result of ~0.36 is consistent with this check.\n*   **Matching the Answer:** The calculated value of ~0.36 must be matched to the correct option provided in the question.

The formula is:\nK = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))\nwhere P is the orbital period, mₚ is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, i is the orbital inclination, and G is the gravitational constant.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Problem's Conditions to Simplify the Relationship\nThe problem states several conditions that allow us to simplify the formula for our comparison:\n*   **Identical star masses:** M_star₁ = M_star₂\n*   **Similar planet masses:** m_p₁ ≈ m_p₂\n*   **Implicit assumption:** For a unique solution to exist, we must assume the orbital inclinations are comparable, so sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂). In RV problems, \"similar masses\" is often interpreted as the measured quantity `mₚ sin(i)` being similar.\n\nWith these parameters being constant for both systems, the formula for K simplifies to a direct proportionality with the orbital period P:\nK ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n### Step 4: Solve for the Ratio of the Orbital Periods\nWe can now use the proportionality from Step 3 to create a ratio for the two systems:\nK₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3)\nThis can be rewritten as:\nK₁ / K₂ = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 (P₂ / P₁). To do this, we can cube both sides of the equation:\n(K₁ / K₂)^3 = P₂ / P₁\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Final Value\nSubstitute the ratio of the K values (which is the same as the ratio of the Δλ values) from Step 1 into the equation:\nP₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³\nP₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343\nP₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\n### Conclusion\nThe calculated ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 is approximately 0.36. This result makes physical sense: planet #2 induces a larger Doppler shift in its star, which implies a stronger gravitational interaction at a closer distance, corresponding to a shorter orbital period.\n\nComparing the result to the given options:\nA) ~ 1.96\nB) ~ 1.40\nC) ~ 0.36\nD) ~ 0.85\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the reasoning from the provided answers and highlighting crucial points.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift (Δλ) to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K)**\n    The Radial Velocity (RV) method works by detecting the Doppler shift in a star's light. The magnitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's velocity along our line of sight (v_r).

In the context of the RV method, the measured quantity is the minimum mass, mₚ sin(i). For a unique solution to exist, it is a standard assumption that this observable quantity is the same for both systems.\n    *   With M_star, mₚ, and sin(i) being constant for both systems, the formula simplifies to a core relationship between K and P:\n    *   K ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n4.  **Solve for the Ratio of the Orbital Periods**\n    From the proportionality K ∝ P^(-1/3), we can set up a ratio for the two systems:\n    K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n\n    We want to find the ratio of the period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 (P₂ / P₁).

A larger velocity is caused by a stronger gravitational interaction, which typically means the planet is in a closer, and therefore shorter-period, orbit. This confirms that the ratio P₂/P₁ should be less than 1.\n*   **Ratio and Exponents**: The most common mistake is in manipulating the ratios and exponents. The correct relationship is P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)³.

The observed shift in wavelength, Δλ, is directly proportional to the star's velocity along our line of sight. The maximum periodic shift, Δλ_max, corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity curve, denoted as K.\n    *   Therefore, `K ∝ Δλ_max`.\n    *   For the two systems, the ratio of their RV semi-amplitudes is:\n        `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7`\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P):**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:\n    `K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3)`\n    This is a standard approximation where the planet's mass (`m_p`) is much smaller than the star's mass (`M_star`).\n\n3.  **Apply the Problem's Conditions to Simplify the Formula:**\n    The problem states that several key parameters are the same for both systems:\n    *   The stars have identical masses (`M_star1 = M_star2`).\n    *   The planets have similar masses (`m_p1 ≈ m_p2`).\n    *   In the context of the RV method, the measured quantity is the \"minimum mass,\" `m_p * sin(i)`.

Substituting this into the equation gives:\n    `5 / 7 = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n\n    To find the ratio `P₂ / P₁`, we must cube both sides of the equation:\n    `P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Numerical Value:**\n    `P₂ / P₁ = 5³ / 7³ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644`\n\n    The orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Proportionality:** It is essential to correctly identify that the RV amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the wavelength shift `Δλ`, but inversely proportional to the cube root of the period `P`.\n*   **Assumptions:** The solution relies on the standard assumption that when planet masses are described as \"similar\" in an RV problem, it refers to the measured minimum mass, `m_p * sin(i)`.\n*   **Ratio Direction:** A crucial sanity check is to note that planet #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (`Δλ₂ > Δλ₁`), which implies a larger stellar velocity (`K₂ > K₁`). A larger velocity is caused by a planet in a closer, shorter-period orbit. Therefore, the period of planet #2 should be shorter than that of planet #1, and the ratio `P₂ / P₁` must be less than 1. The result of ~0.36 is consistent with this physical intuition.\n*   **Algebra:** The final step requires cubing the ratio of the velocities (or wavelength shifts). A common mistake is to use the wrong power or invert the ratio.

The magnitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's velocity along our line of sight. The maximum periodic shift given in the problem (Δλ_max) corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as K.\n    *   Therefore, `K ∝ Δλ_max`.\n    *   We can establish a ratio for the two systems: `K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 mÅ / 5 mÅ = 1.4`.\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P):** For a planet in a circular orbit, the formula for the RV semi-amplitude is:\n    `K ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3)`\n    This assumes the planet's mass (`m_p`) is much smaller than the star's mass (`M_star`), which is true for a Neptune-like planet orbiting a Sun-like star.\n\n3.  **Apply the Problem's Conditions:** The problem states that the stars have identical masses (`M_star1 = M_star2`) and the planets have similar masses (`m_p1 ≈ m_p2`). In RV problems, the measured quantity is the minimum mass, `m_p * sin(i)`. The most logical interpretation is that this value is similar for both planets. With these parameters being constant for both systems, the formula simplifies to a core proportionality:\n    *   `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`\n\n4.  **Solve for the Period Ratio:** We can now use this proportionality to relate the two systems:\n    *   `K₂ / K₁ = (P₂)^(-1/3) / (P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)`\n\n    To find the desired ratio `P₂ / P₁`, we rearrange the equation:\n    *   `P₁ / P₂ = (K₂ / K₁)³`\n    *   `P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)³`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Substitute the ratio of the velocities (`K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7`):\n    *   `P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³`\n    *   `P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644`\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.36.

Since `K` is inversely proportional to the cube root of `P`, a larger `K` means a smaller `P`. The final ratio for the periods `P₂ / P₁` must be the inverse of the cubed velocity ratio, `(K₁ / K₂)³`, not `(K₂ / K₁)³`.\n*   **Sanity Check:** Planet #2 induces a larger velocity shift in its star (`K₂ > K₁`). This implies a stronger gravitational interaction, which for planets of similar mass means a closer orbit. A closer orbit has a shorter period. Therefore, the result `P₂ / P₁` must be less than 1, which immediately eliminates options A and D.\n*   **Matching Result to Options:** Several of the provided candidate answers calculated the value 0.36 correctly but then matched it to the wrong letter.

A larger stellar wobble (larger K and Δλ) implies a stronger gravitational interaction, which for a given mass, means a smaller orbital distance and thus a shorter period (P). Since planet #2 causes a larger shift (7 mÅ > 5 mÅ), its period must be shorter than planet #1's, so the ratio P₂/P₁ must be less than 1.

The correct calculation and correct matching are found in answers 2, 3, 7, 11, and 13.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the reasoning from the provided answers and highlighting the crucial points.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift (Δλ) to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K)**\n    The core principle of the Radial Velocity (RV) method is the Doppler effect. The observed periodic shift in a star's spectral line wavelength (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's velocity along our line of sight. The maximum value of this shift (Δλ_max) corresponds to the amplitude of the star's velocity curve, known as the semi-amplitude (K).\n    *   **Relationship:** `K ∝ Δλ_max`\n    *   **Given:** Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ, Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ\n    *   **Ratio:** `K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4`\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P)**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by the formula:\n    `K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3)`\n    (This is the standard formula assuming the planet's mass `m_p` is much smaller than the star's mass `M_star`).\n\n3.  **Apply the Problem's Conditions to Simplify the Formula**\n    The problem states several parameters are constant for both systems:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: `M_star₁ = M_star₂`.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: `m_p₁ ≈ m_p₂`.\n    *   A standard and necessary assumption for this type of problem is that the orbital inclinations are comparable, so `sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂)`.\n    *   `G` and `2π` are physical constants.\n\n    With all other terms being constant, the formula simplifies to a direct relationship between K and P:\n    *   **Proportionality:** `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`\n\n4.  **Solve for the Ratio of the Orbital Periods**\n    We can now set up an equation relating the two systems:\n    `K₂ / K₁ = (P₂)^(-1/3) / (P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)`\n\n    We want to find the ratio `P₂ / P₁`. To do this, we first rearrange the equation to solve for `P₁ / P₂` by cubing both sides:\n    `(K₂ / K₁)^3 = P₁ / P₂`\n\n    Now, we take the reciprocal of both sides to get our desired ratio:\n    `P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)³`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Numerical Value**\n    Substitute the known ratio of the K values (`K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7`):\n    `P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³`\n    `P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The Sanity Check:** Planet #2 induces a larger wavelength shift (7 mÅ > 5 mÅ), which means its host star is moving faster (K₂ > K₁). A faster stellar wobble is caused by a stronger gravitational pull, which for a planet of similar mass, implies it is in a closer orbit. A closer orbit means a shorter orbital period. Therefore, we must expect P₂ to be shorter than P₁, and the ratio `P₂ / P₁` must be less than 1. This immediately eliminates options A (~ 1.96) and B (~ 1.40).\n*   **Algebraic Exponents:** A common mistake is to incorrectly manipulate the exponents. The final relationship is `P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)³`, not `(K₂ / K₁)^3` or `(K₁ / K₂)^(1/3)`.\n*   **Assumptions:** The solution relies on the standard assumption that \"similar masses\" in an RV problem implies the measured quantity `m_p * sin(i)` is the same for both systems. This is necessary to arrive at a single numerical answer.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 is approximately 0.36.

The magnitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's velocity along our line of sight. The maximum periodic shift (Δλ_max) corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity curve, denoted as K.\n    *   `K ∝ Δλ_max`\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts:\n        `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7`\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P):**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:\n    `K ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3)`\n    This formula is valid when the planet's mass (m_p) is much smaller than the star's mass (M_star), which is true for a Neptune-like planet orbiting a Sun-like star.\n\n3.  **Apply the Problem's Conditions:**\n    The problem states that several key parameters are the same for both systems:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: `M_star1 = M_star2`.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: `m_p1 ≈ m_p2`.\n    *   For a unique solution, we must assume the viewing geometry is comparable, meaning the orbital inclinations are the same: `sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂)`.\n    Given these conditions, all terms in the formula for K are constant for both systems except for the orbital period, P. This simplifies the relationship to a clear proportionality:\n    *   `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`\n\n4.  **Solve for the Period Ratio (P₂ / P₁):**\n    We can now write a ratio for the two systems based on this proportionality:\n    `K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n    We want to find the ratio `P₂ / P₁`. To do this, we can cube both sides of the equation:\n    `(K₁ / K₂)³ = P₂ / P₁`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    Substitute the ratio of the K values (which is the same as the ratio of the wavelength shifts) into the equation:\n    `P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³`\n    `P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644`\n\n### Careful Points and Sanity Check\n\n*   **Proportionality:** The core of the problem lies in correctly identifying the two key proportionalities: `K ∝ Δλ` and `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`.\n*   **Assumptions:** The solution relies on the stated conditions (equal star and planet masses) and the standard implicit assumption in such problems that the orbital inclinations are comparable.\n*   **Algebra:** The final step involves cubing the ratio, not taking the cube root or using an incorrect exponent. It's also crucial to use the correct ratio (`K₁/K₂` vs. `K₂/K₁`).\n*   **Sanity Check:** Planet #2 causes a larger wavelength shift (7 mÅ vs. 5 mÅ), which means its star is moving faster (`K₂ > K₁`). A faster stellar wobble is generally caused by a planet that is closer to its star. A closer orbit means a shorter orbital period. Therefore, we should expect the period of planet #2 to be shorter than that of planet #1 (`P₂ < P₁`), and the ratio `P₂ / P₁` must be less than 1. Our result of ~0.36 is consistent with this check.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 is approximately 0.36.

The magnitude of the observed wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's velocity along our line of sight. The maximum periodic shift given in the problem (Δλ_max) corresponds to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity curve, a value known as the semi-amplitude (K).\n    *   Therefore: `K ∝ Δλ_max`\n    *   For the two systems, we can establish a ratio of their velocity amplitudes:\n        `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 mÅ / 7 mÅ = 5/7`\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P)**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by the formula:\n    `K ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3)`\n    This formula is valid when the planet's mass (`m_p`) is much smaller than the star's mass (`M_star`), which is true for a Neptune-like planet orbiting a Sun-like star.\n\n3.  **Apply the Problem's Conditions to Simplify the Relationship**\n    The problem states several conditions that allow us to simplify the formula for comparison:\n    *   The stars have \"exactly the same masses\" (`M_star₁ = M_star₂`).\n    *   The planets have \"masses similar to that of Neptune.\" In the context of the RV method, the measured quantity is the minimum mass, `m_p * sin(i)`. The problem's phrasing implies this measured value is similar for both planets (`m_p₁ * sin(i₁) ≈ m_p₂ * sin(i₂)`).\n    *   `G` (the gravitational constant) and `2π` are constants.\n\n    Because all terms except K and P are constant across both systems, the relationship simplifies to a direct proportionality:\n    `K ∝ P^(-1/3)` or `K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)`\n\n4.  **Combine Relationships and Solve for the Period Ratio**\n    We can now write a ratio for the two systems using this proportionality:\n    `K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n\n    We want to find the ratio of the periods, `P₂ / P₁`.

A larger wavelength shift (planet #2) implies a larger stellar velocity `K`. A larger velocity is caused by a stronger gravitational tug, which happens when the planet is closer and thus has a *shorter* orbital period `P`. Since `K₂ > K₁`, it must be that `P₂ < P₁`, so the ratio `P₂ / P₁` must be less than 1. This provides a quick sanity check on the final answer.\n*   **Exponent:** The final calculation requires cubing the velocity ratio, `(K₁/K₂)^3`, not taking the cube root or using a different exponent.\n*   **Assumptions:** The solution relies on the standard assumption in such problems that \"similar masses\" detected via RV refers to the measured minimum mass, `m_p * sin(i)`.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the candidate answers correctly derived the physics and the calculation, arriving at a value of ~0.36.

The magnitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's velocity along our line of sight. The maximum periodic shift given in the problem corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as K.\n    *   This means `K ∝ Δλ`.\n    *   For star 1, `Δλ₁ = 5` miliangstrom.\n    *   For star 2, `Δλ₂ = 7` miliangstrom.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes is `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7`.\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P):**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the formula for the star's velocity semi-amplitude is:\n    `K ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3)`\n    This formula is valid when the planet's mass (`m_p`) is much smaller than the star's mass (`M_star`), which is true for a Neptune-like planet orbiting a Sun-like star.\n\n3.  **Apply the Problem's Conditions:**\n    The problem states that several key parameters are the same for both systems:\n    *   The stars have identical masses (`M_star1 = M_star2`).\n    *   The planets have similar masses (`m_p1 ≈ m_p2`).\n    *   A standard and necessary assumption for this type of problem is that the orbital inclinations (`i`) are comparable, meaning `sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂)`. This is because the RV method measures the minimum mass, `m_p * sin(i)`, and stating the planets are similar implies this measured quantity is similar.\n\n4.  **Simplify the Proportionality:**\n    With `M_star`, `m_p`, and `sin(i)` being effectively constant for both systems, the formula simplifies to a core relationship between the velocity amplitude `K` and the orbital period `P`:\n    *   `K ∝ P^(-1/3)` (K is proportional to the inverse of the cube root of the period).\n\n5.  **Solve for the Ratio of the Periods:**\n    We can express the proportionality as a ratio for the two systems:\n    `K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n    The question asks for the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 (`P₂ / P₁`).

A faster stellar wobble is caused by a stronger gravitational pull, which typically comes from a planet that is in a closer, and therefore shorter-period, orbit. This means we should expect `P₂` to be shorter than `P₁`, so the ratio `P₂ / P₁` must be less than 1. Our result of ~0.36 is consistent with this check.\n*   **Ratio Inversion:** It is a common mistake to invert the ratio. Calculating `(7/5)³` would yield `2.744`, which is the ratio `P₁ / P₂`. The question specifically asks for `P₂ / P₁`.\n*   **Exponents:** The relationship is `K ∝ P^(-1/3)`. This leads to the final ratio being cubed, `(K₁/K₂)^3`, not raised to the power of 1/3 or -1/3.\n*   **Assumptions:** The solution relies on the standard assumption that \"similar masses\" in an RV problem refers to the measured quantity `m_p * sin(i)` being similar for both planets.\n\nThe calculated value is approximately 0.36.
