    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure of Product 1.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C10H14Br2).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess KOH, heated to 240°C.\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   IR: 1720 cm⁻¹. This strong absorbance is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O), likely a ketone, possibly in a strained ring.\n    *   ¹H NMR: Total integration is 2H + 10H + 2H = 14H. This matches the number of hydrogens in the starting material, suggesting no protons were lost. The molecular formula of Product 1 is likely C10H14O.\n    *   Since the NMR does not show a signal in the 9-10 ppm region, the carbonyl is a ketone, not an aldehyde.\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** The reaction of a dihalide with a strong base at high temperature can lead to complex rearrangements. Elimination to form a double bond at the bridgehead is forbidden by Bredt's rule. A known reaction for 1,3-dihaloadamantanes under these conditions is rearrangement to form a ketone with the protoadamantane skeleton. A plausible structure for Product 1 is **protoadamantan-4-one**. The provided spectral data is complex and may be simplified, but the key takeaway is the formation of a C10H14O ketone.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the structure of Product 2.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (a ketone) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide (Al(O-iPr)₃).\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** This reagent is characteristic of the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which reduces ketones to alcohols. So, the ketone (Product 1) is first reduced to the corresponding alcohol (protoadamantan-4-ol).\n*   However, the next step in the synthesis is ozonolysis, which cleaves C=C double bonds. This strongly implies that Product 2 is an alkene.\n*   The reaction conditions involve heating with Al(O-iPr)₃, which is a Lewis acid. Lewis acids and heat are known to cause the dehydration of alcohols to form alkenes.\n*   Therefore, the overall transformation is the reduction of the ketone to an alcohol, followed by in-situ dehydration to form an alkene.\n    *   Ketone (Product 1) → Alcohol → Alkene (Product 2)\n*   **Structure of Product 2:** Dehydration of protoadamantan-4-ol involves removing the -OH from C4 and a hydrogen from an adjacent carbon (C3 or C5). Removal of H from bridgehead C3 would violate Bredt's rule. Removal of H from C5 is favored and leads to the formation of a stable alkene, **protoadamantene** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]dec-4-ene). So, Product 2 is protoadamantene (C10H14).\n\n**Step 3: Identify the structure of Product 3.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (protoadamantene) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** This is a reductive ozonolysis, which cleaves the C=C double bond and converts the carbons of the double bond into carbonyl groups (aldehydes or ketones). Since the double bond in protoadamantene is between two CH groups, ozonolysis will yield two aldehyde (CHO) groups.\n*   **Structure of Product 3:** Cleaving the C4=C5 double bond of the tricyclic protoadamantene skeleton opens one of the rings, resulting in a bicyclic dialdehyde. The known product of this reaction is **cis-bicyclo[3.3.0]octane-2,6-dicarbaldehyde** (C10H14O2).\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of Product 3.**\n\n*   **Question:** What is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in Product 3 (excluding exchangeable protons)?\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** In cis-bicyclo[3.3.0]octane-2,6-dicarbaldehyde, the most deshielded non-exchangeable protons are the two equivalent aldehyde protons (CHO). Their chemical shift is typically in the 9-10 ppm range, far downfield from any other C-H protons in the molecule.\n*   **Coupling Analysis:** We need to determine the splitting pattern of one of these aldehyde protons (let's call it H_ald).\n    1.  **³J Coupling:** H_ald is separated by three bonds from the proton on the adjacent ring carbon (C2). Let's call this proton H2. This coupling will split the H_ald signal into a **doublet**.\n    2.  **Long-Range Coupling (⁴J):** The options provided (triplet, pentet, doublet of triplets, triplet of triplets) are more complex than a simple doublet. This indicates that additional, long-range couplings must be considered. An aldehyde proton can exhibit ⁴J coupling to protons that are four bonds away.\n    3.  **Pattern Analysis:**\n        *   A **doublet of triplets** (option C) arises when a proton is coupled to one proton with a certain coupling constant (J_A) and to two other *equivalent* protons with another coupling constant (J_B).\n        *   In our structure, H_ald is coupled to one proton, H2 (giving the doublet splitting).\n        *   H_ald is also four bonds away from the two protons on C3 (H3a and H3b). While these two protons are diastereotopic (and thus not strictly equivalent), due to conformational flexibility and averaging in the five-membered ring, they can become magnetically equivalent with respect to the distant aldehyde proton.\n        *   If we assume this effective equivalence, the two H3 protons will split the H_ald signal into a **triplet**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Combining these effects, the signal for the aldehyde proton (H_ald) is split into a doublet by H2, and each line of that doublet is further split into a triplet by the two H3 protons. The resulting pattern is a **doublet of triplets**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
