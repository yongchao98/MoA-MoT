    "The user is asking to identify the set of assumptions that define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. Let's break down the meaning of the impulse approximation and then evaluate each of the given statements.\n\n**The Impulse Approximation**\n\nThe core idea of the impulse approximation is to simplify a very complex problem—an external probe interacting with a nucleus made of many strongly-interacting nucleons—into a much simpler one. It assumes that the interaction is so rapid (hence \"impulse\") that it can be treated as a collision between the external probe and a single, isolated nucleon. The other nucleons in the nucleus are considered mere \"spectators\" that do not participate in the primary interaction.\n\nThis approximation implies that for the brief moment of the interaction, the struck nucleon behaves as if it were a **free particle**, not part of a bound system.\n\nNow let's analyze the four proposed assumptions in this context:\n\n1.  **\"The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.\"** This is the foundational assumption of the impulse approximation. It's often called the \"one-body current\" approximation. It explicitly neglects more complex scenarios where the probe might interact with a pair of nucleons simultaneously (two-body currents) or with the meson fields that bind the nucleus. If this assumption is not made, you cannot treat the interaction as a simple probe-nucleon collision. Therefore, this assumption is **essential**.\n\n2.  **\"The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.\"** This deals with what happens before and after the main interaction. If the incoming probe or the outgoing particles (the scattered probe and the ejected nucleon) can interact with the other \"spectator\" nucleons, these are called initial-state interactions (ISI) and final-state interactions (FSI). These secondary interactions would complicate the picture and mean the nucleon is not truly behaving as if it were isolated. Assuming the nucleus is \"transparent\" means we are ignoring ISI and FSI. This is a crucial part of making the nucleon effectively \"free\" from the influence of its neighbors during the entire scattering process. Therefore, this assumption is **essential**.\n\n3.  **\"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.\"** This assumption concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself. The impulse approximation, in its standard form, treats the nucleon as a fundamental particle with certain properties (mass, charge, magnetic moment, form factors). It is agnostic about the nucleon's internal quark-gluon dynamics. One can apply the impulse approximation while using either a relativistic or non-relativistic model for the nucleon's structure. Therefore, this assumption is **not** a defining requirement of the impulse approximation itself. It's a separate approximation related to hadron structure models.\n\n4.  **\"The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.\"** This is the very definition of the \"impulse\" in the approximation. The idea is that the interaction happens over such a short timescale (e.g., a high-energy collision) that the relatively slow-acting binding forces from the surrounding nucleons are negligible *during the collision*. The nucleon is struck, and it recoils with the momentum it had *at that instant*, plus the momentum transferred from the probe, without the nuclear potential having time to affect its trajectory. This is key to treating it as a \"free\" particle at the moment of interaction. Therefore, this assumption is **essential**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe assumptions that jointly define the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4. These three assumptions work together to reduce the complex many-body problem to a more tractable sum of two-body interactions.\n\n*   Assumption 1: Defines the target of the interaction (a single nucleon).\n*   Assumption 4: Defines the state of the target nucleon during the interaction (unbound).\n*   Assumption 2: Ensures that the rest of the nucleus doesn't interfere with the process (no initial or final state interactions).\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
