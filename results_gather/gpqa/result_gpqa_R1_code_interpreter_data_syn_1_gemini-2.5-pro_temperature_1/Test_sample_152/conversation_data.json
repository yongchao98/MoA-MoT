    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning for each reaction:\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Reactants:** dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate\n*   **Reagents:** NaOEt, EtOH\n*   **Analysis:** This is a classic Michael addition reaction.\n    1.  **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) is a strong base that deprotonates the acidic α-hydrogen of dimethyl malonate (CH₂(COOMe)₂). This forms a resonance-stabilized enolate, `⁻CH(COOMe)₂`.\n    2.  **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The structure is p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOMe. The β-carbon is the electrophilic center.\n    3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n        `⁻CH(COOMe)₂ + p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOMe → p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOMe)₂) - C⁻H-COOMe`\n    4.  **Protonation:** The resulting enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent (EtOH) to yield the final product.\n        `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOMe)₂) - C⁻H-COOMe + EtOH → p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOMe)₂) - CH₂-COOMe + EtO⁻`\n    5.  **Product Identification (A):** The structure of the product is `(COOMe)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOMe`. Let's name this compound according to the options. We can name it as a derivative of propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid. The main propane chain is `C(1)H(COOMe)₂ - C(2)H(p-tolyl) - C(3)H₂(COOMe)`. The name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile\n*   **Reagents:** MeOH, H₃O⁺\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Stork enamine alkylation, which is a type of Michael addition.\n    1.  **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine derived from cyclohexanone. Enamines are nucleophilic at the β-carbon (the C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    2.  **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN, is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, which acts as a Michael acceptor.\n    3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The nucleophilic β-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. This forms a new C-C bond and an iminium ion intermediate.\n    4.  **Hydrolysis:** The reaction is worked up with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group, regenerating the ketone. The enamine functionality is a protecting group for the α-position of the ketone that also activates it for nucleophilic attack.\n    5.  **Product Identification (B):** The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the α-position (C2). The substituent added is derived from but-2-enenitrile, which becomes the `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group. The final structure is 2-substituted cyclohexanone. To name it, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (higher priority than the ketone). The parent chain is butanenitrile. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent at position 3 of the butanenitrile chain. Therefore, the name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the major stable product, not the enol form (`3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`).\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reactants:** C + but-3-en-2-one\n*   **Reagents:** KOH, H₂O\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Michael addition where we need to identify the starting Michael donor (C). This requires a retrosynthetic approach.\n    1.  **Analyze the Product and Acceptor:** The product is `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. The Michael acceptor is but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`.\n    2.  **Identify the Bond Formed:** In a Michael addition, the nucleophile adds to the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated system. For MVK, the β-carbon is the `CH₂` group. After addition and protonation, the MVK fragment becomes `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`, which is the `(3-oxobutyl)` group found in the product.\n    3.  **Identify the Donor (C):** The `(3-oxobutyl)` group is attached to C2 of a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring. This C2 position is an acidic \"active methylene\" position, located between two carbonyl groups. In the presence of a base like KOH, this position is deprotonated to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate is the Michael donor.\n    4.  **Reactant Identification (C):** Therefore, the unknown reactant C must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n*   A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
