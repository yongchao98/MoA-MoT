    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Starting Material:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Bromine (Br2), pyridine, acetic anhydride, heating.\n*   This set of reagents suggests an alpha-halogenation of the carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The alpha-carbon of acetic acid is the methyl group. One of the alpha-hydrogens is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Starting Material (Product 1):** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Ethanol (CH3CH2OH), sulfuric acid (H2SO4, catalyst), heating.\n*   This is a Fischer esterification reaction, where the carboxylic acid is converted to an ester by reacting with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Starting Material (Product 2):** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n*   **Starting Material (Product 3):** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   This step involves alkylation of the active methylene group of ethyl cyanoacetate.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that removes a proton from the carbon alpha to both the cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups, forming a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + H₂\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The enolate attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → (NC)(EtOOC)CH-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻\n    3.  **Intramolecular Cyclization:** The problem states \"excess\" NaH. The intermediate formed in the previous step still has a proton on the alpha-carbon (`(NC)(EtOOC)CH-`). Although less acidic than the starting material's methylene protons, this methine proton can be removed by a strong base like NaH. The use of \"excess\" base strongly suggests this second deprotonation occurs.\n        (NC)(EtOOC)CH-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → Na⁺[(NC)(EtOOC)C]⁻-(CH2)5-Br + H₂\n    4.  The resulting carbanion attacks the other end of the carbon chain, displacing the second bromide ion in an intramolecular SN2 reaction. This forms a cyclic product. The ring will contain the alpha-carbon and the five carbons from the pentyl chain, forming a 6-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonyl-cyclohexane.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals for 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonyl-cyclohexane.\n\n*   **Chirality:** The C1 carbon of the cyclohexane ring is attached to four different groups: -CN, -COOCH2CH3, -CH2- (ring carbon C2), and -CH2- (ring carbon C6). Therefore, C1 is a stereocenter, and the molecule is chiral. The product will be a racemic mixture of (R) and (S) enantiomers. We only need to analyze one enantiomer to determine the number of signals, as enantiomers have identical NMR spectra in an achiral solvent.\n\n*   **Symmetry:** As a chiral molecule, it does not possess a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n*   **Conformational Dynamics:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. This averages the signals for axial and equatorial protons on the same carbon, but it does not make diastereotopic protons or carbons equivalent.\n\nLet's count the chemically distinct sets of protons:\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-COOCH2CH3):**\n    *   **-CH3:** These three protons are equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n    *   **-O-CH2-:** This methylene group is part of an ethyl group attached to a chiral center (C1). Therefore, the two protons of the CH2 group are diastereotopic and chemically non-equivalent. **(2 signals)**\n    *   Total for the ethyl group = 1 + 2 = 3 signals.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   Because C1 is a chiral center, the two \"sides\" of the ring are non-equivalent. Thus, C2 is not equivalent to C6, and C3 is not equivalent to C5.\n    *   Due to rapid chair flipping, the axial and equatorial protons on each carbon are averaged into a single observed resonance for that carbon.\n    *   **Protons on C2:** Give one averaged signal.\n    *   **Protons on C6:** Diastereotopic to C2, giving a different signal.\n    *   **Protons on C3:** Give another distinct signal.\n    *   **Protons on C5:** Diastereotopic to C3, giving another distinct signal.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon is unique and gives its own signal.\n    *   Total for the ring = 5 signals (one for each of C2, C3, C4, C5, C6).\n\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Summing them up: 3 signals (from the ethyl group) + 5 signals (from the cyclohexane ring) = **8 distinct hydrogen signals**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
