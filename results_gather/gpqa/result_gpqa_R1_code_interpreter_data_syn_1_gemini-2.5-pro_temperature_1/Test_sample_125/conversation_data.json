    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I.**\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule containing one stereocenter at the C5 position, which has the (S) configuration. The ketone at C3 is a prochiral center.\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH, LiAlH4) followed by an acidic workup (H3O+). LAH is a strong, achiral reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to an alcohol (-OH).\n*   **Reaction Outcome:** The reduction of the prochiral ketone at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The hydride ion (H-) can attack from either the front or the back face of the planar carbonyl group. This results in the formation of two possible configurations at C3: (R) and (S). The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:** Two products are formed, which are diastereomers of each other.\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    Since they are diastereomers, they are distinct chemical compounds with different physical properties.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II.**\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral. It has a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH2 group.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup (H3O+). NaBH4 is an achiral reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to alcohol groups.\n*   **Reaction Outcome:** The reduction of the two prochiral ketones at C2 and C4 creates two new stereocenters. The product is pentane-2,4-diol. We must consider all possible stereoisomers.\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationships:**\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**. Because the starting material and reagents are achiral, they will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has an internal plane of symmetry, making it a **meso compound**. It is achiral and is superimposable on its mirror image, (2S, 4R).\n*   **Products of Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed.\n    1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n    The meso compound is a diastereomer of the two enantiomers.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC.**\n*   Normal-phase HPLC is an achiral separation technique. It separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   **Principle:** Diastereomers and constitutional isomers have different physical properties (including polarity) and can be separated. Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated; they will co-elute as a single peak.\n*   **Applying to the mixture:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, will have different polarities and will resolve into **2 separate peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction II consist of a racemic pair and a meso compound. The enantiomers, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will co-elute, giving **1 peak**. The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the other two and will have a different polarity, giving another **1 peak**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C7 ethers/alcohols) are constitutionally different from the products of Reaction II (C5 diols) and will have very different retention times.\n    *   **Total Peaks:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (from the enantiomeric pair in Rxn II) + 1 (from the meso compound in Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture with Chiral HPLC.**\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n*   **Principle:** A chiral column can separate all stereochemically distinct molecules: constitutional isomers, diastereomers, and enantiomers.\n*   **Applying to the mixture:** We have a total of five unique stereoisomers in our mixture:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   Since a chiral column can resolve all of them, each compound will produce a distinct peak.\n*   **Total Peaks:** **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   Normal-Phase HPLC: **4 peaks**\n*   Chiral HPLC: **5 peaks**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
