    "*   **Analysis of the Mass Spectrum (MS):**\n    1.  The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the molecule with the most common isotopes.\n    2.  There is another peak at m/z = 158, which is M+2. Its intensity is 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%).\n    3.  This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 (100:32 ≈ 3:1) is a characteristic isotopic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (³⁵Cl:³⁷Cl natural abundance is ~75.8% : 24.2%).\n    4.  All the proposed structures contain one chlorine atom and have a molecular formula of C₇H₅ClO₂, which corresponds to a molecular weight of 156 g/mol for the ³⁵Cl isotope. Let's verify this.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Infrared (IR) Spectrum:**\n    1.  A very broad absorption from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n    2.  A strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. This frequency is typical for a carbonyl group in a conjugated system, such as an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n    3.  The combination of these two peaks is strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This evidence eliminates options A (phenyl chloroformate, an acid chloride/ester) and D (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, an aldehyde with a phenol group), as neither contains a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n*   **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    1.  **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal in the 10-13 ppm range is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). It is a singlet ('s') because this proton does not typically couple with other protons. It integrates to one proton ('1H'). This confirms the carboxylic acid functional group.\n    2.  **Aromatic Region:** There are two signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm).\n        *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet integrating to two protons.\n        *   **7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet integrating to two protons.\n    3.  This pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is classic for a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of the para-substitution results in only two chemically distinct types of aromatic protons. The protons ortho to one substituent are equivalent, as are the protons ortho to the other substituent. They split each other into doublets.\n    4.  This NMR pattern allows us to distinguish between the remaining options:\n        *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is *ortho*-substituted. It would have four distinct aromatic protons, leading to a much more complex splitting pattern (not two simple doublets).\n        *   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is *para*-substituted. It has the correct symmetry to produce two doublets for the four aromatic protons. The electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group (-COOH) deshields the adjacent (ortho) protons, causing them to appear further downfield (8.02 ppm). The chlorine atom is also electron-withdrawing, and the protons adjacent to it appear at 7.72 ppm.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    All pieces of spectral data point consistently to one structure. The MS shows a molecular weight of 156 and the presence of one chlorine atom. The IR and the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm confirm a carboxylic acid. The aromatic signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum are only consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring. Therefore, the unknown compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\nLet's calculate the molecular weights of the options to confirm.\n```python\ndef calculate_mw(formula):\n    atomic_weights = {'C': 12.011, 'H': 1.008, 'Cl': 35.453, 'O': 15.999}\n    \n    # Calculate for the most common isotope of Cl (35) for M+ peak\n    weights_35 = {'C': 12, 'H': 1, 'Cl': 35, 'O': 16}\n    \n    mw_35 = 0\n    import re\n    elements = re.findall(r'([A-Z][a-z]*)(\\d*)', formula)\n    for element, count in elements:\n        count = int(count) if count else 1\n        mw_35 += weights_35[element] * count\n        \n    return mw_35\n\n# Formulas for the options (all are C7H5ClO2)\nformula = \"C7H5Cl1O2\"\n\nprint(f\"Molecular weight for C7H5ClO2 (with 35Cl): {calculate_mw(formula)}\")\n```\nMolecular weight for C7H5ClO2 (with 35Cl): 156\n\nAll options have the same molecular formula (C₇H₅ClO₂) and thus the same molecular weight, which matches the mass spectrometry data. The decision must be made based on the IR and NMR data, which strongly supports option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS):**\n    *   The molecular ion (M⁺) peak is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   A peak at m/z = 158 (M⁺+2) with an intensity of 32% relative to the M⁺ peak (100%) is observed. This ~3:1 ratio for M⁺:(M⁺+2) is the characteristic isotopic pattern for a molecule containing a single chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl ≈ 75.8% and ³⁷Cl ≈ 24.2%).\n    *   Let's check the molecular formula for the proposed structures. All options (A, B, C, D) have the chemical formula C₇H₅ClO₂. The molecular weight using the most common isotopes (¹²C, ¹H, ¹⁶O, ³⁵Cl) is: (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol. This matches the M⁺ peak. The MS data confirms the molecular formula and the presence of one chlorine atom but doesn't distinguish between the isomers.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The spectrum shows a very broad peak spanning from 3500 cm⁻¹ down to 2700 cm⁻¹. This is the classic signature of an O-H stretch from a carboxylic acid dimerized through hydrogen bonding.\n    *   There is a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. This frequency is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, specifically an aryl carboxylic acid (conjugated carbonyl).\n    *   The combination of these two features is definitive evidence for a carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional group. This allows us to eliminate option A (phenyl chloroformate, which is an acid chloride/ester) and option D (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, which is an aldehyde and a phenol). This leaves us with options B (2-chlorobenzoic acid) and C (4-chlorobenzoic acid).\n\n*   **¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **Signal at 11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** This signal is in the typical chemical shift range (10-13 ppm) for a carboxylic acid proton. Its high deshielding is characteristic. It is a singlet ('s') because it does not couple with nearby protons and integrates to one proton ('1H'). This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **Signals at 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern is crucial for determining the substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n        *   We see two signals, each a doublet ('d'), and each integrating to two protons ('2H'). This symmetrical pattern indicates a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring. In a para-substituted ring, there are only two sets of chemically equivalent protons, and each set splits the other into a doublet.\n        *   Let's analyze the remaining options:\n            *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho* (1,2) substituted ring. All four aromatic protons would be chemically non-equivalent, leading to four distinct and more complex signals (not two simple doublets).\n            *   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a *para* (1,4) substituted ring. It possesses the required symmetry to produce two doublets, each for two protons. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are more deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the protons ortho to the chlorine atom appear slightly more upfield (7.72 ppm).\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The combined spectral data points conclusively to 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The MS confirms the molecular formula and presence of chlorine, the IR confirms the carboxylic acid group, and the ¹H NMR confirms the *para* substitution pattern.\n\n<<<C>>>"
