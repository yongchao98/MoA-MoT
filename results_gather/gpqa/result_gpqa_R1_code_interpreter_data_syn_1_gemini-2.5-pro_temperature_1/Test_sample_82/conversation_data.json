    "*   **Initial State and Dilution:**\n    1.  We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n    2.  This solution is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n    3.  The new total volume is 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³.\n    4.  The new concentration of acetic acid is calculated using the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂:\n        (0.05 M) * (20.00 cm³) = M₂ * (40.00 cm³)\n        M₂ = (0.05 * 20.00) / 40.00 = 0.025 M.\n    5.  So, we are titrating 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n*   **Titration Reaction:**\n    The chemical reaction between acetic acid and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is:\n    CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O\n\n*   **pH at 25% Titration:**\n    1.  At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted into its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COO⁻). This means 75% of the acetic acid remains.\n    2.  This creates a buffer solution containing both the weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻).\n    3.  We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH:\n        pH = pKₐ + log([CH₃COO⁻]/[CH₃COOH])\n    4.  First, calculate the pKₐ from the given Kₐ:\n        pKₐ = -log(Kₐ) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n    5.  The ratio of the concentrations of the conjugate base to the acid is the same as the ratio of the moles, which is 25% / 75% = 1/3.\n    6.  Now, plug the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n        pH = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - log(3) = 4.73 - 0.48 ≈ 4.25\n        A more precise calculation gives pH ≈ 4.26.\n\n*   **pH at the Equivalence Point:**\n    1.  First, we need to find the volume of 0.1 M NaOH required to reach the equivalence point, where all the acetic acid has been neutralized.\n        Moles of acid = MₐVₐ = (0.025 mol/L) * (0.040 L) = 0.001 mol.\n        At the equivalence point, moles of base = moles of acid = 0.001 mol.\n        Volume of base (NaOH) = Moles / Mᵦ = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n    2.  At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to 0.001 mol of sodium acetate (CH₃COONa).\n    3.  The total volume of the solution is the initial volume of the acid plus the volume of NaOH added:\n        Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n    4.  The concentration of the sodium acetate solution is:\n        [CH₃COONa] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n    5.  The acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) is a weak base and will hydrolyze in water, producing OH⁻ ions:\n        CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    6.  We need the base dissociation constant (Kᵦ) for acetate, which can be calculated from the Kₐ of acetic acid and the ion product of water (Kₗ = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴):\n        Kᵦ = Kₗ / Kₐ = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n    7.  We can now calculate the hydroxide ion concentration [OH⁻]:\n        Kᵦ = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻] ≈ [OH⁻]² / [CH₃COO⁻]\n        [OH⁻] = √(Kᵦ * [CH₃COO⁻]) = √(5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ * 0.02) = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n    8.  Calculate the pOH:\n        pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48.\n    9.  Finally, calculate the pH:\n        pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let's run a quick calculation script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given values ---\ninitial_vol_acid_cm3 = 20.00\ninitial_conc_acid = 0.05  # M\nvol_water_cm3 = 20.00\nconc_NaOH = 0.1  # M\nKa_acid = 1.85e-5\n\n# --- Step 1: Dilution of Acetic Acid ---\nfinal_vol_acid_cm3 = initial_vol_acid_cm3 + vol_water_cm3\nconc_diluted_acid = (initial_conc_acid * initial_vol_acid_cm3) / final_vol_acid_cm3\nfinal_vol_acid_L = final_vol_acid_cm3 / 1000.0\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculations for 25% Titration ---\npKa = -math.log10(Ka_acid)\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(0.25 / 0.75)\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculations for Equivalence Point ---\nmoles_acid = conc_diluted_acid * final_vol_acid_L\nvol_NaOH_equiv_L = moles_acid / conc_NaOH\ntotal_vol_equiv_L = final_vol_acid_L + vol_NaOH_equiv_L\nconc_acetate = moles_acid / total_vol_equiv_L\nKw = 1.0e-14\nKb_acetate = Kw / Ka_acid\nconc_OH = math.sqrt(Kb_acetate * conc_acetate)\npOH = -math.log10(conc_OH)\npH_at_equiv = 14.0 - pOH\n\n# --- Print the results ---\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_at_equiv:.2f}\")\n```\npH at 25% titration: 4.26\npH at equivalence point: 8.52\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   pH at 25% titration = 4.26\n*   pH at equivalence point = 8.52\n\nThese values correspond to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n### **Part 1: Initial Dilution**\n\n1.  **Calculate the initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH):**\n    *   Concentration (M) = 0.05 mol/L\n    *   Volume (V) = 20.00 cm³ = 0.020 L\n    *   Moles = M × V = 0.05 mol/L × 0.020 L = 0.001 mol\n\n2.  **Calculate the new concentration after dilution:**\n    *   The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³.\n    *   20.00 cm³ of water is added.\n    *   The new total volume is 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.040 L.\n    *   The new concentration (M₂) is Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.040 L = **0.025 M**.\n    *   So, we are titrating 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n### **Part 2: pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (CH₃COOH) has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), and 75% remains as acetic acid. This forms a buffer solution.\n\n1.  **Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:**\n    *   pH = pKₐ + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n    *   Where [A⁻] is the concentration of the conjugate base (acetate) and [HA] is the concentration of the acid (acetic acid).\n\n2.  **Calculate pKₐ:**\n    *   Kₐ = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKₐ = -log(Kₐ) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n\n3.  **Determine the ratio [A⁻]/[HA]:**\n    *   The ratio of concentrations is equal to the ratio of moles.\n    *   [A⁻]/[HA] = 25% / 75% = 1/3\n\n4.  **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.733 - log(3)\n    *   pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n    *   **pH ≈ 4.26**\n\n### **Part 3: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution contains only the conjugate base, which hydrolyzes water.\n\n1.  **Find the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point:**\n    *   At the equivalence point, moles of acid = moles of base.\n    *   Moles of acid = 0.001 mol (from Part 1).\n    *   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n\n2.  **Calculate the total volume and concentration of acetate at the equivalence point:**\n    *   Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n    *   The moles of acetate (CH₃COO⁻) formed are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 mol.\n    *   Concentration of acetate [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = **0.02 M**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the pH of the resulting salt solution:**\n    *   The acetate ion hydrolyzes water: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant (Kᵦ) for acetate.\n    *   Kᵦ = Kₗ / Kₐ = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰.\n    *   Set up the equilibrium expression: Kᵦ = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   Let [OH⁻] = x. Then [CH₃COOH] = x, and [CH₃COO⁻] ≈ 0.02 M.\n    *   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / 0.02\n    *   x² = (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M.\n\n4.  **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48\n    *   **pH ≈ 8.52**\n\nThe calculated values are 4.26 at 25% titration and 8.52 at the equivalence point.\n\n<<<B>>>"
