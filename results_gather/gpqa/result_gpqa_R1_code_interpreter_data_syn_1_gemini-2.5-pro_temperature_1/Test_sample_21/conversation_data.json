    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct words to complete the statement.\n\n### Part 1: Thermodynamic Strength of Oxygen as an Oxidant\n\n1.  **Definition of Oxidant Strength:** The strength of an oxidizing agent (oxidant) is determined by its tendency to be reduced. In electrochemistry, this is quantified by the standard reduction potential (E°). A more positive E° value indicates a stronger oxidant because the reduction reaction is more spontaneous.\n2.  **Oxygen Reduction Half-Reactions:** We need to compare the standard reduction potential of oxygen in acidic and basic solutions.\n    *   **In acidic solution:** The half-reaction is O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l), which has a standard reduction potential of **E° = +1.23 V**.\n    *   **In basic solution:** The half-reaction is O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq), which has a standard reduction potential of **E° = +0.40 V**.\n3.  **Comparison:** Comparing the two values, +1.23 V is significantly more positive than +0.40 V.\n4.  **Conclusion for Part 1:** Since the reduction potential is lower in basic solution, oxygen is a thermodynamically **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions than it is in acidic solutions. This eliminates options B and D.\n\n### Part 2: Kinetic Rate of Oxygen Reaction\n\n1.  **Definition of Kinetic Rate:** Kinetics deals with the speed (rate) of a reaction, which is determined by the activation energy of the reaction pathway, not the overall thermodynamic driving force (E°).\n2.  **Factors Affecting Oxygen's Reaction Rate:** The reduction of molecular oxygen (O₂) is known to be a kinetically slow process, even though it is often thermodynamically favorable. There are two main reasons for this:\n    *   **Strong O=O Bond:** The dioxygen molecule has a strong double bond (bond dissociation energy ≈ 498 kJ/mol). Breaking this bond requires a large amount of energy, leading to a high activation energy for the overall reaction.\n    *   **Complex Reaction Mechanism:** The overall reduction of O₂ to H₂O is a four-electron transfer process. Such multi-electron transfers are complex and typically proceed through a series of steps involving intermediates (like superoxide, O₂⁻, and peroxide, H₂O₂). The initial one-electron reduction step is often difficult and acts as a bottleneck, slowing down the entire reaction.\n3.  **Conclusion for Part 2:** Due to the high activation energy, the uncatalyzed reaction of oxygen as an oxidant is generally **slower**, both in acidic and basic solutions. The question asks specifically about acidic solutions, where despite the very high thermodynamic potential (+1.23 V), the reaction remains kinetically slow without a catalyst. This is why many thermodynamically favorable oxidations by air (e.g., a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen gas) do not occur at an appreciable rate at room temperature.\n\n### Final Combination\n\n*   From Part 1, the first blank is **weaker**.\n*   From Part 2, the second blank is **slower**.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination is **weaker - slower**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
