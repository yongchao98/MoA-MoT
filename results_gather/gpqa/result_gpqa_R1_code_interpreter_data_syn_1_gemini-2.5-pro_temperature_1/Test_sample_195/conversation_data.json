    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the principle of conservation of energy.** In a closed system, the total energy is constant. For the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of its relativistic kinetic energy, its rest energy, and its potential energy.\n\n2.  **Define the relevant energy terms.**\n    *   The potential energy of a harmonic oscillator with spring constant $k$ at a displacement $x$ from equilibrium is given by $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$. This form is the same in both classical and relativistic mechanics, as it's derived from the force law $F=-kx$.\n    *   The total relativistic energy of a particle with mass $m$ and speed $v$ is $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $mc^2$ is the rest energy and $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The total energy of the oscillating system, which must be conserved, is the sum of the particle's total relativistic energy and its potential energy: $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x)$.\n\n3.  **Apply the conservation of energy at two key points in the oscillation.**\n    *   **Point 1: Maximum displacement (amplitude).**\n        At the maximum amplitude, $x = A$, the mass momentarily stops. Therefore, its speed is $v=0$.\n        The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n        The potential energy is at its maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n        The total energy at this point is:\n        $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n    *   **Point 2: Equilibrium position.**\n        At the equilibrium position, $x = 0$, the potential energy is zero: $U(0) = 0$.\n        The speed of the mass is at its maximum, $v = v_{max}$.\n        The Lorentz factor is at its maximum value, $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        The total energy at this point is:\n        $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$.\n\n4.  **Equate the total energy at these two points.**\n    Since the total energy is conserved, the energy at the maximum amplitude must equal the energy at the equilibrium position:\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n5.  **Solve for the maximum Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_{max}$.**\n    Divide both sides by $mc^2$:\n    $\\frac{mc^2}{mc^2} + \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2} = \\frac{\\gamma_{max}mc^2}{mc^2}$\n    $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\gamma_{max}$\n\n6.  **Solve for the maximum speed, $v_{max}$, using the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$.**\n    We have the relationship $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$. We need to rearrange this to solve for $v_{max}$.\n    *   Square both sides: $\\gamma_{max}^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}$\n    *   Take the reciprocal: $\\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2} = 1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$\n    *   Rearrange to isolate the velocity term: $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}$\n    *   Multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root: $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{max}^2}}$\n\n7.  **Substitute the expression for $\\gamma_{max}$ into the equation for $v_{max}$.**\n    Substitute $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$ into the equation from step 6:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n8.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The derived expression for $v_{max}$ matches option C.\n\n    *   A) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}}$ (Incorrect form and dimensionally inconsistent)\n    *   B) $v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$ (This is the non-relativistic limit)\n    *   C) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$ (Matches our derivation)\n    *   D) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}}$ (Incorrect form)\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.\n\n<<<C>>>"
