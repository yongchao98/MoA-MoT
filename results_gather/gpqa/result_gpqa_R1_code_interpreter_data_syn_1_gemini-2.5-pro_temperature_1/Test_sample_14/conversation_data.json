    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to compare the transit probabilities of two exoplanets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, to determine which one is a better target for observation. This comparison will be in the form of a ratio of their probabilities.\n\n2.  **Recall the Transit Probability Formula:** The geometric probability of a planet transiting its host star is given by the ratio of the star's radius (`R_s`) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (`a`). For a circular orbit, this is:\n    `Prob = R_s / a`\n    (A more precise formula is `(R_s + R_p) / a`, where `R_p` is the planet's radius. However, since both planets are Earth-like and have the same mass, we can assume `R_p1 ≈ R_p2`. As we will see, using this more precise formula leads to the same final ratio).\n\n3.  **Set up the Ratio of Probabilities:** We want to find the ratio `Prob_1 / Prob_2`.\n    `Prob_1 = R_s1 / a_1`\n    `Prob_2 = R_s2 / a_2`\n    The ratio is `Prob_1 / Prob_2 = (R_s1 / a_1) / (R_s2 / a_2) = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (a_2 / a_1)`.\n\n4.  **Incorporate Given Information about the Stars:** The problem states that both host stars have the same radii, so `R_s1 = R_s2`. This simplifies the ratio significantly:\n    `Prob_1 / Prob_2 = (1) * (a_2 / a_1) = a_2 / a_1`.\n    This means the planet with the smaller semi-major axis will have the higher transit probability.\n\n5.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Known Quantities:** To find the ratio `a_2 / a_1`, we must use Kepler's Third Law, which relates a planet's orbital period (`P`), its semi-major axis (`a`), and the mass of its host star (`M_s`). The law states:\n    `P^2 = (4π² / (G * M_s)) * a^3` (assuming the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star's).\n    Rearranging to solve for `a`, we get:\n    `a^3 = (G * M_s * P²) / (4π²)`, which means `a` is proportional to `(M_s * P²)^(1/3)`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** Now we can write the ratio `a_2 / a_1` in terms of the stellar masses and orbital periods:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = [(M_s2 * P_2²) / (M_s1 * P_1²)]^(1/3)`\n\n7.  **Substitute the Specific Values from the Problem:**\n    - The mass of Star_1 is twice the mass of Star_2: `M_s1 = 2 * M_s2`.\n    - The period of Planet_2 is three times the period of Planet_1: `P_2 = 3 * P_1`.\n\n    Substitute these into the equation:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = [(M_s2 * (3 * P_1)²) / ((2 * M_s2) * P_1²)]^(1/3)`\n    `a_2 / a_1 = [(M_s2 * 9 * P_1²) / (2 * M_s2 * P_1²)]^(1/3)`\n\n8.  **Simplify the Expression:** The terms `M_s2` and `P_1²` cancel out:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = (9 / 2)^(1/3) = 4.5^(1/3)`\n\n9.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:** The ratio of probabilities `Prob_1 / Prob_2` is equal to `a_2 / a_1`. We need to calculate the cube root of 4.5. A simple calculation can provide the value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n# The ratio of probabilities is (9/2)^(1/3)\nratio = (4.5)**(1/3)\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n1.6509635993128485\n</execute_code>\n\n10. **Interpret the Result:** The calculation shows that `Prob_1 / Prob_2 ≈ 1.65`. This means the transit probability for Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than for Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1.\n\n11. **Match with Options:**\n    - A) Planet_2 is preferred... (Incorrect, Planet_1 is preferred)\n    - B) Planet_2 is preferred... (Incorrect, Planet_1 is preferred)\n    - C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit. (This matches our result).\n    - D) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability... (Incorrect value).\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The probability of a planet transiting its host star is given by the ratio of the stellar radius to the planet's semi-major axis, `P_transit = R_star / a`.\n\nLet's denote the parameters for Planet_1 with subscript 1 and for Planet_2 with subscript 2.\nWe are looking for the ratio of the probabilities: `Ratio = P_transit_1 / P_transit_2`.\n\n`Ratio = (R_star_1 / a_1) / (R_star_2 / a_2)`\n`Ratio = (R_star_1 / R_star_2) * (a_2 / a_1)`\n\nFrom the problem statement, we know:\n1.  The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: `P_2 = 3 * P_1`.\n2.  The mass of the host star of Planet_1 is twice that of Planet_2: `M_star_1 = 2 * M_star_2`.\n3.  Both host stars have the same radii: `R_star_1 = R_star_2`.\n\nSubstituting `R_star_1 = R_star_2` into our ratio equation, we get:\n`Ratio = (1) * (a_2 / a_1) = a_2 / a_1`\n\nTo find the ratio `a_2 / a_1`, we use Kepler's Third Law, which states that the square of the orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (`a`) and inversely proportional to the mass of the star (`M_star`):\n`P^2 ∝ a^3 / M_star`\nRearranging for `a`, we get:\n`a^3 ∝ P^2 * M_star`\nSo, `a ∝ (P^2 * M_star)^(1/3)`\n\nNow we can write the ratio `a_2 / a_1`:\n`a_2 / a_1 = [(P_2^2 * M_star_2) / (P_1^2 * M_star_1)]^(1/3)`\n\nSubstitute the known relationships: `P_2 = 3 * P_1` and `M_star_1 = 2 * M_star_2`.\n`a_2 / a_1 = [((3 * P_1)^2 * M_star_2) / (P_1^2 * (2 * M_star_2))]^(1/3)`\n`a_2 / a_1 = [(9 * P_1^2 * M_star_2) / (2 * P_1^2 * M_star_2)]^(1/3)`\n\nThe `P_1^2` and `M_star_2` terms cancel out:\n`a_2 / a_1 = (9 / 2)^(1/3) = 4.5^(1/3)`\n\nThe code output shows that `4.5^(1/3)` is approximately 1.65.\nSince `Ratio = a_2 / a_1`, the ratio of the transit probabilities `P_transit_1 / P_transit_2` is approximately 1.65.\n\nThis means that Planet_1 has a ~1.65 times higher probability of transiting than Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should prefer to observe Planet_1. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
