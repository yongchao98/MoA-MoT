    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Information Provided**\n\n*   **Molecular Structure:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we start with a benzene ring (C₆H₄) that has two substituents.\n*   **Total Carbon Atoms:** The entire molecule contains 8 carbon atoms. Since the benzene ring itself has 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   **Carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents must contain a C=O double bond.\n    *   **Aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X):** This tells us that one substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n**2. Deduce the Structure of the Substituents**\n\n*   We have two substituents on the benzene ring.\n*   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X). This accounts for 0 carbon atoms.\n*   The other substituent must therefore contain both remaining carbon atoms (2 carbons) and the carbonyl group.\n*   A two-carbon group containing a carbonyl is an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n*   Therefore, the two substituents are a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n\n**3. Assemble the Molecular Structure**\n\n*   Combining the benzene ring with the two substituents, the compound must be a **haloacetophenone**. The general structure is X-C₆H₄-COCH₃.\n*   Let's check if this structure fits all the criteria:\n    *   Di-substituted aromatic ring: Yes.\n    *   Total carbons: 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl group) = 8. Yes.\n    *   Carbonyl group: Yes, in the acetyl group.\n    *   Aromatic-halogen bond: Yes, the halogen is directly on the ring.\n*   The molecular formula would be C₈H₇XO, which means the molecule has a total of 7 hydrogen atoms (4 on the ring, 3 in the methyl group).\n\n**4. Analyze the 1H NMR Options**\n\nNow we must find the 1H NMR spectrum that matches a haloacetophenone structure. Let's assume the most symmetric isomer, para-substitution (1,4-disubstitution), as it gives a simple, recognizable NMR pattern.\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at **9.9 ppm** is highly characteristic of an **aldehyde** proton (-CHO). Our structure is a ketone, not an aldehyde. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   There are no signals in the typical aromatic region (approximately 6.5-8.5 ppm). This spectrum cannot belong to an aromatic compound. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** The two signals at **7.8 ppm (2H, doublet)** and **7.6 ppm (2H, doublet)** are a classic pattern for a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**. The two sets of equivalent protons split each other into doublets. The chemical shifts are downfield, which is consistent with the presence of two electron-withdrawing groups (the halogen and the acetyl group).\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** The signal at **2.3 ppm (3H, singlet)** is characteristic of a **methyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon (-COCH₃)**. It is a singlet because there are no protons on the adjacent carbon atom to cause splitting.\n    *   This spectrum perfectly matches the structure of a p-haloacetophenone. The total number of protons is 2 + 2 + 3 = 7, which is correct.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   The pattern of signals is not consistent with a di-substituted aromatic ring. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe compound is a haloacetophenone. The 1H NMR data in option C, showing a para-substituted aromatic pattern and a methyl ketone singlet, is the only one that correctly represents this structure.\n\n<<<C>>>"
