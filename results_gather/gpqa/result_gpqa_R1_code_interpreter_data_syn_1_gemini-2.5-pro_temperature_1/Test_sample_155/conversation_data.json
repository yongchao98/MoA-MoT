    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. The molecule is symmetric.\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process:\n    1.  Treatment with mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid) results in epoxidation. This is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    2.  Treatment with aqueous acid (H3O+) causes acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. This occurs via a backside attack by a water molecule, which is an *anti*-addition.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The combination of these two steps (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene, meaning two hydroxyl (-OH) groups are added to the opposite faces of the original double bond.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** There is a well-established rule for the stereochemistry of anti-additions to alkenes: a *trans*-alkene undergoing an *anti*-addition results in a *meso* product (if the substituents on the alkene are identical, which they are here - both are propyl groups). A useful mnemonic for this is **TAM: Trans-Anti-Meso**.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The product is meso-octane-4,5-diol. A meso compound is achiral and has stereocenters, typically with an (R,S) or (S,R) configuration that are the same molecule due to internal symmetry.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. This molecule is also symmetric.\n*   **Reagents:** The reagents are the same as in Reaction 1, so the overall transformation is also *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The stereochemical rule for anti-addition to a *cis*-alkene is that it produces a *racemic mixture* of enantiomers. A useful mnemonic for this is **CAR: Cis-Anti-Racemic**.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The product is a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other (enantiomers).\n\n**Step 3: Characterize the Final Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct chemical species (stereoisomers):\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is important:\n*   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the Chromatogram for Standard (Achiral) HPLC**\n\n*   Standard HPLC columns are achiral. They separate compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity, size, and boiling point.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties (in an achiral environment) and therefore cannot be separated by an achiral column. They will elute at the same time and appear as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated by an achiral column. They will elute at different times and appear as separate peaks.\n*   In our mixture, the enantiomeric pair ((4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol) will produce **one peak**. The meso-diol is a diastereomer to them and will produce a **second peak**.\n*   **Conclusion for standard HPLC: 2 peaks.**\n\n**Step 5: Predict the Chromatogram for Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC columns have a chiral stationary phase. This allows the column to interact differently with each enantiomer of a chiral compound.\n*   Chiral HPLC can separate **both diastereomers and enantiomers**.\n*   Each of the three stereoisomers in the mixture will have a unique interaction with the chiral stationary phase and will elute at a different time.\n*   Therefore, (4R,5R)-diol will be one peak, (4S,5S)-diol will be a second peak, and meso-octane-4,5-diol will be a third peak.\n*   **Conclusion for chiral HPLC: 3 peaks.**\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe analysis shows that the combined product mixture will exhibit **2 peaks** on a standard (achiral) HPLC column and **3 peaks** on a chiral HPLC column. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
