    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data to Identify Structural Fragments\n\n*   **Compound Type:** The problem states the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This implies a benzene ring with two substituents, with a core formula of C6H4.\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** The presence of an ester group (-COO-) is confirmed. An ester contains a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H:** Two signals suggest a symmetrically substituted ring, most likely a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. This accounts for the C6H4 part of the structure.\n    *   **Vinyl-H:** There are two signals for vinyl protons (protons on a C=C double bond). One is a doublet (d) and the other is a doublet of quartets (dq). This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3).\n        *   The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets.\n        *   The other vinyl proton is split only by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet.\n        *   This confirms the presence of a -CH=CH-CH3 fragment.\n    *   **-CH₃ Groups:** There are two signals for methyl groups. One of these is accounted for by the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). Therefore, there must be a second, chemically different methyl group elsewhere in the molecule.\n    *   **-CH₂ Groups:** The problem explicitly states there are **no signals** for -CH₂- groups. This is a crucial piece of information that rules out fragments like ethyl (-CH₂CH₃), propyl, etc.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency) tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n\nFrom the structural fragments identified:\n*   Aromatic ring: 1 ring + 3 double bonds = 4 DBE\n*   Ester group (C=O): 1 double bond = 1 DBE\n*   Vinyl group (C=C): 1 double bond = 1 DBE\n*   **Total DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6**\n\nAny valid chemical formula for this compound must have a DBE of 6. Let's check the given options. The formula for DBE is `C - H/2 + 1`.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_dbe(formula_str):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) for a chemical formula like 'C11H12O2'.\"\"\"\n    import re\n    c_match = re.search(r'C(\\d+)', formula_str)\n    h_match = re.search(r'H(\\d+)', formula_str)\n    C = int(c_match.group(1)) if c_match else 0\n    H = int(h_match.group(1)) if h_match else 0\n    dbe = C - (H / 2) + 1\n    return dbe\n\noptions = {\n    \"A\": \"C12H14O2\",\n    \"B\": \"C11H12O2\",\n    \"C\": \"C12H12O2\",\n    \"D\": \"C11H14O2\"\n}\n\ndbe_from_structure = 6\nprint(f\"DBE required based on structural analysis: {dbe_from_structure}\\n\")\n\nfor label, formula in options.items():\n    dbe_val = calculate_dbe(formula)\n    print(f\"Option {label}) {formula}: DBE = {dbe_val}\")\n\n```\nExecution Output:\n```\nDBE required based on structural analysis: 6\n\nOption A) C12H14O2: DBE = 6.0\nOption B) C11H12O2: DBE = 6.0\nOption C) C12H12O2: DBE = 7.0\nOption D) C11H14O2: DBE = 5.0\n```\nFrom the DBE calculation, we can immediately rule out options C (DBE=7) and D (DBE=5). We are left with options A (C12H14O2) and B (C11H12O2).\n\n### 3. Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula\n\nNow we assemble the identified fragments to build the molecule and determine its formula.\nThe required pieces are:\n1.  A di-substituted benzene ring: **C₆H₄**\n2.  An ester functional group: **-COO-**\n3.  A propenyl group: **-CH=CH-CH₃** (which has a formula of C₃H₅)\n4.  A second, non-equivalent methyl group: **-CH₃**\n5.  A constraint: **No -CH₂- groups**.\n\nLet's combine these pieces. The two substituents on the C₆H₄ ring must be formed from the propenyl group, the ester group, and the second methyl group.\n*   **Substituent 1:** The propenyl group, -CH=CH-CH₃.\n*   **Substituent 2:** This must be formed from the ester group and the second methyl group, without creating any -CH₂- groups. The two possibilities are:\n    *   A methoxycarbonyl group: -COOCH₃\n    *   An acetoxy group: -O-C(=O)CH₃\n\nLet's calculate the total molecular formula if these fragments are assembled:\n*   **Core:** C₆H₄\n*   **Substituent 1:** C₃H₅\n*   **Substituent 2 (either possibility):** C₂H₃O₂\n*   **Total Formula** = C(6+3+2) H(4+5+3) O₂ = **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**\n\nThis molecular formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂) perfectly matches all the spectroscopic data and corresponds to option B.\n\n### 4. Rule out the Remaining Option\n\nLet's consider why option A (C₁₂H₁₄O₂) is incorrect.\nTo get from our derived formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ to C₁₂H₁₄O₂, we would need to add one carbon and two hydrogen atoms (a \"CH₂\" unit).\nIf we add a CH₂ group to the molecule (for example, by changing the methyl ester to an ethyl ester, -COOCH₂CH₃), it would introduce a -CH₂- signal into the ¹H NMR spectrum. However, the problem explicitly states that there are no such signals. Any other plausible way to add a CH₂ unit while maintaining the core structure would also either create a -CH₂- signal or violate another piece of the given data (e.g., the aromatic substitution pattern).\nTherefore, the formula C₁₂H₁₄O₂ is inconsistent with the provided information.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only formula that is consistent with all the provided data (aromatic ring, ester, propenyl group, two methyls, no methylenes, and the resulting DBE of 6) is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The analysis of the spectroscopic data allows for the step-by-step deduction of the compound's structure and, consequently, its molecular formula.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the ¹H NMR and FTIR Data to Identify Key Structural Fragments\n\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** The problem states the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. The presence of two signals for aromatic protons (Aromatic-H) suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely a 1,4- (para-) substituted benzene ring. This accounts for a **C₆H₄** core.\n*   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (**-COO-**). This group contains a C=O double bond.\n*   **Vinyl Group:** The ¹H NMR shows two vinyl protons with specific splitting patterns: one doublet (d) and one doublet of quartets (dq). This is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. The proton on the carbon bonded to the methyl group is split by both the other vinyl proton and the methyl protons, resulting in a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl proton is only split by the first one, giving a doublet. This fragment also accounts for one of the two methyl signals.\n*   **Methyl Groups:** The spectrum shows two distinct signals for methyl (-CH₃) groups. One is part of the propenyl group identified above. The other must be part of the second substituent.\n*   **Absence of -CH₂- Groups:** The problem explicitly states there are no signals for methylene (-CH₂-) groups. This is a critical constraint that eliminates possibilities like ethyl esters (-COOCH₂CH₃) or other alkyl chains containing a -CH₂- unit.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) represents the total number of rings and π-bonds in the molecule. Based on our identified fragments:\n*   Aromatic ring = 1 ring + 3 π-bonds = 4 DBE\n*   Ester group (C=O) = 1 π-bond = 1 DBE\n*   Vinyl group (C=C) = 1 π-bond = 1 DBE\n*   **Total required DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6**\n\nThe code execution calculated the DBE for each of the possible formulas:\n*   A) C12H14O2: DBE = 6\n*   B) C11H12O2: DBE = 6\n*   C) C12H12O2: DBE = 7 (Incorrect)\n*   D) C11H14O2: DBE = 5 (Incorrect)\n\nThis calculation eliminates options C and D, leaving A and B as possibilities.\n\n### Step 3: Assemble the Fragments to Determine the Molecular Formula\n\nLet's combine the pieces we've identified to construct the full molecule and find its formula:\n1.  **C₆H₄** (di-substituted benzene core)\n2.  **-CH=CH-CH₃** (propenyl group, one substituent)\n3.  An ester group and a methyl group must form the second substituent without creating any -CH₂- groups. The only way to do this is to form a methyl ester, **-COOCH₃**.\n\nNow, let's sum the atoms from these assembled parts:\n*   From C₆H₄: 6 Carbons, 4 Hydrogens\n*   From -CH=CH-CH₃: 3 Carbons, 5 Hydrogens\n*   From -COOCH₃: 2 Carbons, 3 Hydrogens, 2 Oxygens\n\n**Total Calculation:**\n*   Carbons: 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n*   Hydrogens: 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n*   Oxygens: 2\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\nThis formula matches option B. It has the correct DBE of 6 and accounts for all the features observed in the spectra, including the crucial absence of -CH₂- groups. Option A (C₁₂H₁₄O₂) has the correct DBE but contains an extra CH₂ unit, which would produce a signal in the ¹H NMR spectrum, contradicting the given information.\n\n<<<B>>>"
