    "An organic compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are the presence of a chiral center or other structural features like axial or planar chirality. Let's analyze each molecule:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is a biphenyl derivative with bulky substituents at all four ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). The substituents are methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₃) and nitro (-NO₂) groups.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The presence of these large groups creates significant steric hindrance, which severely restricts the rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This phenomenon is known as atropisomerism. Because the rotation is hindered, the two rings cannot become coplanar. The molecule gets locked into a specific twisted conformation. This conformation lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making the molecule chiral. Therefore, it can exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers) and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is the methyl ester of lactic acid, with the chemical formula CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: To check for chirality, we look for chiral centers. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group):\n        *   Group 1: -H (Hydrogen)\n        *   Group 2: -OH (Hydroxyl group)\n        *   Group 3: -CH₃ (Methyl group)\n        *   Group 4: -COOCH₃ (Methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   Since all four groups attached to this carbon are different, it is a chiral center. The presence of a single chiral center makes the entire molecule chiral. Thus, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    *   **Structure**: This molecule has the formula (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It consists of a carbonyl group bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The molecule does not contain any chiral centers. The central carbon is sp² hybridized. The molecule possesses elements of symmetry. Specifically, it has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral and cannot be optically active. Therefore, benzophenone does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   **Structure**: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis**: The molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has the plane of the molecule itself as a plane of symmetry. Furthermore, dimethyl fumarate has a center of inversion located at the midpoint of the carbon-carbon double bond. The presence of either a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion makes a molecule achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nBased on the analysis, only compound 1 (due to atropisomerism) and compound 2 (due to a chiral center) are chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the correct option includes 1 and 2.\n\n```python\n# This script uses the RDKit library to programmatically check for tetrahedral chiral centers.\n# Note: Standard algorithms for finding chiral centers do not typically identify atropisomerism\n# automatically from a non-isomeric SMILES string.

    "Optical isomerism is exhibited by chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A molecule's chirality can arise from several features, most commonly a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality (as seen in some substituted biphenyls).\n\nLet's examine each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This is a biphenyl compound. The bond connecting the two phenyl rings can theoretically rotate. However, there are large, bulky substituents (nitro groups and methoxycarbonyl groups) at all four positions ortho to this bond (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). These bulky groups clash with each other, severely restricting rotation around the central carbon-carbon single bond. This phenomenon is called atropisomerism. Because the rings are forced out of plane and cannot freely rotate to become planar, the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is locked in a chiral conformation. As a result, it is non-superimposable on its mirror image and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. To determine if it's chiral, we look for a chiral center. The second carbon atom (C2) is bonded to four different groups:\n    *   a hydrogen atom (-H)\n    *   a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    *   a methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since C2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. The presence of this chiral center makes the molecule chiral and thus optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. The central carbon atom is part of a carbonyl group and is bonded to only three groups (two phenyl rings and one oxygen atom). It is not a chiral center. The molecule as a whole is symmetric; it has a plane of symmetry that bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings and passes through the C=O bond. Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral and do not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene, with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule is planar. Any planar molecule possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself). Furthermore, dimethyl fumarate has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral, so it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and will show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>"
