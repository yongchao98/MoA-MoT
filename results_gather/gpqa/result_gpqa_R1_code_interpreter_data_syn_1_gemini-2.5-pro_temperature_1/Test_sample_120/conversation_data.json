    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted epoxide fused to a cyclohexane ring. The name indicates the following:\n        *   `bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`: A 6-membered ring (cyclohexane) fused with a 3-membered ring (the epoxide). The epoxide bridge is between carbons C1 and C6. The oxygen is atom 7.\n        *   `1,3,4-trimethyl`: Methyl groups are located on carbons C1, C3, and C4 of the cyclohexane ring.\n        *   `(1R,3R,4R,6S)`: This defines the absolute stereochemistry at the chiral centers.\n    *   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), also known as a Gilman reagent. It is a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n    *   **Reaction:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide.\n\n2.  **Determine the Regioselectivity (Where the Nucleophile Attacks):**\n    *   The problem states: \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\"\n    *   The epoxide ring is formed by C1, C6, and O7.\n    *   Carbon C1 is attached to a methyl group, C2, C6, and O7. It is a quaternary carbon (tetrasubstituted).\n    *   Carbon C6 is attached to a hydrogen, C1, C5, and O7. It is a tertiary carbon (trisubstituted).\n    *   Therefore, **C6 is the less hindered carbon**, and the nucleophilic methyl group will attack C6.\n\n3.  **Determine the Stereoselectivity (How the Nucleophile Attacks):**\n    *   The problem states: \"inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\" This is characteristic of an Sₙ2-type reaction.\n    *   The attack occurs from the side opposite to the C-O bond (backside attack).\n    *   The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks C6, breaking the C6-O bond. The oxygen remains attached to C1 and, after acidic workup, becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The result is a cyclohexanol derivative where the -OH group is at the position of the original C1, and a new methyl group is at the position of the original C6.\n\n4.  **Determine the Structure and IUPAC Name of the Product Skeleton:**\n    *   The product is a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The principal functional group is the alcohol (-OH), so the carbon it's attached to (original C1) is designated as C1 in the product's IUPAC name.\n    *   This C1 also has the original methyl group from the starting material.\n    *   The new methyl group from the cuprate is on the adjacent carbon (original C6), which becomes C2 in the product name (numbering to give substituents the lowest locants).\n    *   The other original methyl groups are at C3 and C4 of the starting material. In the new numbering scheme, these become C5 and C4, respectively.\n    *   Product numbering: New C1 = Old C1; New C2 = Old C6; New C3 = Old C5; New C4 = Old C4; New C5 = Old C3; New C6 = Old C2.\n    *   The methyl groups are at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n    *   Therefore, the product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options A and C.\n\n5.  **Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   The configurations of the chiral centers that are not part of the reaction (old C1, C3, C4) are retained.\n    *   The configuration of the chiral center that is attacked (old C6) is inverted.\n\n    *   **New C1 (Old C1):** Configuration is retained. It was **R**.\n    *   **New C4 (Old C4):** Configuration is retained. It was **R**.\n    *   **New C5 (Old C3):** Configuration is retained. It was **R**.\n    *   **New C2 (Old C6):** Configuration is inverted. The starting configuration was **S**. An inversion of stereochemistry means the 3D arrangement of the groups is flipped (e.g., a group that was 'down' is pushed 'up' by the incoming nucleophile from 'down'). We must determine the resulting R/S designation based on the new structure and Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities.\n\n    *   **Let's analyze the inversion at C6 -> C2:**\n        *   **At Old C6:** The configuration is S. The CIP priorities are O(1) > C1(2) > C5(3) > H(4).\n        *   **Reaction:** A backside attack replaces the C6-O bond with a C6-Me bond. The geometry inverts.\n        *   **At New C2 (Old C6):** The groups are now C1, C5 (which is new C3), H, and a new Me.\n        *   **New CIP priorities at C2:** The priority of the attached groups changes. C1 (bearing an OH group) is priority 1. C3 (a CH₂ group in the ring) is priority 2. The new methyl group is priority 3. Hydrogen is priority 4. So, C1(1) > C3(2) > Me(3) > H(4).\n        *   **Determining the new R/S label:** We must determine the configuration from the inverted geometry. The SN2 attack forces the substituents to flip their relative positions. If the original H at C6 was, for example, *alpha* (dashed, pointing down), the inversion would push it to *beta* (wedged, pointing up) as the new methyl group attacks from the *alpha* face.\n        *   Let's assume the starting epoxide O was *beta* (wedged). Then the H at C6 must be *alpha* (dashed) for the molecule to have S configuration.\n        *   After inversion, the new Me is *alpha* (dashed) and H is *beta* (wedged).\n        *   To determine the configuration at New C2, we look at the arrangement: C1(1), C3(2), Me(3, dashed), H(4, wedged).\n        *   According to the CIP rules, when the lowest priority group (H, priority 4) is wedged (pointing towards the viewer), we determine the direction of the sequence 1 -> 2 -> 3 and then reverse the result.\n        *   The sequence C1 -> C3 -> Me traces a clockwise (R) path.\n        *   Since H(4) is wedged, we reverse R to S.\n        *   Therefore, the configuration at New C2 is **S**.\n\n6.  **Assemble the Final Product Name:**\n    *   Skeleton: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n    *   Stereochemistry:\n        *   C1: **R**\n        *   C2: **S**\n        *   C4: **R**\n        *   C5: **R**\n    *   The full name is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   This result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
