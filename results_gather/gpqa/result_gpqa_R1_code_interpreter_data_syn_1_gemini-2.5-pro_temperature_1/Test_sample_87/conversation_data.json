    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the key components of the experiment:**\n    *   **Antigen:** Rotavirus inner capsid proteins. This is the molecule that will trigger the immune response.\n    *   **Location:** The experiment traces the antigen to the Peyer's patches. Peyer's patches are a type of gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and are critical secondary lymphoid organs for initiating immune responses to intestinal antigens.\n    *   **Cells:** The focus is on a \"proliferating cell population\" isolated from these Peyer's patches. Proliferation (rapid cell division) is a hallmark of lymphocyte activation after encountering an antigen.\n    *   **Genetic Analysis:** The \"variable heavy chain gene\" of these proliferating cells is sequenced.\n    *   **Observation:** The sequencing reveals \"high variability\" in this specific gene region.\n\n2.  **Analyze the biological context:**\n    *   The introduction of a viral protein into the gut via oral gavage simulates a natural infection.\n    *   The immune system's response in the Peyer's patches will involve B lymphocytes (B cells) and T lymphocytes (T cells).\n    *   The mention of the \"variable heavy chain gene\" specifically points towards B cells, as this gene is part of the B cell receptor (BCR) and the antibody it will eventually secrete.\n    *   When B cells are activated by an antigen in a secondary lymphoid organ, they form structures called germinal centers. Inside germinal centers, these B cells proliferate rapidly and undergo a process of affinity maturation to improve how strongly their antibodies bind to the antigen.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the options based on the observation of \"high variability in the variable heavy chain gene\":**\n\n    *   **A) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system. It involves a cascade of proteins in the blood that helps clear pathogens. It does not involve genetic changes in lymphocytes and therefore cannot explain the variability in the variable heavy chain gene.\n\n    *   **B) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process *does* occur in activated, proliferating B cells within germinal centers. However, CSR changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain gene (e.g., switching from producing IgM to IgA or IgG). It does *not* affect the *variable* region. Therefore, it does not explain the observed variability in the variable region.\n\n    *   **C) V(D)J recombination:** This is the genetic recombination process that creates the initial, vast diversity of B cell receptors (and T cell receptors). Crucially, this process occurs in the bone marrow during the development of B cells, *before* they ever encounter an antigen. The cells in the Peyer's patch are mature cells that are already responding to an antigen. V(D)J recombination has already occurred for these cells; it is not the process happening *during* the active response.\n\n    *   **D) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a process that occurs specifically in activated, proliferating B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). SHM deliberately introduces a high rate of point mutations into the genes encoding the *variable* regions of the antibody heavy and light chains. This creates a population of B cells with slight variations in their antigen-binding sites. B cells whose mutations lead to higher affinity binding are then selected to survive and proliferate further. This process is the direct cause of the \"high variability\" observed in the variable heavy chain gene of a proliferating B cell population during an active immune response.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating cells isolated from a Peyer's patch following antigen challenge is the classic signature of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
