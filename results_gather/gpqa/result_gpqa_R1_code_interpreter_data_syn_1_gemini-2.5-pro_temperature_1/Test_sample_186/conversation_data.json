    "To solve this problem, we need to determine for each of the six listed stars whether it is detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory. A star is considered detectable if two conditions are met:\n1.  The star must be observable from the Paranal Observatory's location in the Southern Hemisphere.\n2.  It must be bright enough to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 in a 1-hour exposure with ESPRESSO on a single 8m VLT.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the performance limit of ESPRESSO\n\nThe problem provides a link to the ESPRESSO overview. The key performance metric mentioned on that page is: \"ESPRESSO is expected to reach a S/N of 10 at magnitude V=19 in 1 hour of exposure time in the 1-UT mode.\"\nThis exactly matches the conditions given in the question (S/N=10, 1-hour exposure, one 8m VLT). Therefore, any star with an apparent V magnitude (m_V) of 19.0 or brighter (i.e., m_V ≤ 19.0) will meet the S/N requirement.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the observability of each star from Paranal\n\nThe Paranal Observatory is located at a latitude of approximately -24.6°. A star's observability depends on its declination (DEC).\n*   Stars with a southern declination are well-placed for observation.\n*   Stars near the celestial equator (DEC ≈ 0°) are also observable.\n*   Stars with a very high northern declination are not visible from the Southern Hemisphere. A star with declination δ will never rise above the horizon at a latitude φ if δ > 90° + φ. For Paranal, this means stars with DEC > 90° - 24.6° = +65.4° are difficult or impossible to observe. Polaris, at DEC ≈ +89°, is a northern circumpolar star and is never visible from Paranal.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze each star\n\nWe will now calculate the apparent V magnitude for each star and check both the observability and brightness conditions. The apparent magnitude (m_V) is calculated from the absolute magnitude (M_V) and distance (d, in parsecs) using the distance modulus formula:\n`m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5`\n\nI will use a Python script to perform the calculations accurately and check the conditions for all stars.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_apparent_magnitude(M_V, d_pc):\n    \"\"\"Calculates apparent magnitude from absolute magnitude and distance.\"\"\"\n    # Distance modulus: m_V - M_V = 5 * log10(d) - 5\n    return M_V + 5 * math.log10(d_pc) - 5\n\n# --- Star Data ---\n# Structure: { name: (apparent_V_mag, declination_deg, is_hypothetical, M_V, distance_pc) }\n# For known stars, apparent_V_mag is given.

    "To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we must check two conditions for each star:\n1.  **Observability:** The star must be visible from the Paranal Observatory's location in Chile (latitude ≈ -24.6° S). Stars with very high northern declinations are not visible from the Southern Hemisphere. A conservative limit is that a star's declination (DEC) must be less than approximately +65°.\n2.  **Brightness:** The star must be bright enough to achieve the required signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). The problem states that ESPRESSO can achieve an S/N of 10 in a 1-hour exposure for a star with an apparent V magnitude (m_V) of 19.0. Therefore, any star with m_V ≤ 19.0 is considered detectable in terms of brightness.\n\nFor the hypothetical stars, we calculate the apparent magnitude (m_V) from the absolute magnitude (M_V) and the distance in parsecs (d) using the distance modulus formula:\n`m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5`\n\nLet's evaluate each star:\n\n*   **a) Canopus:**\n    *   **Observability:** Declination is -52.7°. This is a southern declination, making it easily observable from Paranal.\n    *   **Brightness:** Apparent magnitude is -0.74. Since -0.74 ≤ 19.0, it is bright enough.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Detectable.\n\n*   **b) Polaris:**\n    *   **Observability:** Declination is approximately +89.3°. This is the North Star, which is circumpolar in the Northern Hemisphere and never rises above the horizon at Paranal's southern latitude.\n    *   **Brightness:** Apparent magnitude is 1.98. While it is bright enough, it is not visible.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not detectable.\n\n*   **c) Star at 10 pc:**\n    *   **Observability:** Declination is 0°. This is on the celestial equator and is observable from Paranal.\n    *   **Brightness:** M_V = 15, d = 10 pc. `m_V = 15 + 5*log10(10) - 5 = 15 + 5 - 5 = 15.0`. Since 15.0 ≤ 19.0, it is bright enough.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Detectable.\n\n*   **d) Star at 200 pc:**\n    *   **Observability:** Declination is 0°, so it is observable.\n    *   **Brightness:** M_V = 15, d = 200 pc. `m_V = 15 + 5*log10(200) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5*(2.30) - 5 = 15 + 11.5 - 5 = 21.5`. Since 21.5 > 19.0, it is too faint.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not detectable.\n\n*   **e) Star at 5 pc:**\n    *   **Observability:** Declination is 0°, so it is observable.\n    *   **Brightness:** M_V = 15, d = 5 pc. `m_V = 15 + 5*log10(5) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5*(0.70) - 5 = 15 + 3.5 - 5 = 13.5`. Since 13.5 ≤ 19.0, it is bright enough.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Detectable.\n\n*   **f) Star at 50 pc:**\n    *   **Observability:** Declination is 0°, so it is observable.\n    *   **Brightness:** M_V = 15, d = 50 pc. `m_V = 15 + 5*log10(50) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5*(1.70) - 5 = 15 + 8.5 - 5 = 18.5`. Since 18.5 ≤ 19.0, it is bright enough.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Detectable.\n\nIn summary, the detectable stars are Canopus, the star at 10 pc, the star at 5 pc, and the star at 50 pc. This makes a total of 4 detectable stars.\n\n<<<D>>>"
