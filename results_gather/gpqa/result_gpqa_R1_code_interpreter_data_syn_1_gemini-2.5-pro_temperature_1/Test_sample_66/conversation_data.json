    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial and final states.**\n    *   The initial state of the two-electron system is given in the coupled basis as $|\\psi_{initial}> = |l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$. Here, $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for the two electrons (since they are in p-orbitals). The total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$, and its z-component quantum number is $m=-1$.\n    *   A measurement of the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed. This means we are projecting the initial state onto the uncoupled basis, which consists of states of the form $|l_1, m_1>|l_2, m_2>$.\n    *   We want to find the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ for both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The eigenvalue of $L_z$ is $m\\hbar$. So, an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ corresponds to a magnetic quantum number of -1.\n    *   The final state corresponding to this measurement outcome is $| \\psi_{final} > = |l_1, m_1> |l_2, m_2> = |1, -1>|1, -1>$.\n\n2.  **Understand the relationship between the coupled and uncoupled bases.**\n    *   The total z-component of the angular momentum, $L_z$, is the sum of the individual z-components: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    *   This implies that the corresponding quantum numbers are also related by a sum: $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n    *   The initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ is an eigenstate of the total $L_z$ operator with an eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n    *   The final state $|1, -1>|1, -1>$ is an eigenstate of both $L_{1z}$ (with eigenvalue $m_1\\hbar = -1\\hbar$) and $L_{2z}$ (with eigenvalue $m_2\\hbar = -1\\hbar$). For this state, the total z-component of angular momentum eigenvalue is $(m_1+m_2)\\hbar = (-1 + -1)\\hbar = -2\\hbar$.\n\n3.  **Apply the conservation principle (selection rule).**\n    *   When we express a coupled state $|l, m>$ as a linear combination of uncoupled states $|m_1, m_2>$, only the uncoupled states for which the condition $m_1 + m_2 = m$ is met will have non-zero coefficients. These coefficients are known as Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n    *   In other words, a measurement of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ on a system in a state with a definite total magnetic quantum number $m$ can only yield outcomes $(m_1, m_2)$ that satisfy $m_1 + m_2 = m$. This is a consequence of the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n    *   In our case, the initial state has $m = -1$. The desired final measurement corresponds to $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Let's check the condition: $m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   Since $m_1 + m_2 = -2$ and $m = -1$, we have $-2 \\neq -1$. The selection rule is violated.\n\n4.  **Calculate the probability.**\n    *   The probability of measuring the state $|1, -1>|1, -1>$ is given by the square of the absolute value of the inner product of the initial and final states:\n        $P = |< \\psi_{final} | \\psi_{initial} >|^2 = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2$\n    *   The term $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>$ is the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for coupling the states $|1, -1>$ and $|1, -1>$ to get the state $|2, -1>$.\n    *   Because the condition $m_1 + m_2 = m$ is not satisfied (since $-1 + (-1) \\neq -1$), this Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n    *   Therefore, the probability is $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\nThe joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$ is zero.\n\n<<<D>>>"
