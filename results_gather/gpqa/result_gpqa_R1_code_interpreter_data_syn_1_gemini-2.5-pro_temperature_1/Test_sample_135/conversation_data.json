    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Vector Field and the Volume**\n    *   The problem describes a vector field `f(r)` that is purely radial.\n    *   The magnitude of the field is given by `|f(r)| = 1/r^2`.\n    *   In spherical coordinates `(r, θ, φ)`, a purely radial vector is expressed using the radial unit vector `r_hat`.\n    *   Therefore, the vector field is `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`.\n    *   The volume `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin `(r=0)`.\n\n2.  **State the Goal**\n    *   We need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the field `f`, which is written as `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`.\n\n3.  **Choose the Method: The Divergence Theorem**\n    *   The Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem) is a powerful tool that relates a volume integral of a divergence to a surface integral of the field itself.\n    *   The theorem states: `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ n_hat) dS`, where `S` is the closed surface that bounds the volume `V`, and `n_hat` is the outward-pointing unit normal vector to the surface `S`.\n    *   It is important to note that the vector field `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat` has a singularity at the origin (`r=0`), where the field is undefined. However, the Divergence Theorem can still be applied in a generalized sense (as in Gauss's Law in electromagnetism). The value of the volume integral `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV` (representing the total source/sink strength within the volume) is equal to the net flux of the field `∮_S (f ⋅ n_hat) dS` through the boundary surface.\n\n4.  **Apply the Divergence Theorem**\n    *   **Volume `V`**: A sphere of radius `R`.\n    *   **Boundary Surface `S`**: The surface of the sphere of radius `R`.\n    *   **Field on the surface `S`**: On this surface, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n    *   **Outward Normal Vector `n_hat`**: For a sphere centered at the origin, the outward-pointing normal vector at any point on the surface is simply the radial unit vector, `n_hat = r_hat`.\n    *   **Surface Element `dS`**: In spherical coordinates, the differential element of surface area on a sphere of radius `R` is `dS = R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Surface Integral (Flux)**\n    *   We need to compute the dot product `f ⋅ n_hat`:\n        `f ⋅ n_hat = [ (1/R^2) * r_hat ] ⋅ [ r_hat ] = 1/R^2` (since `r_hat ⋅ r_hat = 1`).\n    *   Now, set up the surface integral:\n        `∮_S (f ⋅ n_hat) dS = ∬_S (1/R^2) * (R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ)`\n    *   The `R^2` terms cancel out:\n        `= ∬_S sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n    *   To cover the entire surface of the sphere, the integration limits are `φ` from `0` to `2π`, and `θ` from `0` to `π`.\n        `= ∫_0^(2π) [ ∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ ] dφ`\n    *   Evaluate the inner integral (with respect to `θ`):\n        `∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n    *   Now, evaluate the outer integral (with respect to `φ`):\n        `∫_0^(2π) 2 dφ = 2 * [φ]_0^(2π) = 2 * (2π - 0) = 4π`\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n    *   According to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to this calculated surface integral (flux).\n    *   `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = 4π`\n    *   This result is independent of the radius `R` of the sphere (as long as `R > 0`), which is a characteristic feature for fields that fall off as `1/r^2`.\n\n7.  **Compare with Options**\n    *   The calculated value is `4π`.\n    *   This corresponds to option A.\n\nAn alternative way to think about this is to directly calculate the divergence. The divergence of the field `f(r) = r_hat / r^2` is zero everywhere except at the origin, where it is a Dirac delta function: `∇ ⋅ (r_hat / r^2) = 4πδ³(r)`. Integrating this over a volume that includes the origin (`r=0`) gives `∫_V 4πδ³(r) dV = 4π * 1 = 4π`. Both methods yield the same result.\n\n<<<A>>>"
