    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the products of decomposition and their quantities.**\n\nThe problem describes heating a mixture of salts A and B, which decompose completely into a mixture of gases. These gases are then passed through a series of tubes to identify them.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is due to the water absorbed.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. The problem states its weight did not change. This is a crucial clue: no acidic gases were produced in the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases, most commonly oxygen (O₂). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of the tube's contents (0.80 g) is the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of an oxygen atom (O) ≈ 16 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Since oxygen exists as O₂ molecules, the moles of O₂ gas are half the moles of O atoms.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with a drying agent, a base, or hot copper. This suggests it is a relatively inert gas, like nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Verify the findings with the Law of Conservation of Mass.**\n\nThe total mass of the products should equal the initial mass of the reactants (7.20 g). Let's assume Gas C is Nitrogen (N₂), which has a molar mass of ~28 g/mol.\n\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.025 mol * 32 g/mol = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N₂ = 0.10 mol * 28 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Total Mass of Products = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n\nThis perfectly matches the initial mass of the salt mixture. Our identification of the products (0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, 0.10 mol N₂) is correct.\n\n**3. Determine the identity of Salts A and B.**\n\nThe initial mixture contains only salts A and B and is composed of the elements found in the products: Hydrogen (H), Nitrogen (N), and Oxygen (O). This strongly suggests the salts are ammonium salts with nitrogen-oxygen anions (like nitrite or nitrate). The fact that the products are all gases also supports this, as many ammonium salts decompose without leaving a solid residue.\n\nLet's hypothesize the salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**. The problem states the mixture is equimolar, meaning there are equal moles of salt A and salt B. Let this amount be `n`.\n\nThe decomposition reactions are:\n*   NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n*   2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O (This decomposition pathway for ammonium nitrate produces the specific products we observed).\n\nLet's see if an equimolar mixture of these two salts produces the correct ratio of products.\nTotal mass = `n` × M(NH₄NO₂) + `n` × M(NH₄NO₃) = 7.20 g\n`n` × (64.04 g/mol + 80.04 g/mol) = 7.20 g\n`n` × (144.08 g/mol) = 7.20 g\n`n` ≈ 0.05 mol.\n\nSo, the initial mixture contained 0.05 mol of salt A and 0.05 mol of salt B. Let's calculate the expected products:\n\n*   From 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂:\n    *   Produces 0.05 mol N₂ and 2 × 0.05 = 0.10 mol H₂O.\n*   From 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃:\n    *   Produces (2/2) × 0.05 = 0.05 mol N₂.\n    *   Produces (1/2) × 0.05 = 0.025 mol O₂.\n    *   Produces (4/2) × 0.05 = 0.10 mol H₂O.\n\nNow, let's sum the products from both reactions:\n*   Total N₂ = 0.05 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.10 mol. (Matches our finding)\n*   Total O₂ = 0.025 mol. (Matches our finding)\n*   Total H₂O = 0.10 mol + 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol. (Matches our finding)\n\nThe hypothesis is confirmed. Salts A and B are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\n**4. Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in one formula unit of each salt combined).\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms in A and B:**\n    *   Total = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nTo verify the calculations, the following Python code can be executed.\n```python\n# Molar masses\nM_H2O = 18.015  # g/mol\nM_O = 15.999   # g/mol\nM_O2 = 31.998  # g/mol\nM_N2 = 28.014  # g/mol\nM_NH4NO2 = 64.045 # g/mol\nM_NH4NO3 = 80.043 # g/mol\n\n# Experimental data\nmass_H2O = 3.60  # g\nmass_O_increase = 0.80 # g\nvol_gas_C_STP = 2.24 # L\ninitial_mass = 7.20 # g\n\n# --- Calculate moles of products from experimental data ---\nmoles_H2O = mass_H2O / M_H2O\nmoles_O_atoms = mass_O_increase / M_O\nmoles_O2 = moles_O_atoms / 2\nmoles_gas_C = vol_gas_C_STP / 22.4\n\n# --- Verify the salt mixture hypothesis ---\nmoles_n = initial_mass / (M_NH4NO2 + M_NH4NO3)\n\n# --- Calculate products from the hypothesized mixture (n=0.05 mol) ---\ntotal_N2_predicted = moles_n + moles_n * (2/2)\ntotal_O2_predicted = moles_n * (1/2)\ntotal_H2O_predicted = 2 * moles_n + moles_n * (4/2)\n\n# --- Calculate total number of atoms ---\natoms_A = 2 + 4 + 2 # Atoms in NH4NO2\natoms_B = 2 + 4 + 3 # Atoms in NH4NO3\ntotal_atoms = atoms_A + atoms_B\n\nprint(\"--- Experimental Moles ---\")\nprint(f\"Moles H2O: {moles_H2O:.3f}\")\nprint(f\"Moles O2: {moles_O2:.3f}\")\nprint(f\"Moles N2: {moles_gas_C:.3f}\")\nprint(\"\\n--- Predicted Moles (from n={:.3f} mol of each salt) ---\".format(moles_n))\nprint(f\"Predicted Moles H2O: {total_H2O_predicted:.3f}\")\nprint(f\"Predicted Moles O2: {total_O2_predicted:.3f}\")\nprint(f\"Predicted Moles N2: {total_N2_predicted:.3f}\")\nprint(\"\\n--- Final Answer ---\")\nprint(f\"Total atoms in salts A and B: {total_atoms}\")\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "The reasoning and thinking process has been successfully completed, and the calculations have been verified by the Python code execution. The steps were:\n1.  **Analyze the experimental data** to determine the products of the decomposition and their molar quantities.\n    *   The mass increase in the Mg(ClO₄)₂ tube (3.60 g) corresponds to 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   The lack of mass change in the Ca(OH)₂ tube indicates no acidic gases (like CO₂) were formed.\n    *   The mass increase in the hot copper tube (0.80 g) corresponds to 0.025 mol of O₂.\n    *   The remaining gas volume (2.24 L at STP) corresponds to 0.10 mol of an inert gas, identified as N₂.\n2.  **Verify the product masses** against the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g). The sum of the masses of H₂O (3.60 g), O₂ (0.80 g), and N₂ (2.80 g) equals 7.20 g, confirming the product identification.\n3.  **Deduce the identity of the salts**. Based on the product elements (H, N, O) and the fact that they are salts, ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) were hypothesized.\n4.  **Write the decomposition reactions** and test the hypothesis using the \"equimolar mixture\" condition.\n    *   Reaction 1: NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n    *   Reaction 2: 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n    *   It was calculated that an equimolar mixture of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ would produce the exact quantities of N₂, O₂, and H₂O observed experimentally. This confirms that salts A and B are indeed ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n5.  **Calculate the final answer**. The question asks for the total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n    *   Atoms in NH₄NO₂ = 2(N) + 4(H) + 2(O) = 8 atoms.\n    *   Atoms in NH₄NO₃ = 2(N) + 4(H) + 3(O) = 9 atoms.\n    *   Total atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThe result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
