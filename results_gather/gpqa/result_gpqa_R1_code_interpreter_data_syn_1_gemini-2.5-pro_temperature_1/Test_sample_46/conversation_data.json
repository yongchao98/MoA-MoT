    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2):**\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation (one ring and three double bonds).\n    *   The remaining degree of unsaturation (5 - 4 = 1) is likely a carbonyl group (C=O), which is consistent with the IR data.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The two medium to strong bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   The strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The frequency is typical for an ester, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)** and **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pattern is the classic signature of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The downfield chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm indicates that the methylene (-CH₂) group is attached to a very electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom, as in an ethyl ester (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet integrating to two protons. Its chemical shift and broadness, along with the IR data, are characteristic of the two protons of a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂). The protons are exchangeable, causing the signal to be broad.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a clear indication of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two substituents have different electronic effects. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-donating amino group (-NH₂). The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt).\n\n*   **Putting the Pieces Together:**\n    1.  We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  The substituents are a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n    3.  Assembling these fragments gives the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Has a secondary amide (one N-H peak in IR), not a primary amine.\n    *   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Is meta-substituted, which would give a more complex aromatic pattern in the NMR, not two doublets.\n    *   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Has a propionate group (CH₃CH₂COO-). The methylene protons (-CH₂CO-) would appear around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: The structure perfectly matches all the spectral data: primary amine, ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring with the correct electronic effects reflected in the NMR chemical shifts.\n\nLet's confirm the molecular formula for each option.\n```python\ndef calculate_formula(smiles):\n    from rdkit import Chem\n    from rdkit.Chem.rdMolDescriptors import CalcMolFormula\n    mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles)\n    return CalcMolFormula(mol)\n\n# A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide\nsmiles_A = \"CCOc1ccc(NC=O)cc1\"\n# B) 3-ethoxybenzamide\nsmiles_B = \"CCOc1cccc(C(=O)N)c1\"\n# C) 4-aminophenyl propionate\nsmiles_C = \"CCC(=O)Oc1ccc(N)cc1\"\n# D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate\nsmiles_D = \"CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1\"\n\nprint(f\"A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: {calculate_formula(smiles_A)}\")\nprint(f\"B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: {calculate_formula(smiles_B)}\")\nprint(f\"C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: {calculate_formula(smiles_C)}\")\nprint(f\"D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: {calculate_formula(smiles_D)}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\nA) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: C9H11NO2\nB) 3-ethoxybenzamide: C9H11NO2\nC) 4-aminophenyl propionate: C9H11NO2\nD) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: C9H11NO2\n</execute_result>\nAll four compounds have the correct molecular formula, C9H11NO2. The identification must rely on the spectroscopic data. Based on the detailed analysis above, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate is the only structure that is consistent with all the provided IR and ¹H NMR data.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to get an idea of the rings and/or double bonds present in the molecule.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) - (X/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) - 0\n    *   DoU = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    *   A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: 1 for the ring and 3 for the double bonds) plus one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in the region of 3300-3500 cm⁻¹ is a classic signature for a primary amine (-NH₂). The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency of 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an ester, particularly one that is conjugated with an aromatic ring (which lowers the frequency slightly from a typical saturated ester at ~1740 cm⁻¹).\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This is a textbook triplet-quartet pattern, indicating an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The triplet (t) for 3H is the methyl group split by the adjacent 2 protons of the methylene group. The quartet (q) for 2H is the methylene group split by the adjacent 3 protons of the methyl group. The very downfield chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm strongly suggests the methylene (-CH₂) is attached to an oxygen atom in an ester functional group (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet (bs) integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). The broadness is due to quadrupole relaxation from the nitrogen nucleus and chemical exchange with trace amounts of acid/water. The chemical shift is typical for an aromatic amine. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets (d) in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a clear indication of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two substituents are different electronically. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is due to the protons ortho to the strongly electron-donating amino (-NH₂) group. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is due to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information to Determine the Structure**\n    *   From the DoU, we have a benzene ring and a C=O.\n    *   From the IR and NMR, we have a primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n    *   From the IR and NMR, we have an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group.\n    *   From the NMR aromatic region, we know these two groups are attached to a benzene ring in a 1,4 (para) arrangement.\n    *   Assembling these pieces gives the structure: **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Given Options**\n    *   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide (would have one N-H peak in IR) and an ether.\n    *   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a 1,3-(meta) substituted ring, which would give a more complex NMR pattern. It is also a primary amide, which has a lower C=O frequency (~1680 cm⁻¹).\n    *   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is a phenyl ester, not an ethyl ester. The NMR would show signals for a propionyl group (-CO-CH₂CH₃), with the methylene quartet appearing around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   D) **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**: **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all the data: C9H11NO2, primary amine, conjugated ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring with the expected chemical shifts.\n\nTo be absolutely certain, let's check the molecular formulas of all options.\n```python\nfrom rdkit import Chem\nfrom rdkit.Chem.rdMolDescriptors import CalcMolFormula\n\n# A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide\nsmiles_A = \"CCOc1ccc(NC=O)cc1\"\n# B) 3-ethoxybenzamide\nsmiles_B = \"CCOc1cccc(C(=O)N)c1\"\n# C) 4-aminophenyl propionate\nsmiles_C = \"CCC(=O)Oc1ccc(N)cc1\"\n# D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate\nsmiles_D = \"CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1\"\n\n# The SMILES strings correctly represent the structures.\n# Let's calculate the molecular formulas.\nmol_A = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles_A)\nmol_B = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles_B)\nmol_C = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles_C)\nmol_D = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles_D)\n\nprint(f\"A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: {CalcMolFormula(mol_A)}\")\nprint(f\"B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: {CalcMolFormula(mol_B)}\")\nprint(f\"C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: {CalcMolFormula(mol_C)}\")\nprint(f\"D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: {CalcMolFormula(mol_D)}\")\n```\nThe code execution confirms that all four potential answers have the same molecular formula, C9H11NO2. Therefore, the decision must be made based on the detailed analysis of the spectroscopic data, which points unambiguously to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, typically a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region are the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. These correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a **carbonyl (C=O) stretch**. The frequency is typical for an ester that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pattern is the unmistakable signal of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The triplet (t) at 1.20 ppm is the methyl group (-CH₃), split by the two adjacent methylene protons.\n    *   The quartet (q) at 4.5 ppm is the methylene group (-CH₂-), split by the three adjacent methyl protons. The significantly downfield chemical shift (4.5 ppm) indicates the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which in this context is the oxygen of an **ethyl ester group (-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet integrating to two protons. This signal confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂) group** identified in the IR spectrum. The protons are exchangeable, causing the signal to broaden.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a clear sign of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The protons ortho to the electron-donating amino group are shielded and appear upfield (7.0 ppm).\n    *   The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group are deshielded and appear downfield (8.0 ppm).\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nPutting all the pieces together:\n*   We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   The substituents are a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   This leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this against the options:\n*   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. Has a secondary amide, not a primary amine.\n*   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. Is 1,3-substituted (meta) and a primary amide.\n*   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. The ethyl group would be part of a propionate (-CO-CH₂CH₃), and its methylene quartet would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   D) **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure perfectly fits all the provided IR and NMR data.\n\n<<<D>>>"
