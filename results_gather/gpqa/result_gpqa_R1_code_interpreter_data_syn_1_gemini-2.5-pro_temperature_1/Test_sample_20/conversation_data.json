    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n**Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism.**\n\n1.  **Understanding Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where molecules, called tautomers, can readily interconvert. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which involves the migration of a proton (H+) and a shift in the location of a double bond. A key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen—a hydrogen atom on a carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with three ketone (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are -CH2- groups.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The hydrogens on carbons 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-hydrogens because they are adjacent to the carbonyl groups. Since these alpha-hydrogens are present, the compound can undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Stability:** The tautomerization of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can happen at all three keto sites, leading to the formation of benzene-1,3,5-triol (also known as phloroglucinol). This enol form is an aromatic compound and is therefore exceptionally stable. The equilibrium heavily favors this aromatic enol form.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione clearly shows tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Benzoquinone (specifically 1,4-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two ketone groups opposite each other. The structure is cyclohexa-2,5-diene-1,4-dione.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds. While these carbons do have hydrogen atoms, attempting to form an enol tautomer would disrupt the stable conjugated system of the quinone without forming a fully aromatic ring. This makes the potential enol form very unstable.\n    *   **Equilibrium:** Because the enol form is highly unstable compared to the keto form, the equilibrium lies almost entirely with the keto (quinone) form. For practical purposes in chemistry, it is considered a non-tautomerizing ketone. The related compound, hydroquinone, is formed by a reduction reaction (gain of two H atoms), not by tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone does not show significant tautomerism.\n\n4.  **Decision for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**. So, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism.**\n\n1.  **Understanding Optical Isomerism:** Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and will exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). Therefore, it will show optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which has a *trans* configuration around the double bond: CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality Check:** The molecule does not have any chiral centers. Furthermore, the molecule is planar and possesses a plane of symmetry that cuts through the C=C double bond. Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since dimethyl fumarate is achiral, it is superimposable on its mirror image and will not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Decision for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. So, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Combination:**\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
