    "An effective way to eliminate a gene's function is to introduce a mutation that results in a non-functional or truncated protein. The most severe mutations are typically frameshift mutations (insertions or deletions not divisible by three) or nonsense mutations (which introduce a premature stop codon).\n\nLet's analyze each mutation by comparing it to the intact gene and translating the resulting sequence. The genetic code is read in triplets called codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n**Intact Gene:**\n*   **Sequence:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT ... TGA-3’`\n*   **Codons:** ATG (Met), TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser)\n*   **Protein:** Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly-Thr-Ser...\n*   This sequence produces the full-length, functional protein responsible for the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n**Mutant 1:**\n*   **Sequence:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT ... TGA-3’`\n*   **Comparison:** The original `TTT CTC` is changed to `TTC TAC`.\n    *   `TTT` -> `TTC`: Both codons code for Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a **silent mutation**.\n    *   `CTC` -> `TAC`: `CTC` codes for Leucine (Leu), while `TAC` codes for Tyrosine (Tyr). This is a **missense mutation**, changing one amino acid in the protein.\n*   **Protein:** Met-Phe-**Tyr**-Ala-Gly-Thr-Ser...\n*   **Effect:** A single amino acid change might alter the protein's function, but it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely.\n\n**Mutant 2:**\n*   **Sequence:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT ... TGA-3’`\n*   **Comparison:** The original `TTT CTC` is changed to `TTC TAA`.\n    *   `TTT` -> `TTC`: Silent mutation (Phe -> Phe).\n    *   `CTC` -> `TAA`: `CTC` codes for Leucine (Leu), while `TAA` is a **stop codon**.\n*   **Protein:** Met-Phe-**STOP**.\n*   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. It introduces a premature stop codon at the third position. The cell will only produce a tiny, two-amino-acid-long peptide (Met-Phe). This resulting peptide will be completely non-functional, thus eliminating the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n**Mutant 3:**\n*   **Sequence:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT ... TGA-3’`\n*   **Comparison:** The original `CTC` and `ACT` are changed to `TAC` and `GTC`.\n    *   `CTC` (Leu) -> `TAC` (Tyr): A missense mutation.\n    *   `ACT` (Thr) -> `GTC` (Val): Another missense mutation.\n*   **Protein:** Met-Phe-**Tyr**-Ala-Gly-**Val**-Ser...\n*   **Effect:** Two amino acids are changed. This is more likely to disrupt function than a single missense mutation, but it is still less severe than a premature stop codon. The full-length protein is still produced, and it might retain some function.\n\n**Mutant 4:**\n*   **Sequence:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT ... TGA-3’`\n*   **Comparison:** A comparison of the strings shows that `GGT` (the 5th codon) has been deleted, and `CTC` has been changed to `TAC`.\n    *   `CTC` (Leu) -> `TAC` (Tyr): A missense mutation.\n    *   Deletion of `GGT`: This is a deletion of three nucleotides.\n*   **Protein:** Met-Phe-**Tyr**-Ala-Thr-Ser...\n*   **Effect:** This is an in-frame deletion (a deletion of a full codon) combined with a missense mutation. The protein will be missing one amino acid (Glycine) and have another one changed (Leu -> Tyr). The reading frame for the rest of the gene is preserved. While this will alter the protein, it is not guaranteed to completely inactivate it.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe mutation in **Mutant 2** introduces a premature stop codon, which will terminate protein synthesis very early. This is the most reliable way among the given options to produce a non-functional protein and therefore eliminate the unwanted compound.\n\n<<<C>>>"
