    "This is a problem of special relativity. We need to calculate the distance traveled by the supernova ejecta in the reference frame of the Galaxy.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Reference Frames:**\n    *   **Frame S (Galaxy's reference frame):** This is the \"stationary\" frame from which we want to measure the distance.\n    *   **Frame S' (Ejecta's reference frame):** This is the \"moving\" frame. The ejecta is at rest in this frame.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60 000 km/s`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame is `Δt' = 50 s`. Since this time is measured by a clock moving with the ejecta, it is the *proper time* (`Δt_0`).\n    *   The speed of light is `c`. We will assume `c = 300 000 km/s`, which is a standard approximation for such problems.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (Frame S). Let's call this distance `Δx`.\n\n4.  **Apply the Principles of Special Relativity:**\n    *   The fundamental equation for distance is `distance = speed × time`. In our case, `Δx = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (Frame S).\n    *   According to the principle of time dilation, an observer in a stationary frame (S) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) compared to the proper time (`Δt'`) measured in the moving frame (S'). The relationship is given by the formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    *   Here, `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n5.  **Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n    *   **Step 1: Calculate the ratio v/c.**\n        `β = v/c = 60 000 km/s / 300 000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n    *   **Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor, γ.**\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n    *   **Step 3: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame, Δt.**\n        `Δt = γ * Δt' = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n    *   **Step 4: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame, Δx.**\n        `Δx = v * Δt = v * γ * Δt'`\n        `Δx = 60 000 km/s * (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n        `Δx = (60 000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n        `Δx = 3 000 000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\n    *   **Step 5: Compute the final value.**\n        We can use a calculator or a simple script to get the numerical value.\n\nLet's use a Python script for the precise calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # speed of ejecta in km/s\ndt_prime = 50  # proper time in ejecta's frame in seconds\nc = 300000 # speed of light in km/s\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\nbeta = v / c\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta**2)\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (dt)\ndt_galaxy = gamma * dt_prime\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame (dx)\ndx_galaxy = v * dt_galaxy\n\nprint(f\"Distance traveled in the Galaxy reference frame: {dx_galaxy} km\")\n```\n>>>\nDistance traveled in the Galaxy reference frame: 3061862.178478726 km\n>>>\nThe calculated distance is approximately `3,061,862 km`.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) 2 880 000 km\n    *   B) 2 940 000 km\n    *   C) 3 000 000 km (This would be the non-relativistic answer, or the distance measured in the ejecta's frame)\n    *   D) 3 060 000 km\n\nOur calculated value of `3,061,862 km` is extremely close to option D, `3,060,000 km`.

    "The problem asks for the distance traveled by a supernova ejecta as measured from the reference frame of the Galaxy. This is a classic problem in special relativity.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Galaxy's Frame (S):** This is considered the \"stationary\" frame of reference.
