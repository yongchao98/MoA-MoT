    "**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material (Compound X) from the spectroscopic data.**\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The very broad absorption in the range of **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n    *   The strong, sharp peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is likely an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet (bs) appearing far downfield is a classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the IR data.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm) is indicative of a **para-disubstituted** (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is due to protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm is due to protons ortho to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   **Analyzing the alkyl group signals:** We need to piece together the structure from the remaining signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is a terminal ethyl fragment (`-CH₂CH₃`).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (a methine group, -CH-).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-) from the ethyl fragment. It is a multiplet because it is coupled to both the adjacent methyl group and the methine proton.\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton corresponds to the methine group (-CH-). This proton is attached directly to the benzene ring (a benzylic position), which explains its downfield shift. It is coupled to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group and the two protons of the adjacent methylene group, resulting in a complex multiplet.\n        *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** The fragments are `-CH₂CH₃` and `-CH(CH₃)-`. Connecting them through the CH and CH₂ groups gives `-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)`. This is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n*   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the pieces, Compound X is a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at the para (position 4) position. The structure is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option B, but the question asks for the final product of the reaction.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the reaction and predict the final product.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) is treated with **red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI)**.\n*   **Reagents' Function:** The combination of red phosphorus and HI is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). It also reduces alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones to the corresponding alkanes.\n*   **Applying the reaction:**\n    *   The starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) on the benzene ring will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The sec-butyl group is an alkyl group and is already fully reduced, so it will not be affected by the reagents.\n    *   The aromatic ring is stable under these conditions.\n*   **Final Product:** The reduction of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid yields **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**Step 3: Match the predicted product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect structure.\n*   B) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material (Compound X).\n*   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: The alkyl group is incorrect. The starting material has a *sec*-butyl group, not an *iso*-butyl group.\n*   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: This matches the predicted final product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
