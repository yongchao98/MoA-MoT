    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   The substrate is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen, denoted by 'd' or 'D') at position 2.\n    *   The reagent is sodium amide (NaNH2) in condensed (liquid) ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base, with the active species being the amide ion (NH2-).\n    *   The reaction of a halobenzene with sodium amide is a classic example of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The strong base, NH2-, abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position ortho (adjacent) to the leaving group (the bromine atom).\n    *   In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions to the bromine at C1:\n        *   Position C6, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n        *   Position C2, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n    *   The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to the kinetic isotope effect (KIE), it is easier and faster for the base to abstract the proton (H) from C6 than the deuteron (D) from C2. However, both abstractions are possible.\n\n    *   **Pathway A (Major): Abstraction of H from C6**\n        1.  The amide ion removes the proton from C6.\n        2.  The resulting carbanion expels the bromide ion from C1.\n        3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where the new triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **2-deuterio-1,6-didehydrobenzene**.\n\n    *   **Pathway B (Minor): Abstraction of D from C2**\n        1.  The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2.\n        2.  The resulting carbanion expels the bromide ion from C1.\n        3.  This forms a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is removed from the molecule in this process. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **1,2-didehydrobenzene (benzyne)**.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    *   The nucleophile, which is another amide ion (NH2-), attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH3) to yield the final aniline product.\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway A's Intermediate (Benzyne with D at C2, triple bond C1-C6):**\n        1.  **Attack at C1:** The NH2 group adds to C1. This creates a carbanion at C6, which is then protonated by NH3. The resulting product has the NH2 group at C1 and the D at C2. This is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        2.  **Attack at C6:** The NH2 group adds to C6. This creates a carbanion at C1, which is then protonated. The resulting product has the NH2 group at C6 and the D at C2. The positional relationship between the NH2 group and D is meta (1,3). So, this product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   Pathway A leads to two distinct deuterated products.\n\n    *   **Products from Pathway B's Intermediate (Standard Benzyne, triple bond C1-C2):**\n        1.  **Attack at C1:** The NH2 group adds to C1, forming a carbanion at C2. Protonation yields aniline.\n        2.  **Attack at C2:** The NH2 group adds to C2, forming a carbanion at C1. Protonation also yields aniline.\n        *   Pathway B leads to only one product: **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n\n4.  **Conclusion: Count the Total Number of Possible Products**\n    *   The question asks for the number of *possible* organic products. Since both elimination pathways (A and B) are mechanistically possible (even though Pathway A is faster), we must count all the products that can be formed.\n    *   The unique products are:\n        1.  2-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n        2.  3-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n        3.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n    *   These three compounds are structurally distinct (they are isotopomers). Therefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\n<<<C>>>"
