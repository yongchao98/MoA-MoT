    "Here's my thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the core physical principles:** The problem provides uncertainty in position ($\\Delta x$) and asks for the minimum uncertainty in energy ($\\Delta E$) for a moving particle. This immediately brings to mind the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\n2.  **Select the relevant equations:**\n    *   The position-momentum uncertainty principle states: $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p_x \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$, where $\\Delta p_x$ is the uncertainty in momentum along the x-direction and $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant ($\\hbar = h/2\\pi \\approx 1.054 \\times 10^{-34}$ J·s). For the *minimum* uncertainty, we use the equality: $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$.\n    *   We need to relate the uncertainty in energy ($\\Delta E$) to the uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p_x$). The relationship between energy (E) and momentum (p) for a particle is given by the energy-momentum relation. Since the electron's speed ($v = 2 \\times 10^8$ m/s) is a significant fraction of the speed of light ($c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s), we must use the relativistic formula: $E^2 = (p_x c)^2 + (m_0 c^2)^2$, where $m_0$ is the rest mass of the electron.\n\n3.  **Derive the relationship between $\\Delta E$ and $\\Delta p_x$:**\n    *   We can find the relationship by taking the derivative of the energy equation with respect to momentum $p_x$. This gives us the rate of change of energy with momentum, which we can use to relate their uncertainties for small changes: $\\Delta E \\approx \\left| \\frac{dE}{dp_x} \\right| \\Delta p_x$.\n    *   Let's differentiate $E^2 = (p_x c)^2 + (m_0 c^2)^2$ with respect to $p_x$:\n        $2E \\frac{dE}{dp_x} = 2p_x c^2$\n        $\\frac{dE}{dp_x} = \\frac{p_x c^2}{E}$\n    *   From special relativity, we know that the relativistic momentum is $p_x = \\gamma m_0 v_x$ and the total energy is $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$, where $v_x$ is the velocity and $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   Substituting these into our expression for the derivative:\n        $\\frac{dE}{dp_x} = \\frac{(\\gamma m_0 v_x) c^2}{\\gamma m_0 c^2} = v_x$\n    *   This gives us a very elegant and simple relationship: $\\Delta E \\approx v_x \\Delta p_x$.\n\n4.  **Perform the calculation:**\n    *   **Step 1: Find the minimum uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p_x$).**\n        From the uncertainty principle: $\\Delta p_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}$.\n    *   **Step 2: Substitute this into the energy uncertainty relation.**\n        $\\Delta E = v_x \\cdot \\Delta p_x = v_x \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}\\right)$.\n    *   **Step 3: Plug in the given values.**\n        *   $v_x = 2 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n        *   $\\Delta x = 0.1$ nm = $0.1 \\times 10^{-9}$ m = $10^{-10}$ m\n        *   $\\hbar \\approx 1.054 \\times 10^{-34}$ J·s\n\n        $\\Delta E = (2 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot \\frac{1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J·s}}{2 \\cdot (10^{-10} \\text{ m})}$\n        $\\Delta E = (10^8) \\cdot \\frac{1.054 \\times 10^{-34}}{10^{-10}}$ J\n        $\\Delta E = 1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\times 10^{(8+10)}$ J\n        $\\Delta E = 1.054 \\times 10^{-16}$ J\n\n5.  **Final check and comparison:** The calculated value is $\\approx 1.054 \\times 10^{-16}$ J. This is very close to $10^{-16}$ J. Comparing this with the given options:\n    A) ~10^(-19) J\n    B) ~10^(-17) J\n    C) ~10^(-18) J\n    D) ~10^(-16) J\n    The result matches option D.\n\nTo ensure the precision of the calculation, I will use a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Constants\nhbar = 1.054571817e-34  # Reduced Planck constant in J·s\nv = 2e8                   # Speed of the electron in m/s\ndelta_x = 0.1e-9          # Uncertainty in position in meters (0.1 nm)\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum (delta_p)\n# delta_p = hbar / (2 * delta_x)\ndelta_p = hbar / (2 * delta_x)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy (delta_E)\n# delta_E = v * delta_p\ndelta_E = v * delta_p\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(f\"{delta_E:.3e}\")\n```\n<execute_code>\n1.055e-16\n</execute_code>\nThe calculation confirms the result is $1.055 \\times 10^{-16}$ J, which is approximately $10^{-16}$ J.\n\n<<<D>>>",
