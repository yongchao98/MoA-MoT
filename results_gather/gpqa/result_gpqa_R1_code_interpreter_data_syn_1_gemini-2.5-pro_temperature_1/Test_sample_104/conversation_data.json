    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Goal\nThe main objective is to determine the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet (`Rpl/Rstar`) that would cause the same brightness dip as the rotational modulation of a star with a large spotted region.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Starspot Scenario\nWe have a star that shows variable brightness because it rotates. One side (hemisphere) is \"clean\" and the other is covered with spots.\n\n*   **Maximum Brightness (`F_max`):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The entire visible disk of the star has a temperature `Teff_star`.\n*   **Minimum Brightness (`F_min`):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere is facing the observer. A fraction of the visible disk is covered by cooler spots.\n\n### 3. Quantify the Brightness Change from Spots\nThe flux (brightness) emitted by a surface is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature, according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law (`Flux per unit area ∝ T^4`).\n\nLet's define the key parameters:\n*   Star's effective temperature, `Teff_star = 6000 K`.\n*   Temperature difference of spots, `ΔT = 1000 K`.\n*   Spot temperature, `Teff_spot = Teff_star - ΔT = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K`.\n*   Spot filling factor on the visible disk, `f_spot = 20% = 0.20`.\n\nThe \"amplitude signal\" or relative flux drop due to the spots is the difference between maximum and minimum flux, divided by the maximum flux:\n`Signal_spot = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n\nLet `A` be the projected area of the star's disk and `σ` be the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   `F_max = A * σ * Teff_star^4`\n\nWhen the spotted side is visible, an area `f_spot * A` has temperature `Teff_spot`, and the remaining area `(1 - f_spot) * A` has temperature `Teff_star`.\n*   `F_min = [(1 - f_spot) * A * σ * Teff_star^4] + [f_spot * A * σ * Teff_spot^4]`\n\nNow, let's calculate the relative flux drop:\n`Signal_spot = 1 - (F_min / F_max)`\n`Signal_spot = 1 - {([(1 - f_spot) * A * σ * Teff_star^4] + [f_spot * A * σ * Teff_spot^4]) / (A * σ * Teff_star^4)}`\n\nWe can cancel `A` and `σ`:\n`Signal_spot = 1 - [(1 - f_spot) + f_spot * (Teff_spot^4 / Teff_star^4)]`\n`Signal_spot = 1 - 1 + f_spot - f_spot * (Teff_spot / Teff_star)^4`\n`Signal_spot = f_spot * [1 - (Teff_spot / Teff_star)^4]`\n\n### 4. Analyze the Exoplanet Transit Scenario\nWhen an exoplanet transits (passes in front of) its star, it blocks a portion of the star's light. The resulting dip in brightness is called the transit depth. For a uniformly bright star, this depth is the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n\n*   Area of the planet's disk: `A_pl = π * Rpl^2`\n*   Area of the star's disk: `A_star = π * Rstar^2`\n\nThe transit depth signal is:\n`Signal_planet = A_pl / A_star = (π * Rpl^2) / (π * Rstar^2) = (Rpl / Rstar)^2`\n\n### 5. Equate the Signals and Solve\nThe problem states that the two signals have the same amplitude. Therefore:\n`Signal_planet = Signal_spot`\n`(Rpl / Rstar)^2 = f_spot * [1 - (Teff_spot / Teff_star)^4]`\n\nNow, we can plug in the numerical values and solve for `Rpl / Rstar`.\n\n`Rpl / Rstar = sqrt(f_spot * [1 - (Teff_spot / Teff_star)^4])`\n\nLet's perform the calculation using a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the given parameters\nTeff_star = 6000.0  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\nTeff_spot = 5000.0  # Temperature of the spots in Kelvin (6000K - 1000K)\nf_spot = 0.20       # Filling factor of the spots on the visible hemisphere\n\n# Calculate the relative flux drop caused by the spots.\n# This is the \"amplitude signal\" from the rotational modulation.\n# Signal = f_spot * (1 - (Teff_spot / Teff_star)**4)\nflux_drop_ratio = f_spot * (1 - (Teff_spot / Teff_star)**4)\n\n# The transit depth of a hypothetical exoplanet is given by (Rpl / Rstar)^2.\n# We set this equal to the flux drop from the spots.\n# (Rpl / Rstar)^2 = flux_drop_ratio\n# Rpl / Rstar = sqrt(flux_drop_ratio)\nrelative_planet_radius = np.sqrt(flux_drop_ratio)\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(f\"{relative_planet_radius:.4f}\")\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.3218\n</execute_code>\n\nThe calculation shows that the relative radius `Rpl / Rstar` is approximately 0.3218.\n\n### 6. Final Answer Selection\nThe calculated value `~0.32` corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "To solve this problem, we need to equate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the starspots with the transit depth caused by a hypothetical exoplanet.\n\n**1. Calculate the brightness variation due to starspots.**\n\nThe flux (brightness) emitted by a black body is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (Stefan-Boltzmann law, F ∝ T⁴).\n*   Star's effective temperature, T_star = 6000 K.\n*   Spot temperature, T_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K.\n*   Spot filling factor on the visible hemisphere, f_spot = 0.20.\n\nThe maximum flux (F_max) occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is visible. We can normalize this to 1.\nF_max ∝ A * T_star⁴\n\nThe minimum flux (F_min) occurs when the spotted hemisphere is visible. A fraction `f_spot` of the area radiates at T_spot, and the rest `(1 - f_spot)` radiates at T_star.\nF_min ∝ A * [(1 - f_spot) * T_star⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴]\n\nThe relative drop in flux, or the amplitude of the signal, is:\nAmplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\nAmplitude = 1 - (F_min / F_max)\nAmplitude = 1 - [(1 - f_spot) + f_spot * (T_spot / T_star)⁴]\nAmplitude = f_spot * [1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴]\n\n**2. Calculate the transit depth of the exoplanet.**\n\nThe transit depth is the fraction of the star's light blocked by the planet. It is equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\nTransit Depth = (Area_planet) / (Area_star)\nTransit Depth = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²)\nTransit Depth = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n**3. Equate the two signals and solve for R_pl / R_star.**\n\nWe set the amplitude from the spots equal to the transit depth.\n(R_pl / R_star)² = f_spot * [1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴]\nR_pl / R_star = sqrt(f_spot * [1 - (T_spot / T_star)⁴])\n\nNow, we plug in the values:\nR_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.20 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴])\nR_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.20 * [1 - (5/6)⁴])\nR_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.20 * [1 - 0.48225])\nR_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.20 * 0.51775)\nR_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.10355)\nR_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.32 matches the result from the code execution. Comparing this to the given options:\n\nA) ~0.32\nB) ~0.39\nC) ~0.11\nD) ~0.07\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
