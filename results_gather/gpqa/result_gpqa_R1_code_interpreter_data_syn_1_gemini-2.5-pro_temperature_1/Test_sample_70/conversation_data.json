    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main objective is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 to Planet_2, which can be written as T_eq(4) / T_eq(2).\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    T_eq = T_star * ( (1 - A) * R_star² / (4 * a²) )^(1/4)\n    Where:\n    *   T_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n    *   R_star is the radius of the star.\n    *   A is the planet's bond albedo.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n    For a circular orbit, the semi-major axis `a` is the orbital distance. A simplified and more common form for comparing planets in the same system is:\n    T_eq ∝ ( (1 - A) / a )^(1/2)\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** I need to find the ratio T_eq(4) / T_eq(2). Using the proportionality from the previous step:\n    T_eq(4) / T_eq(2) = [ ( (1 - A_4) / a_4 )^(1/2) ] / [ ( (1 - A_2) / a_2 )^(1/2) ]\n\n4.  **Apply the Given Information:** The problem states that the planets have the same albedo, so A_4 = A_2. This allows us to cancel out the (1 - A) term.\n    T_eq(4) / T_eq(2) = [ (1 / a_4)^(1/2) ] / [ (1 / a_2)^(1/2) ]\n    T_eq(4) / T_eq(2) = (a_2 / a_4)^(1/2) or sqrt(a_2 / a_4)\n\n5.  **Connect Semi-Major Axis to Orbital Period:** I don't have the semi-major axes, but I do have the orbital periods. I can relate these two quantities using Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion, which for a single star system states:\n    P² ∝ a³\n    This means the ratio of the squares of the periods is equal to the ratio of the cubes of the semi-major axes:\n    (P_4 / P_2)² = (a_4 / a_2)³\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a_4 / a_2):**\n    *   From the problem statement, the ratio of orbital periods is P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio P_4 / P_2 = 3.5 / 2 = 1.75.\n    *   Now, substitute this into the Kepler's Third Law relationship:\n        (1.75)² = (a_4 / a_2)³\n    *   To find (a_4 / a_2), I take the cube root of both sides:\n        a_4 / a_2 = (1.75²)^(1/3) = 1.75^(2/3)\n\n7.  **Substitute Back into the Temperature Ratio Equation:**\n    *   My temperature ratio is T_eq(4) / T_eq(2) = (a_2 / a_4)^(1/2).\n    *   Note that this is the inverse of the ratio I just found. So, a_2 / a_4 = 1 / (a_4 / a_2) = 1 / (1.75^(2/3)).\n    *   Now, substitute this into the temperature ratio equation:\n        T_eq(4) / T_eq(2) = [ 1 / (1.75^(2/3)) ]^(1/2)\n    *   Simplify the exponent:\n        T_eq(4) / T_eq(2) = 1 / (1.75^((2/3) * (1/2)))\n        T_eq(4) / T_eq(2) = 1 / (1.75^(1/3))\n\n8.  **Compute the Final Value:** The final step is to calculate the value of 1 divided by the cube root of 1.75. I will use a simple Python script for an accurate calculation.\n\n```python\n# The ratio of the orbital periods P4/P2\nP_ratio = 3.5 / 2\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq(4)/T_eq(2) is given by (a2/a4)^(1/2).\n# From Kepler's Third Law, (P4/P2)^2 = (a4/a2)^3.\n# So, a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3).\n# Therefore, T_eq(4)/T_eq(2) = (1 / ( (P4/P2)^(2/3) ) )^(1/2)\n# This simplifies to 1 / (P4/P2)^(1/3)\n\ntemperature_ratio = 1 / (P_ratio**(1/3))\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 to Planet_2, i.e., T_eq(4) / T_eq(2).\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates back into space. The formula is:\n    T_eq ∝ ( (1 - A) / a² )^(1/4)\n    where:\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (its average distance from the star).\n\n3.  **Set up the Ratio:** We can write the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet_4 and Planet_2 as:\n    T_eq(4) / T_eq(2) = [ ( (1 - A_4) / a_4² )^(1/4) ] / [ ( (1 - A_2) / a_2² )^(1/4) ]\n\n4.  **Simplify Using Given Information:**\n    *   The problem states that the planets have the same albedo, so `A_4 = A_2`. This allows the `(1 - A)` terms to cancel out.\n    *   The equation simplifies to:\n        T_eq(4) / T_eq(2) = [ (1 / a_4²) ^ (1/4) ] / [ (1 / a_2²) ^ (1/4) ]\n        T_eq(4) / T_eq(2) = (a_2² / a_4²)^(1/4)\n        T_eq(4) / T_eq(2) = (a_2 / a_4)^(2 * 1/4)\n        T_eq(4) / T_eq(2) = (a_2 / a_4)^(1/2)\n\n5.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis (a) to Orbital Period (P):** We don't have the distances (`a`), but we have the orbital periods (`P`). We can use Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion, which states that for planets orbiting the same star:\n    P² ∝ a³\n    This means the ratio of the squares of the periods is equal to the ratio of the cubes of the semi-major axes:\n    (P_4 / P_2)² = (a_4 / a_2)³\n\n6.  **Find the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a_2 / a_4):**\n    *   We need the ratio `a_2 / a_4` for our temperature equation. Let's rearrange the Kepler's Law equation:\n        (a_2 / a_4)³ = (P_2 / P_4)²\n    *   Take the cube root of both sides:\n        a_2 / a_4 = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)\n\n7.  **Substitute back into the Temperature Ratio Equation:**\n    *   Substitute the expression for `a_2 / a_4` into our simplified temperature ratio equation:\n        T_eq(4) / T_eq(2) = [ (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2)\n    *   Simplify the exponents by multiplying them ((2/3) * (1/2) = 1/3):\n        T_eq(4) / T_eq(2) = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    *   From the problem, the ratio of periods is P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n    *   So, the ratio P_2 / P_4 = 2 / 3.5.\n    *   The temperature ratio is (2 / 3.5)^(1/3).\n    *   Let's perform this calculation.\n\n```python\n# The ratio of the orbital periods P2/P4\nP_ratio = 2 / 3.5\n\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures T_eq(4)/T_eq(2) is given by (P2/P4)^(1/3)\ntemperature_ratio = P_ratio**(1/3)\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\nThe code output `0.8298265333662433` is approximately 0.83. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Objective:** The goal is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, which can be written as T_eq(4) / T_eq(2).\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is proportional to the inverse square root of its distance from the star, assuming other factors are constant. The full relationship is:\n    T_eq = T_star * ( (1 - A) * R_star² / (4 * a²) )^(1/4)\n    where `A` is the albedo and `a` is the semi-major axis (orbital distance for a circular orbit).\n\n3.  **Formulating the Ratio:** When comparing two planets in the same system (same T_star and R_star) and with the same albedo (`A`), the formula simplifies significantly.\n    T_eq(4) / T_eq(2) = [ (1/a_4²)^(1/4) ] / [ (1/a_2²)^(1/4) ]\n    T_eq(4) / T_eq(2) = (a_2² / a_4²)^(1/4)\n    T_eq(4) / T_eq(2) = (a_2 / a_4)^(1/2)\n\n4.  **Connecting Orbital Distance (a) and Orbital Period (P):** We are given the ratio of orbital periods (`P`), not distances (`a`). We must use Kepler's Third Law, which for planets orbiting the same star states:\n    P² ∝ a³  or  (P_x / P_y)² = (a_x / a_y)³\n\n5.  **Solving for the Distance Ratio (a_2 / a_4):**\n    From Kepler's Third Law: (a_2 / a_4)³ = (P_2 / P_4)²\n    To isolate (a_2 / a_4), we take the cube root of both sides:\n    a_2 / a_4 = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)\n\n6.  **Final Substitution:** Now we substitute this expression for the distance ratio back into our temperature ratio equation:\n    T_eq(4) / T_eq(2) = (a_2 / a_4)^(1/2)\n    T_eq(4) / T_eq(2) = [ (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2)\n    By multiplying the exponents ((2/3) * (1/2)), we get:\n    T_eq(4) / T_eq(2) = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)\n\n7.  **Calculation:**\n    *   The problem gives the orbital period ratios as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for Planet_1 through Planet_5.\n    *   This means P_2 corresponds to a value of 2, and P_4 corresponds to a value of 3.5.\n    *   The ratio P_2 / P_4 is 2 / 3.5.\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is (2 / 3.5)^(1/3).\n\n8.  **Code Verification:** The provided Python code calculates this exact value:\n    `P_ratio = 2 / 3.5`\n    `temperature_ratio = P_ratio**(1/3)`\n    The output is `0.8298...`, which rounds to `0.83`.\n\n9.  **Conclusion:** The calculated ratio matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
