    "This is a classic problem involving the exponential distribution, which governs radioactive decay. The key property of this distribution is that it is \"memoryless.\" This means the probability of decay in a future time interval is independent of how long the atom has already survived.\n\n**1. Define the Decay Process**\n\nRadioactive decay follows an exponential distribution. Let T be the lifetime of the atom. The probability that the atom has *not* decayed by time `t` (the survival probability) is given by:\n`P(T > t) = S(t) = exp(-λt)`\nwhere `λ` is the decay constant.\n\nThe probability that the atom *has* decayed by time `t` is:\n`P(T ≤ t) = F(t) = 1 - exp(-λt)`\n\n**2. Calculate the Decay Constant (λ)**\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%.\n`P(T ≤ 100) = 0.32`\n`1 - exp(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n`exp(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\nWe don't need to solve for `λ` explicitly. We can use this relationship directly.\n\n**3. Apply the Memoryless Property**\n\nThe question asks for the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\nLet's denote this as `P(T ≤ 50 + 150 | T > 50)`.\n\nBecause the decay process is memoryless, the fact that it has already survived 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future behavior. The probability of it decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of a brand new atom decaying in 150 minutes.\n\nSo, we need to calculate:\n`P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - exp(-λ * 150)`\n\n**4. Solve for the Probability**\n\nWe know that `exp(-λ * 100) = 0.68`.\nWe can write `exp(-λ * 150)` in terms of our known value:\n`exp(-λ * 150) = exp(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (exp(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n`exp(-λ * 150) = 0.68^1.5`\n\nNow, substitute this back into our probability calculation:\n`P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - 0.68^1.5`\n\nLet's compute the final value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We need to calculate 1 - (0.68 ** 1.5)\nprobability = 1 - (0.68 ** 1.5)\nprint(f\"The probability is: {probability}\")\n# Convert to percentage and round to check against options\nprint(f\"As a percentage: {probability * 100:.1f}%\")\n```\nThe probability is 0.4402651483984954.\nAs a percentage, this is approximately 44.0%.\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This problem deals with radioactive decay, which is a process that follows an exponential distribution. The most important characteristic of this process for this problem is that it is **memoryless**. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed without decaying.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Physics and Mathematics**\n\n*   Let T be the lifetime of the atom. The probability that the atom survives past time `t` is given by the survival function: `S(t) = P(T > t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n*   The probability that the atom decays by time `t` is the cumulative distribution function: `F(t) = P(T ≤ t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n**Step 2: Use the Given Information to Find the Decay Constant (λ)**\n\nWe are told that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n*   `P(T ≤ 100) = 0.32`\n*   `1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n*   `e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\nThis equation gives us a way to find `λ`, but we don't need to find its explicit value. We can use the expression `e^(-λ * 100)` directly.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the Question Mathematically**\n\nWe want to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\nThis is a conditional probability: `P(T ≤ 50 + 150 | T > 50)`.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the Memoryless Property**\n\nBecause radioactive decay is a memoryless process, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes has no impact on its future decay probability. The clock \"resets,\" so to speak.\nTherefore, the probability of it decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of a brand-new atom decaying in 150 minutes.\n*   `P(T ≤ 50 + 150 | T > 50) = P(T ≤ 150)`\n\nSo, we just need to calculate `P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Final Probability**\n\nWe need to calculate `1 - e^(-λ * 150)`. We can relate `e^(-λ * 150)` to our known value from Step 2:\n*   `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n*   Substituting the value from Step 2: `e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\nNow, we can calculate the final probability:\n*   `Probability of decay = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\nThe code execution confirms this calculation: `1 - (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.439`.\n\nConverting this to a percentage gives `43.9%`, which is approximately 44%.\n\n<<<D>>>"
