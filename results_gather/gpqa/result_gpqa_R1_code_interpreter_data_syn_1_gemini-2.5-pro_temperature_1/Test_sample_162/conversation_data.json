    "This problem requires us to find the minimum volume of a strong acid needed to dissolve a specific amount of Fe(OH)3 and the pH of the resulting solution. The dissolution process involves a neutralization reaction and a solubility equilibrium.\n\n**1. Stoichiometric Reaction**\n\nFirst, let's write the chemical reaction for the dissolution of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, in a strong acid (represented by H+):\nFe(OH)3(s) + 3H+(aq) → Fe3+(aq) + 3H2O(l)\n\nThis equation tells us that 1 mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ ions to react completely.\n\n**2. Moles of Fe(OH)3**\n\nWe need to calculate the number of moles in 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3.\n*   Molar mass of Fe = 55.845 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of O = 15.999 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of H = 1.008 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of Fe(OH)3 = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol = 9.3575 x 10^-4 mol\n\n**3. Moles of H+ for Reaction**\n\nUsing the stoichiometry from step 1, we can find the moles of H+ needed just to react with the Fe(OH)3:\n*   Moles of H+ (reacted) = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)3 = 3 * 9.3575 x 10^-4 mol = 2.8072 x 10^-3 mol\n\n**4. Solubility Equilibrium**\n\nSimply adding the stoichiometric amount of acid is not enough. The dissolution is governed by the solubility product constant, Ksp:\nFe(OH)3(s) ⇌ Fe3+(aq) + 3OH-(aq)\nKsp = [Fe3+][OH-]^3\n\nFor the Fe(OH)3 to be completely dissolved, the ion product ([Fe3+][OH-]^3) must be less than or equal to Ksp. The \"minimum\" amount of acid corresponds to the point where the solution is just saturated, i.e., [Fe3+][OH-]^3 = Ksp. To maintain this equilibrium, the concentration of OH- must be kept very low, which requires an acidic solution (an excess of H+).\n\nThe total moles of H+ added must account for both the reaction (step 3) and the excess H+ needed to maintain an acidic pH.\n\nTotal H+ added = H+ (reacted) + H+ (excess)\n\n**5. Analyzing the Options**\n\nInstead of assuming a Ksp value, we can work backward from the given options, as they provide both the final pH and the volume of acid added. The correct option must be internally consistent.\n\n*   **Total Volume** = 100 cm3 = 0.1 L\n*   **Acid Concentration** = 0.1 M\n*   **Final [Fe3+]** = Moles of Fe(OH)3 / Total Volume = (9.3575 x 10^-4 mol) / 0.1 L = 9.3575 x 10^-3 M\n\nLet's test the options for consistency. The following python code performs the check for each option.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants and given values\nmass_FeOH3 = 0.1  # g\nV_total = 0.1  # L (100 cm3)\nM_acid = 0.1  # mol/L\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# Molar masses\nMM_Fe = 55.845\nMM_O = 15.999\nMM_H = 1.008\nMM_FeOH3 = MM_Fe + 3 * (MM_O + MM_H)\n\n# --- Basic Calculations ---\n# Moles of Fe(OH)3 to be dissolved\nmoles_FeOH3 = mass_FeOH3 / MM_FeOH3\n\n# Moles of H+ required for stoichiometric reaction\nmoles_H_reacted = 3 * moles_FeOH3\n\n# Minimum volume of acid for reaction only\nV_acid_reacted_cm3 = moles_H_reacted / M_acid * 1000\n\n# Final concentration of Fe3+\nconc_Fe3_final = moles_FeOH3 / V_total\n\nprint(f\"Moles of Fe(OH)3 = {moles_FeOH3:.4e} mol\")\nprint(f\"Moles of H+ needed for reaction = {moles_H_reacted:.4e} mol\")\nprint(f\"Volume of 0.1M acid for reaction only = {V_acid_reacted_cm3:.2f} cm3\\n\")\n\n\n# --- Test Option B: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3 ---\nprint(\"--- Testing Option B ---\")\nV_acid_B_L = 30.09 / 1000  # L\npH_B = 2.69\n\n# Calculate pH from the given volume\nmoles_H_added_B = M_acid * V_acid_B_L\nmoles_H_excess_B = moles_H_added_B - moles_H_reacted\nconc_H_final_from_V_B = moles_H_excess_B / V_total\npH_calc_from_V_B = -math.log10(conc_H_final_from_V_B)\n\nprint(f\"Given V = {V_acid_B_L*1000:.2f} cm3, Calculated pH = {pH_calc_from_V_B:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Given pH = {pH_B}\")\nprint(\"The calculated pH matches the given pH.\\n\")\n\n\n# --- Check Other Options ---\nprint(\"--- Checking other options ---\")\n# Option C: 28.05 cm3.

    "The problem asks for the minimum volume of 0.1 M strong acid required to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3 in a total volume of 100 cm³, and the pH of the resulting solution.\n\n**Step 1: Write the chemical equation**\nThe dissolution of iron(III) hydroxide, a base, by a strong acid (H+) is a neutralization reaction:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nThis equation shows that for every 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ dissolved, 3 moles of H⁺ ions are consumed.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃**\nFirst, we need the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃.\nMolar Mass (Fe(OH)₃) = M(Fe) + 3 × (M(O) + M(H))\nMolar Mass (Fe(OH)₃) = 55.845 + 3 × (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol\n\nNow, calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ in 0.1 g:\nMoles = mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 9.3575 × 10⁻⁴ mol\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the moles of H⁺ required for the reaction**\nFrom the stoichiometry in Step 1, we need 3 moles of H⁺ for every mole of Fe(OH)₃.\nMoles of H⁺ (reacted) = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃\nMoles of H⁺ (reacted) = 3 × 9.3575 × 10⁻⁴ mol ≈ 2.8073 × 10⁻³ mol\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the volume of acid just for the reaction**\nThis gives the absolute minimum volume of acid required just to neutralize the Fe(OH)₃, without considering the equilibrium.\nVolume (acid) = Moles / Concentration\nVolume (acid) = (2.8073 × 10⁻³ mol) / (0.1 mol/L) = 0.028073 L\nConverting to cm³: 0.028073 L × 1000 cm³/L = 28.07 cm³\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the options**\nThe dissolution requires at least 28.07 cm³ of the acid. This immediately eliminates options C (28.05 cm³) and D (20.40 cm³), as they provide an insufficient amount of acid to react with all the Fe(OH)₃.\n\nWe are left with options A and B. For the solid to remain dissolved, the solution must be acidic (have excess H⁺), meaning the total volume of acid added must be greater than 28.07 cm³. Both A and B satisfy this. We must now check which option is internally consistent. The total amount of H⁺ added must account for the H⁺ that reacted and the H⁺ remaining that determines the final pH.\n\nTotal Moles of H⁺ added = Moles of H⁺ reacted + Moles of H⁺ in excess\n\nLet's test Option B: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³\n*   **Volume of acid added:** 30.09 cm³ = 0.03009 L\n*   **Total moles of H⁺ added:** Volume × Concentration = 0.03009 L × 0.1 M = 3.009 × 10⁻³ mol\n*   **Moles of H⁺ in excess:** Total H⁺ added - H⁺ reacted = (3.009 × 10⁻³) - (2.8073 × 10⁻³) = 2.017 × 10⁻⁴ mol\n*   **Concentration of excess H⁺:** The total volume of the solution is 100 cm³ = 0.1 L.\n    [H⁺] = Moles in excess / Total Volume = (2.017 × 10⁻⁴ mol) / 0.1 L = 2.017 × 10⁻³ M\n*   **Calculate the pH:** pH = -log₁₀([H⁺]) = -log₁₀(2.017 × 10⁻³) ≈ 2.695\n\nThe calculated pH of ~2.70 is consistent with the given pH of 2.69.\n\nLet's quickly check Option A for completeness: pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³\n*   **Volume of acid added:** 32.14 cm³ = 0.03214 L\n*   **Total moles of H⁺ added:** 0.03214 L × 0.1 M = 3.214 × 10⁻³ mol\n*   **Moles of H⁺ in excess:** (3.214 × 10⁻³) - (2.8073 × 10⁻³) = 4.067 × 10⁻⁴ mol\n*   **Concentration of excess H⁺:** (4.067 × 10⁻⁴ mol) / 0.1 L = 4.067 × 10⁻³ M\n*   **Calculate the pH:** pH = -log₁₀(4.067 × 10⁻³) ≈ 2.39\n\nThe calculated pH of 2.39 does not match the given pH of 3.16. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, only option B is chemically consistent.\n\n<<<B>>>"
