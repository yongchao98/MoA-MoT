    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct sequence of reagents.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material and Final Product**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This is a cyclohexane ring attached to an ethynyl group (-C≡CH). Its structure is C₆H₁₁-C≡CH. It has 8 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let's break down this IUPAC name to understand the structure.\n        *   The parent molecule is `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`. This is a cyclohexane ring with a carbaldehyde group (-CHO) attached. Let's denote the cyclohexane ring as Cy, so the molecule is Cy-CHO.\n        *   The substituent is `(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)`. This is a methyl group (-CH₃) where one hydrogen is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH) and another by a cyclohexyl group (-C₆H₁₁). So the substituent group is -CH(OH)C₆H₁₁.\n        *   The number `1-` indicates that this substituent is attached to carbon-1 of the parent cyclohexane ring. Carbon-1 is, by definition, the carbon atom to which the principal functional group (the -CHO) is attached.\n        *   Therefore, the final product has a structure where both a -CHO group and a -CH(OH)C₆H₁₁ group are attached to the same carbon atom of a cyclohexane ring.\n        *   This structure is the result of a self-aldol addition reaction of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. In this reaction, the enolate of one molecule of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule.\n\n2.  **Outline the Overall Synthetic Strategy**\n    The transformation requires two main stages:\n    *   **Stage 1:** Convert the starting material, ethynylcyclohexane, into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n    *   **Stage 2:** Induce the self-aldol addition of the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde formed in Stage 1 to yield the final product.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Proposed Reagent Sequence**\n\n    Let's analyze each option to see if it matches our proposed strategy.\n\n    **A) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)₂; 3. H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**\n    *   Step 1: `NaNH₂, CH₃Cl` converts ethynylcyclohexane (Cy-C≡CH) into 1-cyclohexylpropyne (Cy-C≡C-CH₃).\n    *   Step 2: `H₂/Pd` is a strong reducing agent that would convert the alkyne directly to an alkane, propylcyclohexane (Cy-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃).\n    *   Subsequent steps (hydration of an alkyne) are nonsensical on an alkane. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n    **B) 1. NaNH₂, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   Step 1: `NaNH₂, methanol (CH₃OH)`. NaNH₂ deprotonates the alkyne to form the acetylide anion (Cy-C≡C⁻). Methanol is a protic solvent that would immediately protonate the acetylide anion, regenerating the starting material (Cy-C≡CH). This sequence is unproductive.\n\n    **C) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. Ba(OH)₂**\n    *   **Step 1: `NaNH₂, methyl chloride`**: This step correctly converts ethynylcyclohexane (Cy-C≡CH) into 1-cyclohexylpropyne (Cy-C≡C-CH₃) by deprotonation followed by alkylation.\n    *   **Step 2: `H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`**: This is Lindlar's catalyst (or a component of it), used for the partial hydrogenation of an alkyne to a *cis*-alkene. This converts 1-cyclohexylpropyne to (Z)-1-cyclohexylpropene (*cis*-Cy-CH=CH-CH₃).\n    *   **Step 3: `O₃/ (CH₃)₂S`**: This is ozonolysis with a reductive workup. It cleaves the double bond of the alkene to form two carbonyl compounds. Cleavage of *cis*-Cy-CH=CH-CH₃ yields cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (Cy-CHO) and acetaldehyde (CH₃-CHO). This successfully completes Stage 1 of our strategy.\n    *   **Step 4: `Ba(OH)₂`**: Barium hydroxide is a strong base, which is a common catalyst for aldol reactions. In the presence of the two aldehydes produced in Step 3, it will catalyze aldol additions. One of the possible reactions is the self-condensation of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which, as determined in our initial analysis, forms the target product: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Although other aldol products will also be formed (from acetaldehyde self-condensation and crossed-aldol reactions), this sequence does produce the desired molecule. This sequence is chemically correct and achieves the synthesis.\n\n    **D) 1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ H₂O; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   Step 1: `NaNH₂, ethyl chloride` converts ethynylcyclohexane to 1-cyclohexylbut-1-yne (Cy-C≡C-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   Step 2: `Li/liq. NH₃` reduces the internal alkyne to a *trans*-alkene, (E)-1-cyclohexylbutene (*trans*-Cy-CH=CH-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   Step 3: `O₃/ H₂O` is ozonolysis with an oxidative workup. This cleaves the double bond and oxidizes the resulting aldehyde fragments to carboxylic acids. The products would be cyclohexanecarboxylic acid (Cy-COOH) and propanoic acid (CH₃CH₂-COOH).\n    *   This sequence produces carboxylic acids, not the required aldehyde intermediate, so it cannot lead to the final product.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**\n    Based on the step-by-step analysis, sequence C is the only one that provides a chemically logical and viable pathway to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane.\n\n<<<C>>>"
