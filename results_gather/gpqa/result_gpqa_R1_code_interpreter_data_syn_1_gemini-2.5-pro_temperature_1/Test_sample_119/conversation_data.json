    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the key quantities:**\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star as observed from two different points in Earth's orbit. It is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to the star. Mathematically, `plx = 1/d` (when `plx` is in arcseconds and `d` is in parsecs).\n    *   **Uniform distribution of stars:** This assumption means that the number density of stars (`ρ`), which is the number of stars per unit volume, is constant throughout space. `ρ = N/V = constant`.\n    *   **Target quantity:** We need to find the number of stars per unit range of parallax. This can be expressed as a derivative: `dN/d(plx)`. We want to see how this quantity depends on `plx`.\n\n2.  **Relate the number of stars to distance:**\n    *   Consider a thin spherical shell of space centered on the observer. Let the inner radius of the shell be `d` and the outer radius be `d + dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell (`dV`) is its surface area (`4πd^2`) times its thickness (`dd`). So, `dV = 4πd^2 dd`.\n    *   The number of stars (`dN`) within this shell is the number density (`ρ`) multiplied by the volume of the shell (`dV`).\n    *   `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd^2 dd`.\n\n3.  **Convert the relationship from distance (`d`) to parallax (`plx`):**\n    *   Our goal is to find `dN/d(plx)`. We have an expression for `dN` in terms of `d` and `dd`. We need to express `d` and `dd` in terms of `plx` and `d(plx)`.\n    *   From the definition of parallax, `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   To find the relationship between the infinitesimals `dd` and `d(plx)`, we differentiate `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [1/plx] = -1/plx^2`.\n    *   This gives us `dd = - (1/plx^2) d(plx)`.\n    *   The negative sign indicates that as parallax (`plx`) increases, distance (`d`) decreases. When we are counting stars in a shell, we are interested in the magnitude of the volume, so we can use the absolute value: `|dd| = (1/plx^2) d(plx)`.\n\n4.  **Substitute the parallax expressions into the equation for `dN`:**\n    *   Start with the equation from step 2: `dN = ρ * 4πd^2 dd`.\n    *   Replace `d` with `1/plx` and `dd` with `(1/plx^2) d(plx)`.\n    *   `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) d(plx)`.\n    *   `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) d(plx)`.\n    *   `dN = (4πρ / plx^4) d(plx)`.\n\n5.  **Determine the final proportionality:**\n    *   To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we divide by `d(plx)`.\n    *   `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx^4`.\n    *   Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` (by assumption) are constants, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is directly proportional to `1/plx^4`.\n    *   `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^4`.\n\nThis result means that there are far more stars with small parallaxes (which are far away) in a given parallax interval than there are stars with large parallaxes (which are nearby).\n\n<<<A>>>"
