    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Problem Information**\n\nFirst, let's break down the information provided by the 1H NMR spectrum of the 1:1 mixture.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula of Compounds:** C10H14. All options listed have this molecular formula.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** The two unknown compounds are present in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both are singlets, and their integration ratio is 1:1.\n    *   Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this means that each compound must contribute one aromatic signal (a singlet).\n    *   The 1:1 integration ratio implies that the number of protons giving rise to the singlet from Compound A is equal to the number of protons giving rise to the singlet from Compound B.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all are singlets, and their integration ratio is 2:1:1.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Candidate Compounds**\n\nNext, let's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds based on their molecular structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal. Since they have no adjacent non-equivalent protons, this signal will be a **singlet integrating to 2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single signal, which will be a **singlet integrating to 12H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry passing between the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions C5 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They are adjacent, but since they are equivalent, they do not split each other. They will produce a single **singlet integrating to 2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent by symmetry. They produce one **singlet integrating to 6H**.\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent by symmetry. They produce a second **singlet integrating to 6H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has no planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two separate signals**, each being a singlet (due to small meta-coupling) and each **integrating to 1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are in unique chemical environments. They will produce **four separate singlets**, each **integrating to 3H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 4 alkyl singlets (3H each).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single **singlet integrating to 4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent.\n        *   The two -CH2- groups are equivalent and are split by the three protons of the methyl group, producing a **quartet integrating to 4H**.\n        *   The two -CH3 groups are equivalent and are split by the two protons of the methylene group, producing a **triplet integrating to 6H**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (4H), 1 alkyl quartet (4H), 1 alkyl triplet (6H).\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow, let's see which 1:1 mixture of these compounds would produce the observed spectrum.\n\n*   **Observed Spectrum:**\n    *   Aromatic: 2 singlets (1:1 ratio)\n    *   Alkyl: 3 singlets (2:1:1 ratio)\n\nLet's test Option A: **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Aromatic Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (2H).\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes one singlet (2H).\n    *   The mixture would show **two singlets**. Since the number of protons for each is 2H, the integration ratio is 2:2, which simplifies to **1:1**. This is a **perfect match**.\n\n*   **Alkyl Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (12H).\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets (6H each).\n    *   The mixture would show a total of **three singlets**. Their integrations would be 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   The ratio of these integrations is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is also a **perfect match**.\n\nSince the combination in Option A perfectly explains all features of the observed NMR spectrum, we can conclude it is the correct answer. We can quickly rule out the other options:\n*   **Option B:** Would give 3 aromatic signals (one 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB). Incorrect.\n*   **Option C:** Would give 3 aromatic signals (one 2H singlet from 1,2,3,4-TMB and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB). Incorrect.\n*   **Option D:** The alkyl region would contain a quartet and a triplet from 1,4-diethylbenzene, but the observed spectrum only has singlets. Incorrect.\n\nTo confirm the analysis, the following Python code summarizes the expected signals for the mixture in Option A.\n```python\ndef analyze_mixture_A():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the predicted 1H NMR spectrum for a 1:1 mixture of\n    1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Compound 1: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\n    c1_aromatic_H = 2  # 1 singlet\n    c1_alkyl_H = [12]  # 1 singlet\n\n    # Compound 2: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\n    c2_aromatic_H = 2  # 1 singlet\n    c2_alkyl_H = [6, 6] # 2 singlets\n\n    # --- Analyze the 1:1 mixture spectrum ---\n\n    # Aromatic Region\n    print(\"--- Aromatic Region Analysis ---\")\n    print(f\"Number of signals: 2 (one from each compound)\")\n    print(f\"Type of signals: All singlets\")\n    print(f\"Integration ratio: {c1_aromatic_H}H : {c2_aromatic_H}H => 1:1\")\n    print(\"MATCHES experiment (2 singlets, 1:1 ratio).\\n\")\n\n    # Alkyl Region\n    print(\"--- Alkyl Region Analysis ---\")\n    combined_alkyl_integrals = sorted(c1_alkyl_H + c2_alkyl_H, reverse=True)\n    print(f\"Number of signals: {len(combined_alkyl_integrals)} (one from compound 1, two from compound 2)\")\n    print(f\"Type of signals: All singlets\")\n    print(f\"Integrations: {combined_alkyl_integrals[0]}H, {combined_alkyl_integrals[1]}H, {combined_alkyl_integrals[2]}H\")\n    # Normalize the ratio by the smallest value (6)\n    ratio = [h / min(combined_alkyl_integrals) for h in combined_alkyl_integrals]\n    print(f\"Integration ratio: {int(ratio[0])}:{int(ratio[1])}:{int(ratio[2])}\")\n    print(\"MATCHES experiment (3 singlets, 2:1:1 ratio).\")\n\nanalyze_mixture_A()\n```\n<<<\n--- Aromatic Region Analysis ---\nNumber of signals: 2 (one from each compound)\nType of signals: All singlets\nIntegration ratio: 2H : 2H => 1:1\nMATCHES experiment (2 singlets, 1:1 ratio).\n\n--- Alkyl Region Analysis ---\nNumber of signals: 3 (one from compound 1, two from compound 2)\nType of signals: All singlets\nIntegrations: 12H, 6H, 6H\nIntegration ratio: 2:1:1\nMATCHES experiment (3 singlets, 2:1:1 ratio).\n>>>\nThe analysis confirms that a 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only option that matches the experimental NMR data.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "To determine the two compounds in the mixture, we must analyze the provided 1H NMR data and compare it with the expected spectra for each potential compound.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Experimental NMR Data**\n\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals. Both are singlets, and their integration ratio is 1:1.\n    *   Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture, this means each compound contributes one aromatic singlet.\n    *   The 1:1 integration ratio signifies that the number of protons creating the singlet from the first compound is equal to the number of protons creating the singlet from the second compound.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals. All are singlets, and their integration ratio is 2:1:1.\n    *   The fact that all alkyl signals are singlets immediately suggests that the compounds are tetramethylbenzenes, as ethyl groups would produce a characteristic quartet and triplet. This allows us to eliminate **1,4-diethylbenzene** and, consequently, **option D**.\n    *   In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of alkyl protons is 12 (from compound 1) + 12 (from compound 2) = 24 protons.\n    *   The 2:1:1 ratio represents a total of 4 parts. The integration for each signal is:\n        *   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n        *   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n        *   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Therefore, the mixture's spectrum must show three alkyl singlets with integrations corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n### **2. Predicted Spectra for the Candidate Compounds**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR signals for the remaining tetramethylbenzene isomers:\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   Due to its high symmetry, it has two types of protons.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet integrating to 2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl:** The four methyl groups are equivalent. They produce **one singlet integrating to 12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet integrating to 2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: (C1-Me, C4-Me) and (C2-Me, C3-Me). This results in **two singlets, each integrating to 6H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule is less symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different environments. They would produce **two singlets, each integrating to 1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl:** All four methyl groups are in unique environments. This would produce **four singlets, each integrating to 3H**.\n\n### **3. Evaluating the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we can test which 1:1 mixture matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Mixture A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB also contributes one 2H singlet. The mixture will show **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 2H:2H, which simplifies to **1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets (6H each). The mixture will show a total of **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is also a perfect match.\n\nThis combination perfectly explains all features of the observed spectrum. We can quickly check the other options to be certain.\n\n*   **Mixture B:** Would have 3 aromatic signals (one 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB). This does not match the observed 2 signals.\n*   **Mixture C:** Would also have 3 aromatic signals (one 2H singlet from 1,2,3,4-TMB and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB). This does not match.\n\nTherefore, the mixture must contain 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
