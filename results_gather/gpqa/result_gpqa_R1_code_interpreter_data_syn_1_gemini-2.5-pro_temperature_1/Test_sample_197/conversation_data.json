    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the fraction of the `[Co(SCN)2]` complex relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution. This fraction is often denoted as α₂.\n\n**1. Identify all cobalt species:**\nIn the solution, cobalt(II) ions (`Co²⁺`) can exist as the free ion or as complexes with thiocyanate (`SCN⁻`). Given the stability constants β₁ to β₄, the following species will be present:\n*   `Co²⁺` (free ion)\n*   `[Co(SCN)]⁺`\n*   `[Co(SCN)2]`\n*   `[Co(SCN)3]⁻`\n*   `[Co(SCN)4]²⁻`\n\n**2. Define the total cobalt concentration:**\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)4]²⁻]`\n\n**3. Use the stability constants (β):**\nThe overall stability constants relate the concentration of each complex to the concentration of the free metal ion (`Co²⁺`) and the ligand (`SCN⁻`):\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)3]⁻] = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)4]²⁻] = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴`\n\nWe can substitute these expressions into the equation for the total cobalt concentration:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\nFactoring out `[Co²⁺]`:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**4. Calculate the fraction (α₂) of the dithiocyanato complex:**\nThe fraction of the `[Co(SCN)2]` complex (α₂) is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration:\n`α₂ = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n\nSubstituting the expressions from above:\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, leaving:\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**5. Plug in the values and calculate:**\nWe are given:\n*   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M (Since the total thiocyanate concentration is much larger than the total cobalt concentration (0.1 M >> 0.01 M), we can assume the free ligand concentration is approximately 0.1 M).\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nLet's calculate each term in the formula:\n*   **Numerator:** `β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   **Denominator:**\n    *   `1`\n    *   `β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1)¹ = 0.9`\n    *   `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4`\n    *   `β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063`\n    *   `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016`\n*   **Sum of denominator terms:** `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nNow, calculate α₂:\n`α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n**6. Convert to percentage:**\nPercentage = `α₂ * 100% = 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\nTo ensure precision, we can use a python script for the calculation.\n\n```python\n# Given stability constants and ligand concentration\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nscn_conc = 0.1\n\n# The fraction of the n-th complex (alpha_n) is given by:\n# alpha_n = (beta_n * [L]^n) / (1 + sum of (beta_i * [L]^i))\n\n# Calculate the denominator term (often denoted as the complex formation function, F)\n# F = 1 + beta1*[L] + beta2*[L]^2 + beta3*[L]^3 + beta4*[L]^4\ndenominator = 1 + beta1 * scn_conc**1 + beta2 * scn_conc**2 + beta3 * scn_conc**3 + beta4 * scn_conc**4\n\n# Calculate the numerator for the target complex, [Co(SCN)2] (n=2)\nnumerator_2 = beta2 * scn_conc**2\n\n# Calculate the fraction alpha_2\nalpha_2 = numerator_2 / denominator\n\n# Convert to percentage\npercentage_2 = alpha_2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage_2)\n```\n<execute_code>\n16.91618032648228\n</execute_code>\n\nThe calculation shows that the percentage of the `[Co(SCN)2]` complex is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The user wants to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, in a solution.\n\n### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Identify the species in solution:**\n    In a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN⁻), a series of complexation equilibria occur. Given the stability constants β₁, β₂, β₃, and β₄, the following cobalt-containing species will be present:\n    *   Free Co²⁺ ion\n    *   `[Co(SCN)]⁺` (monothiocyanato)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)2]` (dithiocyanato)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)3]⁻` (trithiocyanato)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)4]²⁻` (tetrathiocyanato)\n\n2.  **Define Total Cobalt Concentration:**\n    The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)4]²⁻]`\n\n3.  **Use Stability Constants (β):**\n    The overall stability constants (βn) relate the concentration of each complex to the free metal ion concentration `[Co²⁺]` and the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`:\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)3]⁻] = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)4]²⁻] = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n4.  **Express `c(Co)` in terms of `[Co²⁺]` and `[SCN⁻]`:**\n    Substitute the expressions from step 3 into the equation for `c(Co)`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n    Factor out `[Co²⁺]`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Fraction of `[Co(SCN)2]` (α₂):**\n    The question asks for the percentage of the `[Co(SCN)2]` complex. This is the fraction of this complex (α₂) multiplied by 100. The fraction α₂ is the concentration of the complex divided by the total cobalt concentration.\n    `α₂ = [[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)`\n\n    Substitute the expressions for `[[Co(SCN)2]]` and `c(Co)`:\n    `α₂ = (β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\n    The `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out:\n    `α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n6.  **Plug in the values and calculate:**\n    *   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M. The problem states the total thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. Since this is 10 times larger than the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), the amount of thiocyanate that forms complexes is relatively small. Thus, we can approximate the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` as 0.1 M.\n    *   β₁ = 9\n    *   β₂ = 40 (This is for the target complex `[Co(SCN)2]`)\n    *   β₃ = 63\n    *   β₄ = 16\n\n    Now, we can perform the calculation. Using a Python script will ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the given values\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nscn_concentration = 0.1\n\n# Calculate the numerator for alpha_2, which corresponds to the [Co(SCN)2] complex\nnumerator = beta2 * (scn_concentration**2)\n\n# Calculate the denominator, which is the sum of terms for all species\ndenominator = 1 + (beta1 * scn_concentration**1) + (beta2 * scn_concentration**2) + (beta3 * scn_concentration**3) + (beta4 * scn_concentration**4)\n\n# Calculate the fraction alpha_2\nalpha_2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha_2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage)\n```\nThe code output is `16.916180326482287`.\n\n7.  **Final Answer:**\n    The calculated percentage is approximately 16.9%. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The calculation has been performed correctly.\n\n### **Summary of Calculation**\n\n1.  **Goal:** Find the percentage of the `[Co(SCN)2]` species relative to the total cobalt concentration. This is represented by the distribution coefficient α₂.\n2.  **Formula:** The fraction α₂ is calculated using the formula:\n    `α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n3.  **Given Values:**\n    *   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n    *   β₁ = 9\n    *   β₂ = 40\n    *   β₃ = 63\n    *   β₄ = 16\n4.  **Substitution and Calculation:**\n    *   **Numerator:** `40 * (0.1)² = 0.4`\n    *   **Denominator:** `1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴) = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n    *   **Fraction (α₂):** `0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n5.  **Percentage:**\n    *   `0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThe code execution confirmed this result (`16.91618...%`). This value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
