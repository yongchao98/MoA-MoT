    "An electric dipole transition in a hydrogen atom is governed by the following selection rules for the quantum numbers $|n,l,m\\rangle$:\n1.  $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n2.  $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n3.  $\\Delta n$ can be any integer. For a decay process (emission), $n$ must decrease.\n\nThe problem describes a two-step cascade decay from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Let the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 1: Transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to an intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.**\n\n*   **Initial state:** $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$, so $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Selection rule for $l$**: Since $l_{initial}=0$, the intermediate state must have $l' = 0 \\pm 1 = 1$.\n*   **Selection rule for $m$**: Since $m_{initial}=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0 + (0, \\pm 1) = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   **Selection rule for $n$**: For a decay, $n' < n$. The problem options suggest the intermediate state has $n'=2$. This is the most probable transition as it has a smaller change in $n$.\n\nSo, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$. All paths shown in the options go through one of these states, so they are all valid routes.\n\n**Step 2: Transition from the intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.**\n\n*   **Intermediate state:** $|k\\rangle = |2,1,m'\\rangle$, with $n'=2, l'=1, m' \\in \\{1,0,-1\\}$.\n*   **Final state:** $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$, with $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n*   **Selection rule for $l$**: $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n*   **Selection rule for $m$**: $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m'$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$. This condition is satisfied for all possible intermediate $m' \\in \\{1,0,-1\\}$.\n    *   If $m'=0$, $\\Delta m = 0$. Allowed.\n    *   If $m'=1$, $\\Delta m = -1$. Allowed.\n    *   If $m'=-1$, $\\Delta m = +1$. Allowed.\n\nSo, all three cascade paths are allowed:\n*   Path 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   Path 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   Path 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nNow, we must determine the probability, which corresponds to the branching ratio for a given route. The probability of a cascade is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n\n**Branching Ratio for Step 1:**\n\nThe transition rate for spontaneous emission from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle$ is given by:\n$\\Gamma_{i \\to f} \\propto |\\langle f | \\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2$\nwhere $|\\langle f | \\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2 = |\\langle f | x | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | y | i \\rangle|^2 + |\\langle f | z | i \\rangle|^2$.\n\nWe need to compare the rates for the transitions from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the three possible intermediate states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n*   $\\Gamma_0 \\propto |\\langle 2,1,0 | \\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$\n*   $\\Gamma_1 \\propto |\\langle 2,1,1 | \\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$\n*   $\\Gamma_{-1} \\propto |\\langle 2,1,-1 | \\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$\n\nThe initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (since $l=0$). A spherically symmetric state has no preferred orientation in space. Therefore, when it decays, it must populate the degenerate final substates $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ equally. This physical intuition implies that the transition rates are equal:\n$\\Gamma_0 = \\Gamma_1 = \\Gamma_{-1}$\n\nA formal calculation using the Wigner-Eckart theorem or by calculating the matrix elements directly (using line strength formulas) confirms this result. The relative strengths for the transition from $l=0, m=0$ to $l'=1, m'=\\{1,0,-1\\}$ are in the ratio 1:1:1.\n\nSince there are three equally probable decay channels to the $2p$ subshell, the total rate is $\\Gamma_{total} = \\Gamma_0 + \\Gamma_1 + \\Gamma_{-1} = 3\\Gamma_0$. The branching ratio for the decay into any specific state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is:\n$BR(\\text{step 1, to } m') = \\frac{\\Gamma_{m'}}{\\Gamma_{total}} = \\frac{\\Gamma_0}{3\\Gamma_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**Branching Ratio for Step 2:**\n\nFor the second step, the atom is in one of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states. The only possible decay via an electric dipole transition is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. Any other transition is either forbidden or involves a much weaker mechanism. For example, decay to the $|2,0,0\\rangle$ state is forbidden by $\\Delta l=\\pm 1$. Decay to higher states is impossible. Therefore, the branching ratio for the second step, regardless of the intermediate state, is 1.\n$BR(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\n**Total Probability of the Cascade Route**\n\nThe total probability (or combined branching ratio) for a specific route is the product of the branching ratios of its steps. For the route specified in options A and C: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\nProbability = $BR(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times BR(|2,1,0\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle)$\nProbability = $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nSimilarly, the probability for the routes through $|2,1,1\\rangle$ and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ would also be $1/3$.\n\nNow we check the given options:\nA) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. (Probability is incorrect)\nB) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. (Probability is incorrect)\nC) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. (Route and probability are correct)\nD) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. (Probability is incorrect)\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$."
