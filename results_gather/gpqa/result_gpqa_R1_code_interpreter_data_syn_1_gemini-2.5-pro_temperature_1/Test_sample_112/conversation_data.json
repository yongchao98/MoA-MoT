    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct chemical formula:\n\n### **1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a very strong indicator of an O-H stretching vibration. The \"very broad\" nature is characteristic of the O-H group in a carboxylic acid, which forms strong hydrogen bonds.\n*   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the carbonyl region and is characteristic of a C=O double bond stretch. When seen in conjunction with a broad O-H peak, it strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n*   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is typical for a C=C double bond (alkene) stretch.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n### **2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbon atoms of a C=C double bond. This observation explicitly confirms the presence of an alkene, supporting the conclusion from the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n**Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The compound definitively contains a C=C double bond.\n\n### **3. Analysis of Mass Spectrum**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** We need to find a common chemical fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group (-COOH):\n    *   Mass = Mass(C) + Mass(O) + Mass(O) + Mass(H)\n    *   Mass = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n*   The fragment [COOH]⁺ is a very common and stable fragment observed in the mass spectra of carboxylic acids.\n\n**Conclusion from Mass Spectrometry:** The presence of a fragment at m/z = 45 provides strong evidence for a carboxylic acid group.\n\n### **4. Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating Formulas**\n\nBased on the analysis, the unknown compound must contain:\n1.  A **carboxylic acid group** (-COOH), which means it must have **two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  An **alkene group** (C=C).\n\nNow, let's determine the required **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule.\n*   The C=O bond in the carboxylic acid contributes **1** to the DoU.\n*   The C=C bond in the alkene contributes **1** to the DoU.\n*   Therefore, the total DoU for the molecule must be **2**.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on these two requirements: **2 oxygen atoms** and a **DoU of 2**. The DoU is calculated using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₂O₂:**\n    *   Oxygen atoms: 2 (Meets requirement)\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. (Does **not** meet requirement). This formula lacks the unsaturation needed for an alkene in addition to the carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **B) C₆H₁₀O:**\n    *   Oxygen atoms: 1 (Does **not** meet requirement). Cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. (Meets requirement, but oxygen count is wrong).\n\n*   **C) C₆H₁₀O₂:**\n    *   Oxygen atoms: 2 (Meets requirement)\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. (Meets requirement)\n    *   This formula perfectly fits all the evidence: it has enough oxygens for a carboxylic acid and the correct degree of unsaturation for both a carboxylic acid and an alkene.\n\n*   **D) C₆H₁₂O:**\n    *   Oxygen atoms: 1 (Does **not** meet requirement).\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. (Does **not** meet requirement).\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nOnly the formula **C₆H₁₀O₂** is consistent with all the spectroscopic data provided.\n\n<<<C>>>"
