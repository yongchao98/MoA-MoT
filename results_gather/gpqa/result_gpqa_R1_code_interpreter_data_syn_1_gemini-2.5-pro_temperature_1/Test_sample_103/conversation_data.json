    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method\n\nThe problem uses the Radial Velocity (RV) method, which detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. The star and planet orbit their common center of mass. As the star moves towards and away from us, its spectral lines shift to the blue and red, respectively.\n\nThe Doppler shift formula is:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c} $$\nwhere:\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda$ is the change in wavelength.\n*   $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n*   $v_r$ is the radial velocity of the star (its velocity along our line of sight).\n*   $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nThe problem gives the *amplitude* of the periodic wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$), which corresponds to the *amplitude* of the star's radial velocity ($K$).\n$$ K = v_{r,max} = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0} $$\n\n### 2. Relate the Observed Shifts to Radial Velocity Amplitudes\n\nWe are given the maximum wavelength shifts for the two systems:\n*   Planet #1: $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5 \\text{ mÅ}$\n*   Planet #2: $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7 \\text{ mÅ}$\n\nSince the same spectral line is used for both stars, $\\lambda_0$ is the same. The speed of light $c$ is also constant. Therefore, the ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes ($K_1$ and $K_2$) is directly proportional to the ratio of the wavelength shifts:\n$$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{c \\cdot (\\Delta\\lambda_2 / \\lambda_0)}{c \\cdot (\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\lambda_0)} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7 \\text{ mÅ}}{5 \\text{ mÅ}} = 1.4 $$\n\n### 3. Relate Radial Velocity Amplitude to Orbital Period\n\nThe amplitude of the star's radial velocity ($K$) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by the formula:\n$$ K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{(M_{star} + m_p)^{2/3}} $$\nwhere:\n*   $P$ is the orbital period.\n*   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n*   $m_p$ is the mass of the planet.\n*   $M_{star}$ is the mass of the star.\n*   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n\n### 4. Set up the Ratio for the Two Systems\n\nThe problem states that the two stars have the same mass ($M_{star,1} = M_{star,2} = M_{star}$) and the two planets have the same mass ($m_{p,1} = m_{p,2} = m_p$). Although the inclinations ($i_1$, $i_2$) are unknown, in such comparative problems, it is standard to assume they are the same, as there is no information to suggest otherwise.\n\nLet's write the expression for $K_1$ and $K_2$:\n$$ K_1 = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i_1}{(M_{star} + m_p)^{2/3}} $$\n$$ K_2 = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i_2}{(M_{star} + m_p)^{2/3}} $$\n\nNow, we take the ratio $K_2 / K_1$. All terms except the period ($P$) cancel out:\n$$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}}{\\left(\\frac{1}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\nThis shows that the radial velocity amplitude is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period: $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$.\n\n### 5. Solve for the Ratio of the Periods\n\nWe have two expressions for the ratio $K_2/K_1$:\n1.  From the data: $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7}{5}$\n2.  From the physics: $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nEquating them gives:\n$$ \\frac{7}{5} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\nTo solve for the desired ratio, $P_2 / P_1$, we first cube both sides:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{7}{5}\\right)^3 = \\frac{P_1}{P_2} $$\n$$ \\frac{7^3}{5^3} = \\frac{343}{125} = 2.744 = \\frac{P_1}{P_2} $$\n\nNow, we take the reciprocal to find $P_2 / P_1$:\n$$ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\frac{125}{343} $$\n\n### 6. Calculate the Final Value\n\nTo find the numerical answer, we perform the division. This can be done with a simple calculation.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the periods (P2/P1)\n# K2/K1 = 7/5\n# K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)\n# (K2/K1)^3 = P1/P2\n# P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3 = (5/7)^3\nperiod_ratio = (5/7)**3\nprint(period_ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.3644314868804665\n</execute_code>\nThe calculation gives approximately 0.3644. Comparing this to the options:\nA) ~ 0.85\nB) ~ 1.96\nC) ~ 1.40\nD) ~ 0.36\n\nThe calculated value is closest to 0.36.\n\nA larger stellar velocity ($K_2 > K_1$) implies a stronger gravitational tug, which happens when the planet is closer to the star. According to Kepler's Third Law, a closer orbit corresponds to a shorter period ($P_2 < P_1$). Our result, $P_2/P_1 \\approx 0.36$, is consistent with this physical intuition.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The user's question is to find the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1.\n\n**1. Reasoning and Physics Principles**\n\n*   **Radial Velocity (RV) Method:** The problem involves the RV method, where the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet causes its host star to \"wobble\" around their common center of mass. This wobble induces a periodic Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines.\n*   **Doppler Shift and Radial Velocity:** The magnitude of the wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) along our line of sight: $\\Delta\\lambda / \\lambda_0 = v_r / c$. The maximum observed shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) corresponds to the amplitude of the radial velocity curve, denoted as $K$.\n*   **Relationship between K and Observables:** Since the same spectral line is observed for both stars, the ratio of their RV amplitudes is equal to the ratio of their maximum wavelength shifts:\n    $ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} $\n*   **RV Amplitude and Orbital Parameters:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV amplitude $K$ is related to the planet's mass ($m_p$), the star's mass ($M_{star}$), and the orbital period ($P$) by the following formula:\n    $ K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{P}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{(M_{star} + m_p)^{2/3}} $\n    where $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n*   **Simplifying the Ratio:** The problem states that the stars have the same mass ($M_{star,1} = M_{star,2}$) and the planets have the same mass ($m_{p,1} = m_{p,2}$). It is a standard assumption in such problems to consider the inclinations to be the same ($i_1 = i_2$) since no other information is provided. Under these conditions, all terms in the formula for $K$ are constant for both systems except for the period, $P$.\n    Therefore, the relationship simplifies to:\n    $ K \\propto P^{-1/3} $\n    This means the ratio of the RV amplitudes is related to the ratio of the periods as:\n    $ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3} $\n\n**2. Calculation Steps**\n\n1.  Calculate the ratio of the RV amplitudes from the given wavelength shifts:\n    $ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{7 \\text{ miliangstrom}}{5 \\text{ miliangstrom}} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4 $\n\n2.  Equate this ratio with the expression involving the periods:\n    $ \\frac{7}{5} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{1/3} $\n\n3.  Solve for the ratio of the periods, $P_2/P_1$. First, cube both sides to eliminate the cube root:\n    $ \\left(\\frac{7}{5}\\right)^3 = \\frac{P_1}{P_2} $\n\n4.  Take the reciprocal of both sides to get the desired ratio, $P_2/P_1$:\n    $ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 $\n\n5.  Compute the numerical value.\n\n**3. Python Code for Calculation**\n\nThe following Python code calculates the final numerical value for the ratio $P_2/P_1$.\n```python\n# The ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes (K2/K1) is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts (Δλ2/Δλ1).\n# K2/K1 = 7 / 5\n# The relationship between K and the period P, for constant masses, is K ∝ P^(-1/3).\n# Therefore, K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3).\n# We want to find P2/P1.\n# (K2/K1)^3 = P1/P2\n# P2/P1 = 1 / (K2/K1)^3 = (K1/K2)^3\n# P2/P1 = (5/7)^3\nratio_of_periods = (5/7)**3\nprint(ratio_of_periods)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.3644314868804665\n</execute_code>\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculation yields a value of approximately 0.3644. Comparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~ 0.85\nB) ~ 1.96\nC) ~ 1.40\nD) ~ 0.36\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The calculation is correct. The ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1 is approximately 0.36.\n\nHere is a summary of the logic:\n\n1.  The amplitude of the star's radial velocity ($K$) is directly proportional to the observed periodic wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$). Therefore, the ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes is $K_2/K_1 = \\Delta\\lambda_2 / \\Delta\\lambda_1 = 7/5$.\n2.  For a given star mass and planet mass, the radial velocity amplitude $K$ is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period ($P$). This can be written as $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$.\n3.  Therefore, the ratio of the velocities is related to the ratio of the periods as follows: $K_2/K_1 = (P_2/P_1)^{-1/3} = (P_1/P_2)^{1/3}$.\n4.  Combining these two relationships, we get: $7/5 = (P_1/P_2)^{1/3}$.\n5.  To find the desired ratio, $P_2/P_1$, we solve the equation: $P_2/P_1 = (5/7)^3$.\n6.  The calculation yields $(5/7)^3 \\approx 0.3644$, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
