    "An optically active compound is a chiral compound, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common source of chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters. A molecule is achiral if it possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Let's analyze each compound for chirality.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   Structure: `Cl(H)C=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. A planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and is therefore achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   This is a complex name, but the stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)` are key. They specify the absolute configuration of two stereocenters. A compound with specific R/S configurations is a single stereoisomer.\n    *   This stereoisomer will be optically active unless it is a meso compound. A meso compound must have internal symmetry. For a compound with two stereocenters to be meso, the centers must have opposite configurations (e.g., R and S) and be stereochemically equivalent.\n    *   The ring system is a derivative of norbornane. The stereocenters 3a and 7a are the bridgehead atoms where the anhydride ring is fused. These positions are not stereochemically equivalent. Therefore, the molecule cannot be meso.\n    *   The name refers to a specific chiral molecule (a single enantiomer).\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   This molecule has two stereocenters at C2 and C3. The descriptors are (2R,3S).\n    *   This is a classic example of a meso compound. Due to the symmetrical nature of the molecule, the (2R,3S) stereoisomer has a plane of symmetry when viewed in an eclipsed conformation and a center of inversion in a staggered conformation.\n    *   Meso compounds are achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the previous compound. The stereoisomer is (2R,3R).\n    *   This molecule lacks any internal symmetry elements (plane or center). It is chiral and has a non-superimposable mirror image, which is the (2S,3S) enantiomer.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   Structure: A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an -OH group on C1.\n    *   The carbon at position 1 is bonded to four different groups: H, OH, the `-CH2-CH=CH-` path, and the `-CH2-CH2-CH=` path. These two paths around the ring are different. Thus, C1 is a stereocenter.\n    *   The name specifies the (R) enantiomer, which is a single chiral molecule.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This name describes the all-`cis` isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring.\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetric. It possesses a C3 axis of rotation and three planes of symmetry that pass through each C-OH bond.\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   Structure: `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   We need to check for stereocenters. The carbon `CH(CH3)2` is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a stereocenter. There are no other potential stereocenters in the molecule.\n    *   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that contains the carbonyl group and the isobutyl group's backbone, bisecting the two terminal methyl groups.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   Conclusion: **Optically inactive**.\n\nSummary:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds in the list.\n\n<<<C>>>"
