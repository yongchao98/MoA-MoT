    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### **1. Understanding Mean Free Path (λ)**\n\nThe mean free path (MFP) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula for the MFP of a particle 'a' moving through a gas of particles 'b' is:\n\nλ = 1 / (n_b * σ_ab)\n\nwhere:\n*   **n_b** is the number density of the target particles 'b'.\n*   **σ_ab** is the effective collision cross-section between particle 'a' and particle 'b'.\n\nA more refined formula from the kinetic theory of gases accounts for the relative motion of the particles.\n\n### **2. Defining λ1 and λ2**\n\n*   **λ1: Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules**\n    This is the MFP for a gas molecule colliding with other identical gas molecules. The standard formula from kinetic theory is:\n    λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n    *   **n** is the number density of the gas molecules.\n    *   **σ_gg** is the collision cross-section between two gas molecules.\n    *   The **√2** factor accounts for the relative velocities of the gas molecules, which are all moving at thermal speeds.\n\n*   **λ2: Mean Free Path of Electrons**\n    This is the MFP for an electron from the beam colliding with a gas molecule. The formula is:\n    λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n    *   **n** is the same gas molecule density.\n    *   **σ_eg** is the collision cross-section for an electron hitting a gas molecule.\n    *   In this case, the electrons are moving at relativistic speeds (1000 kV corresponds to ~0.94c), which is vastly greater than the thermal speed of the gas molecules. Therefore, the gas molecules can be considered stationary targets, and the √2 factor is not used.\n\n### **3. Comparing λ1 and λ2**\n\nTo compare λ2 and λ1, we can take their ratio:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]\nλ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)\n**λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)**\n\nThe relationship between λ1 and λ2 boils down to the ratio of the two collision cross-sections: the gas-gas cross-section (σ_gg) and the electron-gas cross-section (σ_eg).\n\n### **4. Comparing the Collision Cross-Sections (σ)**\n\nWe can compare the cross-sections using two main arguments:\n\n*   **Argument 1: The Classical Hard-Sphere Model**\n    This is a common and intuitive model.\n    *   We model a gas molecule as a hard sphere with a diameter 'd' (and radius r = d/2).\n    *   The collision cross-section for two identical molecules is the area of a circle with radius 'd' (the minimum distance between their centers for a collision). So, **σ_gg = πd²**.\n    *   We model the electron as a point particle (diameter ≈ 0). The cross-section for this point particle hitting the gas molecule sphere is the area of the molecule itself. So, **σ_eg = πr² = π(d/2)² = πd²/4**.\n    *   According to this model, **σ_gg = 4 * σ_eg**.\n\n*   **Argument 2: Physical Principles of High-Energy Scattering**\n    *   The problem states the electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV (1 MeV). These are highly energetic, relativistic particles.\n    *   High-energy particles are known to be highly **penetrating**. This means they are less likely to interact with matter than lower-energy or larger particles. The interaction time is extremely short, and only very direct hits result in significant scattering.\n    *   Therefore, the scattering cross-section for a 1 MeV electron on a gas molecule (σ_eg) is expected to be significantly **smaller** than the gas-kinetic cross-section for two molecules bumping into each other (σ_gg). So, **σ_eg << σ_gg**, which means the ratio **(σ_gg / σ_eg) >> 1**.\n\n### **5. Final Conclusion**\n\nLet's use the results from comparing the cross-sections to find the ratio of the mean free paths.\n\n*   Using the Hard-Sphere Model:\n    λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg) = √2 * 4 = 4√2 ≈ 5.66\n\n*   Using the Physical Principles:\n    Since (σ_gg / σ_eg) >> 1, then λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (a number much greater than 1). This means λ2 / λ1 >> √2 ≈ 1.414.\n\nBoth approaches strongly indicate that λ2 is significantly larger than λ1. Let's check the options:\nA) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1  (i.e., 1 < λ2/λ1 < 1.22)\nB) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1       (i.e., λ2/λ1 >= 1.22)\nC) λ2 < λ1             (i.e., λ2/λ1 < 1)\nD) λ2 = λ1             (i.e., λ2/λ1 = 1)\n\nOur calculated ratios (5.66 and >>1.414) are both greater than 1.22. Therefore, the only consistent conclusion is that λ2 is greater than or equal to 1.22*λ1.\n\nTo formally verify the calculation from the hard-sphere model:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# This code calculates the ratio of the electron mean free path (lambda_2) to the\n# gas-molecule mean free path (lambda_1) based on the classical hard-sphere model.\n\n# The ratio lambda_2 / lambda_1 is given by:\n# ratio = (sqrt(2) * sigma_gg) / sigma_eg\n\n# In the hard-sphere model, the ratio of the cross-sections is:\n# sigma_gg / sigma_eg = 4\n\nsigma_ratio = 4.0\n\n# The ratio of the mean free paths is:\nmfp_ratio = math.sqrt(2) * sigma_ratio\n\nprint(f\"The hard-sphere model predicts the ratio lambda_2 / lambda_1 to be: {mfp_ratio}\")\n\n# The most conservative estimate assumes the cross-sections are equal (sigma_ratio = 1)\nconservative_mfp_ratio = math.sqrt(2) * 1.0\nprint(f\"A conservative estimate assuming sigma_eg = sigma_gg gives a ratio of: {conservative_mfp_ratio}\")\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n### **1. Define Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between successive collisions. The general formula depends on the number density of target particles (`n`) and the collision cross-section (`σ`):\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\n\nHowever, this simple formula needs to be adjusted based on the relative motion of the colliding particles.\n\n### **2. Analyze λ1: Gas Molecule MFP**\n\n*   **Scenario:** This describes a gas molecule moving through other gas molecules.\n*   **Particles:** Both the \"projectile\" particle and the \"target\" particles are gas molecules of the same type, moving at thermal speeds.\n*   **Formula:** The kinetic theory of gases provides a refined formula for this case, which accounts for the fact that the target molecules are not stationary. This introduces a factor of the square root of 2.\n    λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of gas molecules.\n    *   `σ_gg` is the collision cross-section between two gas molecules (gas-gas).\n\n### **3. Analyze λ2: Electron MFP**\n\n*   **Scenario:** This describes a high-energy electron from the beam moving through the gas molecules.\n*   **Particles:** The \"projectile\" is a high-energy electron, and the \"targets\" are the gas molecules.\n*   **Formula:** The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, making them relativistic (moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light). Their velocity is vastly greater than the thermal velocity of the gas molecules. In this situation, the gas molecules can be considered effectively stationary targets. Therefore, the √2 factor is not applicable.\n    λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg)\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the same number density of gas molecules.\n    *   `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for an electron colliding with a gas molecule (electron-gas).\n\n### **4. Compare λ1 and λ2**\n\nTo find the relationship between λ₁ and λ₂, we can calculate their ratio:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]\nλ₂ / λ₁ = (√2 * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)\n**λ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)**\n\nThis ratio depends on two key factors:\n1.  The `√2` term (≈ 1.414), which arises from the relative motion of particles in the gas-gas case.\n2.  The ratio of the collision cross-sections `(σ_gg / σ_eg)`.\n\n### **5. Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg)**\n\n*   **σ_gg (Gas-Gas):** This is the kinetic cross-section, which can be thought of as the effective area for a \"billiard ball\" type collision between two molecules. It's determined by the physical size of the molecules.\n*   **σ_eg (Electron-Gas):** This is the scattering cross-section. The electron is a point-like particle, and it is extremely energetic (1000 kV). High-energy particles are highly penetrating, meaning they are less likely to interact or be deflected by a target. Therefore, the effective area for scattering an electron (`σ_eg`) is significantly smaller than the kinetic area for two molecules bumping into each other (`σ_gg`).\n*   **Conclusion on Cross-Sections:** It is physically certain that `σ_gg > σ_eg`, which means the ratio **(σ_gg / σ_eg) > 1**.\n\n### **6. Final Calculation and Conclusion**\n\nWe have the relationship: **λ₂ = λ₁ * √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)**\n\nLet's consider the most conservative possible case, where we assume (unrealistically) that the cross-sections are equal, i.e., `(σ_gg / σ_eg) = 1`.\n\n*   **Conservative Lower Bound:** λ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * 1 ≈ 1.414\n*   This means that at the absolute minimum, λ₂ is about 1.414 times larger than λ₁.\n\nNow, let's examine the options based on our finding that `λ₂ / λ₁ ≥ 1.414`:\n\n*   A) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1  -->  1 < λ₂/λ₁ < 1.22  (Incorrect, our lower bound is 1.414)\n*   **B) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1       -->  λ₂/λ₁ >= 1.22  (Correct, as 1.414 is greater than 1.22)**\n*   C) λ2 < λ1             -->  λ₂/λ₁ < 1       (Incorrect)\n*   D) λ2 = λ1             -->  λ₂/λ₁ = 1       (Incorrect)\n\nThe analysis shows that λ₂ must be significantly larger than λ₁, and specifically, it must be greater than or equal to 1.22 * λ₁. The code execution confirms that even the most conservative estimate (ratio of 1.414) satisfies this condition.\n\n<<<B>>>"
