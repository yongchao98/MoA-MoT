    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   A: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (a norbornadiene derivative)\n    *   B: 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene\n    *   Reagents: 2 equivalents of B, sodium iodide (NaI), elevated temperature.\n\n*   **Analysis:** The reaction of B with NaI is key. The name \"5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene\" is highly unusual, and its reaction with NaI to form a clean product for a subsequent reaction is not standard. In the context of complex synthesis problems, such unusual names often represent a typo or are precursors to a more common reactive intermediate.\n*   A plausible interpretation is that the intended reactant is **5,6-bis(bromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene**. This compound, upon treatment with a reducing agent like NaI or Zn, undergoes a 1,4-elimination to generate a highly reactive diene: **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene** (let's call this diene **B'**). This is a known method for generating such dienes.\n*   The reaction is then a double Diels-Alder cycloaddition. The norbornadiene (A) acts as the dienophile, using its two C=C double bonds. The diene is B', which has a reactive s-cis endocyclic diene system (from C1 to C4).\n*   Two molecules of B' react with one molecule of A to form Product 1, which is a large, complex molecule containing the central norbornane skeleton fused to two polycyclic systems.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄/H₂O).\n*   **Analysis:** These are standard conditions for the acidic hydrolysis of a tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy group at the C7 position of the norbornane core is cleaved to yield a secondary alcohol (-OH).\n*   So, Product 2 is the same as Product 1, but with a hydroxyl group at C7.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO.\n*   **Analysis:** This is the Parikh-Doering oxidation. It is a mild method for oxidizing primary and secondary alcohols. The secondary alcohol at C7 is oxidized to a ketone (C=O).\n*   So, Product 3 is the same as Product 1, but with a carbonyl group at C7. The core structure is that of 7-oxobicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (norbornadien-7-one), with the two large adducts still attached.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is heated to 150°C.\n*   **Analysis:** Diels-Alder reactions are reversible. Heating the adduct can cause a retro-Diels-Alder reaction, especially when it leads to the formation of stable molecules.\n*   Product 3 will decompose via a retro-Diels-Alder reaction to regenerate the original dienophile and dienes.\n    *   `Product 3 → norbornadien-7-one + 2 B'`\n*   The dienophile, norbornadien-7-one, is known to be thermally unstable. It readily undergoes a cheletropic reaction, eliminating a molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) to form the very stable aromatic molecule, benzene.\n    *   `norbornadien-7-one → Benzene + CO`\n*   The final mixture of products consists of benzene, carbon monoxide, and the diene B' (**5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**). The question asks for \"product 4\", which in this context refers to the significant organic product, B'.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**\n\nTo find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule consists of a six-membered ring with double bonds at C1-C2 and C3-C4, and exocyclic double bonds (=CH₂) at C5 and C6.\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses C₂ᵥ symmetry. It has a C₂ rotational axis that passes through the midpoints of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds. This symmetry makes certain groups of hydrogen atoms chemically equivalent.\n\nLet's count the sets of equivalent hydrogens:\n1.  **H1 and H4:** The protons on carbons C1 and C4 are interchanged by the C₂ rotation. They are chemically equivalent. (1 set)\n2.  **H2 and H3:** The protons on carbons C2 and C3 are interchanged by the C₂ rotation. They are chemically equivalent. (1 set)\n3.  **Methylene Protons:** The two protons on each exocyclic methylene group (e.g., at C5) are not equivalent to each other; they are diastereotopic because of the chiral-like environment of the ring. Let's call them H_exo and H_endo. However, the C₂ rotation makes the H_exo on C5 equivalent to the H_exo on C6. (1 set)\n4.  Similarly, the C₂ rotation makes the H_endo on C5 equivalent to the H_endo on C6. (1 set)\n\nIn total, there are **4** distinct sets of hydrogen atoms. Therefore, the ¹H NMR spectrum of this compound would show 4 different signals.\n\n<<<D>>>"
