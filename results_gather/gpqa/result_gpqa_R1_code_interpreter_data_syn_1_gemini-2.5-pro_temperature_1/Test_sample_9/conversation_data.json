    "This problem requires us to compare the densities of four different exoplanets. Density is defined as mass divided by volume (ρ = M/V). For a spherical planet, the volume is V = (4/3)πR³, where R is the radius.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is essentially a replica of Earth. Earth's average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm³. So, the density of this planet is ~5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is given directly in the problem description. The density is ~5.5 g/cm³.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** A planet with the same composition but less mass will experience weaker self-gravity. This leads to less internal compression compared to Earth. Therefore, its material will be less squeezed, and its overall density will be *lower* than Earth's density (< 5.51 g/cm³).\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** This is the key option. A planet with the same raw materials as Earth but significantly more mass will have much stronger self-gravity. This immense gravity will compress the materials, especially in the core, to a much greater degree than on Earth. This gravitational compression increases the overall density of the planet. Therefore, its density will be *higher* than Earth's density (> 5.51 g/cm³).\n\n**Let's use a more quantitative approach to confirm this:**\nFor rocky planets, the radius does not scale linearly with mass due to this compression effect. A common approximation for the mass-radius relationship is R ∝ M^k, where k is an exponent less than 1/3 (a value of 1/3 would imply constant density). Empirical models and observations suggest k is around 0.27-0.28 for terrestrial planets.\n\nDensity (ρ) is proportional to M/R³.\nSo, ρ ∝ M / (M^k)³ ∝ M / M^(3k) ∝ M^(1-3k).\nUsing k ≈ 0.27, we get ρ ∝ M^(1 - 3*0.27) = M^0.19.\n\nThis relationship shows that as mass (M) increases, density (ρ) also increases.\n*   For planet (c), M = 5 M_earth, so its density will be higher than Earth's.\n*   For planet (d), M = 0.5 M_earth, so its density will be lower than Earth's.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   Density(a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n*   Density(b) ≈ 5.50 g/cm³\n*   Density(c) > 5.51 g/cm³ (due to higher mass and compression)\n*   Density(d) < 5.51 g/cm³ (due to lower mass and less compression)\n\nComparing these, planet (c) has the highest density.\n\n<<<D>>>"
