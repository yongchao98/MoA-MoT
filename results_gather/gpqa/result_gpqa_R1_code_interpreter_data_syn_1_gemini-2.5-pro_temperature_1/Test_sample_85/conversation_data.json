    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Structures**\n\n*   **Starting Material (A and B):** The chemical name provided is `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. Let's break this down to understand its structure.\n    *   \"Pentanoic acid\": A five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at one end (C1).\n    *   \"3-ethyl\": An ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) is attached to the third carbon (C3).\n    *   \"5-isobutoxy-5-oxo\": This indicates that at the fifth carbon (C5), there is an ester group. Specifically, it's an isobutyl ester (-COOCH₂(CH₃)₂).\n    *   The structure is therefore a mono-ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid: `HOOC-CH₂(C2)-CH(Et)(C3)-CH₂(C4)-C(=O)O-iBu(C5)`.\n    *   This molecule has a chiral center at C3, which can have either an (R) or (S) configuration.\n\n*   **Product:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n    *   \"tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\": This is a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom and a carbonyl group next to it (a δ-lactone).\n    *   \"4-ethyl\": An ethyl group is on the fourth carbon of the ring (numbering starts from the ring oxygen as 1, carbonyl carbon as 2).\n    *   The chiral center in the product is at C4.\n    *   Reaction 1 yields the (R)-enantiomer, and Reaction 2 yields the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Reaction Pathways**\n\nThe transformation from the starting material to the lactone product requires the reduction of one carbonyl group to an alcohol, followed by an intramolecular cyclization (lactonization). The key to solving this problem lies in the different chemoselectivities of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃.\n\nThe chiral center in the starting material (C3) becomes the chiral center in the product (C4). The chemical reactions (reduction and cyclization) occur at the ends of the molecule (C1 and C5) and do not involve breaking or forming any bonds at the C3 chiral center. Therefore, the stereochemical configuration (R or S) of the starting material is retained in the product.\n\n*   An (R)-starting material will produce an (R)-lactone.\n*   An (S)-starting material will produce an (S)-lactone.\n\n### **3. Reaction 1: Starting Material A + LiBH₄**\n\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a nucleophilic reducing agent. It readily reduces esters to primary alcohols. However, it is generally unreactive towards carboxylic acids because the acidic proton is first removed to form a carboxylate anion (-COO⁻), which is electron-rich and repels the incoming nucleophilic hydride (BH₄⁻).\n*   **Reaction Sequence:**\n    1.  **Reduction:** LiBH₄ selectively reduces the isobutyl ester at C5 to a primary alcohol, leaving the C1 carboxylic acid untouched.\n        `A (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu) --LiBH₄--> HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`\n    2.  **Lactonization:** The H⁺ workup catalyzes the intramolecular esterification between the C5-hydroxyl group and the C1-carboxylic acid, forming the six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemical Conclusion:** The product of this reaction is `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. Since the configuration is retained, the starting material **A must be (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **4. Reaction 2: Starting Material B + BH₃**\n\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) is an electrophilic reducing agent. It is exceptionally effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. While it can also reduce esters, its reaction with carboxylic acids is much faster. Thus, it selectively reduces the carboxylic acid in the presence of an ester.\n*   **Reaction Sequence:**\n    1.  **Reduction:** BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid at C1 to a primary alcohol, leaving the C5 isobutyl ester untouched.\n        `B (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu) --BH₃--> HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOiBu`\n    2.  **Lactonization:** The H⁺ workup catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed C1-hydroxyl group attacks the C5-ester carbonyl, forming the same six-membered lactone and releasing isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemical Conclusion:** The product of this reaction is `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. Since the configuration is retained, the starting material **B must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **5. Final Answer**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
