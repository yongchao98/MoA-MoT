    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State and Hamiltonian**\n    *   The particle is spin 1/2, and its magnetic moment is `μ = γS`, where `S` is the spin operator and `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n    *   Initially, the particle is in a magnetic field `B` along the +Z direction (`B_vec = B * z_hat`). The Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -μ ⋅ B_vec = -γS ⋅ (B * z_hat) = -γB * S_z`.\n    *   The particle is \"aligned with the magnetic field,\" which means it is in the lowest energy eigenstate of `H_initial`. The eigenstates of `S_z` are spin-up `|+z>` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z>` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n    *   The corresponding energies are `E_+ = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_- = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n    *   The lowest energy state is `E_+`, which corresponds to the spin-up state `|+z>`. Therefore, the initial state of the system at time `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n2.  **Identify the New Hamiltonian and the Time Evolution**\n    *   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction (`B_vec = B * y_hat`).\n    *   For `t > 0`, the new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of the system is `H = -μ ⋅ B_vec = -γB * S_y`.\n    *   The state of the system at a later time `t` is given by the Schrödinger equation: `|ψ(t)> = e^(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>`.\n    *   Substituting the new Hamiltonian and the initial state, we get:\n        `|ψ(t)> = e^(-i(-γB * S_y)t/ħ) |+z> = e^(iγBt * S_y / ħ) |+z>`.\n\n3.  **Solve for the Time-Evolved State `|ψ(t)>`**\n    *   To calculate the effect of the evolution operator `e^(iγBt * S_y / ħ)`, it is easiest to work in the eigenbasis of `S_y`.\n    *   The eigenstates of `S_y` are `|+y>` and `|-y>`, with eigenvalues `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`, respectively.\n    *   The initial state `|+z>` can be expressed as a superposition of these `S_y` eigenstates:\n        `|+z> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`\n    *   Now, we apply the time evolution operator. Since `|+y>` and `|-y>` are eigenstates of `H = -γB * S_y`, the operator acts on them simply by multiplying by a phase factor `e^(-iEt/ħ)`.\n    *   The energy eigenvalues corresponding to `|+y>` and `|-y>` are:\n        `E_y+ = -γB(+ħ/2)`\n        `E_y- = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`\n    *   So, the time evolution of the state is:\n        `|ψ(t)> = e^(-iHt/ħ) * (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * (e^(-iE_y+ t/ħ) |+y> + e^(-iE_y- t/ħ) |-y>)`\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * (e^(iγBt/2) |+y> + e^(-iγBt/2) |-y>)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of the Z-Component of the Magnetic Moment**\n    *   The goal is to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    *   To do this, we can express `|ψ(t)>` back in the z-basis.\n        `|+y> = (1/√2) * (|+z> + i|-z>)`\n        `|-y> = (1/√2) * (|+z> - i|-z>)`\n    *   Substituting these into the expression for `|ψ(t)>`:\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/√2) * [ e^(iγBt/2) * (1/√2)(|+z> + i|-z>) + e^(-iγBt/2) * (1/√2)(|+z> - i|-z>) ]`\n        `|ψ(t)> = (1/2) * [ (e^(iγBt/2) + e^(-iγBt/2))|+z> + i(e^(iγBt/2) - e^(-iγBt/2))|-z> ]`\n    *   Using Euler's identities (`cos(x) = (e^(ix) + e^(-ix))/2` and `sin(x) = (e^(ix) - e^(-ix))/(2i)`):\n        `|ψ(t)> = cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>`\n    *   Now we can calculate the expectation value of `S_z`:\n        `<S_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`\n        `<S_z>(t) = [cos(γBt/2)<+z| - sin(γBt/2)<-z|] * S_z * [cos(γBt/2)|+z> - sin(γBt/2)|-z>]`\n        Since `S_z|+z> = (ħ/2)|+z>` and `S_z|-z> = (-ħ/2)|-z>`, we get:\n        `<S_z>(t) = cos²(γBt/2) * (ħ/2) - sin²(γBt/2) * (ħ/2)`\n        `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * [cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2)]`\n    *   Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2x) = cos²(x) - sin²(x)`:\n        `<S_z>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n\n5.  **Determine the Oscillation Frequency**\n    *   The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n        `<μ_z>(t) = γ<S_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n    *   This expression describes an oscillation with a time-dependent term `cos(ωt)`, where the angular frequency `ω` is `γB`.\n\n*Alternative (Quicker) Method:*\nThe system is a two-level system governed by the Hamiltonian `H = -γB * S_y`. The energy eigenvalues are `E_y+ = -γBħ/2` and `E_y- = +γBħ/2`. The energy difference between the two levels is `ΔE = E_y- - E_y+ = γBħ`.\nFor a two-level system, when the initial state is a superposition of the two energy eigenstates (which `|+z>` is), the expectation values of observables that are not diagonal in the energy basis (like `S_z`) will oscillate at an angular frequency given by `ω = ΔE/ħ`.\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency is `ω = (γBħ)/ħ = γB`.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment is `γB`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
