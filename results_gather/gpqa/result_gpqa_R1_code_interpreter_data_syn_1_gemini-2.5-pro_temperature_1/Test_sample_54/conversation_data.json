    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Signals**\n\nLet's break down each signal from the 1H NMR spectrum:\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons, which is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** The singlet indicates that these protons have no adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is typical for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon of an ester or ketone. In this context, it strongly suggests the presence of an acetate group (-O-C(=O)-CH3). All four possible compounds are acetates, so this signal is consistent with all of them.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This is another methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** The doublet indicates that this methyl group is adjacent to a single proton (-CH).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This shift is characteristic of an allylic methyl group, meaning a methyl group attached directly to a carbon-carbon double bond (CH3-C=C).\n\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents a single proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This complex splitting pattern tells us this proton is coupled to two different groups of neighboring protons. The \"doublet\" part means it's coupled to one adjacent proton. The \"quartet\" part means it's coupled to three adjacent protons (a methyl group).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** This is in the vinylic region, meaning this proton is attached to a carbon in a double bond (-CH=).\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This is another single proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This proton is coupled to one other adjacent proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is also in the vinylic region (-CH=). The high chemical shift suggests it is on the same carbon as the electronegative oxygen atom from the acetate group (-O-CH=).\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is the most critical piece of information for determining the geometry of the double bond. For vinylic protons (protons on a double bond):\n        *   A *trans* coupling (protons on opposite sides) has a large J-value, typically **12-18 Hz**.\n        *   A *cis* coupling (protons on the same side) has a smaller J-value, typically **6-12 Hz**.\n        The observed J-value of 16.0 Hz is a clear indication of a **trans** relationship between the two vinylic protons.\n\n**2. Assembling the Structure**\n\nLet's piece together the fragments we've identified:\n*   We have an acetate group: `-O-C(=O)-CH3`\n*   We have a `CH3-CH=` fragment. The proton on the `CH` is the one at 5.5 ppm (dq), and the `CH3` protons are at 1.6 ppm (d).\n*   We have another vinylic proton (`=CH-`) at 7.0 ppm (d), which is coupled to the first vinylic proton.\n*   The vinylic proton at 7.0 ppm is likely attached to the oxygen of the acetate group.\n\nCombining these pieces gives the structure: **`CH3-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH3`**\n\nThis structure has a three-carbon alkenyl group (`CH3-CH=CH-`), which is a **propenyl** group. This eliminates the butenyl acetate options (A and B).\n\n**3. Determining the Stereochemistry**\n\nNow we must choose between Cis- and Trans-propenyl acetate. As determined from the coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz), the two protons on the double bond are in a **trans** configuration.\n\n*   **Trans-propenyl acetate:** Has the two vinylic protons on opposite sides of the double bond. This would result in a large coupling constant (12-18 Hz). This matches the data.\n*   **Cis-propenyl acetate:** Has the two vinylic protons on the same side of the double bond. This would result in a smaller coupling constant (6-12 Hz). This does not match the data.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe 1H NMR data, particularly the splitting patterns and the large coupling constant of 16.0 Hz, is uniquely consistent with the structure of **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
