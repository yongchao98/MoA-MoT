  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the relationship between genes G1, G2, and G3 based on the provided experimental data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Single-Mutant Phenotypes**\n\n*   **Wild-type (WT):** 100% resistance (our baseline).\n*   **g1 mutant:** 75% resistance. This means the loss of a functional G1 gene product reduces resistance by 25%. So, G1 contributes to resistance.\n*   **g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. The loss of G2 completely eliminates resistance. This indicates that G2 plays an essential, non-redundant role in the resistance pathway.\n*   **g3 mutant:** 50% resistance. The loss of G3 reduces resistance by 50%. So, G3 also contributes significantly to resistance, seemingly more than G1.\n\n**2. Analyze the Double-Mutant Phenotypes to Infer Gene Interactions**\n\nThe phenotypes of double mutants are key to understanding how these genes work together. We will look for epistasis and synergistic/additive effects. Epistasis occurs when the phenotype of one mutation masks the effect of another.\n\n*   **g1g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. This is the same phenotype as the `g2` single mutant (0% resistance). When the phenotype of a double mutant (`g1g2`) is identical to that of one of the single mutants (`g2`), the corresponding gene (G2) is said to be **epistatic** to the other gene (G1). This often suggests G2 acts downstream of G1, or that G2 is essential for the entire pathway to function.\n\n*   **g2g3 mutant:** 0% resistance. Similarly, this is the same phenotype as the `g2` single mutant. This means G2 is also **epistatic** to G3.\n\n*   **g1g3 mutant:** 10% resistance. This interaction is different. It's not a simple case of epistasis, as the 10% phenotype does not match the `g1` (75%) or `g3` (50%) phenotypes. Let's compare the observed result to what we would expect if the genes acted independently (additively).\n    *   Loss from g1: 25%\n    *   Loss from g3: 50%\n    *   Expected resistance if additive: 100% - 25% - 50% = 25%\n    *   The observed resistance (10%) is much lower than the expected additive result (25%). This is called a **synergistic interaction**, where the combined effect of two mutations is much greater than the sum of their individual effects. This often indicates that the two genes (G1 and G3) have partially overlapping or **redundant functions**. While each can compensate for the other to some extent, losing both is catastrophic to their shared function.\n\n**3. Synthesize the Findings into a Model**\n\n*   **Role of G2:** G2 is essential for resistance (g2 is 0%) and is epistatic to both G1 and G3. The problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor (TF) acting upstream. G2 is the strongest candidate for this role. A TF that activates the entire resistance pathway, including G1 and G3, would fit this data perfectly. If the master TF is knocked out, nothing downstream can be expressed, leading to 0% resistance and masking any effects of mutations in those downstream genes.\n\n*   **Role of G1 and G3:** They are likely downstream of G2. They both contribute to the final resistance level, and they show **gene redundancy**. They might control two parallel branches of the pathway that contribute to the same resistance mechanism, or they might be enzymes with overlapping substrate specificities.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nNow, let's assess each option based on our conclusions:\n\n*   **A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   `G1 is a transcription factor`: Unlikely. G2 is the better candidate.\n    *   `G2 and G3 show pleiotropy`: \"Gene redundancy\" is a much better description of their interaction than \"pleiotropy\" (one gene affecting multiple traits, which we can't conclude here).\n    *   `G2 is epistatic towards G1`: This is correct, as shown by the `g1g2` data. However, the main premise of the option is flawed.\n\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct.\n    *   `G1 and G3 show pleiotropy`: Incorrect/poor description.\n    *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: Incorrect. The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%).\n\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct.\n    *   `G1 and G3 has the same promoter`: This is a molecular hypothesis that cannot be concluded from this genetic data.\n    *   `G3 is epistatic towards G1`: Incorrect. The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g3` phenotype (50%).\n\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Correct. This aligns with our strongest conclusion.\n    *   `G1 and G3 show gene redundancy`: Correct. This perfectly explains the synergistic interaction seen in the `g1g3` double mutant.\n    *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: This part is technically incorrect based on the standard definition of epistasis (the `g1g3` phenotype of 10% does not match the `g1` phenotype of 75%).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing the options, Option D contains two major, correct conclusions derived directly from the data: G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. Although its third clause about epistasis between G1 and G3 is incorrect, it provides the best overall description of the genetic system. The other options have more significant flaws, such as misidentifying the transcription factor or mischaracterizing the key interaction between G1 and G3. Therefore, Option D is the best possible conclusion among the choices.\n\n<<<D>>>"
