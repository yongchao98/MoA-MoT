    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon with a formula CxHy.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%, which is equivalent to 0.1428.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen can be expressed as: `mass of H / total mass = (y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008)`. For simplicity, we can use integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1).\n*   `y / (12x + y) = 0.1428`\n*   The fraction 14.28% is very close to 1/7 (`1/7 â‰ˆ 0.142857`). Let's test this assumption.\n*   `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n*   `7y = 12x + y`\n*   `6y = 12x`\n*   `y = 2x`\n*   This means the empirical formula of Z is CH2, and its general molecular formula is (CH2)n or CnH2n.\n*   Z is a saturated hydrocarbon because it does not react further with hydrogen. The general formula for a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon (alkane) is CnH2n+2. The general formula for a saturated cyclic hydrocarbon (cycloalkane) is CnH2n.\n*   Since the formula of Z is CnH2n, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n*   The problem states that Z is a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkanes used as solvents are cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   We can provisionally identify Z as one of these, and we will confirm this in the next steps.\n\n**Step 2: Relate All Compounds**\n\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture X gives only Z.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z.\n*   This is a critical clue. It means that all four compounds (the two in mixture X and the two in mixture Y) have the same carbon skeleton. For example, if Z is cyclohexane, all other compounds must also be based on a six-carbon ring.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is formed by the disproportionation of mixture X. A disproportionation reaction in this context (heating with a Pt catalyst) typically involves hydrogen transfer, where one molecule is hydrogenated and another is dehydrogenated.\n*   Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   One component of Y is Z, which we identified as a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n*   The other component of Y must be the product of dehydrogenation. To be unreactive towards bromine water, it must be an aromatic compound.\n*   Let's assume the most common case, a six-membered ring skeleton. This would make Z **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n*   The corresponding aromatic compound formed by dehydrogenation would be **benzene (C6H6)**.\n*   So, Mixture Y = {cyclohexane, benzene}.\n*   Let's check if this fits the criteria:\n    *   Equimolar mixture of two liquids: Yes, both are liquids at room temperature.\n    *   Does not decolorize bromine water: Yes, cyclohexane is saturated, and benzene only reacts with Br2 under specific catalytic conditions (not with bromine water).\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z: Hydrogenation of cyclohexane (C6H12) gives C6H12. Hydrogenation of benzene (C6H6) gives cyclohexane (C6H12). So, hydrogenating the mixture gives only cyclohexane (Z). This fits perfectly.\n\n**Step 4: Relate Mixture X to Mixture Y and Find the Answer**\n\n*   We have established:\n    *   Mixture Y = {Cyclohexane (C6H12), Benzene (C6H6)}\n    *   Mixture X = {Liquid 1 (X1), Liquid 2 (X2)}\n*   Mixture X is converted to Mixture Y in an equimolar ratio via disproportionation (hydrogen transfer). The overall reaction can be represented as:\n    `X1 + X2 --(Pt, heat)--> Cyclohexane + Benzene`\n*   According to the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction. We are interested in the hydrogen atoms.\n*   Total number of H atoms in the products = (H atoms in one molecule of Cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of Benzene)\n*   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (one molecule of X1 and one molecule of X2) must also be 18.\n\n**Step 5: (Optional) Verify the Identities of Liquids in Mixture X**\n\n*   We need two C6 compounds (X1 and X2) that:\n    1.  Have a total of 18 hydrogen atoms.\n    2.  Decolorize bromine water (i.e., are unsaturated).\n    3.  Do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    4.  Can react to form cyclohexane and benzene.\n*   Let's consider possible unsaturated C6 ring compounds:\n    *   Cyclohexene (C6H10)\n    *   1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) - This is non-conjugated.\n    *   1,3-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) - This is conjugated, so it's ruled out by the problem statement.\n*   Let's test the combination X = {Cyclohexene, 1,4-Cyclohexadiene}:\n    *   Total H atoms = 10 (from C6H10) + 8 (from C6H8) = 18. This works.\n    *   Both are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water.\n    *   1,4-Cyclohexadiene is non-conjugated. Cyclohexene has only one double bond, so no conjugation. This works.\n    *   The reaction `Cyclohexene (C6H10) + 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) -> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)` is a known hydrogen transfer reaction. The diene is oxidized to benzene, and the hexene is reduced to cyclohexane. This is perfectly consistent.\n\nThe logic is sound, and the calculation is confirmed. The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>"
