    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the products of the two reactions.\n\n### **Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reaction Type:** This reaction involves a ketone, an α,β-unsaturated ester (a Michael acceptor), and a strong base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK). This is a classic **Michael addition** reaction.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Enolate):**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, abstracts an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form an enolate ion.\n    *   The ketone has two α-carbons: C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is a quaternary carbon (bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1, and C3) and has **no α-protons**.\n    *   C6 has one α-proton and a methyl group.\n    *   Therefore, deprotonation can only occur at C6. The bulky base t-BuOK will abstract the proton from C6 to form the corresponding enolate. This enolate will act as the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The C6-enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon (the CH₂) of the ethyl acrylate moiety.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The resulting product has the ethyl propanoate group (-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt) attached to the C6 position of the original ketone.\n    *   The structure is: 6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n5.  **Naming Product A:**\n    *   The options provided use a different IUPAC naming convention where the ethyl propanoate is the parent chain and the cyclohexanone ring is a substituent.\n    *   Parent chain: `ethyl ...propanoate`. The substituent is attached at the C3 position of the propanoate chain. So the name is `ethyl 3-(...)propanoate`.\n    *   Substituent: The cyclohexyl ring. According to IUPAC rules, the numbering of the substituent ring starts at the point of attachment.\n        *   The point of attachment is the original C6 of the ketone. This becomes **C1** in the substituent name. This C1 has a methyl group.\n        *   The adjacent carbonyl carbon (original C1) becomes **C2**. This C2 has an oxo group.\n        *   The adjacent quaternary carbon (original C2) becomes **C3**. This C3 has an ethyl and a methyl group.\n    *   Combining these pieces, the name of the cyclohexyl substituent is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   Therefore, the full name for product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This matches the name for product A in options B and D.\n\n---\n\n### **Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reaction Type:** This reaction involves a nitroalkane, an α,β-unsaturated nitrile (a Michael acceptor), and a base (KOH). This is also a **Michael addition** reaction (specifically, a Henry-Michael reaction).\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Nitronate):**\n    *   The starting nitroalkane is 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂).\n    *   The base, KOH, abstracts an acidic proton from the carbon α to the nitro group (C1).\n    *   This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion called a nitronate ion (CH₃-CH₂-CH⁻-NO₂), which acts as the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon of the nitronate ion attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   The β-carbon is the one bearing the methyl group.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. After workup with H₂O, the intermediate enolate is protonated.\n\n4.  **Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The resulting molecule is formed by connecting the two fragments:\n        (CH₃-CH₂-CH-NO₂) + (CH-CH₃)-(CH₂-CN)\n    *   The structure is: CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN\n\n5.  **Naming Product B:**\n    *   To name this molecule, we identify the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (the nitrile, -CN).\n    *   The chain is 6 carbons long, so it is a **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n        *   CN is C1.\n        *   -CH₂- is C2.\n        *   -CH(CH₃)- is C3. There is a **methyl** group at C3.\n        *   -CH(NO₂)- is C4. There is a **nitro** group at C4.\n        *   -CH₂- is C5.\n        *   -CH₃ is C6.\n    *   The full IUPAC name for product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   This matches the name for product B in options A and D.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   **Product B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) A = wrong, B = right\nB) A = right, B = wrong\nC) A = wrong, B = wrong\nD) A = right, B = right\n\nThe correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
