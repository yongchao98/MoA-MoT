    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the molecular symmetry group of compound E.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the reaction scheme and deduce the properties of the unknown compounds.**\n\nThe problem provides four key chemical reactions:\n1.  Solid A + 8 equivalents of gas B → Bright red product C\n2.  C + 2 equivalents of gas D → Extremely hazardous product E\n3.  C + H₂O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)\n4.  D (gas) + B (gas) → H (solvent) (in a 1:1 ratio)\n\n**Step 2: Use the hydrolysis reaction (Reaction 3) to identify the chemical nature of C.**\n\nReaction 3 (C + H₂O → A + F + G) is the most revealing clue. The fact that solid A is reformed means it acts as a core component of C that is stable to water. The rest of C hydrolyzes to produce a strong acid (F) and a weak acid (G).\n\nA classic chemical reaction that produces a strong acid and a weak acid is the disproportionation of chlorine in water:\nCl₂ + H₂O ⇌ HCl (strong acid) + HOCl (hypochlorous acid, a weak acid)\n\nThis strongly suggests that F is HCl and G is HOCl. For this to happen, C must contain chlorine molecules (Cl₂) that are released and then hydrolyze. This implies that C is some form of complex or adduct where Cl₂ molecules are bound to the solid A.\n\n**Step 3: Identify B based on the nature of C.**\n\nIf C contains Cl₂ moieties, it must have been formed from chlorine gas. Reaction 1 states that C is formed from solid A and gas B. Therefore, it is highly probable that gas **B is Cl₂**.\n\nWith B = Cl₂, C can be represented as an adduct, **C = A·(Cl₂)₈**, formed from A reacting with 8 equivalents of Cl₂. The description of C as a \"bright red product\" is unusual for a chlorine adduct but is a given parameter of the puzzle. The regeneration of A upon hydrolysis (C + H₂O → A + ...) is consistent with this adduct model.\n\n**Step 4: Identify D and H using Reaction 4.**\n\nReaction 4 is a 1:1 reaction between gas D and gas B (which we've identified as Cl₂) to form a solvent H.\nD(g) + Cl₂(g) → H(solvent)\n\nThere are two very common reactions that fit this description:\n*   **CO(g) + Cl₂(g) → COCl₂(g/l)**. Phosgene (COCl₂) is a liquid below 8 °C and is used as a reagent and solvent in organic synthesis. So, **D could be CO** and **H could be COCl₂**.\n*   **SO₂(g) + Cl₂(g) → SO₂Cl₂(l)**. Sulfuryl chloride (SO₂Cl₂) is a liquid solvent. So, **D could be SO₂** and **H could be SO₂Cl₂**.\n\nBoth are plausible candidates.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the extremely hazardous product E using Reaction 2.**\n\nReaction 2 is C + 2D → E. We have two possibilities for D.\n\n*   **Case 1: D = CO.**\n    The reaction is A·(Cl₂)₈ + 2CO → E. A very likely reaction is that the CO molecules react with the bound chlorine to form phosgene: 2CO + 2Cl₂ → 2COCl₂.\n    Thus, **E = COCl₂ (phosgene)**. Phosgene is well-known as an extremely hazardous chemical warfare agent. This fits the description perfectly.\n\n*   **Case 2: D = SO₂.**\n    The reaction is A·(Cl₂)₈ + 2SO₂ → E. A likely reaction is the formation of sulfuryl chloride: SO₂ + Cl₂ → SO₂Cl₂.\n    Thus, **E = SO₂Cl₂ (sulfuryl chloride)**. Sulfuryl chloride is also a hazardous substance.\n\nBoth possibilities for E are consistent with the reaction scheme.\n\n**Step 6: Determine the molecular symmetry group (point group) of E.**\n\nWe need to find the point group for our candidate molecules for E.\n\n*   **Point Group of Phosgene (COCl₂):**\n    Phosgene is a planar molecule with a central carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms.\n    - It has a two-fold rotational axis (C₂) passing through the C=O bond.\n    - It has two vertical mirror planes (σᵥ). One is the plane of the molecule itself, and the other is perpendicular to the molecular plane, containing the C₂ axis.\n    - The set of symmetry elements {E, C₂, σᵥ, σᵥ'} corresponds to the **C₂v** point group.\n\n*   **Point Group of Sulfuryl Chloride (SO₂Cl₂):**\n    Sulfuryl chloride has a distorted tetrahedral geometry around the central sulfur atom.\n    - It has a two-fold rotational axis (C₂) that bisects both the O-S-O angle and the Cl-S-Cl angle.\n    - It has two mirror planes (σᵥ) that contain the C₂ axis. One plane contains the two chlorine atoms and the sulfur atom, and the other plane contains the two oxygen atoms and the sulfur atom.\n    - The set of symmetry elements {E, C₂, σᵥ, σᵥ'} corresponds to the **C₂v** point group.\n\nBoth plausible identities for the extremely hazardous product E (phosgene and sulfuryl chloride) belong to the C₂v point group. Therefore, the molecular symmetry group of E must be C₂v.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) C2v\nB) D4h\nC) D∞h\nD) C2\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
