    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Nucleus and its Properties:**\n    *   The problem specifies the nucleus X as Lithium (Li). The atomic number of Lithium is Z=3, meaning it has 3 protons.\n    *   It is stated to have 3 neutrons.\n    *   The mass number A, which is the total number of protons and neutrons (nucleons), is A = 3 (protons) + 3 (neutrons) = 6.\n    *   So, the nucleus is an isotope of Lithium, specifically Lithium-6 ($^6_3$Li).\n\n2.  **Relativistic Energy Formula:**\n    The total energy (E) of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is given by the equation:\n    $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$\n    where:\n    *   $m_0$ is the rest mass of the particle.\n    *   c is the speed of light.\n    *   $\\gamma$ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):**\n    *   The problem gives the speed of the nucleus as v = 0.96c.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio v/c is 0.96.\n    *   Now, we can calculate $\\gamma$:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.96^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.0784}} = \\frac{1}{0.28} \\approx 3.571428$\n\n4.  **Determine the Rest Energy ($E_0 = m_0 c^2$):**\n    *   The rest energy of the nucleus can be calculated precisely from its known mass. However, in many physics problems, especially multiple-choice ones, an approximation is often used. A common approximation is to calculate the mass of the nucleus by multiplying its mass number (A) by the mass of a single nucleon.\n    *   The masses of a proton and a neutron are slightly different ($m_p \\approx 938.3$ MeV/c², $m_n \\approx 939.6$ MeV/c²). Let's use the approximation where the nucleus's mass is the number of nucleons (A) times the neutron's mass. This is a common simplification that often leads to the intended answer in such problems.\n    *   Rest energy of a neutron, $m_n c^2 \\approx 939.57$ MeV.\n    *   Approximated rest energy of the $^6$Li nucleus:\n        $E_0 \\approx A \\times (m_n c^2) = 6 \\times 939.57 \\text{ MeV} = 5637.42 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Energy (E):**\n    *   Now, we combine the Lorentz factor and the approximated rest energy:\n        $E = \\gamma E_0 \\approx 3.571428 \\times 5637.42 \\text{ MeV} \\approx 20133.64 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n6.  **Convert to GeV and Choose the Correct Option:**\n    *   To convert the energy from MeV (Mega-electron Volts) to GeV (Giga-electron Volts), we divide by 1000.\n        $E \\approx \\frac{20133.64}{1000} \\text{ GeV} \\approx 20.134 \\text{ GeV}$.\n    *   This calculated value is very close to option B.\n\nTo confirm the calculation with high precision, let's use a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given constants and values ---\n# Speed of the nucleus (X) as a fraction of the speed of light (c)\nv_over_c = 0.96\n# Nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. Li has 3 protons. So, mass number A = 3 + 3 = 6.\nA = 6\n# Rest energy of a neutron in MeV. We use a standard value.\n# Using mn*c^2 = 939.5654 MeV/c^2 (from CODATA)\nneutron_rest_energy_MeV = 939.5654\n\n# --- Calculations ---\n# 1. Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v_over_c**2)\n\n# 2. Approximate the rest energy of the nucleus (E0)\n# We approximate the mass of the nucleus as A * mass_of_neutron\nnucleus_rest_energy_MeV = A * neutron_rest_energy_MeV\n\n# 3. Calculate the total relativistic energy (E) in MeV\ntotal_energy_MeV = gamma * nucleus_rest_energy_MeV\n\n# 4. Convert the total energy to GeV\ntotal_energy_GeV = total_energy_MeV / 1000\n\n# --- Output the result ---\n# The problem asks for the final answer with a precision of 1e-4, so we format the output.\nprint(f\"{total_energy_GeV:.4f}\")\n```\n>>>\n20.1335\n>>>\nThe calculated energy is 20.1335 GeV. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) 18.475 GeV\nB) 20.132 GeV\nC) 23.069 GeV\nD) 21.419 GeV\n\nThe value 20.1335 GeV is extremely close to option B, 20.132 GeV. The minor difference of approximately 0.0015 GeV is due to the specific rounded value of the neutron mass used in the problem's intended solution. Based on this calculation, option B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The step-by-step reasoning and python code execution have already been performed. The output from the code was `20.1335`.\n\n### Final Answer Derivations\n\n1.  **Identify the Nucleus**: The problem specifies the nucleus as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Since Lithium's atomic number is 3 (meaning it has 3 protons), the total number of nucleons (mass number, A) is 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6. The nucleus is therefore Lithium-6 ($^6$Li).\n\n2.  **Relativistic Energy Formula**: The total energy (E) of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is given by:\n    $E = \\gamma \\cdot E_0$\n    where $E_0 = m_0 c^2$ is the rest energy and $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**: The Lorentz factor depends on the speed, v = 0.96c.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.96^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.0784}} = \\frac{1}{0.28} \\approx 3.5714$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Rest Energy ($E_0$)**: The rest energy of the $^6$Li nucleus is needed. A common approximation in nuclear physics problems is to estimate the nucleus's mass by multiplying its mass number (A) by the mass of a single nucleon. Using the neutron rest energy ($m_n c^2 \\approx 939.57$ MeV):\n    $E_0 \\approx A \\times (m_n c^2) = 6 \\times 939.57 \\text{ MeV} = 5637.42 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Energy (E)**: Now, multiply the Lorentz factor by the rest energy.\n    $E = \\gamma \\cdot E_0 \\approx 3.5714 \\times 5637.42 \\text{ MeV} \\approx 20133.6 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n6.  **Convert to GeV and Compare**: To express the energy in Giga-electron Volts (GeV), divide by 1000.\n    $E \\approx \\frac{20133.6 \\text{ MeV}}{1000} = 20.1336 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThe calculated value of 20.1336 GeV is extremely close to the value in option B (20.132 GeV). The slight difference is likely due to rounding or the specific value of the nucleon mass used to create the problem. The Python script, using a more precise value for the neutron mass, yielded `20.1335` GeV, which also strongly supports option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
