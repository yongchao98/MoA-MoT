    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System and the Method of Images:**\n    We have a point charge `q` placed at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is fixed at zero (`V_sphere = 0`). The charge `q` induces a distribution of charges on the surface of the sphere. To find the electric field and potential outside the sphere, we can use the method of images. This method replaces the sphere and its induced surface charges with a single, strategically placed \"image charge\" inside the sphere. The combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must produce a potential of zero on the surface that corresponds to the sphere's original location.\n\n2.  **Determine the Image Charge and its Position:**\n    For a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the equivalent image charge `q'` is located along the same line connecting the center and `q`. Its properties are given by the standard formulas:\n    *   **Position of image charge (b):** The distance of the image charge from the center is `b = R^2 / d`.\n    *   **Magnitude of image charge (q'):** The magnitude of the image charge is `q' = -q * (R / d)`.\n\n    The negative sign indicates that the image charge has the opposite polarity to the original charge, which is consistent with an attractive force between the charge and the sphere.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Potential Energy of the System:**\n    The potential energy of the system is the work required to assemble it. In this case, it's the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`, in the presence of the grounded sphere.\n\n    A key concept for energy involving induced charges is that the potential energy of the interaction is *not* simply the potential energy of the two point charges (`q` and `q'`). This is because the image charge `q'` doesn't exist independently; it's a representation of the induced charge distribution which is itself created by `q`.\n\n    The correct formula for the potential energy of a point charge `q` in the presence of conductors is given by:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_ind`\n\n    Where `V_ind` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` created by all the *other* charges in the system (in this case, the induced charges on the sphere). The factor of 1/2 is crucial and arises from the fact that the induced charges are not fixed but are established as `q` is brought into position.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential `V_ind` at the location of `q`:**\n    The potential `V_ind` at the location of `q` (a distance `d` from the center) due to the induced charges on the sphere is, by the method of images, the same as the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that same location.\n\n    *   The distance between the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is `d - b`.\n    *   `distance = d - b = d - (R^2 / d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`.\n    *   The potential `V_ind` is therefore:\n        `V_ind = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n        `V_ind = k * [-q * (R/d)] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n        The `d` in the numerator and denominator cancels out.\n        `V_ind = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Potential Energy `U`:**\n    Now we substitute the expression for `V_ind` back into the energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_ind`.\n\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    Let's examine the options provided:\n    A) `U = - kq^2 * d / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    B) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    C) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * d / (d^2 + R^2)`\n    D) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R^2 / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    Our derived result, `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`, matches option B exactly. The energy is negative, indicating an attractive force between the charge and the grounded sphere."
