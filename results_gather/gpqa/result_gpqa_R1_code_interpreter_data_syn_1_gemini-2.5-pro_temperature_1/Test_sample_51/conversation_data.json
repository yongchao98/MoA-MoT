    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the factor by which the ratio of populations of two energy levels of neutral Titanium (Ti) changes when a star has spots compared to when it does not. This factor can be expressed as:\n    Factor = (N₂/N₁)nospot / (N₂/N₁)spot\n\n2.  **Apply the Boltzmann Equation:** The stellar photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). Therefore, the ratio of the number of atoms (N) in two energy levels (1 and 2) is governed by the Boltzmann equation:\n    N₂/N₁ = (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n    where:\n    *   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights of the levels.\n    *   ΔE = E₂ - E₁ is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   T is the temperature of the gas.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Factor:** We can write the ratio for the two scenarios (no spots and with spots):\n    *   (N₂/N₁)nospot = (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospot))\n    *   (N₂/N₁)spot = (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spot))\n\n    The factor is the division of these two expressions. The term with the statistical weights (g₂/g₁) cancels out:\n    Factor = [exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospot))] / [exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spot))]\n    Using the properties of exponents, this simplifies to:\n    Factor = exp[(-ΔE/k) * (1/T_nospot - 1/T_spot)]\n    Factor = exp[(ΔE/k) * (1/T_spot - 1/T_nospot)]\n\n4.  **Determine the Temperatures (T_nospot and T_spot):**\n    *   The problem states that when the surface is not covered by spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. We take this as the temperature for the \"no spot\" case: `T_nospot = 6000 K`.\n    *   When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall effective temperature drops to 5500 K. While the spots themselves are cooler, the simplest and most direct interpretation is to use this new effective temperature as the characteristic temperature for the \"with spots\" case: `T_spot = 5500 K`. The information about the 40% coverage serves as the physical reason for the temperature drop but is not directly needed for the calculation under this interpretation.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE):** The energy difference is related to the wavelength (λ) of the transition by the formula ΔE = h * c / λ, where h is the Planck constant and c is the speed of light.\n    *   λ = 1448 Å = 1448 * 10⁻¹⁰ meters.\n    *   We can calculate the term `ΔE/k` directly to simplify calculations.\n\n6.  **Compute the Final Value:** Now, we substitute the known values into the factor formula. This can be done efficiently and accurately using a Python script.\n\nLet's set up the script to perform the calculation.\n\n*   `T_nospot` = 6000 K\n*   `T_spot` = 5500 K\n*   `λ` = 1448 Å\n*   Constants: `h`, `c`, `k`\n\nThe script will calculate `Factor = exp( (h*c / (λ*k)) * (1/T_spot - 1/T_nospot) )`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Physical constants\nh = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck constant in J·s\nc = 2.99792458e8   # Speed of light in m/s\nk = 1.380649e-23     # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n\n# Given parameters from the problem\nT_nospot = 6000.0  # Temperature without spots in K\nT_spot = 5500.0    # Effective temperature with spots in K\nwavelength_A = 1448.0  # Wavelength in Angstroms\nwavelength_m = wavelength_A * 1e-10  # Wavelength in meters\n\n# Calculate the energy difference (delta_E)\ndelta_E = h * c / wavelength_m\n\n# Calculate the term delta_E / k\ndelta_E_over_k = delta_E / k\n\n# Calculate the difference in inverse temperatures\ninv_temp_diff = (1.0 / T_spot) - (1.0 / T_nospot)\n\n# Calculate the exponent for the final factor\nexponent = delta_E_over_k * inv_temp_diff\n\n# Calculate the final factor\nfactor = np.exp(exponent)\n\nprint(factor)\n```\n4.507208889140026\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 4.5. This matches option B.\n\nNote: There is a physical inconsistency in the problem statement, as a transition energy corresponding to 1448 Å (~8.56 eV) is higher than the ionization energy of neutral Titanium (~6.82 eV), making such a transition within a neutral atom impossible. However, by following the mathematical procedure with the numbers provided, we arrive at a clear answer among the options.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks for the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when a star has spots compared to when it does not. This factor can be written as:\n\nFactor = (N₂/N₁)nospot / (N₂/N₁)spot\n\nAccording to the Boltzmann equation, which is applicable here because the stellar photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the ratio of the population of two energy levels is given by:\n\nN₂/N₁ = (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\nwhere:\n*   N₂ and N₁ are the number of atoms in the upper and lower energy levels, respectively.\n*   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights of the levels.\n*   ΔE is the energy difference between the levels.\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   T is the temperature.\n\nWe can write the expression for the factor as:\n\nFactor = [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospot)) ] / [ (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spot)) ]\n\nThe statistical weights term (g₂/g₁) cancels out. Using the properties of exponents (e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)), the equation simplifies to:\n\nFactor = exp[ -ΔE / (k * T_nospot) - (-ΔE / (k * T_spot)) ]\nFactor = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1 / T_spot - 1 / T_nospot) ]\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n*   Temperature without spots (T_nospot) = 6000 K\n*   Effective temperature with spots (T_spot) = 5500 K\n*   Wavelength of the transition (λ) = 1448 Å = 1448 × 10⁻¹⁰ m\n\nThe energy difference ΔE is related to the wavelength by the formula ΔE = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light.\n\nWe can substitute this into our factor equation:\n\nFactor = exp[ (hc / (λ * k)) * (1 / T_spot - 1 / T_nospot) ]\n\nThe Python code executed in the previous step calculated this value precisely:\n*   h = 6.62607015 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n*   c = 2.99792458 × 10⁸ m/s\n*   k = 1.380649 × 10⁻²³ J/K\n*   λ = 1448 × 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   T_spot = 5500 K\n*   T_nospot = 6000 K\n\nThe calculation yielded a factor of approximately 4.506.
