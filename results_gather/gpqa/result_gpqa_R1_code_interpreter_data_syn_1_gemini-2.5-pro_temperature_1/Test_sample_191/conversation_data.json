    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial state:** We have an uncharged spherical conductor. This means its net electric charge is zero.\n\n2.  **Introducing a charge inside the cavity:** A positive charge `+q` is placed inside the spherical cavity.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Induction on the Inner Surface:** The presence of the positive charge `+q` inside the cavity will attract negative charges within the conductor. These negative charges will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity. According to Gauss's law, for the electric field to be zero everywhere within the conducting material, the total charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity must be exactly `-q`. This is because if we consider a Gaussian surface that lies entirely within the conductor and encloses the cavity, the electric field on this surface is zero. Therefore, the net charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface must be zero. The enclosed charge is the sum of the charge placed in the cavity (`+q`) and the charge induced on the inner wall (`q_inner`). So, `+q + q_inner = 0`, which gives `q_inner = -q`.\n    This induced charge `-q` will distribute itself on the inner surface in such a way that its electric field perfectly cancels the electric field of the `+q` charge for all points outside the cavity (i.e., within the conductor and beyond). This phenomenon is known as electrostatic shielding.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Induction on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially neutral (charge = 0). Since a charge of `-q` has accumulated on the inner surface, to maintain overall charge neutrality of the conductor, a charge of `+q` must appear elsewhere on the conductor. This `+q` charge will move to the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n    So, `q_conductor = q_inner + q_outer = 0`.\n    `-q + q_outer = 0` => `q_outer = +q`.\n\n5.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:** The `+q` charge on the outer surface will distribute itself in a way that makes the conductor an equipotential volume. Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere and there are no other external electric fields, this charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the outer surface.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:** The point P is outside the conductor. The total electric field at P is the superposition of the fields from all charges:\n    *   The charge `+q` inside the cavity.\n    *   The induced charge `-q` on the inner surface.\n    *   The induced charge `+q` on the outer surface.\n\n    Due to the principle of electrostatic shielding, the net electric field produced by the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface is zero for all points outside the conductor.\n    Therefore, the only contribution to the electric field at point P comes from the `+q` charge distributed uniformly on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n7.  **Applying the Shell Theorem (or Gauss's Law):** The electric field at an external point due to a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as if all the charge on the shell were concentrated into a point charge at its center.\n    *   The total charge on the outer shell is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the shell is the center of the spherical conductor, O.\n    *   The distance from the center O to the point P is `L`.\n\n    Thus, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{charge}}{(\\text{distance})^2}$\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The details about the cavity's location (`s`), radius (`r`), the distance `l`, and the angle `\\theta` are all irrelevant to the electric field outside the conductor because of electrostatic shielding. The external field only depends on the total charge that moves to the outer surface (`+q`) and the distance from the center of the conductor (`L`).\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect.\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect.\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ - Correct.\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ - Incorrect.\n\n<<<C>>>"
