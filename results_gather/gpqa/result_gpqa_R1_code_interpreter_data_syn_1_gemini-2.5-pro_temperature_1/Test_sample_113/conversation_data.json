    "*   **Analysis of the first reaction:**\n    *   **Reactants:** butan-2-one (a ketone), NaCN (sodium cyanide), and reagent A.\n    *   **Product:** 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile (a cyanohydrin).\n    *   **Transformation:** The reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone. This is a nucleophilic addition reaction.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n        2.  This forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate: CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂CH₃.\n        3.  This intermediate needs to be protonated to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group. Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺).\n    *   **Evaluating options for A:**\n        *   **H₃O⁺ (hydronium ion):** This represents an acidic workup, which provides the necessary protons to convert the alkoxide intermediate into the final alcohol (cyanohydrin). This is a standard procedure.\n        *   **NaHSO₃ (sodium bisulfite):** This reagent also reacts with ketones in a nucleophilic addition reaction to form a bisulfite adduct. It is not the correct reagent to facilitate the formation of a cyanohydrin in this context.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Reagent A must be a proton source, so H₃O⁺ is the correct choice.\n\n*   **Analysis of the second reaction:**\n    *   **Reactants:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile (a nitrile) and reagent B in water (H₂O).\n    *   **Product:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid (a carboxylic acid).\n    *   **Transformation:** The nitrile group (-C≡N) is converted into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base in the presence of water, usually with heating.\n        2.  The problem shows the direct formation of the carboxylic acid, which is characteristic of acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.\n    *   **Evaluating options for B:**\n        *   **HCl (hydrochloric acid):** This is a strong acid and an effective catalyst for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n        *   **CH₃COOH (acetic acid):** This is a weak acid and is generally not strong enough to effectively catalyze the complete hydrolysis of a stable nitrile to a carboxylic acid under typical reaction conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** Reagent B should be a strong acid catalyst, making HCl the correct choice.\n\n*   **Overall Conclusion:**\n    *   Reagent A is H₃O⁺.\n    *   Reagent B is HCl.\n    *   This combination corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
