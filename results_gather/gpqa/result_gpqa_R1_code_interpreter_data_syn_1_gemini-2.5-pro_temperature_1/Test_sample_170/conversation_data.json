    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order:\n\n**1. Understand the Reaction and the Goal**\n\nThe reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a series of substituted benzene rings (C6H5-R). The goal is to arrange these substances in order of the *increasing* yield (weight fraction) of the *para*-isomer.\n\nThe directing effect of the substituent (R) on the benzene ring is the primary factor determining the product distribution (ortho, meta, para). We need to consider two main aspects for each substituent:\n*   **Directing effect**: Does it direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho/para positions or the meta position?\n*   **Steric and electronic factors**: How do the size and electronic properties of the substituent influence the ratio of para to ortho product?\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents**\n\nFirst, we classify each substituent based on its directing effect.\n\n*   **Substituents that direct to the ortho and para positions (o,p-directors):**\n    *   These are typically activating groups (electron-donating) or halogens.\n    *   1) **-CH3 (methyl)**: Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   5) **-C2H5 (ethyl)**: Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   3) **-Cl (chloro)**: Deactivating, but o,p-director due to lone pair resonance.\n\n*   **Substituents that direct to the meta position (m-directors):**\n    *   These are deactivating groups (electron-withdrawing).\n    *   2) **-COOC2H5 (ethyl ester)**: Deactivating, m-director.\n    *   4) **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, m-director.\n    *   6) **-COOH (carboxylic acid)**: Deactivating, m-director.\n\n**3. Initial Broad Grouping**\n\nCompounds with meta-directing groups will produce very little para-isomer, as the main product is the meta-isomer. Compounds with ortho,para-directing groups will produce a significant amount of para-isomer. Therefore, the order will start with the meta-directors and end with the ortho,para-directors.\n\nOrder: [m-directors in increasing para yield] < [o,p-directors in increasing para yield]\nOrder: [2, 4, 6] < [1, 3, 5]\n\n**4. Ordering the Meta-Directors (Substances 2, 4, 6)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the para-isomer is a very minor side product. The yield of this side product is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group makes the ring less reactive overall and more selective for the meta position, thus producing even less of the para (and ortho) isomers.\n\nLet's rank the deactivating strength of these groups:\n*   **-NO2 (4)** is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n*   **-COOH (6)** is a strong deactivating group.\n*   **-COOC2H5 (2)** is also a strong deactivating group, but slightly weaker than -COOH.\n\nThe generally accepted order of deactivating strength is: **-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5**.\n\nTherefore, the selectivity for the meta position follows the same order. This means the yield of the undesired para-isomer will be in the reverse order of deactivating strength.\n\n*   Lowest para yield: C6H5-NO2 (4)\n*   Intermediate para yield: C6H5-COOH (6)\n*   Highest para yield (among this group): C6H5-COOC2H5 (2)\n\nSo, the order for this group is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**5. Ordering the Ortho,Para-Directors (Substances 1, 3, 5)**\n\nFor these substances, both ortho and para isomers are formed. The percentage of the para-isomer depends on steric hindrance and electronic effects that influence the para/ortho ratio.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH3 (1) and -C2H5 (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased bulk hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, thus favoring substitution at the more accessible para position.\n    *   Therefore, the para yield for ethylbenzene (5) is greater than for toluene (1).\n    *   Order: **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** The chloro group is unique. It is deactivating due to its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I), but its lone pairs allow for a resonance effect (+M) that directs ortho/para. The strong -I effect is distance-dependent and deactivates the ortho positions more significantly than the para position. This electronic factor, combined with the steric size of the chlorine atom, makes para substitution highly favorable. The percentage of para-isomer in the bromination of chlorobenzene is typically very high (around 89-90%), which is higher than for both toluene (around 66%) and ethylbenzene (around 75-80%).\n    *   Therefore, the para yield for chlorobenzene (3) is the highest among these three.\n\nCombining these observations, the order of increasing para yield for the o,p-directors is:\n**C6H5-CH3 (1) < C6H5-C2H5 (5) < C6H5-Cl (3)**.\n\n**6. Final Combined Order**\n\nNow, we combine the two ranked groups:\n\n(Order of m-directors) < (Order of o,p-directors)\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe final arrangement of substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
