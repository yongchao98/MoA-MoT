    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Define the System and its States:**\nThe system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3.\nEach spin can take two possible values: +1 or -1.\nThe total number of possible configurations (microstates) of the system is 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.\nThe states can be listed as tuples (S1, S2, S3):\n1.  (+1, +1, +1)\n2.  (+1, +1, -1)\n3.  (+1, -1, +1)\n4.  (-1, +1, +1)\n5.  (+1, -1, -1)\n6.  (-1, +1, -1)\n7.  (-1, -1, +1)\n8.  (-1, -1, -1)\n\n**2. Define the Energy Function:**\nThe energy of a given state is given by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J[ S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3 ]\n\n**3. Define the Partition Function (Z):**\nThe partition function is the sum over all possible states (i) of the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE_i), where β = 1/(kT).\nZ = Σ_i e^(-βE_i)\n\n**4. Calculate the Energy for Each State:**\nWe need to calculate the energy for each of the 8 configurations.\n\n*   **Case 1: All spins are the same.**\n    *   State (+1, +1, +1): E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n    *   State (-1, -1, -1): E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n    *   There are **2 states** with energy E = -3J.\n\n*   **Case 2: Two spins are +1, and one is -1.**\n    *   State (+1, +1, -1): E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   State (+1, -1, +1): E = -J[(1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   State (-1, +1, +1): E = -J[(-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   There are 3 such states.\n\n*   **Case 3: One spin is +1, and two are -1.**\n    *   State (+1, -1, -1): E = -J[(1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   State (-1, +1, -1): E = -J[(-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   State (-1, -1, +1): E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   There are 3 such states.\n\nIn total, there are **6 states** (3 from Case 2 and 3 from Case 3) with energy E = J.\n\n**5. Sum the Boltzmann Factors to find Z:**\nNow, we group the states by their energy to calculate the partition function.\n\n*   Contribution from the 2 states with E = -3J:\n    2 * e^(-β * -3J) = 2 * e^(3Jβ)\n\n*   Contribution from the 6 states with E = J:\n    6 * e^(-β * J) = 6 * e^(-Jβ)\n\nThe total partition function Z is the sum of these contributions:\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n**6. Compare with the Given Options:**\nThe calculated partition function Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ) matches option A.\n\n*   A) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\n*   B) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\n*   C) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\n*   D) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
