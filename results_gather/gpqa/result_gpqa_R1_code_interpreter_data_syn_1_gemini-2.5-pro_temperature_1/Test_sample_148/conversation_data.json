    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental data:**\n    *   **Â¹H NMR:** The spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single proton (an alpha-proton). These peaks have similar chemical shifts and a 1:1 integration ratio. This immediately suggests the presence of two very similar, but chemically distinct, species in a roughly equal mixture. The fact that spin-spin coupling is ruled out means the splitting isn't due to neighboring protons.\n    *   **LC-MS:** The Liquid Chromatography (LC) part separates the components of the mixture in time, while the Mass Spectrometry (MS) part analyzes the mass of whatever comes off the column at a given time.\n        *   The LC shows two separate peaks, confirming there are two different components in the sample that can be separated by chromatography. The equal intensities of the peaks corroborate the 1:1 ratio seen in the NMR.\n        *   The MS shows that both of these separated peaks have the *same mass*, and this mass corresponds to the expected product molecule.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the possible explanations based on the data:**\n\n    *   **A) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This would mean an extra amino acid was added, creating a longer peptide (e.g., Tripeptide instead of a Dipeptide). This new molecule would have a significantly different structure and a higher molecular weight. The MS data contradicts this, as both observed peaks have the mass of the *expected* molecule, not a heavier one. So, A is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. Under standard (achiral) analytical conditions, they have identical physical and chemical properties. They cannot be distinguished by a standard NMR spectrometer (they would give a single, identical spectrum) or separated on a standard LC column (they would co-elute as a single peak). Since we see two peaks in both NMR and LC, this cannot be a mixture of enantiomers. So, B is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. This occurs when a molecule has two or more stereocenters, and the configuration differs at some, but not all, of them.\n        *   **Key Property:** Unlike enantiomers, diastereoisomers have different physical properties (melting point, boiling point, solubility, etc.) and different chemical properties.\n        *   **NMR:** Because they are chemically distinct environments, they will have different NMR spectra. It is very common for corresponding protons in a pair of diastereoisomers to have slightly different chemical shifts, leading to two sets of peaks, as observed.\n        *   **LC:** Because they have different physical properties, they can be separated by standard (achiral) chromatography. This explains the two peaks in the LC trace.\n        *   **MS:** Because they have the same chemical formula, they have the identical molecular weight. This explains why both LC peaks give the same mass spectrum.\n        *   **Relevance to Peptides:** A very common source of diastereomerism in peptides is the *cis-trans* isomerism of the amide bond preceding a proline residue. The energy barrier for rotation around this bond is high, and the interconversion can be slow on the NMR timescale, leading to two distinct populations of molecules (rotamers) that are diastereomeric. This phenomenon perfectly matches all the observations. Another possibility is that one of the chiral amino acid starting materials was not enantiopure, which would also lead to a mixture of diastereomers upon coupling.\n\n    *   **D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor (a starting material or an intermediate) would have a different chemical formula and thus a different molecular weight from the final product. The MS data shows both peaks have the mass of the final product, ruling this out. So, D is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:** The only explanation that fits all the pieces of experimental evidence (two NMR signals for one proton, two separable LC peaks, and identical mass for both species) is that the compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<C>>>"
