    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   Let the laboratory frame be the stationary frame, which we'll call **S**. The observer is in this frame.\n    *   Let the frame of the moving glass be the moving frame, which we'll call **S'**. In this frame, the glass is at rest.\n\n2.  **Define the Velocities:**\n    *   The velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the laboratory (frame S) is given as **v**.\n    *   The speed of light inside the glass is determined by its index of refraction, `n`. The speed of light in a medium at rest with refractive index `n` is `c/n`. In the S' frame (where the glass is at rest), the speed of the light beam is **u' = c/n**. The problem states that `c=1`, so **u' = 1/n**. Since the beam propagates in the same direction as the glass is moving, `u'` is positive.\n    *   We need to find the speed of the light beam as measured by the observer in the laboratory (frame S). Let's call this velocity **u**.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    The problem involves adding velocities at speeds that can be comparable to the speed of light, so we must use the relativistic velocity addition formula. For velocities in the same direction, the formula is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the Known Values into the Formula:**\n    We substitute the values we have into the formula:\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n)*v / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    Now, we simplify the algebraic expression for `u`:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To clear the fractions within the main fraction, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n\n    Distribute `n` in both the numerator and the denominator:\n    `u = (n * (1/n) + n * v) / (n * 1 + n * (v/n))`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The derived expression for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n    This matches option (D).\n\n<<<D>>>"
