    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope.** This immediately brings to mind reagents used in isotope labeling studies, with Deuterium (D, or ²H) being the most common heavy isotope of hydrogen.\n    *   **Clue 2 & 3: X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W, whose molecule has an equal number of neutrons and protons.** Let's analyze possible gases (W) with p=n:\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Each D atom has 1 proton (p) and 1 neutron (n). The D₂ molecule has 2p and 2n. This is a perfect fit.\n        *   ¹⁴N₂: Each N atom has 7p and 7n. The molecule has 14p and 14n. Plausible.\n        *   ¹²CO: C has 6p, 6n. O has 8p, 8n. Total is 14p and 14n. Plausible.\n        *   ¹⁶O₂: Each O has 8p, 8n. The molecule has 16p and 16n. Plausible.\n    *   **Clue 4 & 5: A precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K.**\n        *   277 K is approximately 4°C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82°C (276.97 K). This is a very strong match. So, B is almost certainly D₂O.\n        *   If B is D₂O, it makes sense that the gas W released in the initial reaction is D₂ (Deuterium gas), tying everything back to Deuterium.\n        *   If heating G produces D₂O, G is likely a deuterated hydroxide that decomposes, such as Al(OD)₃, which would break down into Al₂O₃ and D₂O. Aluminum hydroxide is a precipitate.\n    *   **Clue 6: The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.**\n        *   A keto acid contains both a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n        *   For the final product to have only 2 oxygen atoms, both the ketone and the carboxylic acid must have been reduced. Carboxylic acids are difficult to reduce. This requires a very strong reducing agent.\n    *   **Clue 7: Substance X and its very close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.** This points to a common reagent family.\n\n2.  **Synthesize the Clues to Identify Substance X:**\n    *   The need for a strong reducing agent that contains deuterium points towards Lithium Aluminum Deuteride, **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   Let's check if LiAlD₄ fits all clues:\n        *   **Isotope:** It contains Deuterium (D). (Fits Clue 1)\n        *   **Analog:** Its close analog is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄), a very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. (Fits Clue 7)\n        *   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ reacts violently with protic solvents like water. Let's assume liquid Y is D₂O to produce D₂ gas. The reaction would be: `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) -> 4D₂ (W) + LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G)`.\n        *   **Gas W:** The gas produced is D₂, which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. (Fits Clue 3)\n        *   **Precipitate G & Substance B:** The precipitate G would be Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃. Upon heating, it decomposes: `2Al(OD)₃ -> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O (B)`. The released substance B is D₂O, whose melting point is ~277 K. (Fits Clues 4 & 5)\n        *   **Keto Acid Reaction:** LiAlD₄ is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce both the ketone and the carboxylic acid of a keto acid into a diol (a molecule with two -OH groups). A diol contains exactly 2 oxygen atoms. (Fits Clue 6)\n    *   All clues consistently point to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Required Value:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the **lightest and heaviest elements** present within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n    *   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n    *   The question states that if multiple instances of an element exist, their masses must be summed.\n    *   **Mass of Heaviest Element (Al):** The molecule has one atom of Aluminum. The mass of the stable isotope ²⁷Al is approximately 27 u.\n    *   **Mass of Lightest Element (H):** The molecule has four atoms of the hydrogen isotope Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass of one deuterium atom is approximately 2 u. The total mass is 4 * 2 u = 8 u.\n    *   **Cumulative Mass:** Sum of the masses = (Mass of Al) + (Total mass of D) = 27 u + 8 u = 35 u.\n\n4.  **Final Verification with Code:**\n    The calculation is straightforward. A python script can be used to confirm using more precise masses.\n\n```python\n# More precise atomic mass for the stable isotope of Aluminum (27Al)\nmass_Al = 26.9815\n\n# More precise atomic mass for Deuterium (2H)\nmass_D = 2.0141\n\n# In LiAlD4, there is 1 atom of Al and 4 atoms of D.\n# The lightest element is Hydrogen (represented by D), and the heaviest is Aluminum.\n\n# Sum the mass of all instances of the heaviest element (Aluminum).\ntotal_mass_heaviest = 1 * mass_Al\n\n# Sum the mass of all instances of the lightest element (Hydrogen as Deuterium).\ntotal_mass_lightest = 4 * mass_D\n\n# Calculate the cumulative mass.\ncumulative_mass = total_mass_heaviest + total_mass_lightest\n\n# The options are integers, so we round the result.\nprint(round(cumulative_mass))\n```\n>>>\n35\n\nThe calculation confirms that the cumulative mass is 35. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 31\nB) 35\nC) 25\nD) 29\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues to Identify the Substances:**\n    *   **Clue about Substance B:** \"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"\n        *   Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n        *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C.\n        *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C. This is an excellent match. Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n    *   **Clue about Gas W:** \"a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\"\n        *   Since the system involves heavy water (D₂O), it's logical to assume the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the first clue is Deuterium (D, or ²H). A deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n        *   Let's check if D₂ gas fits the description for W. A D₂ molecule consists of two deuterium atoms. Total protons = 1 + 1 = 2. Total neutrons = 1 + 1 = 2. Protons and neutrons are equal. This is a perfect fit. So, **Gas W is D₂**.\n    *   **Clue about the Reaction:** \"Substance X ... reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W [D₂] and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B [D₂O].\"\n        *   This describes a reaction where X, a deuterated compound, reacts to form D₂ gas and a deuterated precipitate G. The decomposition of G by heat to produce D₂O suggests G is a deuterated metal hydroxide, like Al(OD)₃, which would decompose as: `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`.\n    *   **Clue about the nature of X:** \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" and \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"\n        *   A keto acid contains a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), meaning it has at least 3 oxygen atoms. For the product to have only 2 oxygens, both functional groups must be reduced to alcohols (-OH), forming a diol.\n        *   The reduction of a carboxylic acid requires a very powerful reducing agent. A famous and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄).\n        *   Its \"very close analog\" containing a heavier isotope (Deuterium) would be **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   **Final Check:** Let's see if X = LiAlD₄ fits everything.\n        *   Reaction with Y (let's assume Y is D₂O for consistency): `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → 4D₂ (W) + LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G)`.\n        *   This reaction is indeed violent. It produces D₂ gas (W) and aluminum deuteroxide (G) which is a precipitate. Heating G gives D₂O (B). LiAlD₄ is a potent reducing agent capable of converting a keto acid to a diol. All clues point to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n2.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li, atomic number 3), Aluminum (Al, atomic number 13), and Hydrogen (H, atomic number 1).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum.\n    *   The problem specifies summing the masses of *all instances* of these elements.\n    *   **Mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is one atom of Al in the molecule. The mass of the most stable isotope of aluminum (²⁷Al) is approximately 27 amu.\n    *   **Mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains four atoms of the hydrogen isotope, Deuterium (²H or D). The mass of one deuterium atom is approximately 2 amu. The total mass from these four atoms is 4 * 2 = 8 amu.\n    *   **Cumulative Atomic Mass:** (Total mass of Aluminum atoms) + (Total mass of Hydrogen atoms) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n3.  **Verification with Python Code:**\n    To confirm the calculation with more precise values, we can use a simple script.\n\n```python\n# The identified substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD4).\n# The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of Deuterium, D).\n# The lightest element is Hydrogen, and the heaviest is Aluminum.\n\n# The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n\n# There is 1 atom of Aluminum (Al). Its isotopic mass (27Al) is ~27.\nmass_Al = 26.981538\n\n# There are 4 atoms of Hydrogen as Deuterium (D or 2H). Its isotopic mass is ~2.\nmass_D = 2.014101\n\n# Calculate the total mass of the heaviest element's atoms.\ntotal_mass_heaviest = 1 * mass_Al\n\n# Calculate the total mass of the lightest element's atoms.\ntotal_mass_lightest = 4 * mass_D\n\n# Calculate the cumulative mass.\ncumulative_mass = total_mass_heaviest + total_mass_lightest\n\n# The options provided are integers, so we round the result to the nearest whole number.\nprint(round(cumulative_mass))\n```\n>>>\n35\n\nThe code output confirms our manual calculation. The cumulative mass is 35.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 31\nB) 35\nC) 25\nD) 29\n\nThe correct answer is 35.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "**Step-by-step Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The clue states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K. Converting this to Celsius: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C, but the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C. This is an extremely close match, so we can confidently conclude that **B is D₂O (heavy water)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The problem mentions that substance X contains a \"heavier isotope\". Since we've identified D₂O, this isotope is very likely Deuterium (D, or ²H). A deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. The gas W is said to have an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's test D₂ gas. A D₂ molecule has two deuterium atoms, so it contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This fits the description perfectly. Thus, **W is D₂ (deuterium gas)**.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   Substance X reacts violently to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate G, which upon heating yields D₂O. This suggests X is a powerful deuterated reducing agent.\n    *   The reaction of X with a keto acid produces a product with only 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid (containing R-C(=O)-COOH) has at least 3 oxygen atoms. To reduce this to a product with 2 oxygens, both the ketone and the carboxylic acid must be reduced to alcohols, forming a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH)). The reduction of a carboxylic acid requires a very strong reducing agent.\n    *   A very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). The clue states that X has a \"very close analog\" used in organic chemistry. The deuterated version, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, fits this description.\n    *   Let's verify the reaction: LiAlD₄ reacts violently with protic compounds like water (or in this case, likely D₂O) to produce D₂ gas and metal hydroxides (or deuteroxides): `LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O → 4D₂ (W) + LiOD + Al(OD)₃ (G)`. The precipitate G is aluminum deuteroxide, which decomposes on heating to give aluminum oxide and heavy water (B): `2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O (B)`.\n    *   All clues point to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Cumulative Mass:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic mass of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n    *   The problem requires summing the masses of *all* atoms of these two elements found in the molecule.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is one atom of Aluminum. The mass of its stable isotope (²⁷Al) is approximately **27 u**.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are four atoms of Hydrogen, present as the isotope Deuterium (²H or D). The mass of one Deuterium atom is approximately **2 u**. The total mass from the four Deuterium atoms is 4 × 2 u = **8 u**.\n    *   **Cumulative Mass:** Sum = (Total mass of Al) + (Total mass of D) = 27 + 8 = **35 u**.\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
