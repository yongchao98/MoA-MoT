    "*   **Analyze the problem:** The question asks which fundamental symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). SMEFT is a theoretical framework that extends the Standard Model by adding higher-dimensional operators, representing the low-energy effects of new physics at some high-energy scale Î›.\n\n*   **Lorentz and Poincare Symmetry (1 and 2):** SMEFT is constructed as a relativistic quantum field theory. A core assumption is that the underlying laws of physics are the same for all inertial observers. This is the principle of Lorentz invariance. Poincare symmetry extends Lorentz symmetry to include translations in spacetime. The Lagrangian of SMEFT, which includes all the new operators, is constructed to be invariant under Poincare transformations. Each operator must transform as a Lorentz scalar. Therefore, both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries must be respected. Since Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry, respecting Poincare implies respecting Lorentz.\n\n*   **CPT Symmetry (4):** The CPT theorem is a fundamental result in quantum field theory. It states that any theory that is local, unitary, and Lorentz-invariant must also be invariant under the combined transformation of Charge conjugation (C), Parity (P), and Time reversal (T). Since SMEFT is constructed as a local, Lorentz-invariant effective field theory, it must obey the CPT theorem. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.\n\n*   **CP Symmetry (3):** CP symmetry is the combination of Charge conjugation and Parity. It is well-established experimentally that CP symmetry is violated in the Standard Model, for instance, in the decays of neutral kaons and B mesons. The source of this violation in the SM is a complex phase in the CKM matrix. Since SMEFT is an extension of the SM, it must be able to describe the observed CP violation. Furthermore, SMEFT is designed to parameterize potential *new* sources of CP violation from beyond-the-Standard-Model physics. Consequently, SMEFT operators are explicitly constructed to allow for CP violation, meaning CP is *not* a required symmetry for all operators. Many operators in the SMEFT basis are CP-odd.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry. CP symmetry is not a required symmetry. This corresponds to options 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
