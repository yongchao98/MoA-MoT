    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, which is also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers. We must use the ¹H NMR data for this.\n\n### **2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in analyzing the complex splitting patterns (multiplicities) described. We need to find the structure that would produce both a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** and a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\nLet's break down what these multiplicities mean according to the n+1 rule:\n*   **Doublet (d):** The proton is coupled to 1 neighboring proton.\n*   **Triplet (t):** The proton is coupled to 2 equivalent neighboring protons (like a CH₂ group).\n*   **Quartet (q):** The proton is coupled to 3 equivalent neighboring protons (like a CH₃ group).\n*   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** The proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: one proton (giving the doublet), a CH₂ group (giving the triplet), and a CH₃ group (giving the quartet).\n*   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** The proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: one proton (giving the doublet), a CH₂ group (giving a triplet), and a second, different CH₂ group (giving another triplet).\n\nNow, let's analyze the expected splitting patterns for the methine (CH) protons in each candidate molecule. We will number the carbon chain starting from the COOH group as carbon 1.\n\n---\n\n#### **Candidate A: CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**\nThis structure is **2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n```\n         Et      Et\n         |       |\nCH₃(5)CH₂(4)-C(H)₃-C(H)₂-COOH(1)\n```\n*   **H₃:** Is coupled to H₂ (1H, doublet), H₄ (2H, triplet), and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H, triplet). This signal would be a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the observed signals.\n*   **H₂:** Is coupled to H₃ (1H, doublet) and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H, triplet). This signal would be a **doublet of triplets (dt)**.\n*   **Result:** This structure provides a `dtt` but not a `dtq`. Therefore, it is incorrect.\n\n---\n\n#### **Candidate B: CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\nThis structure is **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n```\n         Et      Et\n         |       |\nCH₃(5)-C(H)₄-C(H)₃-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)\n```\n*   **H₄:** Is coupled to H₃ (1H, doublet), the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H, triplet), and the terminal CH₃ group at C5 (3H, quartet). This signal would be a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches one of the observed signals.\n*   **H₃:** Is coupled to H₄ (1H, doublet), the CH₂ group at C2 (2H, triplet), and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H, triplet). This signal would be a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second observed signal.\n*   **Result:** This structure produces both a `dtq` and a `dtt`. This is a perfect match for the data.\n\n---\n\n#### **Candidate C: CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH**\nThis structure is **3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n```\n         Me      Me\n         |       |\nCH₃(5)-C(H)₄-C(H)₃-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)\n```\n*   **H₄:** Is coupled to H₃ (1H, doublet), the methyl group on C4 (3H, quartet), and the terminal CH₃ group at C5 (3H, quartet). This signal would be a **doublet of quartets of quartets (dqq)**.\n*   **H₃:** Is coupled to H₄ (1H, doublet), the CH₂ group at C2 (2H, triplet), and the methyl group on C3 (3H, quartet). This signal would be a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n*   **Result:** This structure provides a `dtq` but also a `dqq`, not the required `dtt`. Therefore, it is incorrect.\n\n---\n\n#### **Candidate D: CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**\nThis structure is **2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n```\n         Me      Me\n         |       |\nCH₃(5)CH₂(4)-C(H)₃-C(H)₂-COOH(1)\n```\n*   **H₃:** Is coupled to H₂ (1H, doublet), the CH₂ group at C4 (2H, triplet), and the methyl group on C3 (3H, quartet). This signal would be a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches one of the observed signals.\n*   **H₂:** Is coupled to H₃ (1H, doublet) and the methyl group on C2 (3H, quartet). This signal would be a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n*   **Result:** This structure provides a `dtq` but not a `dtt`. Therefore, it is incorrect.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nOnly the structure corresponding to **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH** (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid) correctly predicts the presence of both a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) and a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>"
