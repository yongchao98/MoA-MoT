    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of the Decay**\n\nThe problem describes the decay of a stationary positive pion (Pi+) into a positive muon (mu+) and a muon neutrino (nu):\nPi(+) -> mu(+) + nu\n\nWe are given the rest masses of the pion and the muon, and we need to find the kinetic energies of the two product particles. This is a classic problem involving the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum in the context of special relativity.\n\n*   **Particle:** Pi(+) (pion)\n    *   Rest Mass (m_pi): 139.6 MeV/c^2\n    *   Initial state: Stationary, so its initial velocity is 0.\n\n*   **Products:** mu(+) (muon) and nu (neutrino)\n    *   Rest Mass of muon (m_mu): 105.7 MeV/c^2\n    *   Rest Mass of neutrino (m_nu): Assumed to be 0, which is a standard and very good approximation for this type of problem.\n\n**2. Apply Conservation Laws**\n\nWe will use the conservation of total relativistic energy and the conservation of momentum. For simplicity, we can use a system of units where the speed of light, c = 1. In this system, energy, momentum, and mass are all measured in units of MeV.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    Since the initial pion is stationary, its initial momentum is zero (p_initial = 0).\n    According to the conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero.\n    p_final = p_mu + p_nu = 0\n    This means the muon and the neutrino must fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this magnitude 'p'.\n    |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    The total initial energy must equal the total final energy.\n    E_initial = E_final\n    The initial energy is the rest energy of the stationary pion:\n    E_initial = m_pi * c^2 = 139.6 MeV\n    The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino:\n    E_final = E_mu + E_nu\n    So, the energy conservation equation is:\n    139.6 MeV = E_mu + E_nu\n\n**3. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**\n\nThe total energy (E) of a particle is related to its rest mass (m) and momentum (p) by the equation:\nE^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2\nAgain, setting c=1, this simplifies to E^2 = p^2 + m^2.\n\n*   For the muon (mu+):\n    E_mu^2 = p^2 + m_mu^2\n    E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2)\n\n*   For the neutrino (nu), since m_nu = 0:\n    E_nu^2 = p^2 + 0^2\n    E_nu = p\n\n**4. Solve for the Unknowns**\n\nNow we have a system of equations to solve for the momentum 'p'.\nFrom energy conservation: E_mu = 139.6 - E_nu\nSubstitute E_nu = p: E_mu = 139.6 - p\n\nNow we have two expressions for E_mu:\n1.  E_mu = 139.6 - p\n2.  E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2)\n\nEquate them and solve for p:\n139.6 - p = sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2)\n\nSquare both sides of the equation:\n(139.6 - p)^2 = p^2 + (105.7)^2\n(139.6)^2 - 2 * 139.6 * p + p^2 = p^2 + (105.7)^2\n19488.16 - 279.2 * p + p^2 = p^2 + 11172.49\n\nThe p^2 terms cancel out. Rearrange the equation to solve for p:\n19488.16 - 11172.49 = 279.2 * p\n8315.67 = 279.2 * p\np = 8315.67 / 279.2\np ≈ 29.78 MeV/c\n\n**5. Calculate the Kinetic Energies**\n\nNow that we have the momentum 'p', we can find the kinetic energies (KE) of the products.\nKE = Total Energy (E) - Rest Mass Energy (m*c^2)\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the neutrino (KE_nu):**\n    For a massless particle, the total energy is all kinetic.\n    E_nu = p\n    KE_nu = E_nu = p ≈ 29.78 MeV\n    Rounding to one decimal place gives **29.8 MeV**.\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the muon (KE_mu):**\n    First, find the total energy of the muon. We can use the energy conservation equation:\n    E_mu = 139.6 - E_nu = 139.6 - 29.78 = 109.82 MeV\n    Now, calculate its kinetic energy:\n    KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu*c^2 = 109.82 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 4.12 MeV\n    So, KE_mu = **4.12 MeV**.\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino.\n\nTo confirm the calculations, we can use a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Rest masses in MeV/c^2\nm_pi = 139.6\nm_mu = 105.7\n\n# We use units where c=1.\n# The formula for the momentum of the products is derived from conservation laws:\n# p = (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) / (2 * m_pi)\np = (m_pi**2 - m_mu**2) / (2 * m_pi)\n\n# Kinetic energy of the neutrino (massless, so KE = E = p)\nKE_nu = p\n\n# Total energy of the muon from E^2 = p^2 + m^2\nE_mu = (p**2 + m_mu**2)**0.5\n# Kinetic energy of the muon is KE = E - m\nKE_mu = E_mu - m_mu\n\n# Print the results rounded to two decimal places\nprint(f\"KE of muon (mu+): {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of neutrino (nu): {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\nKE of muon (mu+): 4.12 MeV\nKE of neutrino (nu): 29.78 MeV\n\nThe results from the script confirm our manual calculation. The kinetic energy of the muon is 4.12 MeV, and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is 29.8 MeV (when rounded).\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nB) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nC) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nD) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n\nOur calculated values match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem describes the two-body decay of a stationary particle. To solve this, we must apply the principles of conservation of relativistic energy and momentum.\n\n**1. Define the System:**\n*   **Initial Particle:** Positive pion (Pi+), stationary.\n*   **Final Particles:** Positive muon (mu+) and a muon neutrino (nu).\n*   **Reaction:** Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu\n\n**2. State the Given Masses (in energy units, where c=1):**\n*   Rest mass of Pi+ ($m_{\\pi}$): 139.6 MeV\n*   Rest mass of mu+ ($m_{\\mu}$): 105.7 MeV\n*   Rest mass of neutrino ($m_{\\nu}$): Assumed to be 0 MeV (a standard and accurate approximation).\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Momentum:**\nSince the initial pion is stationary, its initial momentum is zero. By the law of conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the final particles must also be zero.\n$p_{initial} = p_{final} = 0$\n$p_{\\mu} + p_{\\nu} = 0$\nThis means the muon and the neutrino must travel in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this magnitude 'p'.\n$|p_{\\mu}| = |p_{\\nu}| = p$\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Energy:**\nThe total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n$E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n\n*   **Initial Energy:** The initial energy is the rest energy of the stationary pion.\n    $E_{initial} = m_{\\pi}c^2 = 139.6$ MeV\n\n*   **Final Energy:** The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n    $E_{final} = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n\nSo, the energy conservation equation is:\n$139.6 \\text{ MeV} = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n\n**5. Use the Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**\nThe total energy (E) of a particle is related to its momentum (p) and rest mass (m) by the equation $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. In our units (c=1), this is $E^2 = p^2 + m^2$.\n\n*   **For the muon (mu+):**\n    $E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\\mu}^2} = \\sqrt{p^2 + (105.7)^2}$\n\n*   **For the neutrino (nu):** Since it's massless ($m_{\\nu}=0$):\n    $E_{\\nu} = \\sqrt{p^2 + 0^2} = p$\n\n**6. Solve for Momentum (p):**\nSubstitute the expressions for $E_{\\mu}$ and $E_{\\nu}$ into the energy conservation equation:\n$139.6 = \\sqrt{p^2 + (105.7)^2} + p$\n\nRearrange to solve for p:\n$139.6 - p = \\sqrt{p^2 + (105.7)^2}$\n\nSquare both sides:\n$(139.6 - p)^2 = p^2 + (105.7)^2$\n$(139.6)^2 - 2(139.6)p + p^2 = p^2 + (105.7)^2$\n$19488.16 - 279.2p + p^2 = p^2 + 11172.49$\n\nThe $p^2$ terms cancel out. Now, isolate p:\n$19488.16 - 11172.49 = 279.2p$\n$8315.67 = 279.2p$\n$p = \\frac{8315.67}{279.2} \\approx 29.78$ MeV/c\n\n**7. Calculate the Kinetic Energies (KE):**\nThe kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest energy ($KE = E - mc^2$).\n\n*   **KE of the neutrino ($KE_{\\nu}$):**\n    Since the neutrino's rest mass is zero, its total energy is all kinetic energy.\n    $E_{\\nu} = p \\approx 29.78$ MeV\n    $KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu} - 0 = 29.78$ MeV\n    Rounding to one decimal place gives **29.8 MeV**.\n\n*   **KE of the muon ($KE_{\\mu}$):**\n    First, find the total energy of the muon using the energy conservation equation:\n    $E_{\\mu} = 139.6 - E_{\\nu} = 139.6 - 29.78 = 109.82$ MeV\n    Now, calculate its kinetic energy:\n    $KE_{\\mu} = E_{\\mu} - m_{\\mu}c^2 = 109.82 - 105.7 = 4.12$ MeV\n    So, $KE_{\\mu} = \\textbf{4.12 MeV}$.\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
