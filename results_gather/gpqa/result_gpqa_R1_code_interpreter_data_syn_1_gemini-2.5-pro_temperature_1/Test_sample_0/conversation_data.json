    "Here's my thinking process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Concept:** The question asks about the ability to \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two quantum energy levels. This immediately brings to mind the concept of uncertainty. The lifetime of a quantum state is inversely related to the uncertainty in its energy. This relationship is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n2.  **State the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP):** The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in a system's energy ($\\Delta E$) and the time interval over which that energy is measured ($\\Delta t$) must be greater than or equal to a fundamental constant. The formula is:\n    $\\Delta E \\cdot \\Delta t \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant ($\\hbar = h/2\\pi$).\n\n3.  **Apply HUP to the Problem:**\n    *   The \"lifetime\" ($\\tau$) of an unstable quantum state is the characteristic time it exists. We can use this lifetime as the time interval, so $\\Delta t \\approx \\tau$.\n    *   This lifetime imposes a fundamental, unavoidable uncertainty in the energy of the state, often called the \"natural linewidth\" or \"lifetime broadening\". This is the minimum possible width of the energy level.\n    *   From the HUP, the minimum energy uncertainty is $\\Delta E \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau}$. (Note: The factor of 1/2 is often dropped in order-of-magnitude calculations like this, as the full-width at half-maximum, a common measure of line width, is given by $\\Gamma = \\hbar/\\tau$).\n\n4.  **Define the \"Resolution\" Condition:** To clearly distinguish two energy levels, the difference in their central energies ($|E_1 - E_2|$) must be significantly larger than the widths of the levels themselves. If the energy difference is smaller than or comparable to the energy widths, the two levels will overlap and appear as a single, broad feature. The limiting factor is the *larger* of the two energy widths, which corresponds to the *shorter* lifetime.\n    *   Resolution condition: $|E_1 - E_2| > \\Delta E_{\\text{larger}}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Energy Width ($\\Delta E$) for Each State:**\n    *   I need the value of the reduced Planck constant, $\\hbar$, in units that are convenient for this problem, which is electron-volt-seconds (eV·s).\n    *   $\\hbar \\approx 6.582 \\times 10^{-16}$ eV·s.\n\n    *   **For State 1:**\n        *   Lifetime $\\tau_1 = 10^{-9}$ s.\n        *   Energy width $\\Delta E_1 \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau_1} = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ eV·s}}{10^{-9} \\text{ s}} \\approx 6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n\n    *   **For State 2:**\n        *   Lifetime $\\tau_2 = 10^{-8}$ s.\n        *   Energy width $\\Delta E_2 \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau_2} = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ eV·s}}{10^{-8} \\text{ s}} \\approx 6.6 \\times 10^{-8}$ eV.\n\n6.  **Determine the Minimum Required Energy Separation:**\n    *   The energy widths are $\\Delta E_1 \\approx 6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV and $\\Delta E_2 \\approx 6.6 \\times 10^{-8}$ eV.\n    *   The larger width is $\\Delta E_1$. This is the limiting factor for resolution.\n    *   Therefore, the energy difference between the two states, $|E_1 - E_2|$, must be greater than approximately $6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) $10^{-8}$ eV: This is less than the required separation of $6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV. (Not resolvable)\n    *   B) $10^{-11}$ eV: This is much less than the required separation. (Not resolvable)\n    *   C) $10^{-4}$ eV: This is much greater than the required separation ($10^{-4} \\gg 6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$). (Clearly resolvable)\n    *   D) $10^{-9}$ eV: This is much less than the required separation. (Not resolvable)\n\n8.  **Final Conclusion:** Only option C provides an energy difference large enough to overcome the lifetime broadening of the states.\n\nTo be certain of the calculation, I will use a Python script.\n\n```python\n# Constants\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nhbar_eV_s = 6.582119569e-16\n\n# Given lifetimes in seconds\ntau1 = 1e-9\ntau2 = 1e-8\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (natural linewidth) for each state using Delta_E * tau ~ hbar\ndelta_E1 = hbar_eV_s / tau1\ndelta_E2 = hbar_eV_s / tau2\n\n# To be clearly resolved, the energy difference must be larger than the energy widths.\n# The critical value is the larger of the two widths, which corresponds to the shorter lifetime.\nrequired_separation = max(delta_E1, delta_E2)\n\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 1 (lifetime {tau1:.1e} s): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 2 (lifetime {tau2:.1e} s): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"The required energy difference to resolve these levels must be greater than ~{required_separation:.3e} eV.\")\n\n# Check the given options\noptions = {'A': 1e-8, 'B': 1e-11, 'C': 1e-4, 'D': 1e-9}\nprint(\"\\nChecking the options:\")\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    if value > required_separation:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is a possible energy difference as it is greater than the required separation.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is NOT a possible energy difference.\")\n```\n<execute_code>\nEXECUTING CODE...\n<br>\npython\n# Constants\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nhbar_eV_s = 6.582119569e-16\n\n# Given lifetimes in seconds\ntau1 = 1e-9\ntau2 = 1e-8\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (natural linewidth) for each state using Delta_E * tau ~ hbar\ndelta_E1 = hbar_eV_s / tau1\ndelta_E2 = hbar_eV_s / tau2\n\n# To be clearly resolved, the energy difference must be larger than the energy widths.\n# The critical value is the larger of the two widths, which corresponds to the shorter lifetime.\nrequired_separation = max(delta_E1, delta_E2)\n\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 1 (lifetime {tau1:.1e} s): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 2 (lifetime {tau2:.1e} s): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"The required energy difference to resolve these levels must be greater than ~{required_separation:.3e} eV.\")\n\n# Check the given options\noptions = {'A': 1e-8, 'B': 1e-11, 'C': 1e-4, 'D': 1e-9}\nprint(\"\\nChecking the options:\")\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    if value > required_separation:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is a possible energy difference as it is greater than the required separation.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is NOT a possible energy difference.\")\n</execute_code>\nEXECUTION RESULT:\nEnergy width of state 1 (lifetime 1.0e-09 s): 6.582e-07 eV\nEnergy width of state 2 (lifetime 1.0e-08 s): 6.582e-08 eV\nThe required energy difference to resolve these levels must be greater than ~6.582e-07 eV.\n\nChecking the options:\nOption A (1.0e-08 eV) is NOT a possible energy difference.\nOption B (1.0e-11 eV) is NOT a possible energy difference.\nOption C (1.0e-04 eV) is a possible energy difference as it is greater than the required separation.\nOption D (1.0e-09 eV) is NOT a possible energy difference.\n<end_of_execution>\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.\n<<<C>>>",
    "The user wants me to solve a physics problem.\n\n**1. Identify the core physics principle:**\nThe question asks about \"clearly distinguishing\" or \"resolving\" two energy levels, each with a given \"lifetime\". This points directly to the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle** for energy and time.\n\n**2. State the principle:**\nThe principle states that the uncertainty in energy ($\\Delta E$) and the uncertainty in time ($\\Delta t$) are related by the inequality:\n$\\Delta E \\cdot \\Delta t \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$\nwhere $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n**3. Apply the principle to the problem:**\n*   The lifetime of a state ($\\tau$) is the characteristic time interval for that state. We can use this as $\\Delta t$. So, $\\Delta t_1 = \\tau_1 = 10^{-9}$ s and $\\Delta t_2 = \\tau_2 = 10^{-8}$ s.\n*   This lifetime imposes a fundamental uncertainty in the energy of the state, often called the \"natural linewidth\" or \"energy broadening\". This is the inherent \"fuzziness\" of the energy level. For an order-of-magnitude calculation, we can use the approximation:\n    $\\Delta E \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau}$\n*   We need the value of the reduced Planck constant in units of eV·s, which is $\\hbar \\approx 6.582 \\times 10^{-16}$ eV·s.\n\n**4. Calculate the energy uncertainty for each state:**\n*   **State 1:**\n    $\\Delta E_1 \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau_1} = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ eV·s}}{10^{-9} \\text{ s}} = 6.582 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n*   **State 2:**\n    $\\Delta E_2 \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau_2} = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ eV·s}}{10^{-8} \\text{ s}} = 6.582 \\times 10^{-8}$ eV.\n\n**5. Define the \"resolvability\" condition:**\n*   For two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved,\" the difference in their central energies ($|E_1 - E_2|$) must be larger than their energy widths. If the energy difference is smaller than the widths, the two \"fuzzy\" energy levels will overlap too much to be distinguished.\n*   The limiting factor is the state with the *larger* energy width. A shorter lifetime leads to a larger energy uncertainty. In this case, state 1 has the shorter lifetime ($\\tau_1 = 10^{-9}$ s) and thus the larger energy width ($\\Delta E_1 \\approx 6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV).\n*   Therefore, the condition for resolvability is:\n    $|E_1 - E_2| > \\Delta E_1 \\approx 6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n\n**6. Evaluate the given options against this condition:**\nWe need to find an energy difference that is greater than approximately $6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n\n*   A) $10^{-8}$ eV: This is smaller than $6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV. (Not resolvable)\n*   B) $10^{-11}$ eV: This is much smaller than $6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV. (Not resolvable)\n*   C) $10^{-4}$ eV: This is much larger than $6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV. (Resolvable)\n*   D) $10^{-9}$ eV: This is smaller than $6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV. (Not resolvable)\n\n**7. Conclusion:**\nOnly option C provides an energy separation large enough to clearly resolve the two states, given the lifetime broadening of the state with the shorter lifetime.\n\nThe Python code was used to perform these calculations precisely and systematically check the options, confirming the manual reasoning. The code output shows that the required separation must be greater than ~6.582e-07 eV and that only option C (1e-4 eV) satisfies this condition.\n\nFinal Answer should be C. The problem requires us to determine the minimum energy difference needed to clearly distinguish two quantum states with given lifetimes. This is a direct application of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy ($\\Delta E$) and the uncertainty in time ($\\Delta t$) is at least on the order of the reduced Planck constant ($\\hbar$). The formula is:\n    $\\Delta E \\cdot \\Delta t \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$\n\n2.  **Relating Lifetime to Energy Uncertainty:** The lifetime of a quantum state ($\\tau$) represents the characteristic time scale over which the state exists. We can use this lifetime as the time uncertainty, so $\\Delta t \\approx \\tau$. This lifetime imposes a fundamental \"blur\" or uncertainty in the energy of the state, known as the natural linewidth. For calculation purposes, we can approximate the minimum energy uncertainty as:\n    $\\Delta E \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau}$\n\n3.  **Resolvability Condition:** To \"clearly resolve\" or distinguish two energy levels, the difference in their central energies ($|E_1 - E_2|$) must be greater than their energy widths ($\\Delta E$). If the two states have different energy widths, the larger width is the limiting factor. The two levels will overlap and be indistinguishable if their energy difference is smaller than this larger width. Therefore, the condition is:\n    $|E_1 - E_2| > \\max(\\Delta E_1, \\Delta E_2)$\n\n4.  **Calculations:**\n    *   The value of the reduced Planck constant is $\\hbar \\approx 6.582 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ eV·s}$.\n    *   The lifetimes are given as $\\tau_1 = 10^{-9}$ s and $\\tau_2 = 10^{-8}$ s.\n\n    *   **Calculate the energy width for State 1:**\n        $\\Delta E_1 \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau_1} = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ eV·s}}{10^{-9} \\text{ s}} \\approx 6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n\n    *   **Calculate the energy width for State 2:**\n        $\\Delta E_2 \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau_2} = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ eV·s}}{10^{-8} \\text{ s}} \\approx 6.6 \\times 10^{-8}$ eV.\n\n    *   **Determine the required separation:** The larger energy width corresponds to the shorter lifetime ($\\tau_1$). Thus, the limiting energy width is $\\Delta E_1 \\approx 6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV. To resolve the levels, the energy difference must be greater than this value.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:** We need to find the option that is greater than $6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n    *   A) $10^{-8}$ eV: This is less than $6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n    *   B) $10^{-11}$ eV: This is much less than $6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n    *   C) $10^{-4}$ eV: This is much greater than $6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n    *   D) $10^{-9}$ eV: This is less than $6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n\nOnly option C provides an energy difference large enough to overcome the natural linewidths of the states, allowing them to be clearly resolved. The code output confirms these calculations.\n\n<<<C>>>"
