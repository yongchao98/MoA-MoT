    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and calculation to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Define Initial Parameters and Masses**\n\n*   The initial nucleus is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is $E_0 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   It splits into two fragments with rest masses $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n*   We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's say $m_1$ is the more massive one, so $m_1 = 2m_2$.\n*   The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$.\n\nWe can solve for the individual masses (or more conveniently, their rest-mass energies):\nSubstitute $m_1 = 2m_2$ into the sum equation:\n$2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99M \\implies 3m_2 = 0.99M \\implies m_2 = 0.33M$.\nThen, $m_1 = 2m_2 = 2(0.33M) = 0.66M$.\n\nNow, we can find their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1 (the more massive one): $m_1c^2 = 0.66 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2 (the less massive one): $m_2c^2 = 0.33 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released in the fission, known as the Q-value, is converted into the kinetic energy of the two fragments. It's the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n$Q = (\\text{Initial rest-mass energy}) - (\\text{Final total rest-mass energy})$\n$Q = Mc^2 - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2)$\n$Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - (198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV})$\n$Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments:\n$T_1 + T_2 = Q = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n### **3. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, we use the conservation of momentum. Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total final momentum must be zero.\n$p_1 = p_2 = p$ (in magnitude).\n\nThe classical relationship between kinetic energy (T) and momentum (p) is $T = p^2 / (2m)$.\nSo, $p^2 = 2m_1 T_{1,cl} = 2m_2 T_{2,cl}$.\nThis gives the ratio of kinetic energies: $T_{1,cl} / T_{2,cl} = m_2 / m_1$.\nThe kinetic energy is shared inversely proportional to the mass.\n\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  $T_{1,cl} + T_{2,cl} = Q = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n2.  $T_{1,cl} / T_{2,cl} = m_2 / m_1 = (99 \\text{ GeV}/c^2) / (198 \\text{ GeV}/c^2) = 1/2$\n\nFrom (2), $T_{2,cl} = 2 T_{1,cl}$. Substituting this into (1):\n$T_{1,cl} + 2T_{1,cl} = 3 \\text{ GeV} \\implies 3T_{1,cl} = 3 \\text{ GeV} \\implies T_{1,cl} = 1 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nSo, the classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is $T_{1,cl} = 1 \\text{ GeV} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n### **4. Calculate T1 using Correct (Relativistic) Formulas**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the conservation of momentum ($p_1 = p_2 = p$) still holds. However, the energy-momentum relation is different: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\nThe total energy is $E = T + m_0c^2$. So, $(T + m_0c^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\nRearranging for $(pc)^2$, we get: $(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2T(m_0c^2)$.\n\nApplying this to both fragments and equating their momenta:\n$(pc)^2 = T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2)$\n$(pc)^2 = T_2^2 + 2T_2(m_2c^2)$\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = T_2^2 + 2T_2(m_2c^2)$\n\nWe still use the relation $T_1 + T_2 = Q$, so $T_2 = Q - T_1$.\nSubstitute $T_2$ into the momentum equation:\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = (Q - T_1)^2 + 2(Q - T_1)(m_2c^2)$\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = (Q^2 - 2QT_1 + T_1^2) + (2Q(m_2c^2) - 2T_1(m_2c^2))$\n\nCancel $T_1^2$ from both sides and group the terms with $T_1$:\n$2T_1(m_1c^2) = Q^2 - 2QT_1 + 2Q(m_2c^2) - 2T_1(m_2c^2)$\n$2T_1(m_1c^2) + 2QT_1 + 2T_1(m_2c^2) = Q^2 + 2Q(m_2c^2)$\n$T_1 [2(m_1c^2 + m_2c^2) + 2Q] = Q(Q + 2m_2c^2)$\n\nNow, solve for $T_1$ (which we'll call $T_{1,rel}$):\n$T_{1,rel} = \\frac{Q(Q + 2m_2c^2)}{2(m_1c^2 + m_2c^2 + Q)}$\n\nSubstitute the known values (in GeV):\n$Q = 3$\n$m_1c^2 = 198$\n$m_2c^2 = 99$\n$m_1c^2 + m_2c^2 = 297$\n\n$T_{1,rel} = \\frac{3 \\times (3 + 2 \\times 99)}{2 \\times (297 + 3)}$\n$T_{1,rel} = \\frac{3 \\times (3 + 198)}{2 \\times 300}$\n$T_{1,rel} = \\frac{3 \\times 201}{600} = \\frac{201}{200}$\n$T_{1,rel} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nSo, the relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is $T_{1,rel} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV} = 1005 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n### **5. Find the Difference**\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\nDifference = $T_{1,rel} - T_{1,cl}$\nDifference = $1005 \\text{ MeV} - 1000 \\text{ MeV}$\nDifference = $5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nTo confirm the calculations, we can use a short python script.\n```python\n# Initial rest-mass energy in GeV\nMc2 = 300\n\n# Calculate rest-mass energies of the fragments in GeV\n# m1 = 2 * m2 and m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M => m2 = 0.33 * M, m1 = 0.66 * M\nm2c2 = 0.33 * Mc2\nm1c2 = 0.66 * Mc2\n\n# Calculate Q-value in GeV\nQ = Mc2 - (m1c2 + m2c2)\n\n# Calculate T1 using classical approximation in GeV\n# T1_cl = Q * m2 / (m1 + m2)\nT1_cl = Q * m2c2 / (m1c2 + m2c2)\n\n# Calculate T1 using relativistic formula in GeV\n# T1_rel = (Q * (Q + 2*m2c2)) / (2 * (m1c2 + m2c2 + Q))\nT1_rel = (Q * (Q + 2 * m2c2)) / (2 * (m1c2 + m2c2 + Q))\n\n# Calculate the difference and convert from GeV to MeV\ndifference_MeV = (T1_rel - T1_cl) * 1000\n\nprint(f\"The classical T1 is {T1_cl:.4f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"The relativistic T1 is {T1_rel:.4f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"The difference is {difference_MeV:.1f} MeV\")\n```\nThe code output confirms the manually calculated result.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV.\nInitial rest-mass energy, $E_0 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nThe nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses $m_1$ and $m_2$.\nLet $m_1$ be the more massive fragment. We are given $m_1 = 2m_2$.\n\nThe sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass:\n$m_1 + m_2 = 0.99 M$\nSubstituting $m_1 = 2m_2$:\n$2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99 M \\implies 3m_2 = 0.99 M \\implies m_2 = 0.33 M$.\nThen, $m_1 = 2m_2 = 0.66 M$.\n\nWe can now find the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n-   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1: $m_1c^2 = 0.66 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n-   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2: $m_2c^2 = 0.33 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nThe energy released in the fission (Q-value) is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n$Q = E_0 - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2) = 300 \\text{ GeV} - (198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV}) = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\nThis is the total kinetic energy shared by the fragments: $T_1 + T_2 = Q = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**1. Classical (Non-Relativistic) Calculation of T1**\n\nSince the initial nucleus is at rest, the total final momentum must be zero. The fragments fly apart with equal and opposite momenta.\n$p_1 = p_2 = p$.\nThe classical relation between kinetic energy (T) and momentum (p) is $T = p^2 / (2m)$.\nTherefore, $p^2 = 2m_1 T_{1,cl} = 2m_2 T_{2,cl}$.\nThis implies that the kinetic energy is shared in inverse proportion to the mass:\n$T_{1,cl} / T_{2,cl} = m_2 / m_1 = 1/2$.\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  $T_{1,cl} + T_{2,cl} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n2.  $T_{2,cl} = 2 T_{1,cl}$\n\nSubstituting (2) into (1):\n$T_{1,cl} + 2T_{1,cl} = 3 \\text{ GeV} \\implies 3T_{1,cl} = 3 \\text{ GeV} \\implies T_{1,cl} = 1 \\text{ GeV}$.\nSo, the classical kinetic energy is $T_{1,cl} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**2. Correct (Relativistic) Calculation of T1**\n\nConservation of momentum ($p_1 = p_2 = p$) still holds. The relativistic energy-momentum relation is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\nWe can write $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0c^2)^2$.\nSince the total energy is $E = T + m_0c^2$, we can expand this to $(pc)^2 = (T + m_0c^2)^2 - (m_0c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2T(m_0c^2)$.\n\nEquating the momenta for both fragments:\n$(p_1c)^2 = (p_2c)^2$\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = T_2^2 + 2T_2(m_2c^2)$\n\nSubstitute $T_2 = Q - T_1 = 3 - T_1$:\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1(198) = (3 - T_1)^2 + 2(3 - T_1)(99)$\n$T_1^2 + 396 T_1 = (9 - 6T_1 + T_1^2) + (594 - 198 T_1)$\n\nCancel $T_1^2$ from both sides:\n$396 T_1 = 9 - 6T_1 + 594 - 198 T_1$\n$396 T_1 = 603 - 204 T_1$\n$396 T_1 + 204 T_1 = 603$\n$600 T_1 = 603$\n$T_1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\nSo, the correct relativistic kinetic energy is $T_1 = 1.005 \\text{ GeV} = 1005 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**3. The Difference**\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\n$\\Delta T_1 = T_1(\\text{relativistic}) - T_1(\\text{classical})$\n$\\Delta T_1 = 1005 \\text{ MeV} - 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n<<<A>>>"
