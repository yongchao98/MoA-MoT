    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The main objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet1 and Planet2, which can be written as $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet orbiting a star is given by the formula:\n    $T_{eq} = T_* \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where:\n    *   $T_*$ is the effective temperature of the star.\n    *   $R_*$ is the radius of the star.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   $A$ is the albedo of the planet.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We can write the equilibrium temperature for each planet and then take their ratio:\n    $T_{eq,1} = T_* \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}$\n    $T_{eq,2} = T_* \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}$\n\n    The problem states that both planets orbit the same star (so $T_*$ and $R_*$ are the same) and have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2 = A$). When we take the ratio, these common terms cancel out:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_* \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}}{T_* \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}$\n    This shows that the ratio of equilibrium temperatures depends only on the ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n4.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observable Quantities:** The problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's light caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) is related to the star's radial velocity amplitude ($K_*$) by:\n    $K_* = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0}$\n    where $c$ is the speed of light and $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the radial velocity amplitude is given by:\n    $K_* = \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G(M_* + M_p)}{a}}$\n    where $M_p$ is the planet mass, $M_*$ is the star mass, $G$ is the gravitational constant, and $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n    Since planets are much less massive than their host star ($M_p \\ll M_*$), we can simplify this to:\n    $K_* \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{GM_*}{a}}$\n    The problem states that the planets were detected by the transit method as well, which implies their orbits are viewed nearly edge-on, so the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ and $\\sin i \\approx 1$.\n    Thus, the equation simplifies to:\n    $K_* \\approx \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{a}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{M_*}}$\n\n5.  **Determine the Relationship for the Semi-Major Axis Ratio:** We can rearrange the formula to solve for $\\sqrt{a}$:\n    $\\sqrt{a} \\propto \\frac{M_p}{K_*}$\n    Now we can write the ratio for our two planets:\n    $\\frac{\\sqrt{a_2}}{\\sqrt{a_1}} = \\frac{M_2 / K_2}{M_1 / K_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n    We also know that $K_* \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$. Therefore, the ratio of the amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n    Substituting this into the equation for the semi-major axis ratio gives:\n    $\\frac{\\sqrt{a_2}}{\\sqrt{a_1}} = \\left(\\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** From step 3, we know that $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{a_2}}{\\sqrt{a_1}}$.\n    Therefore, we can equate the temperature ratio with the expression from step 5:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\n    Now, we plug in the given values:\n    *   $M_1 = 7 M_{Earth}$\n    *   $M_2 = 5 M_{Earth}$\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n    This calculation can be performed using a simple python script.\n```python\n# Masses of the planets\nM1_earth_mass = 7.0\nM2_earth_mass = 5.0\n\n# Doppler shifts\ndelta_lambda_1_angstrom = 0.03\ndelta_lambda_2_angstrom = 0.04\n\n# Calculate the ratio of masses (M2/M1)\nmass_ratio = M2_earth_mass / M1_earth_mass\n\n# Calculate the ratio of Doppler shifts (delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2)\nshift_ratio = delta_lambda_1_angstrom / delta_lambda_2_angstrom\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is the product of these two ratios\nT_ratio = mass_ratio * shift_ratio\n\nprint(f\"{T_ratio=}\")\n```\n>>>\nT_ratio=0.5357142857142857\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.536. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) ~ 1.30\nB) ~ 1.05\nC) ~ 0.98\nD) ~ 0.53\n\nThe result is closest to 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula:\n$T_{eq} = T_* \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nwhere $T_*$ is the star's effective temperature, $R_*$ is the star's radius, $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, and $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet1 and Planet2, $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}}$. Since both planets orbit the same star ($T_*$ and $R_*$ are constant) and have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$), these terms will cancel out in the ratio:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_* \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_* \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}$\n\nThe problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method. For a planet in a circular orbit detected via the RV method, the amplitude of the star's velocity variation ($K_*$) is given by:\n$K_* = \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G(M_* + M_p)}{a}}$\nSince the planets are much less massive than the star ($M_p \\ll M_*$), we can approximate $M_* + M_p \\approx M_*$. Also, since the planets were also detected by the transit method, their orbital inclination $i$ is close to 90°, so $\\sin i \\approx 1$. The formula simplifies to:\n$K_* \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{GM_*}{a}} = \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{a}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{M_*}}$\n\nThe radial velocity amplitude $K_*$ is related to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$ by the formula $K_* = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0}$, where $c$ is the speed of light and $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength. This means $K_* \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$.\n\nFrom the simplified formula for $K_*$, we can express $\\sqrt{a}$ in terms of the other parameters:\n$\\sqrt{a} \\propto \\frac{M_p}{K_*} \\propto \\frac{M_p}{\\Delta\\lambda_{max}}$\nNow we can write the ratio $\\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{a_2}}{\\sqrt{a_1}}$:\n$\\frac{\\sqrt{a_2}}{\\sqrt{a_1}} = \\frac{M_2 / \\Delta\\lambda_2}{M_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   $M_1 = 7 M_{Earth}$\n*   $M_2 = 5 M_{Earth}$\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>"
