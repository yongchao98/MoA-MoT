    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation, and radioactive decay.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics**\n\nThe number of particles that decay over time follows an exponential law. In the particle's own rest frame, the number of particles $N$ at a proper time $\\tau$ is given by:\n$N(\\tau) = N_0 e^{-\\tau / \\tau_0}$\nwhere $N_0$ is the initial number of particles and $\\tau_0$ is the mean proper lifetime.\n\nThe particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds in the lab frame (the detector frame). Due to time dilation, a time interval $t$ in the lab frame corresponds to a shorter proper time interval $\\tau$ for the particle:\n$\\tau = t / \\gamma$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\nThe time it takes for a particle to travel the radius $R$ of the detector in the lab frame is:\n$t = R/v$\nSince the particles are ultra-relativistic, their speed $v$ is approximately the speed of light, $c$. So, $t \\approx R/c$.\n\nThe proper time elapsed for a particle reaching the detector wall is therefore:\n$\\tau \\approx (R/c) / \\gamma = R / (\\gamma c)$\n\nThe fraction ($f$) of particles that survive the journey to the detector wall is $N/N_0$. Substituting the expression for $\\tau$:\n$f = e^{-\\tau / \\tau_0} = e^{-R / (\\gamma c \\tau_0)}$\n\n**2. Formulate the Equations**\n\nLet's define a constant $K = R / (c \\tau_0)$, which depends on the detector radius and the particle's intrinsic properties. The equation becomes:\n$f = e^{-K / \\gamma}$\n\nWe can rearrange this by taking the natural logarithm:\n$\\ln(f) = -K / \\gamma$\n$-\\ln(f) = K / \\gamma$\n$\\ln(1/f) = K / \\gamma$\nor\n$\\gamma \\ln(1/f) = K$\n\nSince $K$ is a constant for this experiment, we can relate the two scenarios given in the problem:\n$\\gamma_1 \\ln(1/f_1) = \\gamma_2 \\ln(1/f_2)$\n\n**3. Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma_2$)**\n\nWe are given the following information:\n*   Initial condition: $\\gamma_1 = 20$, $f_1 = 1/3$\n*   Target condition: $\\gamma_2 = ?$, $f_2 = 2/3$\n\nPlug these values into the equation:\n$20 \\times \\ln(1 / (1/3)) = \\gamma_2 \\times \\ln(1 / (2/3))$\n$20 \\times \\ln(3) = \\gamma_2 \\times \\ln(3/2)$\n$20 \\times \\ln(3) = \\gamma_2 \\times \\ln(1.5)$\n\nNow, solve for $\\gamma_2$:\n$\\gamma_2 = 20 \\times \\frac{\\ln(3)}{\\ln(1.5)}$\n\n**4. Calculate the Numerical Value**\n\nTo get the numerical answer, we can use a simple python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We derived the formula for the new Lorentz factor, gamma_2.\n# gamma_2 = 20 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)\n# Let's calculate this value.\n\ngamma_2 = 20 * math.log(3) / math.log(1.5)\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n<execute_code>\n54.18539209520937\n</execute_code>\n\nThe calculated value for $\\gamma_2$ is approximately 54.19. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This problem requires understanding the concepts of special relativity, specifically time dilation, and how it affects particle decay.\n\n**1. The Physics of Particle Decay**\n\nThe fraction of particles ($f$) that survive after a certain proper time ($\\tau$) is given by the exponential decay law:\n$f = N/N_0 = e^{-\\tau/\\tau_0}$\nwhere $\\tau_0$ is the mean proper lifetime of the particle (its lifetime in its own rest frame).\n\n**2. Time Dilation in the Lab Frame**\n\nThe particles are moving at relativistic speeds relative to the detector (the lab frame). Due to time dilation, the time elapsed in the particle's rest frame ($\\tau$) is shorter than the time measured in the lab frame ($t$). The relationship is:\n$\\tau = t / \\gamma$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n**3. Time of Flight**\n\nThe time it takes for a particle to travel the radius $R$ of the detector in the lab frame is $t = R/v$. Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed $v$ is approximately the speed of light, $c$.\nSo, $t \\approx R/c$.\n\n**4. Combining the Concepts**\n\nWe can substitute the expressions for $t$ and $\\tau$ into the decay equation:\n*   First, find the proper time elapsed for a particle reaching the wall:\n    $\\tau = t / \\gamma \\approx (R/c) / \\gamma = R / (\\gamma c)$\n*   Now, substitute this proper time into the decay formula:\n    $f = e^{-\\tau/\\tau_0} = e^{-R / (\\gamma c \\tau_0)}$\n\n**5. Setting up the Ratios**\n\nThe term $R/(c\\tau_0)$ is a constant for this specific particle and detector setup. Let's call this constant $K$. The equation becomes:\n$f = e^{-K/\\gamma}$\n\nTo solve for $K$, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$\\ln(f) = -K/\\gamma$\n$-\\ln(f) = K/\\gamma$\n$\\ln(1/f) = K/\\gamma$\n$\\gamma \\ln(1/f) = K$\n\nSince $K$ is constant, we can equate this expression for the two scenarios given in the problem:\n$\\gamma_1 \\ln(1/f_1) = \\gamma_2 \\ln(1/f_2)$\n\n**6. Solving for the Unknown Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma_2$)**\n\nWe are given:\n*   Scenario 1: $\\gamma_1 = 20$, $f_1 = 1/3$\n*   Scenario 2: We want to find $\\gamma_2$ when $f_2 = 2/3$.\n\nPlug these values into the equation:\n$20 \\times \\ln(1 / (1/3)) = \\gamma_2 \\times \\ln(1 / (2/3))$\n$20 \\times \\ln(3) = \\gamma_2 \\times \\ln(3/2)$\n$20 \\times \\ln(3) = \\gamma_2 \\times \\ln(1.5)$\n\nNow, isolate $\\gamma_2$:\n$\\gamma_2 = 20 \\times \\frac{\\ln(3)}{\\ln(1.5)}$\n\n**7. Calculation**\n\nUsing the output from the code interpreter:\n$\\gamma_2 \\approx 54.19$\n\nThis value is very close to 54.\n\n<<<B>>>"
