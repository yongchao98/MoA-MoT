    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the notation:** The notation `[A/B]` represents the logarithmic abundance ratio of element A to element B in a star, compared to the same ratio in the Sun. Mathematically, it's defined as:\n    `[A/B] = log10(n(A)/n(B))_star - log10(n(A)/n(B))_sun`\n    where `n(A)` and `n(B)` are the number densities of elements A and B.\n\n2.  **Derive a useful identity:** We can express `[A/B]` in terms of abundances relative to Hydrogen (H), which is the standard reference.\n    `[A/B] = (log10(n(A)/n(H))_star - log10(n(B)/n(H))_star) - (log10(n(A)/n(H))_sun - log10(n(B)/n(H))_sun)`\n    Rearranging the terms:\n    `[A/B] = (log10(n(A)/n(H))_star - log10(n(A)/n(H))_sun) - (log10(n(B)/n(H))_star - log10(n(B)/n(H))_sun)`\n    This simplifies to:\n    `[A/B] = [A/H] - [B/H]`\n\n3.  **Calculate the silicon abundance for Star_1:**\n    We are given `[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3` and `[Fe/H]_1 = 0`.\n    Using the identity from step 2:\n    `[Si/Fe]_1 = [Si/H]_1 - [Fe/H]_1`\n    `0.3 = [Si/H]_1 - 0`\n    Therefore, `[Si/H]_1 = 0.3`\n\n4.  **Calculate the silicon abundance for Star_2:**\n    We are given `[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3` and `[Mg/H]_2 = 0`.\n    Using the same identity:\n    `[Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2`\n    `0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2`\n    Therefore, `[Si/H]_2 = -0.3`\n\n5.  **Determine the ratio of silicon atoms:** The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of the two stars. This is interpreted as the ratio of their silicon abundances relative to hydrogen, which is `(n(Si)/n(H))_1 / (n(Si)/n(H))_2`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the final ratio:**\n    From the definition of `[Si/H]`, we have:\n    `[Si/H]_1 = log10( (n(Si)/n(H))_1 / (n(Si)/n(H))_sun )`\n    `[Si/H]_2 = log10( (n(Si)/n(H))_2 / (n(Si)/n(H))_sun )`\n\n    Subtracting the second equation from the first:\n    `[Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 = log10( (n(Si)/n(H))_1 ) - log10( (n(Si)/n(H))_2 )`\n    `[Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 = log10( (n(Si)/n(H))_1 / (n(Si)/n(H))_2 )`\n\n    Let `R` be the desired ratio `(n(Si)/n(H))_1 / (n(Si)/n(H))_2`.\n    `log10(R) = [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2`\n    `log10(R) = 0.3 - (-0.3) = 0.6`\n    `R = 10^0.6`\n\n7.  **Compute the numerical value:** We need to calculate `10^0.6`. We can use a python script for this. Note that the stellar masses and the solar abundances of Fe and Mg were not needed for this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the value of 10^0.6\nratio = 10**0.6\nprint(ratio)\n```",
    "The calculation shows that the ratio of silicon atoms in the photosphere of Star_1 to Star_2 is approximately 3.98. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~1.2\nB) ~12.6\nC) ~3.9\nD) ~0.8\n\nThe calculated value of ~3.98 is closest to 3.9.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$."
