    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M1) to the total mass of system_2 (M2). This can be expressed as the factor M1 / M2.\n\n2.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude 1 (K1a) = 10 km/s\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude 2 (K1b) = 5 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude 1 (K2a) = 15 km/s\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitude 2 (K2b) = 10 km/s\n    *   **Key Insight:** Both systems are \"eclipsing.\" This is a crucial piece of information. It implies that we are viewing the orbits nearly edge-on. In orbital mechanics, this means the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90°, and therefore, `sin(i)` is very close to 1.\n\n3.  **Recall the Relevant Physics:** The relationship between the total mass of a binary system, its period, and the velocities of its components is described by Kepler's Third Law, adapted for spectroscopic binaries. For a double-lined spectroscopic binary (where we can measure the radial velocities of both stars), the total mass (M_total = m1 + m2) can be calculated using the following formula:\n    \n    M_total = (P * (K1 + K2)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))\n    \n    Where:\n    *   `M_total` is the total mass of the system.\n    *   `P` is the orbital period.\n    *   `K1` and `K2` are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n    *   `i` is the inclination of the orbit.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio M1 / M2.\n    \n    M1 = (P1 * (K1a + K1b)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i1))\n    M2 = (P2 * (K2a + K2b)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i2))\n    \n    When we take the ratio M1 / M2, the constants `2 * π * G` cancel out.\n    \n    M1 / M2 = [P1 * (K1a + K1b)³ / sin³(i1)] / [P2 * (K2a + K2b)³ / sin³(i2)]\n    \n    Since both systems are eclipsing, we assume `i1 ≈ i2 ≈ 90°`, which means `sin(i1) ≈ sin(i2) ≈ 1`. Therefore, the `sin³(i)` terms also cancel out. The formula simplifies to:\n    \n    M1 / M2 = (P1 / P2) * [(K1a + K1b) / (K2a + K2b)]³\n\n5.  **Calculate the Components of the Ratio:**\n    *   **Ratio of Periods (P1 / P2):**\n        *   P1 = 2 years\n        *   P2 = 1 year\n        *   P1 / P2 = 2 / 1 = 2\n    \n    *   **Ratio of Total Velocity Amplitudes ((K1a + K1b) / (K2a + K2b)):**\n        *   Total K for System 1 (K_total_1) = K1a + K1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n        *   Total K for System 2 (K_total_2) = K2a + K2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n        *   (K_total_1 / K_total_2) = 15 / 25 = 3 / 5 = 0.6\n\n6.  **Compute the Final Mass Ratio:**\n    *   Substitute the calculated ratios back into the simplified formula:\n    *   M1 / M2 = (2) * (0.6)³\n    *   M1 / M2 = 2 * (0.6 * 0.6 * 0.6)\n    *   M1 / M2 = 2 * 0.216\n    *   M1 / M2 = 0.432\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated factor is 0.432. This value is closest to option B.\n\nTo verify the calculation, a simple Python script can be used.\n```python\n# Parameters for system_1\nP1 = 2.0  # years\nK1a = 10.0  # km/s\nK1b = 5.0  # km/s\n\n# Parameters for system_2\nP2 = 1.0  # year\nK2a = 15.0 # km/s\nK2b = 10.0 # km/s\n\n# The ratio of the masses is given by M1/M2 = (P1/P2) * ((K1a+K1b)/(K2a+K2b))^3\n# This is because the other terms (G, 2*pi, sin(i)) in the full mass equation cancel out.\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the periods\nperiod_ratio = P1 / P2\n\n# Calculate the sum of velocity amplitudes for each system\nK_total_1 = K1a + K1b\nK_total_2 = K2a + K2b\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the summed velocity amplitudes\nK_ratio = K_total_1 / K_total_2\n\n# Calculate the final mass ratio\nmass_ratio = period_ratio * (K_ratio)**3\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.432\n</execute_code>\nThe calculation confirms that the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is 0.432. This means system_1 is less massive than system_2. The value 0.432 is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "To solve this problem, we need to use the mass function for a double-lined spectroscopic binary system. The total mass of a binary system (M_total = m1 + m2) is given by Kepler's Third Law, adapted for spectroscopic binaries:\n\nM_total = (P * (K1 + K2)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))\n\nWhere:\n*   `M_total` is the total mass of the system.\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `K1` and `K2` are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbit to our line of sight.\n\nThe problem states that both systems are \"eclipsing.\" This is a critical piece of information, as it implies that we are viewing the orbits nearly edge-on. For an eclipsing binary, the inclination `i` is very close to 90°, which means `sin(i)` is very close to 1. Therefore, `sin³(i) ≈ 1`.\n\nWe are asked to find the ratio of the mass of system_1 (M1) to the mass of system_2 (M2).\n\nFor system_1:\nM1 = (P1 * (K1a + K1b)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i1))\n\nFor system_2:\nM2 = (P2 * (K2a + K2b)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i2))\n\nNow, let's form the ratio M1 / M2:\n\nM1 / M2 = [ (P1 * (K1a + K1b)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i1)) ] / [ (P2 * (K2a + K2b)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i2)) ]\n\nThe constants `2 * π * G` cancel out. Since both systems are eclipsing, we assume `sin³(i1) ≈ sin³(i2) ≈ 1`, so these terms also cancel out. The formula simplifies to:\n\nM1 / M2 = (P1 / P2) * [ (K1a + K1b) / (K2a + K2b) ]³\n\nNow, let's plug in the given values:\n\n**System 1:**\n*   P1 = 2 years\n*   K1a + K1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**System 2:**\n*   P2 = 1 year\n*   K2a + K2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nSubstitute these into the simplified ratio formula:\n\nM1 / M2 = (2 / 1) * [ (15) / (25) ]³\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (0.6)³\nM1 / M2 = 2 * 0.216\nM1 / M2 = 0.432\n\nThe factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is approximately 0.432. This means system_1 is actually less massive than system_2. Comparing this result to the given options:\n\nA) ~ 0.7\nB) ~ 0.4\nC) ~ 0.6\nD) ~ 1.2\n\nThe calculated value of 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
