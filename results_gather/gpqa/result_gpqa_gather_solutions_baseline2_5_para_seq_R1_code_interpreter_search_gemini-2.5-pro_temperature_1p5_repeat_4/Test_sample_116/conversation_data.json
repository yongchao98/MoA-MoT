A compound shows optical isomerism if and only if its molecules are **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image cannot be superimposed upon it. The most common test for chirality is to look for the absence of symmetry elements, such as a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n2.  **Analyze Each Compound**:\n    *   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a classic example of **atropisomerism**. The four large groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃) in the positions adjacent to the bond connecting the two rings create severe steric hindrance. This prevents the rings from rotating freely, locking them into a stable, twisted, non-planar shape. This shape lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n        *   *Conclusion*: The molecule is chiral and **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n    *   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four different chemical groups: a hydrogen (-H), a hydroxyl (-OH), a methyl (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₃). An atom bonded to four different substituents is a **chiral center**.\n        *   *Conclusion*: The molecule is chiral and **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n    *   **Compound 3: benzophenone**: The structure is C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅. This is a highly symmetrical molecule. It possesses a **plane of symmetry** that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two identical phenyl rings.\n        *   *Conclusion*: The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. It **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n    *   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**: This is the *trans*-isomer of dimethyl but-2-enedioate. The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. This structure has two key symmetry elements: a **plane of symmetry** (the molecular plane itself) and a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the double bond.\n        *   *Conclusion*: The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral. It **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n3.  **Synthesize Results**: The chemical analysis concludes that only **Compound 1** and **Compound 2** are chiral and therefore exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Unanimous Scientific Consensus**: All provided candidate answers arrive at the exact same conclusion through the same reasoning. They all correctly identify that compounds 1 and 2 are optically active, while 3 and 4 are not. This unanimous agreement on the scientific facts provides very high confidence in the analysis.\n*   **Correct Identification of Chirality Types**: The candidates correctly identified two distinct reasons for chirality: atropisomerism (axial chirality) in compound 1 and a chiral center in compound 2. This shows a deep and accurate understanding of the topic.\n*   **Inconsistency of Final Letter Choice**: The candidate answers selected a variety of final letters (A, B, C, D). This does not indicate confusion about the science but strongly suggests that the multiple-choice options were presented to them in a different order. Therefore, the letter chosen by any single candidate is unreliable. The decision must be based solely on the scientific reasoning, which is unanimous.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe overwhelming consensus based on correct scientific principles is that the compounds showing optical isomerism are **1 and 2**. We must now match this result to the options provided in the question:\n\nA) 2 and 3\nB) 1 and 2\nC) 1, 2 and 4\nD) 3 and 4\n\nThe option that correctly lists compounds 1 and 2 is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nA step-by-step analysis of the problem, considering the provided candidate answers, leads to the following conclusion:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Scientific Principle**\nThe question requires identifying which of the four given compounds can exhibit optical isomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if and only if its molecules are **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image cannot be superimposed upon the original molecule. The most reliable method to determine chirality is to look for the absence of symmetry elements, such as a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Conversely, the presence of such symmetry makes a molecule achiral.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Compound Based on the Consensus of Candidate Answers**\nAll 15 candidate answers are in complete agreement regarding the scientific analysis of each compound. This provides a very high degree of confidence in the following reasoning:\n\n*   **1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\n    All candidates correctly identify that the large, bulky groups in the *ortho* positions cause restricted rotation around the central single bond. This phenomenon, known as **atropisomerism**, locks the molecule into a stable, twisted conformation that lacks a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is **chiral** and shows optical isomerism.\n\n*   **2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    All candidates correctly identify that the carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four distinct chemical groups: -H, -OH, -CH₃, and -COOCH₃. This makes it a **chiral center**. Therefore, the molecule is **chiral** and shows optical isomerism.\n\n*   **3. benzophenone:**\n    All candidates correctly identify this molecule as symmetrical. It possesses a **plane of symmetry** that passes through the C=O bond, making the molecule **achiral**. It does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **4. dimethyl fumarate:**\n    All candidates correctly identify this as the planar *trans*-isomer. It has both a **plane of symmetry** (the molecular plane itself) and a **center of inversion**. This makes the molecule **achiral**, and it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the Analysis and Identify Careful Points**\n\n*   **Scientific Consensus:** There is a unanimous and correct agreement across all 15 candidate answers that compounds **1 and 2** are the only ones that exhibit optical isomerism.\n*   **Discrepancy in Final Letter Choice:** The final letters chosen by the candidates (A, B, C, D) are inconsistent. For example, some candidates labeled \"1 and 2\" as option A, while others labeled it as B, C, or D.\n*   **Conclusion from Discrepancy:** This inconsistency strongly indicates that while the question and chemical reasoning were the same for all candidates, the multiple-choice options were presented in a different or shuffled order. Therefore, the scientific conclusion is reliable, but the final letter choices from the candidates are not.\n\n**Step 4: Final Decision**\nThe final answer must be based on the unambiguous scientific conclusion, which is that compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism. We must match this conclusion to the specific list of options provided in the question.\n\nThe provided options are:\nA) 3 and 4\nB) 2 and 3\nC) 1 and 2\nD) 1, 2 and 4\n\nThe combination \"1 and 2\" corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nBased on the candidate answers, here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct option.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Scientific Principle:** The question requires identifying which compounds exhibit optical isomerism. The fundamental principle, correctly identified by all candidate answers, is that a compound shows optical isomerism if and only if it is **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. The most effective way to check for this is to look for the absence of symmetry elements, such as a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Compound based on Consensus Reasoning:** There is a complete and unanimous consensus in the chemical reasoning across all candidate answers. This provides an extremely high degree of confidence in the scientific analysis.\n\n    *   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n        *   **Consensus Analysis:** All agents correctly identify this as a substituted biphenyl. The four large, bulky groups in the *ortho* positions (adjacent to the bond connecting the rings) cause significant steric hindrance. This prevents the two rings from rotating freely around the central single bond, a phenomenon known as **atropisomerism**. This locks the molecule into a stable, twisted, non-planar conformation.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This twisted structure lacks any key symmetry elements, making the molecule **chiral** and therefore capable of showing optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n        *   **Consensus Analysis:** All agents correctly identify that the carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four different chemical groups: a hydrogen (-H), a hydroxyl (-OH), a methyl (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₃).\n        *   **Conclusion:** This carbon atom is a **chiral center**. The presence of this single chiral center makes the molecule **chiral** and thus shows optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n        *   **Consensus Analysis:** All agents correctly identify this molecule (C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅) as highly symmetrical. It possesses a **plane of symmetry** that can be drawn through the central C=O bond, bisecting the molecule.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule **achiral**. It does not show optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n        *   **Consensus Analysis:** All agents correctly identify this as the *trans*-isomer, which is a planar molecule. This planarity itself creates a **plane of symmetry**. Additionally, the molecule possesses a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the C=C bond.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule **achiral**. It does not show optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Synthesize Results and Final Decision:**\n    The unanimous conclusion from the analysis is that only compounds **1 and 2** are chiral and therefore exhibit optical isomerism. We now match this conclusion to the multiple-choice options provided in the question:\n    A) 2 and 3\n    B) 3 and 4\n    C) 1 and 2\n    D) 1, 2 and 4\n\nThe combination \"1 and 2\" corresponds to option C.\n\n**Careful Points**\n\n*   **Unanimous Scientific Reasoning:** The most crucial observation is the complete agreement across all candidate answers on the scientific analysis. Every agent correctly identified that compounds 1 and 2 are chiral, while 3 and 4 are achiral.\n*   **Correct Identification of Chirality Types:** The agents correctly distinguished between the two different sources of chirality presented in the problem: axial chirality (atropisomerism) in compound 1 and a point chiral center in compound 2.\n*   **Inconsistency in Final Letter Choice:** The candidate answers ended with different letters (A, B, C, or D). This does not indicate a disagreement on the correct answer, but rather confirms that the multiple-choice options were presented in a different, scrambled order to each agent. Their written reasoning consistently points to the same set of compounds {1, 2}.\n*   **Trusting Reasoning over Final Letter:** This highlights the importance of trusting the detailed, consistent reasoning over the final, inconsistent letter choice. The consensus reasoning is the most reliable signal.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, based on the provided candidate answers and fundamental chemical principles.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Scientific Principle**\nThe question asks which compounds exhibit optical isomerism. A compound shows optical isomerism if and only if it is **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable upon the original. The most effective method to determine chirality is to analyze the molecule's structure for sources of chirality (e.g., chiral centers, axial chirality) and for the absence of key symmetry elements, namely a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. The presence of either of these symmetry elements makes a molecule achiral.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Compound**\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a substituted biphenyl. The four bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃) on the positions adjacent to the bond connecting the rings (*ortho*-positions) create significant steric hindrance. This prevents the rings from rotating freely around the central single bond, a phenomenon known as **atropisomerism**. This restricted rotation locks the molecule into a stable, twisted, non-planar conformation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This twisted structure lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Therefore, it is **chiral** and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Analysis:** We check for a chiral center—an atom bonded to four different groups. The carbon at position 2 (in CH₃-**C**H(OH)-COOCH₃) is bonded to four unique groups:\n        1. A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2. A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3. A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4. A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the carbon at position 2 is a chiral center, the molecule is **chiral** and exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Analysis:** The structure (C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅) is highly symmetrical. It has a **plane of symmetry** that can pass through the carbon-oxygen double bond and bisect the molecule into two identical halves.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule **achiral**. It does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Analysis:** The \"fumarate\" designation means this is the *trans*-isomer. The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. This structure possesses two key symmetry elements:\n        1. A plane of symmetry (the molecular plane itself).\n        2. A center of inversion (at the midpoint of the double bond).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Due to the presence of these symmetry elements, the molecule is **achiral** and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize Results and Identify Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Unanimous Scientific Consensus:** The most important observation from the candidate answers is their complete agreement on the chemical reasoning. Every single candidate correctly identified that compounds **1 and 2** are chiral and optically active, while compounds **3 and 4** are achiral and optically inactive. The justifications (atropisomerism, chiral center, symmetry planes) were also unanimously correct. This provides extremely high confidence in the scientific conclusion.\n\n2.  **Discrepancy in Final Letter Choice:** The candidate answers selected a variety of final letters (A, B, C, D). This does not indicate any disagreement about the chemistry. Instead, it is a clear sign that the multiple-choice options were presented to the agents in a scrambled order. Therefore, the letter itself from any individual agent is an unreliable piece of data.\n\n3.  **Final Decision Strategy:** The decision must be based on the unanimous and correct scientific conclusion that only compounds 1 and 2 are optically active. This conclusion must then be matched against the specific options provided in the problem statement.\n\n**Step 4: Match Conclusion to the Provided Options**\nThe analysis concludes that the compounds exhibiting optical isomerism are **1 and 2**. We now check the given options:\n\nA) 1, 2 and 4\nB) 1 and 2\nC) 2 and 3\nD) 3 and 4\n\nThe correct option that matches our conclusion is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis of the question\n\nThe question asks to identify which of the four listed compounds exhibit optical isomerism. A compound shows optical isomerism if and only if its molecules are **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable on the original. The analysis involves examining each molecule for sources of chirality (like chiral centers or axial chirality) or for the presence of symmetry elements (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion) which would make it achiral.\n\n1.  **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Analysis**: This is a substituted biphenyl molecule where the four positions adjacent to the bond connecting the two rings (the *ortho* positions) are occupied by bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃). The significant steric hindrance prevents the rings from rotating freely around the central single bond. This phenomenon is known as **atropisomerism**. It locks the molecule into a stable, twisted, and non-planar conformation.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This twisted structure lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. Therefore, it **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n2.  **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Analysis**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four distinct chemical groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). An atom bonded to four different groups is a **chiral center**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The presence of a chiral center makes the molecule chiral. Therefore, it **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n3.  **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Analysis**: The structure is C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅. This molecule is symmetrical and possesses a **plane of symmetry** that passes through the C=O bond, bisecting the molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral. Therefore, it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n4.  **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Analysis**: This is the *trans*-isomer, which is planar. The molecule has both a **plane of symmetry** (the molecular plane itself) and a **center of inversion** (at the midpoint of the C=C double bond).\n    *   **Conclusion**: The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral. Therefore, it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**Summary**: The analysis shows that only compounds **1 and 2** are chiral and exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n### Careful points based on the candidate answers\n\n1.  **Unanimous Scientific Consensus**: All candidate answers reach the same scientific conclusion. Every single agent correctly identifies that compounds 1 and 2 are optically active (for the right reasons: atropisomerism and a chiral center, respectively), while compounds 3 and 4 are optically inactive due to their molecular symmetry. This provides an extremely high degree of confidence in the chemical analysis.\n\n2.  **Discrepancy in Final Letter Choice**: The final letter answer (A, B, C, or D) varies across the candidates. For example, some answers conclude with 'A', others 'B', 'C', or 'D'. This inconsistency is the most critical observation. It does not reflect a disagreement on the chemistry but strongly suggests that the multiple-choice options were presented in a different, scrambled order to each agent.\n\n3.  **Conclusion Priority**: The unanimous consensus on the *reasoning* is far more reliable than the inconsistent final letter choice. The core conclusion from all candidates is that the correct combination of compounds is \"1 and 2\". The final decision must be based on this scientific fact, not the superficial letter.\n\nMatching the robust conclusion \"1 and 2\" to the options provided in the prompt:\nA) 2 and 3\nB) 3 and 4\nC) 1 and 2\nD) 1, 2 and 4\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo decide the final answer, I will perform a step-by-step analysis of each compound, referencing the consensus reasoning from the candidate answers, and then match the conclusion to the given options.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Scientific Principle**: The question asks to identify which compounds exhibit optical isomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if its molecules are **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. The presence of symmetry elements, such as a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, makes a molecule achiral. Therefore, the task is to identify which molecules lack these key symmetry elements.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Compound**:\n    *   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n        *   **Reasoning:** The consensus among all candidate answers is correct. This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. The large, bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃) on all four positions adjacent to the bond connecting the two rings (*ortho*-positions) create significant steric hindrance. This prevents the two rings from rotating freely around the central single bond, a phenomenon known as **atropisomerism**. This restricted rotation locks the molecule into a stable, twisted, non-planar shape.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This twisted conformation lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Therefore, the molecule is **chiral** and shows optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n        *   **Reasoning:** The consensus among all agents is also correct here. The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four distinct chemical groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). A carbon atom with four different substituents is known as a **chiral center**.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The presence of this single chiral center makes the molecule **chiral** and therefore shows optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n        *   **Reasoning:** All candidates correctly identify this molecule (C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅) as symmetrical. It possesses a **plane of symmetry** that can pass through the C=O bond and bisect the molecule.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is **achiral** and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n        *   **Reasoning:** The term \"fumarate\" specifies the *trans*-isomer. As all candidates noted, this molecule is planar. Due to its structure, it possesses two key symmetry elements: a **plane of symmetry** (the molecular plane itself) and a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule **achiral**, and it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n### Summary and Careful Points\n\n*   **Scientific Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, only **Compound 1** and **Compound 2** are chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n*   **Consensus:** There is a 100% unanimous agreement in the detailed scientific reasoning across all 15 candidate answers. Every agent correctly identifies compounds 1 and 2 as optically active (due to atropisomerism and a chiral center, respectively) and compounds 3 and 4 as optically inactive (due to symmetry). This provides exceptionally high confidence in the chemical analysis.\n*   **Discrepancy in Final Letter Choice:** The candidate answers selected different final letter options (A, B, C, D). A close inspection reveals that this is not due to any disagreement in their scientific conclusions but rather because the multiple-choice options were presented in a shuffled order for each agent. Therefore, the final letter chosen by any single candidate is not a reliable guide. The decision must be based solely on the unanimous scientific conclusion.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe robust and unanimous conclusion from the analysis is that compounds **1 and 2** are the ones that show optical isomerism. I will now match this finding with the options provided in the question:\n\nA) 1 and 2\nB) 3 and 4\nC) 2 and 3\nD) 1, 2 and 4\n\nThe correct choice is the one that lists \"1 and 2\".\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the candidate responses and fundamental chemical principles.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Scientific Principle**\nThe core task is to identify which compounds exhibit optical isomerism. This property is characteristic of **chiral** molecules. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable on the original structure. The most straightforward way to determine this is to analyze the molecule's symmetry. A molecule is achiral (not chiral) if it possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Chirality typically arises from a chiral center or from molecular asymmetry like atropisomerism.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Compound**\n\n*   **1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\n    This molecule is a classic example of **atropisomerism**. The four bulky substituents (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃) on the *ortho* positions (those adjacent to the bond connecting the two rings) create significant steric hindrance. This prevents the two rings from rotating freely, locking them into a stable, twisted, non-planar conformation. This twisted shape is not superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *Conclusion: The molecule is chiral and **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four unique chemical groups: a hydrogen (-H), a hydroxyl (-OH), a methyl (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₃). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a **chiral center**.\n    *Conclusion: The molecule is chiral and **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **3. benzophenone:**\n    The structure is C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅. This is a highly symmetrical molecule. It possesses a **plane of symmetry** that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two identical phenyl rings.\n    *Conclusion: The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral, so it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **4. dimethyl fumarate:**\n    This is the *trans* isomer of the diester of butenedioic acid. Due to the geometry of the double bond, the molecule is planar. It possesses two key symmetry elements: a **plane of symmetry** (the plane of the molecule itself) and a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the C=C bond.\n    *Conclusion: The presence of symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral, so it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize Results and Analyze Candidate Answers**\n\nThe chemical analysis concludes that only compounds **1 and 2** show optical isomerism. This conclusion needs to be checked against the provided candidate answers for consensus.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n1.  **Unanimous Scientific Consensus:** There is a 100% consensus among all 15 candidate answers on the scientific reasoning. Every agent correctly concludes that compound 1 is chiral due to atropisomerism, compound 2 is chiral due to a chiral center, and compounds 3 and 4 are achiral due to possessing symmetry elements. This provides extremely high confidence in the chemical analysis.\n\n2.  **Inconsistent Final Letter:** The final letter choice (A, B, C, D) varies significantly across the candidate answers. However, a careful reading shows that while the letters are different, the justification in every case identifies the set {1, 2} as the correct answer. This strongly indicates that the letter assignments for the options were different for each candidate, making the final letter choice an unreliable signal.\n\n3.  **Relying on Reasoning, Not Letter Choice:** The most reliable signal is the unanimous agreement on the scientific reasoning. The discrepancy in the final letter is a procedural artifact and should be ignored. The decision must be based solely on the correct chemical conclusion.\n\n**Step 4: Final Decision**\nBased on the robust scientific analysis and the unanimous reasoning from all candidates, the correct answer is the option that includes compounds **1 and 2**. We must now match this conclusion to the specific list of options provided in the original question:\n\nA) 2 and 3\nB) 3 and 4\nC) 1 and 2\nD) 1, 2 and 4\n\nThe correct combination, \"1 and 2,\" corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nA step-by-step analysis is performed to determine the correct answer by synthesizing the provided candidate responses and verifying the underlying scientific principles.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Scientific Principle**: The question asks which compounds exhibit optical isomerism. A compound shows optical isomerism if and only if its molecules are **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image cannot be superimposed upon the original molecule. This is determined by looking for sources of chirality (e.g., chiral centers, axial chirality) and for the absence of symmetry elements (a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion). The presence of any such symmetry element renders a molecule achiral.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Compound Based on Consensus Reasoning**: A thorough review of all 15 candidate answers reveals a complete and unanimous consensus on the chemical properties of each molecule. This provides an extremely high degree of confidence in the analysis.\n\n    *   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n        *   **Consensus Reasoning**: All candidates correctly identify that the bulky substituents (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃) at the four *ortho* positions (2, 2', 6, 6') cause severe steric hindrance. This prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the central C-C bond, a phenomenon known as **atropisomerism**. This restricted rotation locks the molecule into a stable, twisted, non-planar shape that lacks any key symmetry elements.\n        *   **Conclusion**: The molecule is **chiral** and shows optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n        *   **Consensus Reasoning**: All candidates correctly analyze the structure (CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃) and identify that the carbon at position 2 is a **chiral center**. It is bonded to four distinct chemical groups: -H, -OH, -CH₃, and -COOCH₃.\n        *   **Conclusion**: The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule **chiral** and shows optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n        *   **Consensus Reasoning**: All candidates correctly recognize the symmetrical structure (C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅). They note that the molecule possesses a **plane of symmetry** which can be passed through the C=O bond, bisecting the molecule.\n        *   **Conclusion**: The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule **achiral**, so it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n        *   **Consensus Reasoning**: All candidates correctly identify this as the *trans*-isomer, which is a planar molecule. This geometry means the molecule has both a **plane of symmetry** (the molecular plane itself) and a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the double bond.\n        *   **Conclusion**: The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule **achiral**, so it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Synthesize Results and Identify Careful Points**\n\n    *   **Scientific Conclusion**: The unanimous and scientifically sound conclusion from all analyses is that only compounds **1 and 2** are chiral and therefore exhibit optical isomerism.\n    *   **Careful Point 1 (Consensus Strength)**: The consensus on the scientific reasoning is absolute across all 15 candidates. This indicates the chemical analysis is straightforward and the conclusion is very reliable.\n    *   **Careful Point 2 (Superficial Discrepancy)**: The final letter choice (A, B, C, D) varies across the candidate answers. However, their detailed explanations consistently identify \"1 and 2\" as the correct set. This is a critical observation that proves the discrepancy is due to the agents being presented with shuffled multiple-choice options, not any disagreement on the chemical facts. The final letter choices of the candidates should be disregarded.\n\n4.  **Final Decision**\n\nBased on the robust, unanimous scientific reasoning, the correct answer is the option that includes compounds 1 and 2. We match this conclusion to the specific list of options provided in the question:\n\n*   A) 1 and 2\n*   B) 1, 2 and 4\n*   C) 3 and 4\n*   D) 2 and 3\n\nThe combination \"1 and 2\" corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nBased on the analysis of the provided answers, here is a step-by-step breakdown and a final decision.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe core task is to identify which of the four given compounds are chiral, as this is the requirement for exhibiting optical isomerism. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable, which means it lacks key symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n1.  **Analyze Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Chemical Principle:** This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. The four bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃) on the positions adjacent to the bond connecting the rings (*ortho* positions) cause severe steric hindrance. This prevents the rings from rotating freely around the central single bond. This phenomenon is called **atropisomerism**, a form of axial chirality.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The restricted rotation locks the molecule into a stable, twisted, non-planar conformation that lacks a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is **chiral** and shows optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Analyze Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Chemical Principle:** This molecule has a potential chiral center. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different chemical groups. The carbon at position 2 is bonded to: 1) a hydrogen atom (-H), 2) a hydroxyl group (-OH), 3) a methyl group (-CH₃), and 4) a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since all four attached groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center, making the entire molecule **chiral**. It shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyze Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Chemical Principle:** The structure, C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅, is highly symmetrical. A **plane of symmetry** can be passed through the C=O bond, bisecting the molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule **achiral**, meaning it cannot show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Analyze Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Chemical Principle:** This is the *trans*-isomer of dimethyl but-2-enedioate. Due to the double bond, the molecule is planar. It possesses two key symmetry elements: a **plane of symmetry** (the molecular plane itself) and a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the double bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule **achiral**, and it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Unanimous Scientific Reasoning:** There is a complete and correct consensus across all 15 candidate answers. Every agent correctly concludes that compounds 1 and 2 are optically active, while compounds 3 and 4 are not. The reasoning provided (atropisomerism for compound 1, a chiral center for compound 2, and symmetry for compounds 3 and 4) is also unanimously consistent. This provides the highest possible confidence in the chemical analysis.\n*   **Inconsistent Final Letter Choice:** The candidate answers provide a variety of final letters (A, B, C, D). This does not indicate confusion about the science but is an artifact of the multiple-choice options being listed in a different, randomized order for each candidate agent.\n*   **Decision Strategy:** The most reliable path to the correct answer is to trust the unanimous scientific reasoning and disregard the inconsistent final letters provided by the candidates. The conclusion that **compounds 1 and 2** are the correct answer is firmly established. This conclusion must then be matched to the options provided in the specific question prompt.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe analysis robustly concludes that only compounds **1 and 2** exhibit optical isomerism. We must select the option from the provided list that contains exactly \"1 and 2\".\n\nA) 1, 2 and 4\nB) 3 and 4\nC) 2 and 3\nD) 1 and 2\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, along with the careful points derived from evaluating the candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe fundamental requirement for a compound to show optical isomerism is that it must be **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image cannot be superimposed upon it. The most common methods to determine this are by looking for the absence of symmetry elements (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion) or the presence of chirality sources (like a chiral center or axial chirality).\n\n1.  **Analyze Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   This is a substituted biphenyl with bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃) at all four positions adjacent to the bond connecting the rings (the *ortho* positions).\n    *   The large size of these groups creates significant steric hindrance, preventing the two rings from rotating freely around the central single bond. This phenomenon is known as **atropisomerism**.\n    *   The restricted rotation locks the molecule into a stable, twisted conformation that is not planar and lacks a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Compound 1 is chiral and will show optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Analyze Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four distinct chemical groups: a hydrogen (-H), a hydroxyl (-OH), a methyl (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₃).\n    *   An atom bonded to four different groups is a **chiral center**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Compound 2 is chiral and will show optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyze Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   The structure is C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅.\n    *   The molecule is highly symmetrical. It has a **plane of symmetry** that can pass through the C=O bond and bisect the molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral. It will not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Analyze Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   \"Fumarate\" indicates the *trans*-isomer. The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond.\n    *   This structure possesses two key symmetry elements: a **plane of symmetry** (the plane of the molecule itself) and a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the double bond.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The presence of symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral. It will not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary of Analysis**: The compounds that show optical isomerism are **1 and 2**.\n\n### Careful Points from Candidate Answer Analysis\n\n1.  **Unanimous Scientific Consensus**: The most crucial finding is that all 15 candidate answers provided the exact same, correct scientific reasoning. They all correctly concluded that compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and show optical isomerism, while compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and do not. This unanimity provides very high confidence in the chemical analysis.\n\n2.  **Superficial Discrepancy in Final Letters**: The candidate answers concluded with different final letter choices (A, B, C, D). However, a careful reading shows that their reasoning always identifies \"1 and 2\" as the correct set. This discrepancy is clearly due to the agents being presented with shuffled multiple-choice options, not any disagreement on the scientific conclusion. The final letter from any individual candidate is therefore unreliable; the scientific consensus is what matters.\n\n3.  **Matching to the Provided Options**: Based on the unwavering scientific consensus, the final answer must be the option that lists compounds 1 and 2. We must refer back to the options provided in the original question:\n    A) 3 and 4\n    B) 2 and 3\n    C) 1 and 2\n    D) 1, 2 and 4\n\nThe correct conclusion that only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, based on a careful evaluation of the candidate responses and fundamental chemical principles.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Scientific Principle:** The question requires identifying which of the four given compounds can exhibit optical isomerism. A compound shows optical isomerism if and only if it is **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. The analysis involves examining each molecule for sources of chirality (such as chiral centers or axial chirality) and for the presence of symmetry elements (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion) that would render it achiral.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Compound:**\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a substituted biphenyl. The four bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃) at the positions adjacent to the bond connecting the rings (*ortho* positions) create significant steric hindrance. This prevents the two rings from rotating freely around the central C-C single bond, a phenomenon known as **atropisomerism**.

The carbon atom at position 2 in the structure CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃ is bonded to four distinct chemical groups: 1) a hydrogen (-H), 2) a hydroxyl group (-OH), 3) a methyl group (-CH₃), and 4) a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The carbon at position 2 is a chiral center, making the molecule chiral.

Every single one concluded that compounds 1 and 2 are optically active (for the right reasons: atropisomerism and a chiral center, respectively), while compounds 3 and 4 are not (due to their symmetry). This provides exceptionally high confidence in the technical analysis.\n\n2.  **Inconsistent Final Letter Choice:** The final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) varies wildly across the candidate answers. This strongly indicates a procedural artifact—that the multiple-choice options were presented in a different order to each agent—rather than a disagreement on the scientific conclusion.\n\n3.  **Reasoning Trumps Letter Choice:** Because the reasoning is unanimous and scientifically sound while the letter choice is inconsistent, the final decision must be based solely on the scientific reasoning. The correct answer is unequivocally the option that includes compounds 1 and 2.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe analysis confirms that the compounds showing optical isomerism are **1 and 2**.

The fundamental requirement for a compound to be optically active is that its molecules must be **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable on the original.

Every agent correctly concludes that compounds **1 and 2** are chiral and optically active, while compounds **3 and 4** are achiral and optically inactive. This provides extremely high confidence in the scientific conclusion.\n2.  **Inconsistent Final Letters:** The candidate answers propose different final letters (A, B, C, D). This discrepancy does not stem from a misunderstanding of the chemistry but rather indicates that the multiple-choice options were presented in a different, randomized order to each agent. Therefore, the final letter chosen by the candidates is unreliable and should be disregarded.\n3.  **Reliability of the Core Conclusion:** The decision should be based exclusively on the unanimous and robust scientific reasoning.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, synthesizing the information from the candidate answers and applying fundamental chemical principles.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe core of the question is to identify which of the given compounds are **chiral**, as this is the necessary condition for a molecule to exhibit optical isomerism. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. The analysis involves examining each compound for sources of chirality (e.g., chiral centers, axial chirality) and the absence of symmetry elements (e.g., a plane of symmetry, a center of inversion).\n\n1.  **Analyze Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Reasoning:** This is a substituted biphenyl compound. All four positions adjacent to the single bond connecting the two rings (the *ortho* positions) are occupied by large, bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃). The significant steric hindrance prevents the rings from rotating freely around this central bond. This phenomenon, known as **atropisomerism**, locks the molecule into a stable, twisted, non-planar conformation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This twisted structure lacks a plane of symmetry, making the molecule chiral. It therefore **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Reasoning:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four chemically distinct groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   **Conclusion:** An atom bonded to four different substituents is a chiral center. The presence of this chiral center makes the molecule chiral, so it **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Reasoning:** The structure is C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅. This is a highly symmetrical molecule. It possesses a **plane of symmetry** that can pass through the C=O bond, bisecting the molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral and therefore **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n4.  **Analyze Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Reasoning:** The term \"fumarate\" specifies the *trans*-isomer, which is a planar molecule. This structure has two key symmetry elements: a **plane of symmetry** (the molecular plane itself) and a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral, so it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n### Summary and Careful Points\n\nThe analysis consistently shows that only **compounds 1 and 2** are chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism. A review of the 15 candidate answers reveals several critical points:\n\n*   **Unanimous Scientific Consensus:** There is a 100% agreement in the scientific reasoning across all candidate answers. Every agent correctly identified that compounds 1 and 2 are optically active (due to atropisomerism and a chiral center, respectively), while compounds 3 and 4 are optically inactive (due to their molecular symmetry). This provides extremely high confidence in the chemical analysis.\n*   **Inconsistent Letter Choices vs. Consistent Content:** The final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) varies across the candidates. However, a careful reading of their justifications shows that the *content* of their answer is always \"1 and 2\". This is a clear indicator that the multiple-choice options were presented in a shuffled order for each candidate, making their final letter choice an unreliable signal.\n*   **Decision Strategy:** The final answer should be based on the robust and unanimous scientific conclusion, which is that \"1 and 2\" is the correct set of compounds. This conclusion must be matched against the specific options provided in the problem statement.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe analysis confirms that the compounds showing optical isomerism are **1 and 2**. Matching this result to the provided options:\n\nA) 3 and 4\nB) 1, 2 and 4\nC) 2 and 3\nD) 1 and 2\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"

The four large groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃) in the positions adjacent to the bond connecting the two rings create severe steric hindrance. This prevents the rings from rotating freely, locking them into a stable, twisted, non-planar shape.

The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four different chemical groups: a hydrogen (-H), a hydroxyl (-OH), a methyl (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₃). An atom bonded to four different substituents is a **chiral center**.\n        *   *Conclusion*: The molecule is chiral and **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n    *   **Compound 3: benzophenone**: The structure is C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅. This is a highly symmetrical molecule. It possesses a **plane of symmetry** that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two identical phenyl rings.\n        *   *Conclusion*: The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.

This structure has two key symmetry elements: a **plane of symmetry** (the molecular plane itself) and a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the double bond.\n        *   *Conclusion*: The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral. It **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n3.  **Synthesize Results**: The chemical analysis concludes that only **Compound 1** and **Compound 2** are chiral and therefore exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Unanimous Scientific Consensus**: All provided candidate answers arrive at the exact same conclusion through the same reasoning. They all correctly identify that compounds 1 and 2 are optically active, while 3 and 4 are not. This unanimous agreement on the scientific facts provides very high confidence in the analysis.\n*   **Correct Identification of Chirality Types**: The candidates correctly identified two distinct reasons for chirality: atropisomerism (axial chirality) in compound 1 and a chiral center in compound 2. This shows a deep and accurate understanding of the topic.\n*   **Inconsistency of Final Letter Choice**: The candidate answers selected a variety of final letters (A, B, C, D). This does not indicate confusion about the science but strongly suggests that the multiple-choice options were presented to them in a different order. Therefore, the letter chosen by any single candidate is unreliable. The decision must be based solely on the scientific reasoning, which is unanimous.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe overwhelming consensus based on correct scientific principles is that the compounds showing optical isomerism are **1 and 2**. We must now match this result to the options provided in the question:\n\nA) 2 and 3\nB) 1 and 2\nC) 1, 2 and 4\nD) 3 and 4\n\nThe option that correctly lists compounds 1 and 2 is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nA step-by-step analysis of the problem, considering the provided candidate answers, leads to the following conclusion:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Scientific Principle**\nThe question requires identifying which of the four given compounds can exhibit optical isomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if and only if its molecules are **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image cannot be superimposed upon the original molecule. The most reliable method to determine chirality is to look for the absence of symmetry elements, such as a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Conversely, the presence of such symmetry makes a molecule achiral.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Compound Based on the Consensus of Candidate Answers**\nAll 15 candidate answers are in complete agreement regarding the scientific analysis of each compound. This provides a very high degree of confidence in the following reasoning:\n\n*   **1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\n    All candidates correctly identify that the large, bulky groups in the *ortho* positions cause restricted rotation around the central single bond. This phenomenon, known as **atropisomerism**, locks the molecule into a stable, twisted conformation that lacks a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is **chiral** and shows optical isomerism.\n\n*   **2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    All candidates correctly identify that the carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four distinct chemical groups: -H, -OH, -CH₃, and -COOCH₃. This makes it a **chiral center**. Therefore, the molecule is **chiral** and shows optical isomerism.\n\n*   **3. benzophenone:**\n    All candidates correctly identify this molecule as symmetrical. It possesses a **plane of symmetry** that passes through the C=O bond, making the molecule **achiral**. It does not show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **4. dimethyl fumarate:**\n    All candidates correctly identify this as the planar *trans*-isomer. It has both a **plane of symmetry** (the molecular plane itself) and a **center of inversion**. This makes the molecule **achiral**, and it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the Analysis and Identify Careful Points**\n\n*   **Scientific Consensus:** There is a unanimous and correct agreement across all 15 candidate answers that compounds **1 and 2** are the only ones that exhibit optical isomerism.\n*   **Discrepancy in Final Letter Choice:** The final letters chosen by the candidates (A, B, C, D) are inconsistent. For example, some candidates labeled \"1 and 2\" as option A, while others labeled it as B, C, or D.\n*   **Conclusion from Discrepancy:** This inconsistency strongly indicates that while the question and chemical reasoning were the same for all candidates, the multiple-choice options were presented in a different or shuffled order. Therefore, the scientific conclusion is reliable, but the final letter choices from the candidates are not.\n\n**Step 4: Final Decision**\nThe final answer must be based on the unambiguous scientific conclusion, which is that compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism. We must match this conclusion to the specific list of options provided in the question.\n\nThe provided options are:\nA) 3 and 4\nB) 2 and 3\nC) 1 and 2\nD) 1, 2 and 4\n\nThe combination \"1 and 2\" corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nBased on the candidate answers, here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct option.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Scientific Principle:** The question requires identifying which compounds exhibit optical isomerism. The fundamental principle, correctly identified by all candidate answers, is that a compound shows optical isomerism if and only if it is **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. The most effective way to check for this is to look for the absence of symmetry elements, such as a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Compound based on Consensus Reasoning:** There is a complete and unanimous consensus in the chemical reasoning across all candidate answers. This provides an extremely high degree of confidence in the scientific analysis.\n\n    *   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n        *   **Consensus Analysis:** All agents correctly identify this as a substituted biphenyl. The four large, bulky groups in the *ortho* positions (adjacent to the bond connecting the rings) cause significant steric hindrance. This prevents the two rings from rotating freely around the central single bond, a phenomenon known as **atropisomerism**. This locks the molecule into a stable, twisted, non-planar conformation.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This twisted structure lacks any key symmetry elements, making the molecule **chiral** and therefore capable of showing optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n        *   **Consensus Analysis:** All agents correctly identify that the carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four different chemical groups: a hydrogen (-H), a hydroxyl (-OH), a methyl (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₃).\n        *   **Conclusion:** This carbon atom is a **chiral center**. The presence of this single chiral center makes the molecule **chiral** and thus shows optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n        *   **Consensus Analysis:** All agents correctly identify this molecule (C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅) as highly symmetrical. It possesses a **plane of symmetry** that can be drawn through the central C=O bond, bisecting the molecule.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule **achiral**. It does not show optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n        *   **Consensus Analysis:** All agents correctly identify this as the *trans*-isomer, which is a planar molecule. This planarity itself creates a **plane of symmetry**. Additionally, the molecule possesses a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the C=C bond.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule **achiral**. It does not show optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Synthesize Results and Final Decision:**\n    The unanimous conclusion from the analysis is that only compounds **1 and 2** are chiral and therefore exhibit optical isomerism.

This does not indicate a disagreement on the correct answer, but rather confirms that the multiple-choice options were presented in a different, scrambled order to each agent. Their written reasoning consistently points to the same set of compounds {1, 2}.\n*   **Trusting Reasoning over Final Letter:** This highlights the importance of trusting the detailed, consistent reasoning over the final, inconsistent letter choice.

A compound shows optical isomerism if and only if it is **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable upon the original. The most effective method to determine chirality is to analyze the molecule's structure for sources of chirality (e.g., chiral centers, axial chirality) and for the absence of key symmetry elements, namely a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.

A compound exhibits optical isomerism if its molecules are **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. The presence of symmetry elements, such as a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, makes a molecule achiral.

This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. The large, bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃) on all four positions adjacent to the bond connecting the two rings (*ortho*-positions) create significant steric hindrance. This prevents the two rings from rotating freely around the central single bond, a phenomenon known as **atropisomerism**. This restricted rotation locks the molecule into a stable, twisted, non-planar shape.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This twisted conformation lacks both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Therefore, the molecule is **chiral** and shows optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n        *   **Reasoning:** The consensus among all agents is also correct here. The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four distinct chemical groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). A carbon atom with four different substituents is known as a **chiral center**.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The presence of this single chiral center makes the molecule **chiral** and therefore shows optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n        *   **Reasoning:** All candidates correctly identify this molecule (C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅) as symmetrical. It possesses a **plane of symmetry** that can pass through the C=O bond and bisect the molecule.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is **achiral** and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n        *   **Reasoning:** The term \"fumarate\" specifies the *trans*-isomer. As all candidates noted, this molecule is planar. Due to its structure, it possesses two key symmetry elements: a **plane of symmetry** (the molecular plane itself) and a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule **achiral**, and it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n### Summary and Careful Points\n\n*   **Scientific Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, only **Compound 1** and **Compound 2** are chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n*   **Consensus:** There is a 100% unanimous agreement in the detailed scientific reasoning across all 15 candidate answers. Every agent correctly identifies compounds 1 and 2 as optically active (due to atropisomerism and a chiral center, respectively) and compounds 3 and 4 as optically inactive (due to symmetry). This provides exceptionally high confidence in the chemical analysis.\n*   **Discrepancy in Final Letter Choice:** The candidate answers selected different final letter options (A, B, C, D). A close inspection reveals that this is not due to any disagreement in their scientific conclusions but rather because the multiple-choice options were presented in a shuffled order for each agent. Therefore, the final letter chosen by any single candidate is not a reliable guide. The decision must be based solely on the unanimous scientific conclusion.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe robust and unanimous conclusion from the analysis is that compounds **1 and 2** are the ones that show optical isomerism. I will now match this finding with the options provided in the question:\n\nA) 1 and 2\nB) 3 and 4\nC) 2 and 3\nD) 1, 2 and 4\n\nThe correct choice is the one that lists \"1 and 2\".\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the candidate responses and fundamental chemical principles.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Scientific Principle**\nThe core task is to identify which compounds exhibit optical isomerism. This property is characteristic of **chiral** molecules. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable on the original structure. The most straightforward way to determine this is to analyze the molecule's symmetry. A molecule is achiral (not chiral) if it possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Chirality typically arises from a chiral center or from molecular asymmetry like atropisomerism.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Compound**\n\n*   **1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\n    This molecule is a classic example of **atropisomerism**. The four bulky substituents (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃) on the *ortho* positions (those adjacent to the bond connecting the two rings) create significant steric hindrance. This prevents the two rings from rotating freely, locking them into a stable, twisted, non-planar conformation. This twisted shape is not superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *Conclusion: The molecule is chiral and **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four unique chemical groups: a hydrogen (-H), a hydroxyl (-OH), a methyl (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₃). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a **chiral center**.\n    *Conclusion: The molecule is chiral and **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **3. benzophenone:**\n    The structure is C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅. This is a highly symmetrical molecule. It possesses a **plane of symmetry** that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two identical phenyl rings.\n    *Conclusion: The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral, so it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **4. dimethyl fumarate:**\n    This is the *trans* isomer of the diester of butenedioic acid. Due to the geometry of the double bond, the molecule is planar. It possesses two key symmetry elements: a **plane of symmetry** (the plane of the molecule itself) and a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the C=C bond.\n    *Conclusion: The presence of symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral, so it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize Results and Analyze Candidate Answers**\n\nThe chemical analysis concludes that only compounds **1 and 2** show optical isomerism. This conclusion needs to be checked against the provided candidate answers for consensus.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n1.  **Unanimous Scientific Consensus:** There is a 100% consensus among all 15 candidate answers on the scientific reasoning. Every agent correctly concludes that compound 1 is chiral due to atropisomerism, compound 2 is chiral due to a chiral center, and compounds 3 and 4 are achiral due to possessing symmetry elements. This provides extremely high confidence in the chemical analysis.\n\n2.  **Inconsistent Final Letter:** The final letter choice (A, B, C, D) varies significantly across the candidate answers. However, a careful reading shows that while the letters are different, the justification in every case identifies the set {1, 2} as the correct answer. This strongly indicates that the letter assignments for the options were different for each candidate, making the final letter choice an unreliable signal.\n\n3.  **Relying on Reasoning, Not Letter Choice:** The most reliable signal is the unanimous agreement on the scientific reasoning. The discrepancy in the final letter is a procedural artifact and should be ignored. The decision must be based solely on the correct chemical conclusion.\n\n**Step 4: Final Decision**\nBased on the robust scientific analysis and the unanimous reasoning from all candidates, the correct answer is the option that includes compounds **1 and 2**. We must now match this conclusion to the specific list of options provided in the original question:\n\nA) 2 and 3\nB) 3 and 4\nC) 1 and 2\nD) 1, 2 and 4\n\nThe correct combination, \"1 and 2,\" corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nA step-by-step analysis is performed to determine the correct answer by synthesizing the provided candidate responses and verifying the underlying scientific principles.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Scientific Principle**: The question asks which compounds exhibit optical isomerism. A compound shows optical isomerism if and only if its molecules are **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image cannot be superimposed upon the original molecule. This is determined by looking for sources of chirality (e.g., chiral centers, axial chirality) and for the absence of symmetry elements (a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion). The presence of any such symmetry element renders a molecule achiral.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Compound Based on Consensus Reasoning**: A thorough review of all 15 candidate answers reveals a complete and unanimous consensus on the chemical properties of each molecule. This provides an extremely high degree of confidence in the analysis.\n\n    *   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n        *   **Consensus Reasoning**: All candidates correctly identify that the bulky substituents (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃) at the four *ortho* positions (2, 2', 6, 6') cause severe steric hindrance. This prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the central C-C bond, a phenomenon known as **atropisomerism**. This restricted rotation locks the molecule into a stable, twisted, non-planar shape that lacks any key symmetry elements.\n        *   **Conclusion**: The molecule is **chiral** and shows optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n        *   **Consensus Reasoning**: All candidates correctly analyze the structure (CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃) and identify that the carbon at position 2 is a **chiral center**. It is bonded to four distinct chemical groups: -H, -OH, -CH₃, and -COOCH₃.\n        *   **Conclusion**: The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule **chiral** and shows optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n        *   **Consensus Reasoning**: All candidates correctly recognize the symmetrical structure (C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅). They note that the molecule possesses a **plane of symmetry** which can be passed through the C=O bond, bisecting the molecule.\n        *   **Conclusion**: The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule **achiral**, so it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n        *   **Consensus Reasoning**: All candidates correctly identify this as the *trans*-isomer, which is a planar molecule. This geometry means the molecule has both a **plane of symmetry** (the molecular plane itself) and a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the double bond.\n        *   **Conclusion**: The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule **achiral**, so it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Synthesize Results and Identify Careful Points**\n\n    *   **Scientific Conclusion**: The unanimous and scientifically sound conclusion from all analyses is that only compounds **1 and 2** are chiral and therefore exhibit optical isomerism.\n    *   **Careful Point 1 (Consensus Strength)**: The consensus on the scientific reasoning is absolute across all 15 candidates. This indicates the chemical analysis is straightforward and the conclusion is very reliable.\n    *   **Careful Point 2 (Superficial Discrepancy)**: The final letter choice (A, B, C, D) varies across the candidate answers. However, their detailed explanations consistently identify \"1 and 2\" as the correct set. This is a critical observation that proves the discrepancy is due to the agents being presented with shuffled multiple-choice options, not any disagreement on the chemical facts. The final letter choices of the candidates should be disregarded.\n\n4.  **Final Decision**\n\nBased on the robust, unanimous scientific reasoning, the correct answer is the option that includes compounds 1 and 2. We match this conclusion to the specific list of options provided in the question:\n\n*   A) 1 and 2\n*   B) 1, 2 and 4\n*   C) 3 and 4\n*   D) 2 and 3\n\nThe combination \"1 and 2\" corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nBased on the analysis of the provided answers, here is a step-by-step breakdown and a final decision.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe core task is to identify which of the four given compounds are chiral, as this is the requirement for exhibiting optical isomerism. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable, which means it lacks key symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n1.  **Analyze Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Chemical Principle:** This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. The four bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃) on the positions adjacent to the bond connecting the rings (*ortho* positions) cause severe steric hindrance. This prevents the rings from rotating freely around the central single bond. This phenomenon is called **atropisomerism**, a form of axial chirality.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The restricted rotation locks the molecule into a stable, twisted, non-planar conformation that lacks a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is **chiral** and shows optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Analyze Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Chemical Principle:** This molecule has a potential chiral center. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different chemical groups. The carbon at position 2 is bonded to: 1) a hydrogen atom (-H), 2) a hydroxyl group (-OH), 3) a methyl group (-CH₃), and 4) a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since all four attached groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center, making the entire molecule **chiral**. It shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyze Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Chemical Principle:** The structure, C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅, is highly symmetrical. A **plane of symmetry** can be passed through the C=O bond, bisecting the molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule **achiral**, meaning it cannot show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Analyze Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Chemical Principle:** This is the *trans*-isomer of dimethyl but-2-enedioate. Due to the double bond, the molecule is planar. It possesses two key symmetry elements: a **plane of symmetry** (the molecular plane itself) and a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the double bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule **achiral**, and it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Unanimous Scientific Reasoning:** There is a complete and correct consensus across all 15 candidate answers. Every agent correctly concludes that compounds 1 and 2 are optically active, while compounds 3 and 4 are not. The reasoning provided (atropisomerism for compound 1, a chiral center for compound 2, and symmetry for compounds 3 and 4) is also unanimously consistent. This provides the highest possible confidence in the chemical analysis.\n*   **Inconsistent Final Letter Choice:** The candidate answers provide a variety of final letters (A, B, C, D). This does not indicate confusion about the science but is an artifact of the multiple-choice options being listed in a different, randomized order for each candidate agent.\n*   **Decision Strategy:** The most reliable path to the correct answer is to trust the unanimous scientific reasoning and disregard the inconsistent final letters provided by the candidates. The conclusion that **compounds 1 and 2** are the correct answer is firmly established. This conclusion must then be matched to the options provided in the specific question prompt.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe analysis robustly concludes that only compounds **1 and 2** exhibit optical isomerism. We must select the option from the provided list that contains exactly \"1 and 2\".\n\nA) 1, 2 and 4\nB) 3 and 4\nC) 2 and 3\nD) 1 and 2\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, along with the careful points derived from evaluating the candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe fundamental requirement for a compound to show optical isomerism is that it must be **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image cannot be superimposed upon it. The most common methods to determine this are by looking for the absence of symmetry elements (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion) or the presence of chirality sources (like a chiral center or axial chirality).\n\n1.  **Analyze Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   This is a substituted biphenyl with bulky groups (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃) at all four positions adjacent to the bond connecting the rings (the *ortho* positions).\n    *   The large size of these groups creates significant steric hindrance, preventing the two rings from rotating freely around the central single bond.

It will not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary of Analysis**: The compounds that show optical isomerism are **1 and 2**.\n\n### Careful Points from Candidate Answer Analysis\n\n1.  **Unanimous Scientific Consensus**: The most crucial finding is that all 15 candidate answers provided the exact same, correct scientific reasoning. They all correctly concluded that compounds 1 and 2 are chiral and show optical isomerism, while compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and do not. This unanimity provides very high confidence in the chemical analysis.\n\n2.  **Superficial Discrepancy in Final Letters**: The candidate answers concluded with different final letter choices (A, B, C, D). However, a careful reading shows that their reasoning always identifies \"1 and 2\" as the correct set. This discrepancy is clearly due to the agents being presented with shuffled multiple-choice options, not any disagreement on the scientific conclusion. The final letter from any individual candidate is therefore unreliable; the scientific consensus is what matters.\n\n3.  **Matching to the Provided Options**: Based on the unwavering scientific consensus, the final answer must be the option that lists compounds 1 and 2. We must refer back to the options provided in the original question:\n    A) 3 and 4\n    B) 2 and 3\n    C) 1 and 2\n    D) 1, 2 and 4\n\nThe correct conclusion that only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, based on a careful evaluation of the candidate responses and fundamental chemical principles.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1.

Every single one concluded that compounds 1 and 2 are optically active (for the right reasons: atropisomerism and a chiral center, respectively), while compounds 3 and 4 are not (due to their symmetry). This provides exceptionally high confidence in the technical analysis.\n\n2.  **Inconsistent Final Letter Choice:** The final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) varies wildly across the candidate answers. This strongly indicates a procedural artifact—that the multiple-choice options were presented in a different order to each agent—rather than a disagreement on the scientific conclusion.\n\n3.  **Reasoning Trumps Letter Choice:** Because the reasoning is unanimous and scientifically sound while the letter choice is inconsistent, the final decision must be based solely on the scientific reasoning.

The four groups at the positions adjacent to the bond connecting the rings (the *ortho* positions) are large and bulky (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃). The significant steric hindrance prevents the two rings from rotating freely around the central single bond. This phenomenon is known as **atropisomerism** and is a form of axial chirality.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The locked, twisted, non-planar structure lacks a plane of symmetry, making the molecule chiral. It **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n2.  **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Analysis**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four distinct chemical groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). An atom bonded to four different groups is a **chiral center**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The presence of this chiral center makes the molecule chiral. It **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n3.  **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Analysis**: The structure is C₆H₅-CO-C₆H₅. This is a highly symmetrical molecule. It possesses a **plane of symmetry** that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral. It **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n4.  **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Analysis**: This is the *trans*-isomer, which has a planar structure due to the C=C double bond. This geometry means the molecule has both a **plane of symmetry** (the molecular plane itself) and a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the double bond.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral. It **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Unanimous Scientific Consensus**: The most crucial observation is the complete and unanimous agreement across all 15 candidate answers on the scientific reasoning. Every agent correctly concluded that compounds **1 and 2** are chiral and exhibit optical isomerism, while compounds **3 and 4** are achiral and do not.\n*   **Correct Identification of Chirality Types**: The candidates correctly identified two different sources of chirality: axial chirality (atropisomerism) in compound 1 and a central chiral atom in compound 2. This shows a robust understanding of the topic.\n*   **Discrepancy in Final Letter Choice**: The candidate answers selected a variety of final letters (A, B, C, D). However, their detailed explanations consistently pointed to \"1 and 2\" as the correct answer. This discrepancy is a clear artifact of the multiple-choice options being shuffled for each agent, and it does not reflect any error in their chemical analysis. The decision must be based on the unanimous scientific conclusion, not the inconsistent letters.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe consistent and correct analysis from all sources concludes that compounds **1 and 2** are the only ones that show optical isomerism. This result must be matched to the options provided in the question:\n\nA) 1, 2 and 4\nB) 3 and 4\nC) 1 and 2\nD) 2 and 3\n\nThe option that correctly lists compounds 1 and 2 is **C**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, based on a careful evaluation of the provided candidate responses.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Core Scientific Question**\nThe question asks to identify which of the four chemical compounds can exhibit optical isomerism. The fundamental principle is that a compound exhibits optical isomerism if and only if it is **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if its mirror image is non-superimposable. The analysis requires examining each molecule for sources of chirality (such as chiral centers or axial chirality) and, conversely, for the presence of symmetry elements (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion) that would render it achiral.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Reasoning of the Candidate Answers**\nThere is a complete and unanimous consensus in the chemical reasoning across all 15 candidate answers. This provides a very high degree of confidence in the scientific analysis. The consensus reasoning for each compound is as follows:\n\n*   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Consensus:** All candidates correctly identify that the large, bulky groups on the *ortho*-positions cause significant steric hindrance. This prevents free rotation around the central bond, a phenomenon known as **atropisomerism**. This locks the molecule into a stable, twisted, non-planar conformation which lacks symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is **chiral** and therefore **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Consensus:** All candidates correctly identify that the carbon atom at position 2 is a **chiral center**. It is bonded to four distinct chemical groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of this chiral center makes the molecule **chiral** and therefore it **shows optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n    *   **Consensus:** All candidates correctly recognize that this molecule is highly symmetrical. It possesses a **plane of symmetry** that passes through the central C=O bond, bisecting the molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule **achiral**, so it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Consensus:** All candidates correctly identify this as the *trans*-isomer, which is a planar molecule. This geometry means it has a **plane of symmetry** (the molecular plane itself) and also a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the double bond.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule **achiral**, so it **does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Unanimous Scientific Conclusion:** The most crucial observation is that the scientific logic presented by all 15 candidate agents is identical and correct. They all unanimously agree that compounds **1 and 2** are chiral (and optically active), while compounds **3 and 4** are achiral (and optically inactive).\n2.  **Inconsistent Final Letter Choices:** The final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) varies significantly across the candidate answers. This strongly indicates that the multiple-choice options were presented in a different, randomized order to each agent.\n3.  **Reliability of Reasoning vs. Final Letter:** The discrepancy in the final letter choices should be considered a procedural artifact. The final decision should be based solely on the overwhelmingly consistent and correct scientific reasoning, not the inconsistent final letters from the agents.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe unanimous and correct scientific analysis concludes that only compounds **1 and 2** exhibit optical isomerism. We now match this firm conclusion to the specific list of options provided in the question:\n\nA) 1 and 2\nB) 2 and 3\nC) 1, 2 and 4\nD) 3 and 4\n\nThe combination \"1 and 2\" corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
