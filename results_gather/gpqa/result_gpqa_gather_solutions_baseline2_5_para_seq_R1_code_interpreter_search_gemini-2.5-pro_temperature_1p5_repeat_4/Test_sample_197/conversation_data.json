This indicates that the multiple-choice options were presented in a different order to each agent, but the underlying calculation and result are not in dispute. The unanimous agreement on the numerical result provides extremely high confidence.\n\nThe task is to perform a definitive calculation and match the result to the specific list of options presented in the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n**1. Identify the Goal**\nThe question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total amount of all cobalt-containing species in the solution. This value is the mole fraction of the species, `α₂`, expressed as a percentage.\n\n**2. State the Governing Formula**\nThe mole fraction of a complex `[MLₙ]` in solution is determined by the free ligand concentration `[L]` and the overall stability constants `β`. The general formula is:\n\n`αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)`\n\nFor our specific complex of interest, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, where n=2, the formula is:\n\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**3. Perform the Calculation**\nWe substitute the given values into the formula:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator, which corresponds to the species of interest, `[Co(SCN)₂]`:\n*   **Numerator** = `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\nNext, calculate the denominator, which is the sum of the terms for *all* possible cobalt species:\n*   Term for free Co²⁺ (i=0, β₀=1): **1**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (i=1): `β₁[SCN⁻]¹` = 9 × (0.1)¹ = **0.9**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (i=2): `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 × (0.1)² = **0.4**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (i=3): `β₃[SCN⁻]³` = 63 × (0.1)³ = **0.063**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (i=4): `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴` = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = **0.0016**\n\nSumming these terms gives the total for the denominator:\n*   **Denominator** = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\nFinally, calculate the mole fraction `α₂` and convert it to a percentage:\n*   `α₂` = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n*   **Percentage** = `α₂` × 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Free vs. Total Ligand Concentration**: The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration, `[SCN⁻]`. We are given the *total* concentration of 0.1 M. Since the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is ten times greater than the total metal concentration (`c(Co) = 10⁻² M` or 0.01 M), the ligand is in large excess. It is a standard and valid approximation in coordination chemistry to assume the free ligand concentration is equal to the total ligand concentration.\n2.  **The '1' in the Denominator**: It is crucial to include the '1' term in the denominator. This term represents the fraction of cobalt that exists as the free (uncomplexed) `Co²⁺` ion, for which β₀ is defined as 1. Forgetting this term is a common error that would lead to an incorrect result.\n3.  **The Role of Total Cobalt Concentration**: The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is not needed directly to calculate the *relative percentage* or mole fraction, as the free metal concentration cancels out in the derivation of the formula. However, it is essential information needed to justify the assumption about the ligand concentration (Point 1).\n4.  **Overall vs. Stepwise Constants**: The problem correctly provides overall stability constants (`βₙ`), which are the appropriate constants for this formula. If stepwise formation constants (`Kₙ`) were given, they would need to be converted to overall constants (`βₙ = K₁ × K₂ × ... × Kₙ`) before use.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe calculation robustly and unambiguously shows that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is **16.9%**. This result is supported by a unanimous consensus among all 15 candidate answers. We now match this value to the options provided in the question:\n\nA) 25.6%\nB) 38.1%\nC) 16.9%\nD) 42.3%\n\nThe calculated percentage matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers and a step-by-step verification of the chemical calculation, a definitive answer can be determined.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Goal**: The core task is to calculate the percentage of one specific cobalt species, `[Co(SCN)₂]` (dithiocyanato cobalt(II)), relative to the total amount of all cobalt-containing species in the solution. This is known as the mole fraction of the species, expressed as a percentage.\n\n2.  **Identify the Governing Formula**: In coordination chemistry, the distribution of complexes in equilibrium is governed by the free ligand concentration and the overall stability constants (β). The mole fraction (αₙ) of a specific complex with 'n' ligands (`[MLₙ]`) is calculated as:\n    `αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)`\n    For our target complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, we need to find `α₂`:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n3.  **Analyze Candidate Answers**: A review of all 15 candidate answers reveals a complete and unanimous agreement on both the scientific method and the final numerical result.\n    *   **Consensus on Method**: Every agent correctly identified the formula above as the correct approach.\n    *   **Consensus on Calculation**: Every agent, through their step-by-step work, arrived at the same numerical value of approximately **16.9%**.\n    *   **Source of Discrepancy**: The only difference in the provided answers is the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D). This indicates that the multiple-choice options were presented in a different order to each agent. This is a clerical discrepancy, not a scientific one. The overwhelming consensus on the numerical result gives very high confidence in its accuracy.\n\n4.  **Perform Verification Calculation**: To ensure correctness and match the answer to the provided options, we will perform the calculation.\n\n    *   **Values**:\n        *   Stability Constants: β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16\n        *   Ligand Concentration `[SCN⁻]` ≈ 0.1 M (See Careful Point 1 below)\n\n    *   **Calculate the Numerator** (the term for `[Co(SCN)₂]`):\n        Numerator = `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n    *   **Calculate the Denominator** (the sum of terms for all cobalt species):\n        *   Term for `Co²⁺` (free ion): **1**\n        *   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`: `β₁[SCN⁻]¹` = 9 × 0.1 = **0.9**\n        *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]`: `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 × 0.1² = **0.4**\n        *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`: `β₃[SCN⁻]³` = 63 × 0.1³ = **0.063**\n        *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`: `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴` = 16 × 0.1⁴ = **0.0016**\n\n        Total Denominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016` = **2.3646**\n\n    *   **Calculate Mole Fraction and Percentage**:\n        `α₂` = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n        Percentage = `α₂` × 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Free vs. Total Ligand Concentration**. The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium. We are given the *total* concentration of 0.1 M. Since the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is ten times greater than the total metal concentration (10⁻² M), the amount of ligand bound in complexes is small compared to the total. Therefore, it is a standard and valid chemical approximation to assume the free ligand concentration is equal to the total concentration (`[SCN⁻]` ≈ 0.1 M).\n*   **Careful Point 2: The \"1\" in the Denominator**. It is crucial to include the '1' term in the denominator. This term represents the fraction of the metal that remains as the free ion (`Co²⁺`), for which β₀ is defined as 1. Forgetting it is a common error that would lead to an incorrect result.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Irrelevance of Total Metal Concentration**. The value of `c(Co) = 10⁻² M` is not directly used to calculate the relative percentage (mole fraction). Its main purpose is to justify the assumption made in Careful Point 1.\n*   **Careful Point 4: Overall vs. Stepwise Constants**. The problem provides overall stability constants (`βₙ`), which are the correct constants for this formula. If stepwise formation constants (`Kₙ`) had been given, they would need to be converted first (e.g., β₂ = K₁ × K₂).\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe calculation robustly shows that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is **16.9%**.

This is a calculation of the mole fraction (`α₂`) of this specific species, expressed as a percentage.\n\n2.  **Determine the Correct Formula:** The distribution of metal complexes in an equilibrium system is governed by the free ligand concentration and the overall stability constants (β). The mole fraction of a complex with 'n' ligands (`[MLₙ]`) is calculated using the following general formula:\n\n    αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)\n\n    For the specific complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, we need to calculate `α₂` (where n=2):\n\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation:** We substitute the values provided in the question into the formula.\n    *   Given values: `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`; β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16.\n\n    *   **Numerator Calculation**: This term corresponds to the complex of interest, `[Co(SCN)₂]`.\n        Numerator = β₂ × [SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n    *   **Denominator Calculation**: This is the sum of terms representing *all* possible cobalt species in the solution.\n        *   Term for free Co²⁺ (where i=0, β₀=1): **1**\n        *   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺` (i=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × 0.1 = **0.9**\n        *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]` (i=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = **0.4**\n        *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻` (i=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = **0.063**\n        *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻` (i=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = **0.0016**\n        \n        The total value of the denominator is the sum of these terms:\n        Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n    *   **Mole Fraction (`α₂`) and Percentage Calculation**:\n        α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n        Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n### Analysis of Candidate Answers & Careful Points\n\n*   **Consensus:** All 15 candidate answers show unanimous agreement on the calculation methodology and the final numerical result of **16.9%**. This provides extremely high confidence in the correctness of the calculation. The discrepancies in their final letter choices (A, B, C, D) are merely clerical errors due to receiving the options in a different order.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Ligand Concentration:** The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration. It is a critical and valid assumption that since the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is in large excess compared to the total metal concentration (0.01 M), the free ligand concentration can be approximated as being equal to the total ligand concentration (`[SCN⁻]` ≈ 0.1 M).\n*   **Careful Point 2: Denominator Integrity:** It is crucial to include the term '1' in the denominator. This term represents the fraction of free `Co²⁺` ions and is essential for normalizing the distribution correctly. Omitting it is a common error in these types of problems.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Irrelevant Information:** The total cobalt concentration (`c(Co) = 10⁻² M`) is not used directly in the mole fraction calculation. Its role is to justify the assumption made in Careful Point 1.\n*   **Careful Point 4: Final Matching:** The calculated numerical value must be carefully matched to the list of options provided in *this* specific problem.\n\nThe calculation definitively shows the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is **16.9%**.

A step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating insights and checks from the provided candidate answers, leads to a definitive conclusion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Goal Identification**\nThe objective is to find the percentage of cobalt that exists in the form of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution. This is calculated by finding the mole fraction (`α₂`) of this species and expressing it as a percentage.\n\n**2. The Governing Formula**\nThe mole fraction of a metal complex `[MLₙ]` in solution is determined by the free ligand concentration `[L]` and the overall stability constants (`β`). The general formula is:\n\nαₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)\n\nFor our target species, `[Co(SCN)₂]` (where n=2), the formula becomes:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**3. Careful Points and Assumptions**\nA careful analysis, reinforced by the consensus among the candidate answers, highlights several key points:\n*   **Ligand Concentration:** The formula uses the *free* (unbound) ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`. We are given the *total* concentration of 0.1 M. Because the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is in large excess compared to the total metal concentration (10⁻² M or 0.01 M), the amount of ligand bound in complexes is negligible compared to the total. Therefore, it is a standard and valid approximation to assume the free ligand concentration is equal to its total concentration: **[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M**.\n*   **The \"1\" in the Denominator:** This term is crucial as it represents the population of free `Co²⁺` ions (for which `β₀` is defined as 1). The denominator must represent the sum of *all* cobalt-containing species.\n*   **Role of Total Metal Concentration:** The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, is not directly used in the mole fraction formula itself. Its primary purpose is to justify the assumption about the ligand concentration mentioned above.\n*   **Consensus from Candidate Answers:** All 15 candidate answers, despite choosing different final letters due to varying option orders, unanimously arrived at the same numerical result of **~16.9%**. This provides extremely high confidence in the calculation itself.\n\n**4. Calculation**\nWe substitute the given values into the formula:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator for the species of interest, `[Co(SCN)₂]`:\n*   **Numerator** = `β₂ × [SCN⁻]²` = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\nNext, calculate the denominator, which is the sum of terms for all species:\n*   **Denominator** = 1 (for Co²⁺) + (β₁[SCN⁻]¹) + (β₂[SCN⁻]²) + (β₃[SCN⁻]³) + (β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n*   Denominator = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.1²) + (63 × 0.1³) + (16 × 0.1⁴)\n*   Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\n*   **Denominator** = **2.3646**\n\nFinally, calculate the mole fraction `α₂` and convert to a percentage:\n*   `α₂` = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n*   **Percentage** = `α₂` × 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n**5.

This must be matched to the specific options provided in the question:\n\nA) 38.1%\nB) 25.6%\nC) 16.9%\nD) 42.3%\n\nThe calculated value of 16.9% corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating a review of the candidate answers and identifying all the careful points required to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\nThe goal is to calculate the percentage of one specific species, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) or `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution. This is a problem of finding the mole fraction (`α`) of a species in a complexation equilibrium.\n\n**2. Analyze the Candidate Answers**\nA review of all 15 candidate answers reveals two key findings:\n*   **Unanimous Calculation:** Every single candidate agent used the correct formula and arrived at the same numerical result of **~16.9%**. This provides extremely high confidence that the mathematical procedure is correct.\n*   **Source of Discrepancy:** The final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) varies among the candidates. This is because each agent was presented with a different, randomized ordering of the multiple-choice options. The core scientific conclusion is not in dispute.\n\n**3. Identify the Governing Principle and Formula**\nThe mole fraction of a complex `[MLₙ]` in a solution depends on the free ligand concentration `[L]` and the overall stability constants `β`. The general formula is:\n`αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)`\nFor our target species `[Co(SCN)₂]`, where n=2, the formula is:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\nWe substitute the given values into the formula:\n*   Given values: `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`, `β₁ = 9`, `β₂ = 40`, `β₃ = 63`, `β₄ = 16`.\n\n*   **Calculate the Numerator** (the term corresponding to the species of interest, `[Co(SCN)₂]`):\n    Numerator = `β₂ × [SCN⁻]²` = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n*   **Calculate the Denominator** (the sum of terms for *all* possible cobalt species):\n    *   Term for free Co²⁺ (n=0): **1**\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺` (n=1): `β₁[SCN⁻]¹` = 9 × 0.1 = **0.9**\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]` (n=2): `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 × 0.1² = **0.4**\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻` (n=3): `β₃[SCN⁻]³` = 63 × 0.1³ = **0.063**\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻` (n=4): `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴` = 16 × 0.1⁴ = **0.0016**\n\n*   **Sum of Denominator**: `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016` = **2.3646**\n\n*   **Calculate the Mole Fraction (α₂) and Percentage**:\n    `α₂` = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n    Percentage = `α₂` × 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Free vs. Total Ligand Concentration:** The formula uses the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium `[SCN⁻]`. We are given the *total* concentration of 0.1 M. Because the total ligand concentration is ten times greater than the total metal concentration (`0.1 M` vs. `10⁻² M`), the ligand is in large excess. It is a standard and valid assumption to approximate the free ligand concentration as being equal to its total concentration (`[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`). The total cobalt concentration value is mainly used to justify this key assumption.\n\n2.  **Completeness of the Denominator:** It is a common error in this type of calculation to forget the `1` in the denominator. This term represents the fraction of the metal that remains as the free `Co²⁺` ion (for which β₀ is defined as 1) and is crucial for accurately representing the sum of *all* cobalt-containing species.\n\n3.  **Overall vs. Stepwise Stability Constants:** The problem provides overall stability constants (`β`), which are the correct constants to use directly in the mole fraction formula. If stepwise constants (`K`) had been provided, they would have needed to be converted first (`β₂ = K₁ × K₂`, etc.).\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe calculation robustly and unambiguously shows that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is **16.9%**. This result is confirmed by the unanimous calculations across all candidate answers. Matching this numerical value to the options provided in the question:\n\nA) 16.9%\nB) 42.3%\nC) 25.6%\nD) 38.1%\n\nThe calculated value of 16.9% corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis is a quantitative analysis problem in coordination chemistry.

The mole fraction (αₙ) of a specific complex with 'n' ligands (`[MLₙ]`) is calculated using the formula:\n    \n    αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)\n    \n    For the target species, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, we need to calculate `α₂`:\n    \n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation**: We substitute the given values into the formula.\n    *   **Given values**: `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`, `β₁ = 9`, `β₂ = 40`, `β₃ = 63`, `β₄ = 16`.\n\n    *   **Calculate the Numerator**: This term corresponds to the `[Co(SCN)₂]` species.\n        Numerator = β₂ × [SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n    *   **Calculate the Denominator**: This is the sum of terms for all possible cobalt-containing species.\n        *   Term for free Co²⁺ (where β₀=1): **1**\n        *   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`: β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × 0.1 = **0.9**\n        *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]`: β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × 0.1² = **0.4**\n        *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`: β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × 0.1³ = **0.063**\n        *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`: β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × 0.1⁴ = **0.0016**\n        \n        The sum of these terms gives the denominator:\n        Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n    *   **Calculate the Mole Fraction (`α₂`) and Percentage**:\n        α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n        Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Free vs. Total Ligand Concentration**: The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium, `[SCN⁻]`. The problem provides the *total* concentration of 0.1 M. Because the total ligand concentration is in large excess compared to the total metal concentration (0.1 M >> 0.01 M), it is a standard and valid chemical approximation to assume the free ligand concentration is equal to its total concentration. Therefore, `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`.\n\n2.  **Inclusion of the Free Metal Ion**: It is crucial that the denominator includes the term '1', which represents the fraction of cobalt that remains as the free, uncomplexed `Co²⁺` ion (for which β₀ is defined as 1). Forgetting this term is a common error and would lead to an incorrect answer.\n\n3.  **Role of Total Metal Concentration**: The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, is not used directly in the mole fraction calculation itself. Its primary role is to justify the assumption about the ligand concentration discussed in the first point.\n\n4.  **Consensus of Candidate Answers**: A review of all candidate answers shows a unanimous agreement on the calculation method and the final numerical result of 16.9%. The only discrepancies were in the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D), which indicates the options were presented in a different random order to each agent. This overwhelming consensus provides very high confidence in the numerical result.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe step-by-step calculation robustly shows that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is **16.9%**. Matching this correct numerical result to the specific list of options provided in the question:\n\nA) 16.9%\nB) 38.1%\nC) 25.6%\nD) 42.3%\n\nThe calculated value corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Analysis of the Chemical Problem\n\n**1. Identify the Goal**\nThe question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total amount of all cobalt-containing species in the solution. This requires calculating the mole fraction (`α₂`) of this species and expressing it as a percentage.\n\n**2. State the Governing Formula**\nThe mole fraction of a complex `[MLₙ]` in a solution at equilibrium is calculated using the overall stability constants (`β`) and the concentration of the free ligand (`[L]`). The formula is:\n`αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)`\nwhere the denominator sums the terms for all species in the solution, including the free metal ion (represented by the '1' term, where `β₀`=1).\n\nFor the specific complex of interest, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, we need to calculate `α₂`:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**3. Perform the Calculation**\nThe previous Python script execution yielded the following results:\n*   Numerator (`β₂[SCN⁻]²`): ~0.4\n*   Denominator (Sum of all species terms): 2.3646\n*   Calculated percentage: 16.916180326482287%\n\nRounding the result to one decimal place gives **16.9%**. This confirms the numerical result obtained by all candidate answers.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Free vs. Total Ligand Concentration**: The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium `[SCN⁻]`. We are given the *total* concentration of 0.1 M. Since the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is ten times higher than the total metal concentration (`c(Co) = 10⁻² M`), the ligand is in large excess. It is a standard and valid chemical approximation to assume the free ligand concentration is equal to the total concentration (`[SCN⁻]` ≈ 0.1 M).\n\n2.  **The \"1\" in the Denominator**: It is crucial to include the '1' term in the denominator. This term represents the fraction of the metal that remains as the free ion (`Co²⁺`), for which the stability constant `β₀` is defined as 1. Forgetting this term is a common mistake that would lead to an incorrect answer.\n\n3.  **Irrelevance of Total Metal Concentration for the Calculation**: The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, is not directly used in the mole fraction calculation. The mole fraction is a relative percentage, and the free metal ion concentration `[Co²⁺]` cancels out from the numerator and denominator during the formula's derivation. The value of `c(Co)` is primarily useful for justifying the ligand concentration assumption mentioned in point 1.\n\n4.  **Unanimity of Candidate Calculations**: A review of all candidate answers shows they all correctly identified the formula and unanimously arrived at the same numerical result of **16.9%**. The only discrepancies were in which letter (A, B, C, or D) this value corresponded to, which confirms that the multiple-choice options were scrambled for each agent. This consensus provides very high confidence in the calculated result.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe step-by-step analysis and the executed code both robustly show that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately **16.9%**.\n\nMatching this result to the multiple-choice options provided in the question:\nA) 16.9%\nB) 38.1%\nC) 42.3%\nD) 25.6%\n\nThe calculated value corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis is a quantitative problem in coordination chemistry.

Objective**: The goal is to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species. This is achieved by finding the mole fraction of this species, denoted `α₂`, and converting it to a percentage.\n\n**2. Governing Principle and Formula**: The distribution of metal complexes in solution is governed by the equilibrium concentrations of the free ligand and the overall stability constants (β) of each complex. The mole fraction `αₙ` of a complex `[MLₙ]` is given by the formula:\n\n`αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)`\n\nFor the specific target complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]` (where n=2), the formula is:\n\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**3. Calculation**: The calculation proceeds by substituting the given values into the formula. The code execution has confirmed the manual calculations:\n*   **Numerator**: `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 * (0.1)² = **0.4**\n*   **Denominator**: `1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴) = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016` = **2.3646**\n*   **Mole Fraction `α₂`**: `0.4 / 2.3646` ≈ 0.16916\n*   **Percentage**: The code output shows `16.916...%`, which rounds to **16.9%**.\n\n**4.

The only inconsistencies were in the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D), indicating that the options were presented in a different order to each agent. This consensus provides very high confidence in the numerical result.\n*   **Free vs. Total Ligand Concentration**: The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration, `[SCN⁻]`.

If stepwise constants (`Kₙ`) had been given, they would have needed to be converted first.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating careful points and leading to a definitive final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Goal**\nThe question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species. This is the mole fraction of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` species, denoted as `α₂`, expressed as a percentage.\n\n**2. State the Governing Formula**\nThe mole fraction of a complex `[MLₙ]` in a solution is determined by the overall stability constants (β) and the free ligand concentration `[L]`. The general formula is:\n`αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)`\nFor our target species, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, where n=2, the formula becomes:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**3. Perform the Calculation**\nWe use the values provided in the question:\n*   [SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M (See Careful Point 1 below)\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator term, which represents the species of interest `[Co(SCN)₂]`:\n*   **Numerator** = `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\nNext, calculate the denominator, which is the sum of terms for all possible cobalt species:\n*   Term for `Co²⁺` (free ion): **1**\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`: `β₁[SCN⁻]¹` = 9 × (0.1)¹ = **0.9**\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]`: `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 × (0.1)² = **0.4**\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`: `β₃[SCN⁻]³` = 63 × (0.1)³ = **0.063**\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`: `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴` = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = **0.0016**\n\nSumming these terms gives the denominator:\n*   **Denominator** = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\nFinally, calculate the mole fraction `α₂` and convert it to a percentage:\n*   `α₂` = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n*   **Percentage** = `α₂` × 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\nThis result is unanimously confirmed by all 15 candidate answers.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Free vs. Total Ligand Concentration**: The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration, `[SCN⁻]free`. The problem provides the *total* concentration, `[SCN⁻]total` = 0.1 M. A crucial and valid assumption is made that `[SCN⁻]free ≈ [SCN⁻]total`. This is justified because the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is in 10-fold excess compared to the total metal concentration (c(Co) = 0.01 M), meaning only a small fraction of the ligand is bound to cobalt.\n2.  **Completeness of the Denominator**: The denominator represents the sum of the relative concentrations of *all* cobalt-containing species. It is essential to include the **'1'** term, which represents the free `Co²⁺` ion (for which β₀ is defined as 1). Forgetting this term is a common mistake that leads to an incorrect answer.\n3.  **Role of Total Metal Concentration**: The value `c(Co) = 10⁻² M` is not directly used in the final calculation for the mole fraction (a relative percentage). Its main purpose is to justify the assumption regarding the ligand concentration.\n4.  **Overall vs. Stepwise Stability Constants**: The problem provides overall stability constants (`βₙ`), which are the correct constants to use in the mole fraction formula. If stepwise constants (`Kₙ`) had been provided, they would need to be converted first.\n5.  **Analyzing the Candidate Answers**: The candidate answers show a universal agreement on the numerical result (16.9%), while disagreeing on the corresponding letter (A, B, C, or D). This indicates that the multiple-choice options were randomized for each candidate. The correct approach is to ignore the letters from the candidates and match the independently verified numerical result to the option list in the original question.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe step-by-step calculation robustly shows the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex to be **16.9%**.

This is equivalent to calculating the mole fraction (`α₂`) of this species and expressing it as a percentage.\n\n2.  **Determine the Correct Formula**: The distribution of metal complexes in a solution is described by the mole fraction formula, which uses overall stability constants (`βₙ`) and the free ligand concentration `[L]`. The mole fraction `αₙ` for a complex `[MLₙ]` is:\n    `αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)`\n    The sum `Σ` in the denominator runs over all complexed species (i=1 to 4), and the `1` term represents the free metal ion (`Co²⁺`), for which β₀ = 1.\n    For the specific complex `[Co(SCN)₂]` (n=2), the formula is:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation**: We substitute the given values into the formula.\n    *   **Given values**: `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M; β₁ = 9; β₂ = 40; β₃ = 63; β₄ = 16.\n\n    *   **Calculate the Numerator**: This term corresponds to the `[Co(SCN)₂]` species.\n        Numerator = `β₂ × [SCN⁻]²` = `40 × (0.1)²` = `40 × 0.01` = **0.4**\n\n    *   **Calculate the Denominator**: This is the sum of terms for all five possible cobalt species (`Co²⁺`, `[Co(SCN)]⁺`, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`, `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`).\n        Denominator = `1` (for free Co²⁺) + (`β₁[SCN⁻]¹`) + (`β₂[SCN⁻]²`) + (`β₃[SCN⁻]³`) + (`β₄[SCN⁻]⁴`)\n        Denominator = `1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.01) + (63 × 0.001) + (16 × 0.0001)`\n        Denominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016`\n        Denominator = **2.3646**\n\n    *   **Calculate the Mole Fraction and Percentage**:\n        `α₂` = Numerator / Denominator = `0.4 / 2.3646` ≈ `0.16916`\n        Percentage = `α₂` × 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Analysis of Candidate Answers**: All 15 candidate answers correctly identified the formula and performed the calculation, unanimously arriving at the numerical result of **16.9%**. This provides extremely high confidence in the accuracy of the calculation. The discrepancies in their final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) arose simply because they were presented with different orderings of the options, which is a clerical issue, not a scientific one.\n\n2.  **Free vs. Total Ligand Concentration**: The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium, `[SCN⁻]`. The problem provides the *total* concentration of 0.1 M. Since the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is ten times greater than the total metal concentration (10⁻² M), the ligand is in large excess. It is therefore a standard and valid chemical approximation to assume that the free ligand concentration is equal to its total concentration (`[SCN⁻]free ≈ 0.1 M`).\n\n3.  **Importance of the '1' in the Denominator**: A common error in this type of calculation is forgetting to include the `1` term in the denominator. This term represents the fraction of the metal that remains as the free `Co²⁺` ion and is essential for accurately representing the sum of all species.\n\n4.  **Irrelevant Information**: The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, is not directly used in the mole fraction calculation itself.

Free vs. Total Ligand Concentration**: The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium, `[SCN⁻]`. We are given the *total* concentration of 0.1 M. Because the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is 10 times greater than the total metal concentration (`c(Co) = 10⁻² M`), the ligand is in large excess. It is a standard and valid assumption to approximate the free ligand concentration as being equal to its total concentration. Therefore, **[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M**. All candidate answers correctly identified and used this assumption.\n*   **2. The \"1\" in the Denominator**: This term represents the population of free `Co²⁺` ions, for which the stability constant β₀ is defined as 1. It is crucial to include this term to correctly represent the sum of *all* cobalt-containing species. This was handled correctly in all candidate answers.\n*   **3. Irrelevant Information**: The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, is not directly used in the mole fraction calculation itself. It only serves to justify the ligand concentration assumption detailed in Careful Point 1.\n*   **4. Consensus of Candidate Answers**: There is a unanimous consensus across all 15 candidate answers that the correct numerical result is **16.9%**. The only discrepancy among them is the final letter choice, which is an artifact of the options being presented in a different order to each agent.

The final answer is determined by performing a verified, step-by-step calculation and matching the result to the provided options.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Goal**\nThe question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species. This is the mole fraction of the species, denoted as `α₂`, expressed as a percentage.\n\n**2. State the Governing Scientific Principle and Formula**\nIn a solution containing a metal ion (M) and a ligand (L), the distribution of the various complexes formed (`[ML]`, `[ML₂]`, etc.) is determined by the concentration of the free ligand and the overall stability constants (`β`). The mole fraction of a specific complex, `[MLₙ]`, is given by:\n\n`αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)`\n\nFor the specific complex of interest, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, we need to calculate `α₂`:\n\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**3. Careful Points and Assumptions**\n\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers**: All provided candidate answers correctly identified the formula and performed the calculation, unanimously arriving at the numerical result of **~16.9%**. This provides a very high degree of confidence in the calculation. The discrepancies in their final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) were due to variations in the ordering of the multiple-choice options presented to them, not an error in the scientific calculation.\n*   **Ligand Concentration (`[SCN⁻]`)**: The formula requires the *free* (unbound) ligand concentration at equilibrium. We are given the *total* concentration (0.1 M). Since the total ligand concentration is ten times greater than the total cobalt concentration (0.1 M >> 0.01 M), the amount of ligand that binds to the metal is small relative to the total amount of ligand. Therefore, it is a standard and valid approximation to assume that the free ligand concentration is equal to its total concentration: `[SCN⁻]` ≈ 0.1 M.\n*   **Denominator Term (`1`)**: It is crucial to include the `1` in the denominator. This term represents the fraction of cobalt that remains as the free `Co²⁺` ion, for which the stability constant `β₀` is defined as 1. Omitting this term would lead to an incorrect answer.\n*   **Irrelevant Information (`c(Co)`):** The total cobalt concentration (`10⁻² M`) is not used directly in the mole fraction formula. Its purpose in the problem is to allow the justification of the assumption about the ligand concentration.\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\nUsing the given values:\n*   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n*   `β₁=9`, `β₂=40`, `β₃=63`, `β₄=16`\n\n**Calculate the numerator term (for `[Co(SCN)₂]`):**\n*   Numerator = `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n**Calculate the denominator (sum of terms for all cobalt species):**\n*   Term for `Co²⁺` = **1**\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺` = `β₁[SCN⁻]¹` = 9 × (0.1)¹ = **0.9**\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]` = `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 × (0.1)² = **0.4**\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻` = `β₃[SCN⁻]³` = 63 × (0.1)³ = **0.063**\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻` = `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴` = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = **0.0016**\n\nSum of denominator terms = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016` = **2.3646**\n\n**Calculate the mole fraction (`α₂`) and convert to a percentage:**\n*   `α₂` = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n*   Percentage = `α₂` × 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n**5. Final Decision**\nThe calculation unambiguously shows that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is **16.9%**. This result is confirmed by the consensus of all the candidate answers.

The problem provides the *total* ligand concentration ([SCN⁻]total = 0.1 M).

This is justified because the total ligand is in large excess compared to the total metal (0.1 M >> c(Co) = 0.01 M).\n*   **The \"1\" in the Denominator**: It is essential to include the term '1' in the denominator.

State the Governing Formula**\nThe mole fraction of a complex `[MLₙ]` in a solution at equilibrium is calculated using the overall stability constants (`β`) and the concentration of the free ligand (`[L]`). The formula is:\n`αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)`\nwhere the denominator sums the terms for all species in the solution, including the free metal ion (represented by the '1' term, where `β₀`=1).\n\nFor the specific complex of interest, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, we need to calculate `α₂`:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**3.

We are given the *total* concentration of 0.1 M. A crucial and valid assumption is that the free concentration is approximately equal to the total concentration (`[SCN⁻]free ≈ [SCN⁻]total`). This is justified because the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is in large excess compared to the total metal ion concentration (0.01 M), meaning only a small fraction of the ligand is actually bound.\n2.  **The \"1\" in the Denominator:** It is essential to include the term '1' in the denominator. This term represents the fraction of the metal that remains as the free `Co²⁺` ion (for which `β₀` is defined as 1).

Identify the Goal**\nThe question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total amount of all cobalt-containing species in the solution. This value is the mole fraction of the species, `α₂`, expressed as a percentage.\n\n**2. State the Governing Formula**\nThe mole fraction of a complex `[MLₙ]` in solution is determined by the free ligand concentration `[L]` and the overall stability constants `β`. The general formula is:\n\n`αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)`\n\nFor our specific complex of interest, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, where n=2, the formula is:\n\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**3. Perform the Calculation**\nWe substitute the given values into the formula:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator, which corresponds to the species of interest, `[Co(SCN)₂]`:\n*   **Numerator** = `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\nNext, calculate the denominator, which is the sum of the terms for *all* possible cobalt species:\n*   Term for free Co²⁺ (i=0, β₀=1): **1**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺ (i=1): `β₁[SCN⁻]¹` = 9 × (0.1)¹ = **0.9**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₂] (i=2): `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 × (0.1)² = **0.4**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (i=3): `β₃[SCN⁻]³` = 63 × (0.1)³ = **0.063**\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (i=4): `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴` = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = **0.0016**\n\nSumming these terms gives the total for the denominator:\n*   **Denominator** = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\nFinally, calculate the mole fraction `α₂` and convert it to a percentage:\n*   `α₂` = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n*   **Percentage** = `α₂` × 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Free vs. Total Ligand Concentration**: The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration, `[SCN⁻]`.

This term represents the fraction of cobalt that exists as the free (uncomplexed) `Co²⁺` ion, for which β₀ is defined as 1. Forgetting this term is a common error that would lead to an incorrect result.\n3.  **The Role of Total Cobalt Concentration**: The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is not needed directly to calculate the *relative percentage* or mole fraction, as the free metal concentration cancels out in the derivation of the formula. However, it is essential information needed to justify the assumption about the ligand concentration (Point 1).\n4.  **Overall vs. Stepwise Constants**: The problem correctly provides overall stability constants (`βₙ`), which are the appropriate constants for this formula.

The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium. We are given the *total* concentration of 0.1 M. Since the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is ten times greater than the total metal concentration (10⁻² M), the amount of ligand bound in complexes is small compared to the total. Therefore, it is a standard and valid chemical approximation to assume the free ligand concentration is equal to the total concentration (`[SCN⁻]` ≈ 0.1 M).\n*   **Careful Point 2: The \"1\" in the Denominator**. It is crucial to include the '1' term in the denominator. This term represents the fraction of the metal that remains as the free ion (`Co²⁺`), for which β₀ is defined as 1. Forgetting it is a common error that would lead to an incorrect result.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Irrelevance of Total Metal Concentration**.

The problem provides overall stability constants (`βₙ`), which are the correct constants for this formula.

This is a calculation of the mole fraction (`α₂`) of this specific species, expressed as a percentage.\n\n2.  **Determine the Correct Formula:** The distribution of metal complexes in an equilibrium system is governed by the free ligand concentration and the overall stability constants (β). The mole fraction of a complex with 'n' ligands (`[MLₙ]`) is calculated using the following general formula:\n\n    αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)\n\n    For the specific complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, we need to calculate `α₂` (where n=2):\n\n    α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation:** We substitute the values provided in the question into the formula.\n    *   Given values: `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`; β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16.\n\n    *   **Numerator Calculation**: This term corresponds to the complex of interest, `[Co(SCN)₂]`.\n        Numerator = β₂ × [SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n    *   **Denominator Calculation**: This is the sum of terms representing *all* possible cobalt species in the solution.\n        *   Term for free Co²⁺ (where i=0, β₀=1): **1**\n        *   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺` (i=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × 0.1 = **0.9**\n        *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]` (i=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = **0.4**\n        *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻` (i=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = **0.063**\n        *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻` (i=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = **0.0016**\n        \n        The total value of the denominator is the sum of these terms:\n        Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n    *   **Mole Fraction (`α₂`) and Percentage Calculation**:\n        α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n        Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n### Analysis of Candidate Answers & Careful Points\n\n*   **Consensus:** All 15 candidate answers show unanimous agreement on the calculation methodology and the final numerical result of **16.9%**. This provides extremely high confidence in the correctness of the calculation. The discrepancies in their final letter choices (A, B, C, D) are merely clerical errors due to receiving the options in a different order.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Ligand Concentration:** The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration. It is a critical and valid assumption that since the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is in large excess compared to the total metal concentration (0.01 M), the free ligand concentration can be approximated as being equal to the total ligand concentration (`[SCN⁻]` ≈ 0.1 M).\n*   **Careful Point 2: Denominator Integrity:** It is crucial to include the term '1' in the denominator. This term represents the fraction of free `Co²⁺` ions and is essential for normalizing the distribution correctly. Omitting it is a common error in these types of problems.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Irrelevant Information:** The total cobalt concentration (`c(Co) = 10⁻² M`) is not used directly in the mole fraction calculation. Its role is to justify the assumption made in Careful Point 1.\n*   **Careful Point 4: Final Matching:** The calculated numerical value must be carefully matched to the list of options provided in *this* specific problem.\n\nThe calculation definitively shows the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is **16.9%**.

A step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating insights and checks from the provided candidate answers, leads to a definitive conclusion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Goal Identification**\nThe objective is to find the percentage of cobalt that exists in the form of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution. This is calculated by finding the mole fraction (`α₂`) of this species and expressing it as a percentage.\n\n**2. The Governing Formula**\nThe mole fraction of a metal complex `[MLₙ]` in solution is determined by the free ligand concentration `[L]` and the overall stability constants (`β`). The general formula is:\n\nαₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)\n\nFor our target species, `[Co(SCN)₂]` (where n=2), the formula becomes:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**3. Careful Points and Assumptions**\nA careful analysis, reinforced by the consensus among the candidate answers, highlights several key points:\n*   **Ligand Concentration:** The formula uses the *free* (unbound) ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`. We are given the *total* concentration of 0.1 M. Because the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is in large excess compared to the total metal concentration (10⁻² M or 0.01 M), the amount of ligand bound in complexes is negligible compared to the total. Therefore, it is a standard and valid approximation to assume the free ligand concentration is equal to its total concentration: **[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M**.\n*   **The \"1\" in the Denominator:** This term is crucial as it represents the population of free `Co²⁺` ions (for which `β₀` is defined as 1). The denominator must represent the sum of *all* cobalt-containing species.\n*   **Role of Total Metal Concentration:** The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, is not directly used in the mole fraction formula itself. Its primary purpose is to justify the assumption about the ligand concentration mentioned above.\n*   **Consensus from Candidate Answers:** All 15 candidate answers, despite choosing different final letters due to varying option orders, unanimously arrived at the same numerical result of **~16.9%**. This provides extremely high confidence in the calculation itself.\n\n**4. Calculation**\nWe substitute the given values into the formula:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator for the species of interest, `[Co(SCN)₂]`:\n*   **Numerator** = `β₂ × [SCN⁻]²` = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\nNext, calculate the denominator, which is the sum of terms for all species:\n*   **Denominator** = 1 (for Co²⁺) + (β₁[SCN⁻]¹) + (β₂[SCN⁻]²) + (β₃[SCN⁻]³) + (β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n*   Denominator = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.1²) + (63 × 0.1³) + (16 × 0.1⁴)\n*   Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\n*   **Denominator** = **2.3646**\n\nFinally, calculate the mole fraction `α₂` and convert to a percentage:\n*   `α₂` = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n*   **Percentage** = `α₂` × 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n**5. Final Decision**\nThe calculation unambiguously shows that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is 16.9%. This must be matched to the specific options provided in the question:\n\nA) 38.1%\nB) 25.6%\nC) 16.9%\nD) 42.3%\n\nThe calculated value of 16.9% corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating a review of the candidate answers and identifying all the careful points required to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\nThe goal is to calculate the percentage of one specific species, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) or `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution. This is a problem of finding the mole fraction (`α`) of a species in a complexation equilibrium.\n\n**2. Analyze the Candidate Answers**\nA review of all 15 candidate answers reveals two key findings:\n*   **Unanimous Calculation:** Every single candidate agent used the correct formula and arrived at the same numerical result of **~16.9%**. This provides extremely high confidence that the mathematical procedure is correct.\n*   **Source of Discrepancy:** The final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) varies among the candidates. This is because each agent was presented with a different, randomized ordering of the multiple-choice options. The core scientific conclusion is not in dispute.\n\n**3. Identify the Governing Principle and Formula**\nThe mole fraction of a complex `[MLₙ]` in a solution depends on the free ligand concentration `[L]` and the overall stability constants `β`. The general formula is:\n`αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)`\nFor our target species `[Co(SCN)₂]`, where n=2, the formula is:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\nWe substitute the given values into the formula:\n*   Given values: `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`, `β₁ = 9`, `β₂ = 40`, `β₃ = 63`, `β₄ = 16`.\n\n*   **Calculate the Numerator** (the term corresponding to the species of interest, `[Co(SCN)₂]`):\n    Numerator = `β₂ × [SCN⁻]²` = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n*   **Calculate the Denominator** (the sum of terms for *all* possible cobalt species):\n    *   Term for free Co²⁺ (n=0): **1**\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺` (n=1): `β₁[SCN⁻]¹` = 9 × 0.1 = **0.9**\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]` (n=2): `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 × 0.1² = **0.4**\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻` (n=3): `β₃[SCN⁻]³` = 63 × 0.1³ = **0.063**\n    *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻` (n=4): `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴` = 16 × 0.1⁴ = **0.0016**\n\n*   **Sum of Denominator**: `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016` = **2.3646**\n\n*   **Calculate the Mole Fraction (α₂) and Percentage**:\n    `α₂` = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n    Percentage = `α₂` × 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Free vs. Total Ligand Concentration:** The formula uses the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium `[SCN⁻]`. We are given the *total* concentration of 0.1 M. Because the total ligand concentration is ten times greater than the total metal concentration (`0.1 M` vs. `10⁻² M`), the ligand is in large excess. It is a standard and valid assumption to approximate the free ligand concentration as being equal to its total concentration (`[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`). The total cobalt concentration value is mainly used to justify this key assumption.\n\n2.  **Completeness of the Denominator:** It is a common error in this type of calculation to forget the `1` in the denominator. This term represents the fraction of the metal that remains as the free `Co²⁺` ion (for which β₀ is defined as 1) and is crucial for accurately representing the sum of *all* cobalt-containing species.\n\n3.  **Overall vs. Stepwise Stability Constants:** The problem provides overall stability constants (`β`), which are the correct constants to use directly in the mole fraction formula. If stepwise constants (`K`) had been provided, they would have needed to be converted first (`β₂ = K₁ × K₂`, etc.).\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe calculation robustly and unambiguously shows that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is **16.9%**. This result is confirmed by the unanimous calculations across all candidate answers. Matching this numerical value to the options provided in the question:\n\nA) 16.9%\nB) 42.3%\nC) 25.6%\nD) 38.1%\n\nThe calculated value of 16.9% corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis is a quantitative analysis problem in coordination chemistry. To arrive at the correct answer, a step-by-step analysis is performed, taking into account the unanimous consensus on the calculation method seen across all candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal**: The objective is to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species.

The problem provides the *total* concentration of 0.1 M. Because the total ligand concentration is in large excess compared to the total metal concentration (0.1 M >> 0.01 M), it is a standard and valid chemical approximation to assume the free ligand concentration is equal to its total concentration. Therefore, `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`.\n\n2.  **Inclusion of the Free Metal Ion**: It is crucial that the denominator includes the term '1', which represents the fraction of cobalt that remains as the free, uncomplexed `Co²⁺` ion (for which β₀ is defined as 1). Forgetting this term is a common error and would lead to an incorrect answer.\n\n3.  **Role of Total Metal Concentration**: The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, is not used directly in the mole fraction calculation itself. Its primary role is to justify the assumption about the ligand concentration discussed in the first point.\n\n4.  **Consensus of Candidate Answers**: A review of all candidate answers shows a unanimous agreement on the calculation method and the final numerical result of 16.9%. The only discrepancies were in the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D), which indicates the options were presented in a different random order to each agent.

Identify the Goal**\nThe question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total amount of all cobalt-containing species in the solution. This requires calculating the mole fraction (`α₂`) of this species and expressing it as a percentage.\n\n**2. State the Governing Formula**\nThe mole fraction of a complex `[MLₙ]` in a solution at equilibrium is calculated using the overall stability constants (`β`) and the concentration of the free ligand (`[L]`). The formula is:\n`αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)`\nwhere the denominator sums the terms for all species in the solution, including the free metal ion (represented by the '1' term, where `β₀`=1).\n\nFor the specific complex of interest, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, we need to calculate `α₂`:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**3. Perform the Calculation**\nThe previous Python script execution yielded the following results:\n*   Numerator (`β₂[SCN⁻]²`): ~0.4\n*   Denominator (Sum of all species terms): 2.3646\n*   Calculated percentage: 16.916180326482287%\n\nRounding the result to one decimal place gives **16.9%**. This confirms the numerical result obtained by all candidate answers.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Free vs. Total Ligand Concentration**: The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium `[SCN⁻]`. We are given the *total* concentration of 0.1 M. Since the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is ten times higher than the total metal concentration (`c(Co) = 10⁻² M`), the ligand is in large excess. It is a standard and valid chemical approximation to assume the free ligand concentration is equal to the total concentration (`[SCN⁻]` ≈ 0.1 M).\n\n2.  **The \"1\" in the Denominator**: It is crucial to include the '1' term in the denominator. This term represents the fraction of the metal that remains as the free ion (`Co²⁺`), for which the stability constant `β₀` is defined as 1. Forgetting this term is a common mistake that would lead to an incorrect answer.\n\n3.  **Irrelevance of Total Metal Concentration for the Calculation**: The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, is not directly used in the mole fraction calculation. The mole fraction is a relative percentage, and the free metal ion concentration `[Co²⁺]` cancels out from the numerator and denominator during the formula's derivation. The value of `c(Co)` is primarily useful for justifying the ligand concentration assumption mentioned in point 1.\n\n4.  **Unanimity of Candidate Calculations**: A review of all candidate answers shows they all correctly identified the formula and unanimously arrived at the same numerical result of **16.9%**. The only discrepancies were in which letter (A, B, C, or D) this value corresponded to, which confirms that the multiple-choice options were scrambled for each agent.

This is achieved by finding the mole fraction of this species, denoted `α₂`, and converting it to a percentage.\n\n**2. Governing Principle and Formula**: The distribution of metal complexes in solution is governed by the equilibrium concentrations of the free ligand and the overall stability constants (β) of each complex. The mole fraction `αₙ` of a complex `[MLₙ]` is given by the formula:\n\n`αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)`\n\nFor the specific target complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]` (where n=2), the formula is:\n\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**3.

A crucial and valid assumption is that the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` is approximately equal to its total concentration (0.1 M). This is justified because the ligand is in large excess compared to the metal ion (0.1 M >> 0.01 M).\n2.  **The Denominator '1' Term**: It is essential to include the term '1' in the denominator. This term represents the fraction of free metal ions, `Co²⁺` (for which β₀ is defined as 1), and is necessary to account for all cobalt-containing species. Omitting it is a common error.\n3.  **Irrelevance of Total Metal Concentration**: The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, is not used directly in the mole fraction calculation. Its primary purpose is to justify the ligand concentration approximation detailed in point 1.\n4.  **Overall vs. Stepwise Constants**: The problem correctly provides overall stability constants (`βₙ`), which are the required inputs for this formula. If stepwise constants (`Kₙ`) had been given, they would have needed to be converted first.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating careful points and leading to a definitive final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Goal**\nThe question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species. This is the mole fraction of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` species, denoted as `α₂`, expressed as a percentage.\n\n**2. State the Governing Formula**\nThe mole fraction of a complex `[MLₙ]` in a solution is determined by the overall stability constants (β) and the free ligand concentration `[L]`. The general formula is:\n`αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)`\nFor our target species, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, where n=2, the formula becomes:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**3. Perform the Calculation**\nWe use the values provided in the question:\n*   [SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M (See Careful Point 1 below)\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator term, which represents the species of interest `[Co(SCN)₂]`:\n*   **Numerator** = `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\nNext, calculate the denominator, which is the sum of terms for all possible cobalt species:\n*   Term for `Co²⁺` (free ion): **1**\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`: `β₁[SCN⁻]¹` = 9 × (0.1)¹ = **0.9**\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]`: `β₂[SCN⁻]²` = 40 × (0.1)² = **0.4**\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`: `β₃[SCN⁻]³` = 63 × (0.1)³ = **0.063**\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`: `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴` = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = **0.0016**\n\nSumming these terms gives the denominator:\n*   **Denominator** = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\nFinally, calculate the mole fraction `α₂` and convert it to a percentage:\n*   `α₂` = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n*   **Percentage** = `α₂` × 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\nThis result is unanimously confirmed by all 15 candidate answers.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Free vs. Total Ligand Concentration**: The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration, `[SCN⁻]free`. The problem provides the *total* concentration, `[SCN⁻]total` = 0.1 M. A crucial and valid assumption is made that `[SCN⁻]free ≈ [SCN⁻]total`. This is justified because the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is in 10-fold excess compared to the total metal concentration (c(Co) = 0.01 M), meaning only a small fraction of the ligand is bound to cobalt.\n2.  **Completeness of the Denominator**: The denominator represents the sum of the relative concentrations of *all* cobalt-containing species. It is essential to include the **'1'** term, which represents the free `Co²⁺` ion (for which β₀ is defined as 1). Forgetting this term is a common mistake that leads to an incorrect answer.\n3.  **Role of Total Metal Concentration**: The value `c(Co) = 10⁻² M` is not directly used in the final calculation for the mole fraction (a relative percentage). Its main purpose is to justify the assumption regarding the ligand concentration.\n4.  **Overall vs. Stepwise Stability Constants**: The problem provides overall stability constants (`βₙ`), which are the correct constants to use in the mole fraction formula. If stepwise constants (`Kₙ`) had been provided, they would need to be converted first.\n5.  **Analyzing the Candidate Answers**: The candidate answers show a universal agreement on the numerical result (16.9%), while disagreeing on the corresponding letter (A, B, C, or D). This indicates that the multiple-choice options were randomized for each candidate. The correct approach is to ignore the letters from the candidates and match the independently verified numerical result to the option list in the original question.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe step-by-step calculation robustly shows the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex to be **16.9%**. Matching this result to the options provided in the question:\nA) 42.3%\nB) 16.9%\nC) 25.6%\nD) 38.1%\n\nThe calculated value corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal**: The problem asks for the percentage of one specific complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) or `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution. This is equivalent to calculating the mole fraction (`α₂`) of this species and expressing it as a percentage.\n\n2.  **Determine the Correct Formula**: The distribution of metal complexes in a solution is described by the mole fraction formula, which uses overall stability constants (`βₙ`) and the free ligand concentration `[L]`. The mole fraction `αₙ` for a complex `[MLₙ]` is:\n    `αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)`\n    The sum `Σ` in the denominator runs over all complexed species (i=1 to 4), and the `1` term represents the free metal ion (`Co²⁺`), for which β₀ = 1.\n    For the specific complex `[Co(SCN)₂]` (n=2), the formula is:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation**: We substitute the given values into the formula.\n    *   **Given values**: `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M; β₁ = 9; β₂ = 40; β₃ = 63; β₄ = 16.\n\n    *   **Calculate the Numerator**: This term corresponds to the `[Co(SCN)₂]` species.\n        Numerator = `β₂ × [SCN⁻]²` = `40 × (0.1)²` = `40 × 0.01` = **0.4**\n\n    *   **Calculate the Denominator**: This is the sum of terms for all five possible cobalt species (`Co²⁺`, `[Co(SCN)]⁺`, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`, `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`).\n        Denominator = `1` (for free Co²⁺) + (`β₁[SCN⁻]¹`) + (`β₂[SCN⁻]²`) + (`β₃[SCN⁻]³`) + (`β₄[SCN⁻]⁴`)\n        Denominator = `1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.01) + (63 × 0.001) + (16 × 0.0001)`\n        Denominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016`\n        Denominator = **2.3646**\n\n    *   **Calculate the Mole Fraction and Percentage**:\n        `α₂` = Numerator / Denominator = `0.4 / 2.3646` ≈ `0.16916`\n        Percentage = `α₂` × 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Analysis of Candidate Answers**: All 15 candidate answers correctly identified the formula and performed the calculation, unanimously arriving at the numerical result of **16.9%**. This provides extremely high confidence in the accuracy of the calculation. The discrepancies in their final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) arose simply because they were presented with different orderings of the options, which is a clerical issue, not a scientific one.\n\n2.  **Free vs. Total Ligand Concentration**: The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium, `[SCN⁻]`. The problem provides the *total* concentration of 0.1 M. Since the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is ten times greater than the total metal concentration (10⁻² M), the ligand is in large excess. It is therefore a standard and valid chemical approximation to assume that the free ligand concentration is equal to its total concentration (`[SCN⁻]free ≈ 0.1 M`).\n\n3.  **Importance of the '1' in the Denominator**: A common error in this type of calculation is forgetting to include the `1` term in the denominator. This term represents the fraction of the metal that remains as the free `Co²⁺` ion and is essential for accurately representing the sum of all species.\n\n4.  **Irrelevant Information**: The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, is not directly used in the mole fraction calculation itself. Its only purpose is to justify the critical ligand concentration assumption described in point 2.\n\n### Final Decision\nThe calculation robustly yields a value of 16.9%.

This is known as the mole fraction of the species (`α₂`) and is expressed as a percentage.\n\n2.  **State the Governing Formula**: The mole fraction of a complex `[MLₙ]` in a solution is determined by the free ligand concentration `[L]` and the overall stability constants `β`. The general formula is:\n\n    `αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)`\n\n    For our target complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, we need to calculate `α₂`:\n\n    `α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation**: Substitute the given values into the formula. A consistent calculation was performed across all candidate answers, which we will verify here.\n    *   **Given values**: `[SCN⁻]` ≈ 0.1 M (See Careful Point 1), `β₁=9`, `β₂=40`, `β₃=63`, `β₄=16`.\n\n    *   **Calculate the Numerator**: The term for the species of interest, `[Co(SCN)₂]`.\n        Numerator = β₂ × [SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = **0.4**\n\n    *   **Calculate the Denominator**: The sum of terms for all possible cobalt species.\n        *   Term for free Co²⁺ (i=0): **1**\n        *   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺` (i=1): β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × 0.1 = **0.9**\n        *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]` (i=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × 0.1² = **0.4**\n        *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻` (i=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × 0.1³ = **0.063**\n        *   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻` (i=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × 0.1⁴ = **0.0016**\n        *   **Sum of Denominator**: 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = **2.3646**\n\n    *   **Calculate the Mole Fraction (α₂) and Percentage**:\n        α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n        Percentage = α₂ × 100% ≈ **16.9%**\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **1. Free vs. Total Ligand Concentration**: The formula requires the *free* ligand concentration at equilibrium, `[SCN⁻]`. We are given the *total* concentration of 0.1 M. Because the total ligand concentration (0.1 M) is 10 times greater than the total metal concentration (`c(Co) = 10⁻² M`), the ligand is in large excess. It is a standard and valid assumption to approximate the free ligand concentration as being equal to its total concentration. Therefore, **[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M**. All candidate answers correctly identified and used this assumption.\n*   **2. The \"1\" in the Denominator**: This term represents the population of free `Co²⁺` ions, for which the stability constant β₀ is defined as 1. It is crucial to include this term to correctly represent the sum of *all* cobalt-containing species. This was handled correctly in all candidate answers.\n*   **3. Irrelevant Information**: The total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, is not directly used in the mole fraction calculation itself. It only serves to justify the ligand concentration assumption detailed in Careful Point 1.\n*   **4. Consensus of Candidate Answers**: There is a unanimous consensus across all 15 candidate answers that the correct numerical result is **16.9%**. The only discrepancy among them is the final letter choice, which is an artifact of the options being presented in a different order to each agent. This overwhelming agreement provides very high confidence in the correctness of the calculation.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe step-by-step analysis and the consensus of all candidate agents confirm that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is **16.9%**. We must match this result to the original list of options provided in the question.\n\n**Question's Options**:\nA) 38.1%\nB) 16.9%\nC) 42.3%\nD) 25.6%\n\nThe calculated value of 16.9% matches option **B**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nAn analysis of the provided answers and the original chemistry problem reveals a strong consensus on the calculation method and numerical result.

Identify the Goal**\nThe question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species. This is the mole fraction of the species, denoted as `α₂`, expressed as a percentage.\n\n**2. State the Governing Scientific Principle and Formula**\nIn a solution containing a metal ion (M) and a ligand (L), the distribution of the various complexes formed (`[ML]`, `[ML₂]`, etc.) is determined by the concentration of the free ligand and the overall stability constants (`β`). The mole fraction of a specific complex, `[MLₙ]`, is given by:\n\n`αₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βᵢ[L]ⁱ)`\n\nFor the specific complex of interest, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, we need to calculate `α₂`:\n\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**3. Careful Points and Assumptions**\n\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers**: All provided candidate answers correctly identified the formula and performed the calculation, unanimously arriving at the numerical result of **~16.9%**. This provides a very high degree of confidence in the calculation. The discrepancies in their final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) were due to variations in the ordering of the multiple-choice options presented to them, not an error in the scientific calculation.\n*   **Ligand Concentration (`[SCN⁻]`)**: The formula requires the *free* (unbound) ligand concentration at equilibrium. We are given the *total* concentration (0.1 M). Since the total ligand concentration is ten times greater than the total cobalt concentration (0.1 M >> 0.01 M), the amount of ligand that binds to the metal is small relative to the total amount of ligand. Therefore, it is a standard and valid approximation to assume that the free ligand concentration is equal to its total concentration: `[SCN⁻]` ≈ 0.1 M.\n*   **Denominator Term (`1`)**: It is crucial to include the `1` in the denominator. This term represents the fraction of cobalt that remains as the free `Co²⁺` ion, for which the stability constant `β₀` is defined as 1. Omitting this term would lead to an incorrect answer.\n*   **Irrelevant Information (`c(Co)`):** The total cobalt concentration (`10⁻² M`) is not used directly in the mole fraction formula. Its purpose in the problem is to allow the justification of the assumption about the ligand concentration.\n\n**4.
