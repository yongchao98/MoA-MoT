The compound is synthesized by a protein, which is encoded by the gene in question. Therefore, the goal is to find a mutation that makes the protein non-functional.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity:** To make a protein non-functional, some mutations are more effective than others. In general, the hierarchy from most to least likely to cause a complete loss of function is:\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation (introduces a premature stop codon):** This terminates protein synthesis, creating a truncated (shortened) protein. If it happens early in the sequence, the resulting protein fragment is almost guaranteed to be non-functional.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation (indel not a multiple of 3):** This shifts the entire reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually creating a premature stop codon by chance. This is also very likely to result in a non-functional protein.\n    *   **Missense Mutation (changes one amino acid):** The effect is uncertain. It might destroy the protein's function if the amino acid is critical, but it might also have little or no effect. It is not a guaranteed \"knockout\".\n    *   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion (indel is a multiple of 3):** This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein sequence correct. It is less severe than a frameshift or early nonsense mutation.\n\n3.  **Translate and Compare the Gene Sequences:** We will now examine the first few codons of the intact gene and each mutant.\n\n    *   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC ... -3’`\n        *   Translation: Methionine (Met) - Phenylalanine (Phe) - Leucine (Leu) ...\n        *   This is the functional protein we want to disable.\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC ... -3’`\n        *   Change: `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n        *   Mutation Type: **Missense**.\n        *   Outcome: Not guaranteed to eliminate function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA ... -3’`\n        *   Change: `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`.\n        *   Mutation Type: **Nonsense**. `TAA` is a stop codon.\n        *   Outcome: Protein synthesis will stop after the second amino acid (Phe). The resulting product is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe), which is guaranteed to be non-functional. This is the most probable way to eliminate the compound.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC ... -3’`\n        *   Change: `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), plus other missense mutations downstream.\n        *   Mutation Type: **Multiple Missense**.\n        *   Outcome: While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it is still less certain to be a complete knockout than the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TACGCTACTT... -3’`\n        *   Change: This involves a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`) and a deletion of one complete codon (`GGT`) downstream.\n        *   Mutation Type: **In-frame deletion** combined with a missense mutation.\n        *   Outcome: This removes an amino acid from the protein chain but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. The effect is significant but less severe than an early stop codon.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon (`TAA`) at the third position in the coding sequence. This is a nonsense mutation that ensures the production of a severely truncated and non-functional protein. This is the most definitive and probable way among the given options to achieve the goal of eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe options are:\nA) Mutant 2\nB) Mutant 4\nC) Mutant 3\nD) Mutant 1\n\nBased on the analysis, Mutant 2 is the correct choice.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe main objective is to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. The gene provided is responsible for synthesizing this compound. Therefore, to stop the production of the compound, we need to find the mutation that is most likely to make the protein produced by this gene completely non-functional.\n\n**2. Analyze the Intact Gene Sequence**\nThe gene sequence is read by the cell's machinery in groups of three DNA bases, called codons. Translation starts at the `ATG` start codon.\n*   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ...-3’`\n*   **Translation into Codons:**\n    *   Codon 1: `ATG` -> Methionine (Met) - This is the START of the protein.\n    *   Codon 2: `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (Phe)\n    *   Codon 3: `CTC` -> Leucine (Leu)\n    *   Codon 4: `GCT` -> Alanine (Ala)\n*   The functional protein begins with the amino acid sequence: **Met-Phe-Leu-Ala...**\n\n**3. Evaluate the Impact of Each Mutation**\nWe must determine which type of mutation is most likely to cause a complete loss of protein function.\n*   **Most Severe:** Nonsense (premature stop codon) and Frameshift (scrambled reading frame) mutations are the most likely to create a non-functional protein, especially when they occur early in the gene.\n*   **Less Severe:** Missense (amino acid substitution) and in-frame deletions/insertions might alter or reduce function, but a functional protein may still be produced.\n\nNow, let's analyze each mutant:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT ...-3’`\n    *   **Codon changes:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). Note: The change from `TTT` to `TTC` is a silent mutation, as both code for Phenylalanine.\n    *   **Mutation Type:** This is a **missense mutation**. It substitutes one amino acid for another. The resulting full-length protein might have reduced function or might function normally. This is not a guaranteed way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ...-3’`\n    *   **Codon changes:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   **Mutation Type:** This is also a **missense mutation**, similar to Mutant 1. It is not the most probable way to guarantee a non-functional protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’` (after deletion)\n    *   **Codon changes:** Comparing the longer string in the prompt to the intact sequence, we see a deletion of the codon `GGT`.\n    *   **Mutation Type:** This is an **in-frame deletion**. It removes one amino acid (Glycine) from the protein but keeps the downstream reading frame intact. Like a missense mutation, this will alter the protein, but it is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than more severe mutations.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT ...-3’`\n    *   **Codon changes:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`.\n    *   **What is `TAA`?** `TAA` is one of the three **STOP codons**.\n    *   **Mutation Type:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. When the ribosome encounters this codon, it stops protein synthesis.\n    *   **Effect:** The resulting \"protein\" will be only two amino acids long (Met-Phe). A severely shortened peptide like this is guaranteed to be completely non-functional.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most destructive change. By introducing a STOP signal at the very beginning of the protein sequence (the third codon), it ensures that a functional, full-length protein cannot be produced. This is the mutation that will most probably eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Goal:** The objective is to select the mutation that will *most probably* eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by a specific gene. Therefore, the goal is to introduce a mutation that makes the protein non-functional.\n\n2.  **Understand Gene Expression and Mutations:** A gene's DNA sequence is transcribed into mRNA, which is then translated into a protein. The translation process reads the sequence in three-base units called codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon. The most severe mutations, those most likely to create a non-functional (\"knockout\") protein, are:\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes a normal codon into a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis prematurely, creating a short, non-functional protein.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three. This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n    *   Other mutations like **missense** (changing one amino acid) or **in-frame deletions/insertions** (removing/adding amino acids without shifting the frame) are less likely to cause a complete loss of function.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Intact Gene Sequence:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Breaking it into codons gives us the start of the amino acid sequence:\n        *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Start)\n        *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine\n        *   `CTC` -> Leucine\n    *   The functional protein begins: `Met-Phe-Leu...`\n\n4.  **Evaluate Each Mutant:**\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** Sequence `5’-ATGTTCTACGCT...-3’`\n        *   Codon change: The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). (The `TTT` to `TTC` change is silent).\n        *   Mutation Type: **Missense**. This results in a single amino acid substitution. This *might* disable the protein, but it is not guaranteed.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** Sequence `5’-ATGTTCTAAGCT...-3’`\n        *   Codon change: The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAA`.\n        *   Mutation Type: **Nonsense**. The codon `TAA` is a **STOP codon**.\n        *   Effect: Protein synthesis will stop after the second amino acid. The result is a tiny dipeptide (`Met-Phe`). This peptide will be completely non-functional. This is the most certain way to eliminate the protein's function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** Sequence `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGT...-3’`\n        *   Codon change: Comparing the sequence shows multiple changes, likely a mix of substitutions and/or a frameshift. The clearest change is `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine), a missense mutation. While complex mutations are disruptive, the presence of a clear nonsense mutation in another option is a more direct path to a functional knockout.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** Sequence `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTT...-3’`\n        *   Codon change: Comparison shows the codon `GGT` has been deleted from the original sequence. This is a 3-base pair deletion.\n        *   Mutation Type: **In-frame deletion**. It removes one amino acid (Glycine) but does not shift the reading frame for the rest of the protein. Like a missense mutation, this is not a guaranteed way to inactivate the protein.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The most severe and definitive mutation is the **nonsense mutation** found in Mutant 2. It introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the gene, ensuring that a functional, full-length protein cannot be produced. This is the most probable mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. The question lists Mutant 2 as option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n1.  **Analyze the Objective:** The goal is to find the mutation that will *most probably* eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. This compound is produced by a protein encoded by the gene in question. Therefore, the most effective strategy is to introduce a mutation that makes the protein non-functional.\n\n2.  **Understand Mutation Severity:** The likelihood of a mutation rendering a protein non-functional depends on the type of mutation and its location. A mutation occurring early in the coding sequence is generally more damaging. The most severe types of mutations are:\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid-coding codon into a stop codon (e.g., TAA, TAG, TGA). This causes protein synthesis to halt prematurely, creating a short, truncated, and almost certainly non-functional protein.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of bases not in a multiple of three. This shifts the entire reading frame, scrambling all downstream amino acids and usually leading to a premature stop codon.\n    *   **Less Severe Mutations:** Missense mutations (changing one amino acid), silent mutations (no amino acid change), and in-frame deletions/insertions (removing/adding whole amino acids) are less certain to cause a complete loss of function.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Intact Gene and the Mutants:** Let's break down the DNA sequences into three-base codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n    *   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n        *   This translates to the amino acid sequence: **Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...** This is the functional protein we want to disable.\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n        *   Change: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). The change from `TTT` to `TTC` is silent as both code for Phenylalanine.\n        *   Type: This is a **missense mutation**. It produces a full-length protein with a single amino acid substitution. This might affect function, but it's not a guaranteed knockout.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n        *   Change: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`.\n        *   Type: **TAA is a stop codon.** This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n        *   Effect: Protein synthesis will terminate after the second amino acid. The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe), which will be completely non-functional. This is the most reliable way to eliminate the protein's function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT...-3’`\n        *   The full sequence string (`ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCT...`) when compared to the intact string shows multiple base substitutions resulting in multiple **missense mutations**. While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it's still less certain to be a complete knockout than a premature stop codon.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TACGCTACTTCT...-3’`\n        *   Comparing the full string to the intact string reveals a deletion of the `GGT` codon. This is an **in-frame deletion**, which removes a single amino acid (Glycine) from the protein. While disruptive, it keeps the rest of the protein's reading frame intact and is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe and definitive mutation among the choices. It introduces a stop codon at the third position of the coding sequence, ensuring that a functional protein cannot be synthesized. This is the mutation that will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. The question lists Mutant 2 as option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n*   **Step 1: Understand the objective.** The main goal is to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound that is synthesized by a specific gene. The most reliable way to achieve this is to introduce a mutation that makes the protein produced by this gene completely non-functional (a \"knockout\" or \"null\" mutation).\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the hierarchy of mutation severity.** We need to find the mutation that will most probably result in a non-functional protein. The general order of severity for inactivating a protein is as follows:\n    1.  **Nonsense Mutation:** Creates a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated and almost always non-functional protein.\n    2.  **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of bases not in a multiple of three, which scrambles the entire amino acid sequence downstream and usually results in a non-functional protein.\n    3.  **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Removes or adds one or more complete amino acids. This can be disruptive but may not lead to a complete loss of function.\n    4.  **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid for another. The effect is variable and might not disable the protein.\n    5.  **Silent Mutation:** Changes the DNA but not the amino acid. Has no effect on the protein's function.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze each mutant's genetic sequence.** We will compare each mutant to the intact gene by reading the DNA in three-base codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n    *   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT ... -3’`\n        *   Translated protein sequence starts: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala ...\n        *   This is the functional protein we want to disable.\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT ... -3’`\n        *   This introduces a missense mutation, changing the third codon `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine). (The change from `TTT` to `TTC` is silent as both code for Phenylalanine).\n        *   **Effect:** A single amino acid is changed. This is not guaranteed to eliminate the protein's function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT ... -3’`\n        *   This introduces a **nonsense mutation**, changing the third codon `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAA` (a **Stop Codon**).\n        *   **Effect:** Protein synthesis will halt after the second amino acid. The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid-long fragment (Met-Phe), which is guaranteed to be completely non-functional. This is a highly effective and probable way to achieve the goal.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ...-3’`\n        *   This sequence shows multiple missense mutations, for example changing `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine) and `ACT` (Threonine) to `GTC` (Valine) when compared to the full intact sequence.\n        *   **Effect:** Multiple amino acids are changed, but a full-length protein is still produced. While more disruptive than Mutant 1, this is still less certain to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT ...-3’`\n        *   When aligned with the intact sequence, this mutant shows an in-frame deletion of the `GGT` codon (which codes for Glycine) and a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`).\n        *   **Effect:** Removing one amino acid and changing another alters the protein but does not stop its synthesis or change the downstream reading frame. This is less severe than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Step 4: Conclude which mutation is most probable.** The nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most disruptive change. By introducing a stop codon at the very beginning of the coding sequence, it ensures that a functional, full-length protein cannot be produced. This is the most reliable way among the given options to eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n*   **Step 5: Match the answer to the options.**\n    *   Mutant 2 is the correct answer.\n    *   The options list Mutant 2 as C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe objective is to identify which mutation is most likely to inactivate the gene responsible for synthesizing an anti-nutritional compound. This is best achieved by introducing a mutation that prevents the formation of a functional protein. The most severe mutations, in terms of protein function, are those that drastically alter the protein's sequence or cause its premature termination.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Intact Gene Sequence:** The gene begins with `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`.\n    *   The sequence is read in three-base units called codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n    *   `ATG` codes for Methionine (Met), the first amino acid.\n    *   `TTT` codes for Phenylalanine (Phe).\n    *   `CTC` codes for Leucine (Leu).\n    *   The normal, functional protein starts with the amino acid sequence: Met-Phe-Leu...\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Impact of Each Mutation:** We will compare each mutant to the intact gene.\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** The sequence `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, which substitutes one amino acid for another. The full-length protein is still produced, and it may or may not be functional. The effect is uncertain.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** The sequence `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. According to the genetic code, **`TAA` is a stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n        *   **Effect:** The ribosome, which translates the gene into a protein, will stop protein synthesis at this point. The resulting product will be a tiny, two-amino-acid-long peptide (Met-Phe). This fragment is guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** This sequence contains multiple changes, including `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine). These are **missense mutations**. While changing multiple amino acids is more disruptive than changing one, it is still less certain to cause a complete loss of function than a premature stop codon.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** This sequence appears to contain a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`) and a deletion of one complete codon (`GGT`). This is an **in-frame deletion**, which removes one amino acid but keeps the rest of the protein's reading frame intact. While this will alter the protein, it is less disruptive than a nonsense mutation that halts production entirely.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The question asks for the mutation that will *most probably* eliminate the compound.\n    *   Missesnse mutations (Mutant 1, 3) and in-frame deletions (Mutant 4) produce a full-length or near-full-length protein that might retain function. The outcome is not guaranteed.\n    *   A nonsense mutation (Mutant 2), especially one occurring so early in the gene, guarantees that translation is stopped prematurely. The resulting, severely truncated protein will be non-functional.\n    *   Therefore, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most reliable and probable way to eliminate the protein's function and, consequently, the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe correct choice is Mutant 2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe main objective is to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound that is synthesized by a protein. To achieve this, we need to find the mutation that is most likely to make the protein completely non-functional.\n\n**2. Analyze the Intact Gene and Protein Synthesis**\nThe gene sequence provided begins with `5’-ATG...`, which is the universal start codon. Protein synthesis (translation) reads the DNA sequence in groups of three bases, called codons.\n*   **Intact Gene codons:** `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...`\n*   **Translation into amino acids:**\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Met) - This is the start of the protein.\n    *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (Phe)\n    *   `CTC` -> Leucine (Leu)\n    *   `GCT` -> Alanine (Ala)\n*   The normal, functional protein begins with the sequence: `Met-Phe-Leu-Ala...`\n\n**3. Evaluate the Impact of Different Types of Mutations**\nWe are looking for the mutation with the most severe impact on the final protein. The hierarchy of severity is generally:\n*   **Nonsense Mutation (most severe for this goal):** Changes an amino acid codon into a STOP codon (TAA, TAG, TGA). This halts protein synthesis, creating a truncated (shortened) and almost always non-functional protein.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation (also very severe):** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases that is not a multiple of three. This shifts the reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually creating a non-functional protein.\n*   **Missense Mutation (less severe):** Changes one amino acid to another. This might or might not disable the protein.\n*   **Silent Mutation (least severe):** Changes the DNA but not the amino acid. It has no effect on the protein's function.\n\n**4. Analyze Each Mutant**\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC ...-3’`\n    *   Compared to the intact gene (`ATG TTT CTC...`), the third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a full-length protein with a single amino acid substitution. This may or may not eliminate the protein's function.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Compared to the intact gene, this also has a change in the third codon from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is also a **missense mutation** and has the same uncertain outcome as Mutant 1.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TACGCT ACTTCT...-3’`\n    *   This mutation combines a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`) with a deletion of one complete codon (`GGT`). This is an **in-frame deletion**, which removes one amino acid. While this is more disruptive than a simple missense mutation, the rest of the protein is synthesized correctly, so a total loss of function is not guaranteed.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT ...-3’`\n    *   Compared to the intact gene, the third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAA`.\n    *   The `TAA` codon is a **STOP codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   **Effect:** Protein synthesis will halt at this position. The resulting \"protein\" will be a tiny fragment only two amino acids long (`Met-Phe`). Such a severely truncated peptide is guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\nThe mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the protein sequence. This is the most definitive way among the options to ensure a non-functional gene product. Therefore, it is the mutation most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nAccording to the provided options:\nA) Mutant 3\nB) Mutant 2\nC) Mutant 1\nD) Mutant 4\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\n**Analysis of the Problem**\n\nThe question asks to identify the mutation most likely to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by a specific gene. To eliminate the compound, the protein's function must be eliminated. Therefore, the goal is to find the mutation that is most likely to result in a completely non-functional protein, a \"knockout\" or \"null\" mutation.\n\n**Evaluating the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity**\n\nIn terms of inactivating a protein, mutations can be ranked by the severity and certainty of their effect:\n\n1.  **Nonsense Mutation:** This changes a codon for an amino acid into a STOP codon (TAA, TAG, TGA). It causes translation to halt prematurely, producing a shortened (truncated) protein. If this happens early in the gene, the resulting protein is almost certainly non-functional.\n2.  **Frameshift Mutation:** This involves an insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides that is not a multiple of three. It shifts the reading frame, altering every downstream amino acid and usually creating a premature stop codon. This is also highly likely to create a non-functional protein.\n3.  **In-frame Insertion/Deletion:** This adds or removes one or more amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein sequence intact. This can disrupt function but is less certain than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n4.  **Missense Mutation:** This changes a single amino acid. The effect is variable; it can be harmless or completely inactivate the protein, but it is not a guaranteed knockout.\n5.  **Silent Mutation:** This does not change the amino acid sequence and has no effect on protein function.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Mutant**\n\nWe will translate the first few codons of the intact gene and each mutant to see the effect of the changes. The starting point for translation is the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   **Amino Acid Sequence:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This sequence produces the functional protein we want to disable.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   **Change:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). (The `TTT` to `TTC` change is silent as both code for Phenylalanine).\n    *   **Type:** This is a **missense mutation**.\n    *   **Effect:** The protein is made in its full length but with one different amino acid. This is not guaranteed to eliminate its function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   **Change:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`.\n    *   **Type:** `TAA` is a stop codon. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   **Effect:** Protein synthesis will stop after the second amino acid. The result will be a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe), which is guaranteed to be non-functional. This is the most effective and certain way to eliminate the protein's activity.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’`\n    *   **Change:** This sequence has multiple amino acid changes (e.g., `CTC` [Leu] -> `TAC` [Tyr]; `ACT` [Thr] -> `GTC` [Val]).\n    *   **Type:** Multiple **missense mutations**.\n    *   **Effect:** A full-length protein is still produced. While changing multiple amino acids increases the chance of disruption, it is not as definitive as the guaranteed truncation caused by a nonsense mutation.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   **Change:** A comparison with the intact sequence shows that the codon `GGT` has been deleted.\n    *   **Type:** This is an **in-frame deletion** (removing one amino acid, Glycine).\n    *   **Effect:** The reading frame is maintained, and the rest of the protein is synthesized correctly. Removing one amino acid can be disruptive but is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nMutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon (a nonsense mutation) at the third position in the coding sequence. This will cause protein synthesis to terminate almost immediately, resulting in a severely truncated and completely non-functional peptide. This is the most reliable and probable way among the given options to eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nTherefore, Mutant 2 is the correct answer. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The primary goal is to find the mutation that will *most probably* eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. The problem states a gene synthesizes a protein responsible for this compound. Therefore, the most effective approach is to introduce a mutation that creates a non-functional or \"knockout\" version of the protein.\n\n2.  **Hierarchy of Mutation Effects:** Not all mutations have the same impact on protein function. The likelihood of causing a complete loss of function generally follows this order, from most to least severe:\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation (most severe):** Introduces a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated (shortened) and almost always non-functional protein.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation (very severe):** An insertion or deletion of bases not in a multiple of three. This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n    *   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion (less severe):** Removes or adds one or more amino acids but leaves the rest of the protein sequence intact. The protein may or may not be functional.\n    *   **Missense Mutation (least severe of the function-altering types):** Substitutes one amino acid for another. The effect is variable; it can range from negligible to a complete loss of function, making it an uncertain way to achieve a knockout.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Intact and Mutant Sequences:** We must break down the DNA sequences into three-base codons, starting with the `ATG` start codon, and translate them to see the effect on the amino acid sequence.\n\n    *   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n        *   **Protein Sequence:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n        *   **Changes:** `TTT` -> `TTC` (silent, both Phe) and `CTC` (Leu) -> `TAC` (Tyr).\n        *   **Type:** This is a **missense mutation**. A full-length protein is made with one different amino acid. It is not guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n        *   **Changes:** `TTT` -> `TTC` (silent) and `CTC` (Leu) -> `TAA`. The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**.\n        *   **Type:** This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n        *   **Effect:** Protein synthesis will halt after the second amino acid. The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe), which will be completely non-functional. This is the most reliable way to eliminate the protein's function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n        *   **Changes:** Contains multiple changes, including `CTC` (Leu) -> `TAC` (Tyr) and `ACT` (Thr) -> `GTC` (Val).\n        *   **Type:** Multiple **missense mutations**. A full-length protein is still produced. While more disruptive than one change, its inactivation is less certain than that of Mutant 2.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n        *   **Changes:** Comparing the sequence to the intact gene (`...GCT GGT ACT...` vs `...GCT ACT...`) shows that the `GGT` codon has been deleted.\n        *   **Type:** This is an **in-frame deletion** of one amino acid (Glycine). The reading frame is preserved. This alters the protein but is less severe than a premature stop codon that eliminates the vast majority of the protein.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon at the third position of the protein. This is a nonsense mutation that guarantees the production of a severely truncated and non-functional protein. Among the given choices, this is the most definitive and probable way to eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine which mutation will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to make the gene non-functional so that it can no longer produce the protein that synthesizes the anti-nutritional compound. We are looking for the mutation most likely to result in a complete loss of protein function, often called a \"knockout\" or \"null\" mutation.\n\n**2. Analyze the Intact Gene Sequence**\nThe gene's DNA sequence is read in groups of three bases called codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon. Each codon corresponds to an amino acid (or a stop signal).\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n*   **Amino Acid Translation:**\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Met) - The starting amino acid.\n    *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (Phe)\n    *   `CTC` -> Leucine (Leu)\n    *   `GCT` -> Alanine (Ala)\n*   The normal, functional protein begins with the sequence `Met-Phe-Leu-Ala...`.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Mutant for its Effect on the Protein**\nWe will now analyze each mutant sequence to see what kind of mutation it introduces and how that affects the final protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n    *   **Changes:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). (The change in the second codon from `TTT` to `TTC` is a silent mutation, as both code for Phenylalanine).\n    *   **Type:** This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a full-length protein with a single amino acid substitution. While this *might* disrupt the protein's function, it is not guaranteed.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    *   **Changes:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), has been changed to `TAA`.\n    *   **Type:** `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   **Effect:** The ribosome, which synthesizes the protein, will stop translation when it encounters this `TAA` codon. The resulting product will be a tiny, two-amino-acid-long fragment (`Met-Phe`). A severely truncated protein like this is guaranteed to be completely non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n    *   **Changes:** This sequence has multiple changes, resulting in several amino acid substitutions (e.g., `CTC` to `TAC`, changing Leucine to Tyrosine).\n    *   **Type:** Multiple **missense mutations**. A full-length protein is still produced. While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it is still not as certain to cause complete inactivation as a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   **Changes:** This sequence has a change from `CTC` to `TAC` (a missense mutation) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon that comes after `GCT`.\n    *   **Type:** This is an **in-frame deletion** combined with a missense mutation. One amino acid is removed from the protein chain without shifting the reading frame. This alters the protein, but like a missense mutation, it is less likely to completely abolish function compared to a nonsense mutation.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe most effective and reliable way to eliminate a protein's function is to prevent it from being made. The nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the gene (the third codon). This ensures the production of a tiny, non-functional protein fragment, thus achieving the goal of knocking out the gene's function. The other mutations result in full-length or nearly full-length proteins that have a higher chance of retaining some or all of their original function.\n\nTherefore, Mutant 2 is the most probable choice.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Goal**: The primary objective is to find a mutation that *most probably* eliminates the synthesis of an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is produced by a protein, which is encoded by the gene in question. Therefore, the most reliable way to achieve this is to introduce a mutation that creates a non-functional (\"knockout\" or \"null\") protein.\n\n2.  **Understand the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity**: Not all mutations are equal in their ability to disable a protein. In general, their severity for causing a complete loss of function is ranked as follows:\n    *   **Most Severe**: **Nonsense mutations** (creating a premature stop codon) and **frameshift mutations** (inserting/deleting a number of bases not divisible by 3). Both are very likely to create a non-functional protein, especially if they occur early in the gene's coding sequence.\n    *   **Less Severe**: **Missensense mutations** (changing one amino acid to another), **in-frame deletions/insertions** (adding/removing one or more full codons). These alter the protein but do not guarantee a complete loss of function. The protein might still be partially or even fully functional.\n    *   **Least Severe**: **Silent mutations** (changing the DNA but not the resulting amino acid). These have no effect on the protein sequence.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Intact and Mutant Sequences**: We will break down each sequence into its three-base codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon, and determine the effect of each mutation.\n\n*   **Intact Gene**: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Translates to the protein: **Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...** This is the functional protein we need to disable.\n\n*   **Mutant 1**: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Change: The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). (The `TTT` to `TTC` change is silent as both code for Phenylalanine).\n    *   Mutation Type: **Missense**.\n    *   Effect: It produces a full-length protein with one different amino acid. This might affect function, but it's not a guaranteed knockout.\n\n*   **Mutant 2**: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Change: The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAA`.\n    *   Mutation Type: **Nonsense**. The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**.\n    *   Effect: Protein synthesis will be terminated prematurely after only two amino acids. The resulting product is a tiny dipeptide (Met-Phe), which is guaranteed to be completely non-functional. This is the most effective way to eliminate the protein's activity.\n\n*   **Mutant 3**: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n    *   Change: The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and later, another codon (`ACT`) is changed to `GTC` (Threonine to Valine).\n    *   Mutation Type: Multiple **missense** mutations.\n    *   Effect: A full-length protein with several altered amino acids is produced. This is more likely to be non-functional than a single missense mutation, but it is still not as definitive as a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4**: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   Change: By aligning the sequences, we see a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`) and a deletion of one entire codon (`GGT`).\n    *   Mutation Type: **In-frame deletion** combined with a missense mutation.\n    *   Effect: One amino acid (Glycine) is removed, and another (Leucine) is changed to Tyrosine. The protein is nearly full-length but altered. This is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most severe and definitive of all the options. By introducing a stop codon at the very beginning of the coding sequence, it ensures that a functional protein cannot be synthesized. This is the most probable mutation to successfully eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nTherefore, Mutant 2 is the correct answer. The question lists \"Mutant 2\" as option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThe goal is to find the mutation most likely to inactivate the gene that synthesizes an anti-nutritional compound. A non-functional gene will not produce a functional protein, thus eliminating the compound.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal and Genetic Code:** We need to find the mutation that most severely disrupts the protein synthesis process. The DNA is read in three-base units called codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon. Each codon corresponds to an amino acid, except for \"stop codons\" which terminate the process.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Intact Gene Sequence:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   This is broken down into codons to translate into a protein.\n    *   Codon 1: `ATG` -> Methionine (Met), the start of the protein.\n    *   Codon 2: `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (Phe).\n    *   Codon 3: `CTC` -> Leucine (Leu).\n    *   The resulting protein begins: Met-Phe-Leu... This is the functional protein we want to disable.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Mutant:**\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n        *   Change: The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). The change in the second codon from `TTT` to `TTC` is silent as both code for Phenylalanine.\n        *   Mutation Type: **Missense mutation**. This changes one amino acid. This might alter or even disable the protein, but it is not a guaranteed method for inactivation, as the protein is still produced at full length.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n        *   Change: The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAA`.\n        *   Mutation Type: **Nonsense mutation**. The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**.\n        *   Effect: Protein synthesis will stop after the second amino acid. The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe). This peptide will be completely non-functional. This is the most reliable and severe mutation among the choices for inactivating a gene.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n        *   Change: This sequence shows multiple changes, including `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine) and `ACT` (Threonine) to `GTC` (Valine).\n        *   Mutation Type: **Multiple missense mutations**. While changing several amino acids increases the chance of inactivating the protein compared to a single change, it is still not as definitive as a premature stop codon.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n        *   Change: This appears to be a combination of a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`) and a deletion of one whole codon (`GGT`).\n        *   Mutation Type: **In-frame deletion** plus a missense mutation. An in-frame deletion removes an amino acid but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. This alters the protein but is generally less disruptive than a nonsense mutation that halts the entire process.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nTo most *probably* eliminate the compound, we need the mutation that most certainly creates a non-functional protein. A nonsense mutation that introduces a premature stop codon very early in the sequence is the most effective way to do this. Mutant 2 changes the third codon to a stop codon (`TAA`), which guarantees that only a useless two-amino-acid fragment is produced. This is a much more definitive \"knockout\" than the missense or in-frame mutations seen in the other options.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo solve this problem, we must determine which of the described mutations is most likely to result in a non-functional protein, thereby eliminating the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Goal:** The primary objective is to \"knock out\" the gene's function. The most effective way to do this is to introduce a mutation that prevents a full-length, functional protein from being synthesized.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Intact Gene's Sequence:** The gene starts with `5’-ATG...`, which is the start codon for protein synthesis (translating to Methionine). The DNA is read in non-overlapping triplets called codons.\n    *   **Codon 1:** `ATG` (Methionine - Met)\n    *   **Codon 2:** `TTT` (Phenylalanine - Phe)\n    *   **Codon 3:** `CTC` (Leucine - Leu)\n    *   The functional protein starts with the amino acid sequence: Met-Phe-Leu...\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Effect of Each Mutation:** We will translate the beginning of each mutant sequence to see how the protein is affected. The most severe mutations are those that cause a premature stop in translation (nonsense mutations) or alter the entire sequence of amino acids (frameshift mutations).\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...`\n        *   Analysis: The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). The change in the second codon from `TTT` to `TTC` is silent, as both code for Phenylalanine.\n        *   Mutation Type: **Missense mutation**. This changes one amino acid. The resulting protein will be full-length but with one substitution. This *might* inactivate the protein, but it is not guaranteed.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...`\n        *   Analysis: The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), has been changed to `TAA`.\n        *   Mutation Type: **Nonsense mutation**. `TAA` is a **stop codon**.\n        *   Effect: Protein synthesis will terminate after the second amino acid. The result will be a tiny dipeptide (Met-Phe), which is guaranteed to be non-functional. This is the most effective way to eliminate the protein's function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...`\n        *   Analysis: This sequence contains multiple substitutions, such as `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n        *   Mutation Type: **Multiple missense mutations**. Like Mutant 1, this creates a full-length protein with altered amino acids. While more disruptive than a single change, its effect is still less certain than a premature stop codon.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...`\n        *   Analysis: Comparing this sequence to the intact one shows a change (`CTC` to `TAC`) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon.\n        *   Mutation Type: **Missense mutation + In-frame deletion**. It changes one amino acid and removes another. The reading frame remains intact. This alters the protein but is less likely to be a complete knockout than the nonsense mutation.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe most reliable way to ensure a gene produces a non-functional protein is to introduce a premature stop codon early in the coding sequence. The mutation in **Mutant 2** changes the third codon to a `TAA` stop codon. This will halt protein synthesis almost immediately, creating a severely truncated and non-functional peptide. This is the mutation that will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which mutation is most likely to result in a non-functional protein, thereby eliminating the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound. We must analyze the effect of each mutation on the gene's protein-coding sequence.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Intact Gene and the Goal\nThe goal is to find a \"knockout\" mutation—one that most reliably abolishes the function of the protein encoded by the gene. The intact gene begins with the sequence `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`.\nLet's translate the first few codons:\n*   `ATG`: Methionine (Met) - This is the START codon.\n*   `TTT`: Phenylalanine (Phe)\n*   `CTC`: Leucine (Leu)\n*   `GCT`: Alanine (Ala)\nThe normal, functional protein starts with the amino acid sequence: **Met-Phe-Leu-Ala...**\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity\nIn terms of their likelihood of causing a complete loss of protein function, mutations generally rank as follows, from most severe to least severe:\n1.  **Nonsense Mutation:** Creates a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated protein. If it occurs early, it is almost guaranteed to be non-functional.\n2.  **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of bases not in a multiple of three. This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually creating a non-functional protein.\n3.  **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid for another. The effect is variable; it may or may not disable the protein.\n4.  **Silent Mutation:** Changes the DNA but not the amino acid sequence. It has no effect on the protein's function.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Mutant\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** Sequence `5’-ATGTTCTACGCT...`\n    *   Alignment: `ATG TTC TAC GCT...`\n    *   Changes: The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). The change from `TTT` to `TTC` is silent as both code for Phenylalanine.\n    *   **Type:** This is a **missense mutation**. It creates a full-length protein with a single amino acid substitution. This might inactivate the protein, but it is not a guaranteed outcome.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** Sequence `5’-ATGTTCTAAGCT...`\n    *   Alignment: `ATG TTC TAA GCT...`\n    *   Changes: The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`.\n    *   **Type:** `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   **Effect:** Protein synthesis will stop after the second amino acid. The result will be a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe), which is guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** Sequence `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGT...`\n    *   Alignment: `ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT...`\n    *   Changes: The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). There are also other missense mutations further down the provided sequence (`ACT` to `GTC`).\n    *   **Type:** These are **multiple missense mutations**. While more likely to be disruptive than a single missense mutation, this still produces a full-length protein and is not as certain to cause a loss of function as a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** Sequence `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACT...`\n    *   Alignment: `ATG TTT TAC GCT --- ACT...`\n    *   Changes: This sequence shows both a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon.\n    *   **Type:** This is a combination of a missense mutation and an **in-frame deletion** (removing one amino acid). While this alters the protein, the reading frame for the rest of the sequence is maintained. This is less severe than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n### Conclusion\nComparing the effects, the **nonsense mutation** in **Mutant 2** is the most catastrophic. By introducing a stop codon at the third position, it ensures that only a tiny, non-functional protein fragment is synthesized. This is the most reliable and probable way to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound among the choices provided.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe main objective is to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is produced by a protein, which is encoded by a gene. Therefore, the most reliable way to achieve this goal is to introduce a mutation that makes the protein non-functional. We are looking for the mutation that will *most probably* lead to a complete loss of function.\n\n**2. Analyze the Intact Gene Sequence**\nThe gene sequence begins with `5’-ATG...`. `ATG` is the universal start codon, which initiates the process of translating the DNA code into a protein. The DNA is read in triplets called codons.\n*   Intact Gene Codons: `ATG` `TTT` `CTC` `GCT` ...\n*   Translated Amino Acids: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala ...\nThis is the sequence of the normal, functional protein.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Mutation and Its Effect**\nWe will now analyze each mutant sequence to see how it alters the resulting protein. The most severe and reliable knockout mutations are those that cause a premature stop in protein synthesis (nonsense mutation) or completely scramble the amino acid sequence (frameshift mutation).\n\n*   **Mutant 1: 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...**\n    *   Change: The third codon, `CTC` (coding for Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (coding for Tyrosine).\n    *   Type of Mutation: This is a **missense mutation**. It substitutes one amino acid for another.\n    *   Effect: A full-length protein is still produced, but with one amino acid changed. This *might* disable the protein if the amino acid is in a critical location, but it's not guaranteed. The function might only be altered or even be unaffected.\n\n*   **Mutant 3: 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT...** and **Mutant 4: 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...**\n    *   Type of Mutation: These mutants also involve **missense mutations** and, in the case of Mutant 4, an **in-frame deletion** (deleting 3 bases, or one whole codon). Like Mutant 1, these produce a full-length or near-full-length protein with some changes. While these alterations could disrupt the protein, they are less certain to cause a complete loss of function compared to more drastic mutations.\n\n*   **Mutant 2: 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...**\n    *   Change: The third codon, `CTC` (coding for Leucine), is changed to `TAA`.\n    *   Type of Mutation: A quick check of a codon table reveals that `TAA` is a **STOP codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   Effect: When the cellular machinery (the ribosome) encounters a STOP codon, it ceases translation. Because this STOP codon appears at the third position, protein synthesis will halt after only two amino acids (Methionine and Phenylalanine) have been linked together. The result is a severely truncated, tiny peptide fragment that is guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nComparing the effects of the mutations:\n*   Mutants 1, 3, and 4 produce altered but full-length or near-full-length proteins. Their loss of function is possible but not certain.\n*   Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon very early in the sequence. This guarantees the production of a non-functional, severely shortened protein fragment.\n\nTherefore, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the one that will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound by ensuring the gene's product cannot be made. Mutant 2 corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Objective:** The central task is to identify the mutation that will *most probably* eliminate an unwanted compound. This compound is produced by a protein, which is encoded by the gene in question. Therefore, the goal is to find the mutation most likely to result in a completely non-functional protein, a \"knockout\" or \"null\" mutation.\n\n2.  **Understand Gene Translation and Mutation Impact:** The genetic code is read in three-base units called codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon. The effect of a mutation depends on how it alters the protein sequence. We can rank mutations by the severity of their impact on protein function:\n    *   **Most Severe:** A **nonsense mutation**, which changes a codon for an amino acid into a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`). This terminates protein synthesis prematurely. If this happens early in the sequence, the resulting protein fragment is almost certainly non-functional.\n    *   **Also Very Severe:** A **frameshift mutation** (insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by 3). This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence.\n    *   **Less Severe:** **Missensense mutations** (which change one amino acid to another) and **in-frame deletions/insertions** (which add or remove entire amino acids). These alter the protein but are less certain to cause a complete loss of function, as a full-length (or near full-length) protein is still produced.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Intact Gene Sequence:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   The first three codons translate to the amino acids: Methionine (Met) - Phenylalanine (Phe) - Leucine (Leu). This is the beginning of the functional protein.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Each Mutant's Sequence:**\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n        The change is from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It changes a single amino acid. The protein is still made to its full length, and its function might be reduced, unchanged, or eliminated. The outcome is uncertain.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n        The change is from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**. Protein synthesis will halt after the second amino acid, creating a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (`Met-Phe`). This is guaranteed to be a non-functional product.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT...-3’`\n        The change is from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine), with other changes downstream. These are **multiple missense mutations**. While more disruptive than a single change, a full-length protein is still synthesized, so the effect remains less certain than a premature stop.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TACGCT ACT...-3’`\n        By aligning with the original sequence, we can see the `GGT` codon is deleted. This is an **in-frame deletion**, which removes one amino acid but keeps the downstream reading frame intact. The effect is less severe and less certain than a nonsense mutation.\n\n5.  **Synthesize and Conclude:** The nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most destructive type of mutation presented. By creating a stop codon at the third position in the sequence, it guarantees that a functional protein cannot be synthesized. This is the most reliable way among the given options to eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n6.  **Match to Final Options:** The question lists the options as:\n    *   A) Mutant 2\n    *   B) Mutant 1\n    *   C) Mutant 3\n    *   D) Mutant 4\n\n    Since Mutant 2 is the correct choice, the corresponding answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"

The compound is synthesized by a protein, which is encoded by the gene in question. Therefore, the goal is to find a mutation that makes the protein non-functional.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity:** To make a protein non-functional, some mutations are more effective than others. In general, the hierarchy from most to least likely to cause a complete loss of function is:\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation (introduces a premature stop codon):** This terminates protein synthesis, creating a truncated (shortened) protein. If it happens early in the sequence, the resulting protein fragment is almost guaranteed to be non-functional.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation (indel not a multiple of 3):** This shifts the entire reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually creating a premature stop codon by chance. This is also very likely to result in a non-functional protein.\n    *   **Missense Mutation (changes one amino acid):** The effect is uncertain. It might destroy the protein's function if the amino acid is critical, but it might also have little or no effect. It is not a guaranteed \"knockout\".\n    *   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion (indel is a multiple of 3):** This removes or adds amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein sequence correct. It is less severe than a frameshift or early nonsense mutation.\n\n3.  **Translate and Compare the Gene Sequences:** We will now examine the first few codons of the intact gene and each mutant.\n\n    *   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC ... -3’`\n        *   Translation: Methionine (Met) - Phenylalanine (Phe) - Leucine (Leu) ...\n        *   This is the functional protein we want to disable.\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC ... -3’`\n        *   Change: `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n        *   Mutation Type: **Missense**.\n        *   Outcome: Not guaranteed to eliminate function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA ... -3’`\n        *   Change: `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`.\n        *   Mutation Type: **Nonsense**. `TAA` is a stop codon.\n        *   Outcome: Protein synthesis will stop after the second amino acid (Phe). The resulting product is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe), which is guaranteed to be non-functional. This is the most probable way to eliminate the compound.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC ... -3’`\n        *   Change: `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), plus other missense mutations downstream.\n        *   Mutation Type: **Multiple Missense**.\n        *   Outcome: While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it is still less certain to be a complete knockout than the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TACGCTACTT... -3’`\n        *   Change: This involves a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`) and a deletion of one complete codon (`GGT`) downstream.\n        *   Mutation Type: **In-frame deletion** combined with a missense mutation.\n        *   Outcome: This removes an amino acid from the protein chain but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. The effect is significant but less severe than an early stop codon.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon (`TAA`) at the third position in the coding sequence. This is a nonsense mutation that ensures the production of a severely truncated and non-functional protein. This is the most definitive and probable way among the given options to achieve the goal of eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe options are:\nA) Mutant 2\nB) Mutant 4\nC) Mutant 3\nD) Mutant 1\n\nBased on the analysis, Mutant 2 is the correct choice.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe main objective is to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. The gene provided is responsible for synthesizing this compound. Therefore, to stop the production of the compound, we need to find the mutation that is most likely to make the protein produced by this gene completely non-functional.\n\n**2. Analyze the Intact Gene Sequence**\nThe gene sequence is read by the cell's machinery in groups of three DNA bases, called codons. Translation starts at the `ATG` start codon.\n*   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ...-3’`\n*   **Translation into Codons:**\n    *   Codon 1: `ATG` -> Methionine (Met) - This is the START of the protein.\n    *   Codon 2: `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (Phe)\n    *   Codon 3: `CTC` -> Leucine (Leu)\n    *   Codon 4: `GCT` -> Alanine (Ala)\n*   The functional protein begins with the amino acid sequence: **Met-Phe-Leu-Ala...**\n\n**3. Evaluate the Impact of Each Mutation**\nWe must determine which type of mutation is most likely to cause a complete loss of protein function.\n*   **Most Severe:** Nonsense (premature stop codon) and Frameshift (scrambled reading frame) mutations are the most likely to create a non-functional protein, especially when they occur early in the gene.\n*   **Less Severe:** Missense (amino acid substitution) and in-frame deletions/insertions might alter or reduce function, but a functional protein may still be produced.\n\nNow, let's analyze each mutant:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT ...-3’`\n    *   **Codon changes:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). Note: The change from `TTT` to `TTC` is a silent mutation, as both code for Phenylalanine.\n    *   **Mutation Type:** This is a **missense mutation**. It substitutes one amino acid for another. The resulting full-length protein might have reduced function or might function normally. This is not a guaranteed way to eliminate function.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ...-3’`\n    *   **Codon changes:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   **Mutation Type:** This is also a **missense mutation**, similar to Mutant 1. It is not the most probable way to guarantee a non-functional protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’` (after deletion)\n    *   **Codon changes:** Comparing the longer string in the prompt to the intact sequence, we see a deletion of the codon `GGT`.\n    *   **Mutation Type:** This is an **in-frame deletion**. It removes one amino acid (Glycine) from the protein but keeps the downstream reading frame intact. Like a missense mutation, this will alter the protein, but it is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than more severe mutations.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT ...-3’`\n    *   **Codon changes:** The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`.\n    *   **What is `TAA`?** `TAA` is one of the three **STOP codons**.\n    *   **Mutation Type:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. When the ribosome encounters this codon, it stops protein synthesis.\n    *   **Effect:** The resulting \"protein\" will be only two amino acids long (Met-Phe). A severely shortened peptide like this is guaranteed to be completely non-functional.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most destructive change. By introducing a STOP signal at the very beginning of the protein sequence (the third codon), it ensures that a functional, full-length protein cannot be produced. This is the mutation that will most probably eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Goal:** The objective is to select the mutation that will *most probably* eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by a specific gene. Therefore, the goal is to introduce a mutation that makes the protein non-functional.\n\n2.  **Understand Gene Expression and Mutations:** A gene's DNA sequence is transcribed into mRNA, which is then translated into a protein. The translation process reads the sequence in three-base units called codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon. The most severe mutations, those most likely to create a non-functional (\"knockout\") protein, are:\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes a normal codon into a STOP codon (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). This halts protein synthesis prematurely, creating a short, non-functional protein.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three. This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n    *   Other mutations like **missense** (changing one amino acid) or **in-frame deletions/insertions** (removing/adding amino acids without shifting the frame) are less likely to cause a complete loss of function.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Intact Gene Sequence:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Breaking it into codons gives us the start of the amino acid sequence:\n        *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Start)\n        *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine\n        *   `CTC` -> Leucine\n    *   The functional protein begins: `Met-Phe-Leu...`\n\n4.  **Evaluate Each Mutant:**\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** Sequence `5’-ATGTTCTACGCT...-3’`\n        *   Codon change: The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). (The `TTT` to `TTC` change is silent).\n        *   Mutation Type: **Missense**. This results in a single amino acid substitution. This *might* disable the protein, but it is not guaranteed.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** Sequence `5’-ATGTTCTAAGCT...-3’`\n        *   Codon change: The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAA`.\n        *   Mutation Type: **Nonsense**. The codon `TAA` is a **STOP codon**.\n        *   Effect: Protein synthesis will stop after the second amino acid. The result is a tiny dipeptide (`Met-Phe`). This peptide will be completely non-functional. This is the most certain way to eliminate the protein's function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** Sequence `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGT...-3’`\n        *   Codon change: Comparing the sequence shows multiple changes, likely a mix of substitutions and/or a frameshift. The clearest change is `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine), a missense mutation. While complex mutations are disruptive, the presence of a clear nonsense mutation in another option is a more direct path to a functional knockout.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** Sequence `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTT...-3’`\n        *   Codon change: Comparison shows the codon `GGT` has been deleted from the original sequence. This is a 3-base pair deletion.\n        *   Mutation Type: **In-frame deletion**. It removes one amino acid (Glycine) but does not shift the reading frame for the rest of the protein. Like a missense mutation, this is not a guaranteed way to inactivate the protein.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The most severe and definitive mutation is the **nonsense mutation** found in Mutant 2. It introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the gene, ensuring that a functional, full-length protein cannot be produced. This is the most probable mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. The question lists Mutant 2 as option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n1.  **Analyze the Objective:** The goal is to find the mutation that will *most probably* eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. This compound is produced by a protein encoded by the gene in question. Therefore, the most effective strategy is to introduce a mutation that makes the protein non-functional.\n\n2.  **Understand Mutation Severity:** The likelihood of a mutation rendering a protein non-functional depends on the type of mutation and its location. A mutation occurring early in the coding sequence is generally more damaging. The most severe types of mutations are:\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** Changes an amino acid-coding codon into a stop codon (e.g., TAA, TAG, TGA). This causes protein synthesis to halt prematurely, creating a short, truncated, and almost certainly non-functional protein.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of bases not in a multiple of three. This shifts the entire reading frame, scrambling all downstream amino acids and usually leading to a premature stop codon.\n    *   **Less Severe Mutations:** Missense mutations (changing one amino acid), silent mutations (no amino acid change), and in-frame deletions/insertions (removing/adding whole amino acids) are less certain to cause a complete loss of function.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Intact Gene and the Mutants:** Let's break down the DNA sequences into three-base codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n    *   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n        *   This translates to the amino acid sequence: **Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...** This is the functional protein we want to disable.\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n        *   Change: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). The change from `TTT` to `TTC` is silent as both code for Phenylalanine.\n        *   Type: This is a **missense mutation**. It produces a full-length protein with a single amino acid substitution. This might affect function, but it's not a guaranteed knockout.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n        *   Change: The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`.\n        *   Type: **TAA is a stop codon.** This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n        *   Effect: Protein synthesis will terminate after the second amino acid. The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe), which will be completely non-functional. This is the most reliable way to eliminate the protein's function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT...-3’`\n        *   The full sequence string (`ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCT...`) when compared to the intact string shows multiple base substitutions resulting in multiple **missense mutations**. While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it's still less certain to be a complete knockout than a premature stop codon.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TACGCTACTTCT...-3’`\n        *   Comparing the full string to the intact string reveals a deletion of the `GGT` codon. This is an **in-frame deletion**, which removes a single amino acid (Glycine) from the protein. While disruptive, it keeps the rest of the protein's reading frame intact and is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most severe and definitive mutation among the choices. It introduces a stop codon at the third position of the coding sequence, ensuring that a functional protein cannot be synthesized. This is the mutation that will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. The question lists Mutant 2 as option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n*   **Step 1: Understand the objective.** The main goal is to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound that is synthesized by a specific gene. The most reliable way to achieve this is to introduce a mutation that makes the protein produced by this gene completely non-functional (a \"knockout\" or \"null\" mutation).\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the hierarchy of mutation severity.** We need to find the mutation that will most probably result in a non-functional protein. The general order of severity for inactivating a protein is as follows:\n    1.  **Nonsense Mutation:** Creates a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated and almost always non-functional protein.\n    2.  **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of bases not in a multiple of three, which scrambles the entire amino acid sequence downstream and usually results in a non-functional protein.\n    3.  **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** Removes or adds one or more complete amino acids. This can be disruptive but may not lead to a complete loss of function.\n    4.  **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid for another. The effect is variable and might not disable the protein.\n    5.  **Silent Mutation:** Changes the DNA but not the amino acid. Has no effect on the protein's function.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze each mutant's genetic sequence.** We will compare each mutant to the intact gene by reading the DNA in three-base codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n\n    *   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT ... -3’`\n        *   Translated protein sequence starts: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala ...\n        *   This is the functional protein we want to disable.\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT ... -3’`\n        *   This introduces a missense mutation, changing the third codon `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine). (The change from `TTT` to `TTC` is silent as both code for Phenylalanine).\n        *   **Effect:** A single amino acid is changed. This is not guaranteed to eliminate the protein's function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT ... -3’`\n        *   This introduces a **nonsense mutation**, changing the third codon `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAA` (a **Stop Codon**).\n        *   **Effect:** Protein synthesis will halt after the second amino acid. The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid-long fragment (Met-Phe), which is guaranteed to be completely non-functional. This is a highly effective and probable way to achieve the goal.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ...-3’`\n        *   This sequence shows multiple missense mutations, for example changing `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine) and `ACT` (Threonine) to `GTC` (Valine) when compared to the full intact sequence.\n        *   **Effect:** Multiple amino acids are changed, but a full-length protein is still produced. While more disruptive than Mutant 1, this is still less certain to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT ...-3’`\n        *   When aligned with the intact sequence, this mutant shows an in-frame deletion of the `GGT` codon (which codes for Glycine) and a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`).\n        *   **Effect:** Removing one amino acid and changing another alters the protein but does not stop its synthesis or change the downstream reading frame. This is less severe than a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Step 4: Conclude which mutation is most probable.** The nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most disruptive change. By introducing a stop codon at the very beginning of the coding sequence, it ensures that a functional, full-length protein cannot be produced.

This is best achieved by introducing a mutation that prevents the formation of a functional protein. The most severe mutations, in terms of protein function, are those that drastically alter the protein's sequence or cause its premature termination.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Intact Gene Sequence:** The gene begins with `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`.\n    *   The sequence is read in three-base units called codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon.\n    *   `ATG` codes for Methionine (Met), the first amino acid.\n    *   `TTT` codes for Phenylalanine (Phe).\n    *   `CTC` codes for Leucine (Leu).\n    *   The normal, functional protein starts with the amino acid sequence: Met-Phe-Leu...\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Impact of Each Mutation:** We will compare each mutant to the intact gene.\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** The sequence `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, which substitutes one amino acid for another. The full-length protein is still produced, and it may or may not be functional. The effect is uncertain.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** The sequence `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. According to the genetic code, **`TAA` is a stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n        *   **Effect:** The ribosome, which translates the gene into a protein, will stop protein synthesis at this point. The resulting product will be a tiny, two-amino-acid-long peptide (Met-Phe). This fragment is guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** This sequence contains multiple changes, including `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine). These are **missense mutations**. While changing multiple amino acids is more disruptive than changing one, it is still less certain to cause a complete loss of function than a premature stop codon.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** This sequence appears to contain a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`) and a deletion of one complete codon (`GGT`). This is an **in-frame deletion**, which removes one amino acid but keeps the rest of the protein's reading frame intact. While this will alter the protein, it is less disruptive than a nonsense mutation that halts production entirely.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The question asks for the mutation that will *most probably* eliminate the compound.\n    *   Missesnse mutations (Mutant 1, 3) and in-frame deletions (Mutant 4) produce a full-length or near-full-length protein that might retain function. The outcome is not guaranteed.\n    *   A nonsense mutation (Mutant 2), especially one occurring so early in the gene, guarantees that translation is stopped prematurely. The resulting, severely truncated protein will be non-functional.\n    *   Therefore, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the most reliable and probable way to eliminate the protein's function and, consequently, the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nThe correct choice is Mutant 2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe main objective is to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound that is synthesized by a protein. To achieve this, we need to find the mutation that is most likely to make the protein completely non-functional.\n\n**2. Analyze the Intact Gene and Protein Synthesis**\nThe gene sequence provided begins with `5’-ATG...`, which is the universal start codon. Protein synthesis (translation) reads the DNA sequence in groups of three bases, called codons.\n*   **Intact Gene codons:** `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...`\n*   **Translation into amino acids:**\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Met) - This is the start of the protein.\n    *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (Phe)\n    *   `CTC` -> Leucine (Leu)\n    *   `GCT` -> Alanine (Ala)\n*   The normal, functional protein begins with the sequence: `Met-Phe-Leu-Ala...`\n\n**3. Evaluate the Impact of Different Types of Mutations**\nWe are looking for the mutation with the most severe impact on the final protein. The hierarchy of severity is generally:\n*   **Nonsense Mutation (most severe for this goal):** Changes an amino acid codon into a STOP codon (TAA, TAG, TGA). This halts protein synthesis, creating a truncated (shortened) and almost always non-functional protein.\n*   **Frameshift Mutation (also very severe):** An insertion or deletion of a number of bases that is not a multiple of three. This shifts the reading frame, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and usually creating a non-functional protein.\n*   **Missense Mutation (less severe):** Changes one amino acid to another. This might or might not disable the protein.\n*   **Silent Mutation (least severe):** Changes the DNA but not the amino acid. It has no effect on the protein's function.\n\n**4. Analyze Each Mutant**\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC ...-3’`\n    *   Compared to the intact gene (`ATG TTT CTC...`), the third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a full-length protein with a single amino acid substitution. This may or may not eliminate the protein's function.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Compared to the intact gene, this also has a change in the third codon from `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is also a **missense mutation** and has the same uncertain outcome as Mutant 1.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TACGCT ACTTCT...-3’`\n    *   This mutation combines a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`) with a deletion of one complete codon (`GGT`). This is an **in-frame deletion**, which removes one amino acid. While this is more disruptive than a simple missense mutation, the rest of the protein is synthesized correctly, so a total loss of function is not guaranteed.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT ...-3’`\n    *   Compared to the intact gene, the third codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAA`.\n    *   The `TAA` codon is a **STOP codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   **Effect:** Protein synthesis will halt at this position. The resulting \"protein\" will be a tiny fragment only two amino acids long (`Met-Phe`). Such a severely truncated peptide is guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\nThe mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the protein sequence. This is the most definitive way among the options to ensure a non-functional gene product. Therefore, it is the mutation most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nAccording to the provided options:\nA) Mutant 3\nB) Mutant 2\nC) Mutant 1\nD) Mutant 4\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\n**Analysis of the Problem**\n\nThe question asks to identify the mutation most likely to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is synthesized by a protein encoded by a specific gene. To eliminate the compound, the protein's function must be eliminated. Therefore, the goal is to find the mutation that is most likely to result in a completely non-functional protein, a \"knockout\" or \"null\" mutation.\n\n**Evaluating the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity**\n\nIn terms of inactivating a protein, mutations can be ranked by the severity and certainty of their effect:\n\n1.  **Nonsense Mutation:** This changes a codon for an amino acid into a STOP codon (TAA, TAG, TGA). It causes translation to halt prematurely, producing a shortened (truncated) protein. If this happens early in the gene, the resulting protein is almost certainly non-functional.\n2.  **Frameshift Mutation:** This involves an insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides that is not a multiple of three. It shifts the reading frame, altering every downstream amino acid and usually creating a premature stop codon. This is also highly likely to create a non-functional protein.\n3.  **In-frame Insertion/Deletion:** This adds or removes one or more amino acids but keeps the rest of the protein sequence intact. This can disrupt function but is less certain than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n4.  **Missense Mutation:** This changes a single amino acid. The effect is variable; it can be harmless or completely inactivate the protein, but it is not a guaranteed knockout.\n5.  **Silent Mutation:** This does not change the amino acid sequence and has no effect on protein function.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Mutant**\n\nWe will translate the first few codons of the intact gene and each mutant to see the effect of the changes. The starting point for translation is the `ATG` start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   **Amino Acid Sequence:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n    *   This sequence produces the functional protein we want to disable.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   **Change:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). (The `TTT` to `TTC` change is silent as both code for Phenylalanine).\n    *   **Type:** This is a **missense mutation**.\n    *   **Effect:** The protein is made in its full length but with one different amino acid. This is not guaranteed to eliminate its function.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   **Change:** The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`.\n    *   **Type:** `TAA` is a stop codon. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   **Effect:** Protein synthesis will stop after the second amino acid. The result will be a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe), which is guaranteed to be non-functional. This is the most effective and certain way to eliminate the protein's activity.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’`\n    *   **Change:** This sequence has multiple amino acid changes (e.g., `CTC` [Leu] -> `TAC` [Tyr]; `ACT` [Thr] -> `GTC` [Val]).\n    *   **Type:** Multiple **missense mutations**.\n    *   **Effect:** A full-length protein is still produced. While changing multiple amino acids increases the chance of disruption, it is not as definitive as the guaranteed truncation caused by a nonsense mutation.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   **Change:** A comparison with the intact sequence shows that the codon `GGT` has been deleted.\n    *   **Type:** This is an **in-frame deletion** (removing one amino acid, Glycine).\n    *   **Effect:** The reading frame is maintained, and the rest of the protein is synthesized correctly. Removing one amino acid can be disruptive but is less certain to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nMutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon (a nonsense mutation) at the third position in the coding sequence. This will cause protein synthesis to terminate almost immediately, resulting in a severely truncated and completely non-functional peptide. This is the most reliable and probable way among the given options to eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nTherefore, Mutant 2 is the correct answer. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The primary goal is to find the mutation that will *most probably* eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. The problem states a gene synthesizes a protein responsible for this compound. Therefore, the most effective approach is to introduce a mutation that creates a non-functional or \"knockout\" version of the protein.\n\n2.  **Hierarchy of Mutation Effects:** Not all mutations have the same impact on protein function. The likelihood of causing a complete loss of function generally follows this order, from most to least severe:\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation (most severe):** Introduces a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated (shortened) and almost always non-functional protein.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation (very severe):** An insertion or deletion of bases not in a multiple of three. This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually leading to a non-functional protein.\n    *   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion (less severe):** Removes or adds one or more amino acids but leaves the rest of the protein sequence intact. The protein may or may not be functional.\n    *   **Missense Mutation (least severe of the function-altering types):** Substitutes one amino acid for another. The effect is variable; it can range from negligible to a complete loss of function, making it an uncertain way to achieve a knockout.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Intact and Mutant Sequences:** We must break down the DNA sequences into three-base codons, starting with the `ATG` start codon, and translate them to see the effect on the amino acid sequence.\n\n    *   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n        *   **Protein Sequence:** Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n        *   **Changes:** `TTT` -> `TTC` (silent, both Phe) and `CTC` (Leu) -> `TAC` (Tyr).\n        *   **Type:** This is a **missense mutation**. A full-length protein is made with one different amino acid. It is not guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n        *   **Changes:** `TTT` -> `TTC` (silent) and `CTC` (Leu) -> `TAA`. The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**.\n        *   **Type:** This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n        *   **Effect:** Protein synthesis will halt after the second amino acid. The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe), which will be completely non-functional. This is the most reliable way to eliminate the protein's function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n        *   **Changes:** Contains multiple changes, including `CTC` (Leu) -> `TAC` (Tyr) and `ACT` (Thr) -> `GTC` (Val).\n        *   **Type:** Multiple **missense mutations**. A full-length protein is still produced. While more disruptive than one change, its inactivation is less certain than that of Mutant 2.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n        *   **Changes:** Comparing the sequence to the intact gene (`...GCT GGT ACT...` vs `...GCT ACT...`) shows that the `GGT` codon has been deleted.\n        *   **Type:** This is an **in-frame deletion** of one amino acid (Glycine). The reading frame is preserved. This alters the protein but is less severe than a premature stop codon that eliminates the vast majority of the protein.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon at the third position of the protein. This is a nonsense mutation that guarantees the production of a severely truncated and non-functional protein. Among the given choices, this is the most definitive and probable way to eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine which mutation will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to make the gene non-functional so that it can no longer produce the protein that synthesizes the anti-nutritional compound. We are looking for the mutation most likely to result in a complete loss of protein function, often called a \"knockout\" or \"null\" mutation.\n\n**2. Analyze the Intact Gene Sequence**\nThe gene's DNA sequence is read in groups of three bases called codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon. Each codon corresponds to an amino acid (or a stop signal).\n\n*   **Intact Gene:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n*   **Amino Acid Translation:**\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Met) - The starting amino acid.\n    *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (Phe)\n    *   `CTC` -> Leucine (Leu)\n    *   `GCT` -> Alanine (Ala)\n*   The normal, functional protein begins with the sequence `Met-Phe-Leu-Ala...`.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Mutant for its Effect on the Protein**\nWe will now analyze each mutant sequence to see what kind of mutation it introduces and how that affects the final protein.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n    *   **Changes:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). (The change in the second codon from `TTT` to `TTC` is a silent mutation, as both code for Phenylalanine).\n    *   **Type:** This is a **missense mutation**. It results in a full-length protein with a single amino acid substitution. While this *might* disrupt the protein's function, it is not guaranteed.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n    *   **Changes:** The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), has been changed to `TAA`.\n    *   **Type:** `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   **Effect:** The ribosome, which synthesizes the protein, will stop translation when it encounters this `TAA` codon. The resulting product will be a tiny, two-amino-acid-long fragment (`Met-Phe`). A severely truncated protein like this is guaranteed to be completely non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n    *   **Changes:** This sequence has multiple changes, resulting in several amino acid substitutions (e.g., `CTC` to `TAC`, changing Leucine to Tyrosine).\n    *   **Type:** Multiple **missense mutations**. A full-length protein is still produced. While more disruptive than a single missense mutation, it is still not as certain to cause complete inactivation as a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   **Changes:** This sequence has a change from `CTC` to `TAC` (a missense mutation) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon that comes after `GCT`.\n    *   **Type:** This is an **in-frame deletion** combined with a missense mutation. One amino acid is removed from the protein chain without shifting the reading frame. This alters the protein, but like a missense mutation, it is less likely to completely abolish function compared to a nonsense mutation.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nThe most effective and reliable way to eliminate a protein's function is to prevent it from being made. The nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of the gene (the third codon). This ensures the production of a tiny, non-functional protein fragment, thus achieving the goal of knocking out the gene's function. The other mutations result in full-length or nearly full-length proteins that have a higher chance of retaining some or all of their original function.\n\nTherefore, Mutant 2 is the most probable choice.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Goal**: The primary objective is to find a mutation that *most probably* eliminates the synthesis of an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is produced by a protein, which is encoded by the gene in question. Therefore, the most reliable way to achieve this is to introduce a mutation that creates a non-functional (\"knockout\" or \"null\") protein.\n\n2.  **Understand the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity**: Not all mutations are equal in their ability to disable a protein. In general, their severity for causing a complete loss of function is ranked as follows:\n    *   **Most Severe**: **Nonsense mutations** (creating a premature stop codon) and **frameshift mutations** (inserting/deleting a number of bases not divisible by 3). Both are very likely to create a non-functional protein, especially if they occur early in the gene's coding sequence.\n    *   **Less Severe**: **Missensense mutations** (changing one amino acid to another), **in-frame deletions/insertions** (adding/removing one or more full codons). These alter the protein but do not guarantee a complete loss of function. The protein might still be partially or even fully functional.\n    *   **Least Severe**: **Silent mutations** (changing the DNA but not the resulting amino acid). These have no effect on the protein sequence.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Intact and Mutant Sequences**: We will break down each sequence into its three-base codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon, and determine the effect of each mutation.\n\n*   **Intact Gene**: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Translates to the protein: **Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...** This is the functional protein we need to disable.\n\n*   **Mutant 1**: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Change: The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). (The `TTT` to `TTC` change is silent as both code for Phenylalanine).\n    *   Mutation Type: **Missense**.\n    *   Effect: It produces a full-length protein with one different amino acid. This might affect function, but it's not a guaranteed knockout.\n\n*   **Mutant 2**: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   Change: The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAA`.\n    *   Mutation Type: **Nonsense**. The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**.\n    *   Effect: Protein synthesis will be terminated prematurely after only two amino acids. The resulting product is a tiny dipeptide (Met-Phe), which is guaranteed to be completely non-functional. This is the most effective way to eliminate the protein's activity.\n\n*   **Mutant 3**: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n    *   Change: The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and later, another codon (`ACT`) is changed to `GTC` (Threonine to Valine).\n    *   Mutation Type: Multiple **missense** mutations.\n    *   Effect: A full-length protein with several altered amino acids is produced. This is more likely to be non-functional than a single missense mutation, but it is still not as definitive as a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4**: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n    *   Change: By aligning the sequences, we see a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`) and a deletion of one entire codon (`GGT`).\n    *   Mutation Type: **In-frame deletion** combined with a missense mutation.\n    *   Effect: One amino acid (Glycine) is removed, and another (Leucine) is changed to Tyrosine. The protein is nearly full-length but altered. This is less likely to cause a complete loss of function than the premature stop codon in Mutant 2.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most severe and definitive of all the options. By introducing a stop codon at the very beginning of the coding sequence, it ensures that a functional protein cannot be synthesized. This is the most probable mutation to successfully eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nTherefore, Mutant 2 is the correct answer. The question lists \"Mutant 2\" as option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThe goal is to find the mutation most likely to inactivate the gene that synthesizes an anti-nutritional compound. A non-functional gene will not produce a functional protein, thus eliminating the compound.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal and Genetic Code:** We need to find the mutation that most severely disrupts the protein synthesis process. The DNA is read in three-base units called codons, starting from the `ATG` start codon. Each codon corresponds to an amino acid, except for \"stop codons\" which terminate the process.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Intact Gene Sequence:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`\n    *   This is broken down into codons to translate into a protein.\n    *   Codon 1: `ATG` -> Methionine (Met), the start of the protein.\n    *   Codon 2: `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (Phe).\n    *   Codon 3: `CTC` -> Leucine (Leu).\n    *   The resulting protein begins: Met-Phe-Leu... This is the functional protein we want to disable.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Mutant:**\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’`\n        *   Change: The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). The change in the second codon from `TTT` to `TTC` is silent as both code for Phenylalanine.\n        *   Mutation Type: **Missense mutation**. This changes one amino acid. This might alter or even disable the protein, but it is not a guaranteed method for inactivation, as the protein is still produced at full length.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’`\n        *   Change: The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), is changed to `TAA`.\n        *   Mutation Type: **Nonsense mutation**. The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**.\n        *   Effect: Protein synthesis will stop after the second amino acid. The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe). This peptide will be completely non-functional. This is the most reliable and severe mutation among the choices for inactivating a gene.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...-3’`\n        *   Change: This sequence shows multiple changes, including `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine) and `ACT` (Threonine) to `GTC` (Valine).\n        *   Mutation Type: **Multiple missense mutations**. While changing several amino acids increases the chance of inactivating the protein compared to a single change, it is still not as definitive as a premature stop codon.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’`\n        *   Change: This appears to be a combination of a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`) and a deletion of one whole codon (`GGT`).\n        *   Mutation Type: **In-frame deletion** plus a missense mutation. An in-frame deletion removes an amino acid but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. This alters the protein but is generally less disruptive than a nonsense mutation that halts the entire process.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nTo most *probably* eliminate the compound, we need the mutation that most certainly creates a non-functional protein. A nonsense mutation that introduces a premature stop codon very early in the sequence is the most effective way to do this. Mutant 2 changes the third codon to a stop codon (`TAA`), which guarantees that only a useless two-amino-acid fragment is produced. This is a much more definitive \"knockout\" than the missense or in-frame mutations seen in the other options.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo solve this problem, we must determine which of the described mutations is most likely to result in a non-functional protein, thereby eliminating the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Goal:** The primary objective is to \"knock out\" the gene's function. The most effective way to do this is to introduce a mutation that prevents a full-length, functional protein from being synthesized.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Intact Gene's Sequence:** The gene starts with `5’-ATG...`, which is the start codon for protein synthesis (translating to Methionine). The DNA is read in non-overlapping triplets called codons.\n    *   **Codon 1:** `ATG` (Methionine - Met)\n    *   **Codon 2:** `TTT` (Phenylalanine - Phe)\n    *   **Codon 3:** `CTC` (Leucine - Leu)\n    *   The functional protein starts with the amino acid sequence: Met-Phe-Leu...\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Effect of Each Mutation:** We will translate the beginning of each mutant sequence to see how the protein is affected. The most severe mutations are those that cause a premature stop in translation (nonsense mutations) or alter the entire sequence of amino acids (frameshift mutations).\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...`\n        *   Analysis: The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). The change in the second codon from `TTT` to `TTC` is silent, as both code for Phenylalanine.\n        *   Mutation Type: **Missense mutation**. This changes one amino acid. The resulting protein will be full-length but with one substitution. This *might* inactivate the protein, but it is not guaranteed.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...`\n        *   Analysis: The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), has been changed to `TAA`.\n        *   Mutation Type: **Nonsense mutation**. `TAA` is a **stop codon**.\n        *   Effect: Protein synthesis will terminate after the second amino acid. The result will be a tiny dipeptide (Met-Phe), which is guaranteed to be non-functional. This is the most effective way to eliminate the protein's function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...`\n        *   Analysis: This sequence contains multiple substitutions, such as `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n        *   Mutation Type: **Multiple missense mutations**. Like Mutant 1, this creates a full-length protein with altered amino acids. While more disruptive than a single change, its effect is still less certain than a premature stop codon.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:**\n        *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...`\n        *   Analysis: Comparing this sequence to the intact one shows a change (`CTC` to `TAC`) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon.\n        *   Mutation Type: **Missense mutation + In-frame deletion**. It changes one amino acid and removes another. The reading frame remains intact. This alters the protein but is less likely to be a complete knockout than the nonsense mutation.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe most reliable way to ensure a gene produces a non-functional protein is to introduce a premature stop codon early in the coding sequence. The mutation in **Mutant 2** changes the third codon to a `TAA` stop codon. This will halt protein synthesis almost immediately, creating a severely truncated and non-functional peptide. This is the mutation that will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which mutation is most likely to result in a non-functional protein, thereby eliminating the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound. We must analyze the effect of each mutation on the gene's protein-coding sequence.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Intact Gene and the Goal\nThe goal is to find a \"knockout\" mutation—one that most reliably abolishes the function of the protein encoded by the gene. The intact gene begins with the sequence `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’`.\nLet's translate the first few codons:\n*   `ATG`: Methionine (Met) - This is the START codon.\n*   `TTT`: Phenylalanine (Phe)\n*   `CTC`: Leucine (Leu)\n*   `GCT`: Alanine (Ala)\nThe normal, functional protein starts with the amino acid sequence: **Met-Phe-Leu-Ala...**\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate the Hierarchy of Mutation Severity\nIn terms of their likelihood of causing a complete loss of protein function, mutations generally rank as follows, from most severe to least severe:\n1.  **Nonsense Mutation:** Creates a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated protein. If it occurs early, it is almost guaranteed to be non-functional.\n2.  **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of bases not in a multiple of three. This alters the entire downstream reading frame, scrambling the amino acid sequence and usually creating a non-functional protein.\n3.  **Missense Mutation:** Changes one amino acid for another. The effect is variable; it may or may not disable the protein.\n4.  **Silent Mutation:** Changes the DNA but not the amino acid sequence. It has no effect on the protein's function.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Mutant\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** Sequence `5’-ATGTTCTACGCT...`\n    *   Alignment: `ATG TTC TAC GCT...`\n    *   Changes: The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). The change from `TTT` to `TTC` is silent as both code for Phenylalanine.\n    *   **Type:** This is a **missense mutation**. It creates a full-length protein with a single amino acid substitution. This might inactivate the protein, but it is not a guaranteed outcome.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** Sequence `5’-ATGTTCTAAGCT...`\n    *   Alignment: `ATG TTC TAA GCT...`\n    *   Changes: The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`.\n    *   **Type:** `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   **Effect:** Protein synthesis will stop after the second amino acid. The result will be a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe), which is guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** Sequence `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGT...`\n    *   Alignment: `ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT...`\n    *   Changes: The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). There are also other missense mutations further down the provided sequence (`ACT` to `GTC`).\n    *   **Type:** These are **multiple missense mutations**. While more likely to be disruptive than a single missense mutation, this still produces a full-length protein and is not as certain to cause a loss of function as a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** Sequence `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACT...`\n    *   Alignment: `ATG TTT TAC GCT --- ACT...`\n    *   Changes: This sequence shows both a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`) and a deletion of the `GGT` codon.\n    *   **Type:** This is a combination of a missense mutation and an **in-frame deletion** (removing one amino acid). While this alters the protein, the reading frame for the rest of the sequence is maintained. This is less severe than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n### Conclusion\nComparing the effects, the **nonsense mutation** in **Mutant 2** is the most catastrophic. By introducing a stop codon at the third position, it ensures that only a tiny, non-functional protein fragment is synthesized. This is the most reliable and probable way to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound among the choices provided.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe main objective is to eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This compound is produced by a protein, which is encoded by a gene. Therefore, the most reliable way to achieve this goal is to introduce a mutation that makes the protein non-functional. We are looking for the mutation that will *most probably* lead to a complete loss of function.\n\n**2. Analyze the Intact Gene Sequence**\nThe gene sequence begins with `5’-ATG...`. `ATG` is the universal start codon, which initiates the process of translating the DNA code into a protein. The DNA is read in triplets called codons.\n*   Intact Gene Codons: `ATG` `TTT` `CTC` `GCT` ...\n*   Translated Amino Acids: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala ...\nThis is the sequence of the normal, functional protein.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Mutation and Its Effect**\nWe will now analyze each mutant sequence to see how it alters the resulting protein. The most severe and reliable knockout mutations are those that cause a premature stop in protein synthesis (nonsense mutation) or completely scramble the amino acid sequence (frameshift mutation).\n\n*   **Mutant 1: 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...**\n    *   Change: The third codon, `CTC` (coding for Leucine), is changed to `TAC` (coding for Tyrosine).\n    *   Type of Mutation: This is a **missense mutation**. It substitutes one amino acid for another.\n    *   Effect: A full-length protein is still produced, but with one amino acid changed. This *might* disable the protein if the amino acid is in a critical location, but it's not guaranteed. The function might only be altered or even be unaffected.\n\n*   **Mutant 3: 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT...** and **Mutant 4: 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...**\n    *   Type of Mutation: These mutants also involve **missense mutations** and, in the case of Mutant 4, an **in-frame deletion** (deleting 3 bases, or one whole codon). Like Mutant 1, these produce a full-length or near-full-length protein with some changes. While these alterations could disrupt the protein, they are less certain to cause a complete loss of function compared to more drastic mutations.\n\n*   **Mutant 2: 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...**\n    *   Change: The third codon, `CTC` (coding for Leucine), is changed to `TAA`.\n    *   Type of Mutation: A quick check of a codon table reveals that `TAA` is a **STOP codon**. This is a **nonsense mutation**.\n    *   Effect: When the cellular machinery (the ribosome) encounters a STOP codon, it ceases translation. Because this STOP codon appears at the third position, protein synthesis will halt after only two amino acids (Methionine and Phenylalanine) have been linked together. The result is a severely truncated, tiny peptide fragment that is guaranteed to be non-functional.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nComparing the effects of the mutations:\n*   Mutants 1, 3, and 4 produce altered but full-length or near-full-length proteins. Their loss of function is possible but not certain.\n*   Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon very early in the sequence. This guarantees the production of a non-functional, severely shortened protein fragment.\n\nTherefore, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 is the one that will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound by ensuring the gene's product cannot be made. Mutant 2 corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
