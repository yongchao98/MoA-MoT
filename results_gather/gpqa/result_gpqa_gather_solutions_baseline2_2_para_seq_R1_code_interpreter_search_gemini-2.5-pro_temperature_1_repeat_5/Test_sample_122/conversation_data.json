This signals a problem in Special Relativity, requiring the consideration of time dilation.\n\n2.  **Define Frames and Variables**:\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S)**: The Galaxy's reference frame. We want to find the distance (`d`) in this frame.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S')**: The ejecta's reference frame.\n    *   **Relative Velocity (v)**: `60,000 km/s`.\n    *   **Proper Time (Δt')**: `50 s`. This is the time measured in the moving frame (S'). It is called \"proper time\" because it is measured by a clock at rest in its own frame.\n    *   **Speed of Light (c)**: `300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Goal**: We need to calculate the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's frame. The distance formula is `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame, not the ejecta's frame.\n\n4.  **Apply Time Dilation**: According to special relativity, an observer in the stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure time passing more slowly for the moving ejecta. This means the time interval measured in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) will be longer than the proper time (`Δt'`). The relationship is given by the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    where `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is calculated as:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²) `\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation**:\n    *   First, calculate the classical distance (numerator of our final expression) which would be the answer if we ignored relativity:\n        `v * Δt' = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`.\n    *   Next, calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`. The denominator of `γ` is `√(1 - v²/c²)`.\n        *   `v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`\n        *   `(v/c)² = 0.2² = 0.04`\n        *   `√(1 - 0.04) = √0.96`\n    *   Now, combine the pieces into the full distance formula:\n        `d = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt') = (v * Δt') / √(1 - v²/c²) `\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96`\n    *   Using a calculator, `√0.96 ≈ 0.9798`.\n    *   `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`.\n\n6.  **Compare to Options and Final Decision**:\n    *   The calculated distance is approximately `3,061,862 km`.\n    *   Now we compare this value to the provided options:\n        A) 2,940,000 km\n        B) 3,000,000 km (This is the incorrect, non-relativistic answer)\n        C) 2,880,000 km\n        D) 3,060,000 km\n    *   The calculated value of `3,061,862 km` is closest to **3,060,000 km**. The minor difference of ~1,862 km is due to the rounding of the value in the multiple-choice option.\n\nAll candidate agents performed the correct calculation. Despite confusion in how they assigned letters to the numerical options, they all unanimously identified `3,060,000 km` as the correct value.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis is a problem that requires the application of Einstein's theory of special relativity, specifically the concept of time dilation. Here is a comprehensive step-by-step analysis based on the provided answers.\n\n**1. Identification of Frames of Reference and Key Information**\n\n*   **Stationary Frame (S):** This is the reference frame of the Galaxy. The question asks for the distance traveled as measured from this frame.\n*   **Moving Frame (S'):** This is the reference frame of the supernova ejecta.\n*   **Relative Velocity (v):** The velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt' or Δt₀):** The time elapsed as measured within the moving frame (the ejecta's own clock) is `Δt' = 50 s`.\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** We will use the approximation `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**2. The Governing Physical Principle: Time Dilation**\n\nBecause the ejecta is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light (`v = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2c`), we cannot use classical mechanics (`distance = velocity × time`). Instead, we must account for relativistic effects.\n\nAccording to the principle of time dilation, an observer in the stationary frame (S) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) than the proper time (`Δt'`) measured in the moving frame (S').\n\n**3. Necessary Formulas**\n\nThe final answer requires combining three formulas:\n1.  **Distance in the Galaxy's frame:** `d = v × Δt`\n2.  **Time Dilation:** `Δt = γ × Δt'`\n3.  **Lorentz Factor (γ):** `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nBy substituting the formulas for `Δt` and `γ` into the distance formula, we get the complete equation:\n`d = v × (1 / √(1 - v²/c²)) × Δt'`\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nAll candidate answers correctly follow these steps:\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate the classical distance (ignoring relativity) for context.**\n    `d_classical = v × Δt' = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`.\n    This corresponds to option **D**. We know the relativistic distance must be *greater* than this value.\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n    *   Ratio `v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`.\n    *   `(v/c)² = 0.2² = 0.04`.\n    *   `1 - (v/c)² = 1 - 0.04 = 0.96`.\n    *   `γ = 1 / √0.96 ≈ 1.02062`.\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt).**\n    *   `Δt = γ × Δt' ≈ 1.02062 × 50 s ≈ 51.031 s`.\n    *   As expected, the time measured in the Galaxy's frame is slightly longer than 50 seconds.\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the distance in the Galaxy's frame (d).**\n    *   `d = v × Δt ≈ 60,000 km/s × 51.031 s ≈ 3,061,860 km`.\n    *   Alternatively, using the combined formula: `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96 ≈ 3,061,862 km`.\n\n**5. Comparison with Options and Final Decision**\n\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. We now compare this value to the options given in the question:\nA) 2,880,000 km\nB) 2,940,000 km\nC) 3,060,000 km\nD) 3,000,000 km\n\nThe calculated value of 3,061,862 km is closest to option **C) 3,060,000 km**. The small discrepancy is due to the rounding of the answer choices in the question.

Understand the Physics Principle**\n\nThe problem involves two inertial frames of reference (the Galaxy and the ejecta) moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light (`v` = 60,000 km/s, which is 20% of the speed of light, `c`). This scenario requires the application of Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, specifically the concept of **time dilation**.\n\n*   **Proper Time (`Δt₀`)**: The time measured in the moving frame of reference (the ejecta's clock) is called the proper time. Here, `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n*   **Dilated Time (`Δt`)**: An observer in the stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval for the same event. This dilated time `Δt` is what must be used to calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n**2. Formulate the Calculation**\n\n*   **Step 1: Find the time (`Δt`) in the Galaxy's reference frame.**\n    The time dilation formula is:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n*   **Step 2: Find the distance (`d`) in the Galaxy's reference frame.**\n    The distance is the velocity multiplied by the time measured in the same frame:\n    `d = v * Δt`\n\n    Substituting the expression for `Δt` from Step 1, we get the complete formula:\n    `d = v * γ * Δt₀ = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n**3. Perform the Calculation**\n\n*   **Given values:**\n    *   `v = 60,000 km/s`\n    *   `Δt₀ = 50 s`\n    *   `c = 300,000 km/s`\n\n*   **Calculate the classical distance (numerator):**\n    `v * Δt₀ = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`\n    (This would be the answer if relativity were ignored, matching option D).\n\n*   **Calculate the relativistic denominator:**\n    *   Ratio `v/c` = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2\n    *   Ratio squared `(v/c)²` = (0.2)² = 0.04\n    *   Denominator = `√(1 - 0.04) = √(0.96)`\n\n*   **Calculate the final distance:**\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √(0.96)`\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798`\n    `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**4. Compare the Result with the Options**\n\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Let's compare this with the given options:\n*   A) 2,880,000 km\n*   B) 2,940,000 km\n*   C) 3,060,000 km\n*   D) 3,000,000 km\n\nThe calculated value of 3,061,862 km is closest to **3,060,000 km**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nAll the candidate answers correctly identified the need for time dilation and performed the correct calculation. The minor discrepancies in the final chosen letter (e.g., some chose A, B, C, or D) arose from inconsistent labeling of the options within their individual responses. However, the underlying physics, the calculation, and the resulting numerical value (~3,062,000 km) were unanimously correct. This value unequivocally corresponds to the option `3,060,000 km`.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\n**1. Deconstruct the Problem**\n\n*   **Goal:** Find the distance traveled by a supernova ejecta as measured from the Galaxy's frame of reference.\n*   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy.\n*   **Moving Frame (S'):** The supernova ejecta.\n*   **Relative Velocity (v):** 60,000 km/s.\n*   **Time in Moving Frame (Δt'):** 50 seconds. This is the \"proper time\" because it's measured on a clock traveling with the ejecta.\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** We'll use the standard approximation `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**2. Identify the Correct Physical Principle**\n\nThe velocity of the ejecta is a significant fraction of the speed of light (`v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`). This means that effects predicted by Einstein's theory of special relativity, specifically **time dilation**, must be considered.\n\n*   **Classical (Incorrect) Approach:** A non-relativistic calculation would simply be `distance = velocity × time = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This corresponds to option D.\n*   **Relativistic (Correct) Approach:** According to time dilation, an observer in the Galaxy's frame will measure time passing more slowly for the moving ejecta. This means the time interval in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) will be *longer* than the 50 seconds measured in the ejecta's frame. Consequently, the distance measured in the Galaxy's frame (`d = v × Δt`) must be *greater* than 3,000,000 km.\n\n**3. Logical Elimination (Sanity Check)**\n\nBased on the principle of time dilation, the final answer must be greater than 3,000,000 km.\n*   A) 3,060,000 km  (Plausible)\n*   B) 2,880,000 km  (Incorrect)\n*   C) 2,940,000 km  (Incorrect)\n*   D) 3,000,000 km  (Incorrect, as this is the classical result)\nThis logical check strongly indicates that option A is the correct answer.\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\n\nTo confirm, we will perform the full calculation.\n\n*   The distance in the Galaxy frame is: `d = v × Δt`\n*   The dilated time `Δt` is found using the proper time `Δt'` and the Lorentz factor `γ`: `Δt = γ × Δt'`\n*   The Lorentz factor is: `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nCombining these, we get:\n`d = v × (Δt' / √(1 - v²/c²))`\n\nNow, plug in the values:\n*   `v = 60,000 km/s`\n*   `Δt' = 50 s`\n*   `c = 300,000 km/s`\n*   `v/c = 0.2`\n\n`d = (60,000 km/s × 50 s) / √(1 - 0.2²)`\n`d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.04)`\n`d = 3,000,000 km / √(0.96)`\n`d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798`\n`d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**5. Final Decision**\n\nThe calculated distance is approximately `3,061,862 km`. This value is extremely close to option A. All provided candidate answers correctly perform this calculation, differing only in how they label the final option. Based on the options presented in the problem description, the correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Identification of the Core Physics Principle**\nThe problem describes a scenario where an object (the supernova ejecta) is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light (`v = 60,000 km/s` is 20% of the speed of light `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`). The question involves measuring time and distance from different inertial frames of reference. This is a classic application of Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, and the key principle involved is **Time Dilation**.\n\n**2. Understanding Frames of Reference and Time**\n*   **The Ejecta's Frame (S'):** This is the moving frame of reference. The time of 50 seconds is measured in this frame. Since it's measured by a clock moving along with the ejecta, this is the **proper time (Δt₀)**. So, `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n*   **The Galaxy's Frame (S):** This is considered the \"stationary\" frame of reference. We need to find the distance traveled as measured by an observer in this frame.\n\n**3. Applying the Time Dilation Formula**\nAccording to the principle of time dilation, an observer in the stationary frame (S) will measure time passing more slowly in the moving frame (S'). This means the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) will be longer than the proper time (`Δt₀`).\nThe relationship is given by:\n`Δt = γ * Δt₀`\nwhere `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as:\n`γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n**4. Calculating the Distance**\nThe distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame (`d`) is its velocity (`v`) multiplied by the time that has elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`).\n`d = v * Δt`\n\nBy substituting the time dilation formula, we get:\n`d = v * (γ * Δt₀)`\n`d = v * Δt₀ / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n**5. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n*   **Given values:**\n    *   `v = 60,000 km/s`\n    *   `Δt₀ = 50 s`\n    *   `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`\n*   **Step i: Calculate the classical distance (ignoring relativity).** This is a useful sanity check.\n    `d_classical = v * Δt₀ = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`\n    This corresponds to option C. Because of time dilation, the actual distance must be greater than this value. This immediately eliminates options A, C, and D, leaving only B as a possibility.\n*   **Step ii: Calculate the relativistic distance.**\n    *   First, calculate the `v²/c²` term:\n        `(v/c)² = (60,000 / 300,000)² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n    *   Next, calculate the denominator `√(1 - v²/c²)`:\n        `√(1 - 0.04) = √0.96`\n    *   Now, calculate the full distance `d`:\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96`\n    *   `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**6.

Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 2,880,000 km\nB) 3,060,000 km\nC) 3,000,000 km\nD) 2,940,000 km\n\nThe calculated value of `3,061,862 km` is closest to **B) 3,060,000 km**. All candidate answers that performed the calculation correctly arrived at this numerical result.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis is a classic problem in special relativity. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the Problem**\n\n*   **Objective**: Calculate the distance traveled by a supernova ejecta as measured by an observer in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n*   **Frames of Reference**:\n    *   **S (Stationary Frame)**: The Galaxy.\n    *   **S' (Moving Frame)**: The supernova ejecta.\n*   **Given Values**:\n    *   Relative velocity, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   Time elapsed in the moving frame S', `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the **proper time** (often denoted as `Δt₀`).\n    *   The speed of light, `c`, is approximately `300,000 km/s`.\n\n### **2. Identifying the Correct Physical Principle**\n\nThe problem involves two inertial frames moving relative to each other at a significant fraction of the speed of light (`v = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2c`). This means we must use the principles of special relativity, not classical (Newtonian) physics. The key phenomenon here is **time dilation**.\n\nAn observer in the stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure time passing more slowly for the moving ejecta. Consequently, the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame, `Δt`, will be longer than the 50 seconds measured in the ejecta's frame.\n\n### **3. Formulating the Solution**\n\n1.  The distance `d` in the Galaxy's frame is given by the formula `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n2.  The time `Δt` in the Galaxy's frame is related to the proper time `Δt₀` by the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n3.  `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n4.  By substituting the formulas, we get the complete equation for the distance:\n    `d = v * (γ * Δt₀) = (v * Δt₀) / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n### **4. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n1.  **Calculate the classical distance (numerator)**: This is the distance if we ignored relativity.\n    `v * Δt₀ = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This corresponds to option (B) and is a useful check; the relativistic answer must be greater than this value.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`**:\n    *   First, find the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`\n    *   Next, square this ratio:\n        `(v/c)² = 0.2² = 0.04`\n    *   Calculate the denominator of the Lorentz factor:\n        `sqrt(1 - (v/c)²) = sqrt(1 - 0.04) = sqrt(0.96)`\n    *   So, `γ = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.02062`\n\n3.  **Calculate the final distance `d`**:\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / sqrt(0.96)`\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798`\n    `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n### **5.

There is a unanimous consensus on the physics and the method of calculation.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to confirm the result:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics:** The ejecta is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light (`v = 60,000 km/s` while `c = 300,000 km/s`, so `v = 0.2c`). The time given (`50 s`) is measured in the ejecta's own moving reference frame (the proper time, `Δt'`). To find the distance traveled in the Galaxy's \"stationary\" frame, we must first find the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`). Due to time dilation, `Δt` will be longer than `Δt'`.\n\n2.  **State the Formulas:**\n    *   The time in the Galaxy frame (`Δt`) is related to the proper time (`Δt'`) by the Lorentz factor (`γ`):\n        `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    *   The Lorentz factor is defined as:\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    *   The distance in the Galaxy frame (`d`) is its velocity (`v`) multiplied by the time in its frame (`Δt`):\n        `d = v * Δt`\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   Combine the formulas:\n        `d = v * (γ * Δt') = (v * Δt') / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    *   Calculate the classical distance part (the numerator):\n        `v * Δt' = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`.\n    *   Calculate the relativistic part (the denominator):\n        `√(1 - v²/c²) = √(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) = √(1 - 0.2²) = √(1 - 0.04) = √0.96`\n    *   Divide the two parts:\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96 ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n4.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   The calculated distance is `3,061,862 km`.\n    *   Let's review the provided options:\n        A) 2 880 000 km\n        B) 3 060 000 km\n        C) 3 000 000 km\n        D) 2 940 000 km\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The calculated value `3,061,862 km` is closest to option B, `3,060,000 km`. The small difference is due to rounding in the option.\n\n    A sanity check confirms this. The classical, non-relativistic distance is `3,000,000 km` (Option C). Due to time dilation, the time elapsed in the observer's frame is longer, so the distance covered must be greater than `3,000,000 km`. Option B is the only choice that satisfies this condition.\n\nAll candidate agents arrived at the same numerical result, confirming the calculation is robust.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem requires the application of the special theory of relativity, specifically the concept of time dilation. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Frames of Reference and Given Information\n*   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. We want to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from this frame.\n*   **Moving Frame (S'):** The supernova ejecta's reference frame.\n*   **Relative Velocity (v):** The speed of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt₀):** The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's clock) is `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** A constant, approximately `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Physical Principle\nBecause the ejecta is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light (`v = 0.2c`), we cannot use classical mechanics. We must account for relativistic effects. According to special relativity, an observer in the stationary frame (S) will measure time passing more slowly for the moving object (S'). This is called **time dilation**.\n\nThe distance `d` traveled in the Galaxy's frame is calculated as `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed as measured in the Galaxy's frame, not the ejecta's frame.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt)\nThe relationship between the time in the stationary frame (`Δt`) and the proper time in the moving frame (`Δt₀`) is given by the time dilation formula:\n`Δt = γ * Δt₀`\nwhere `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n`γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nFirst, we calculate the ratio `v/c`:\n`v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\nNow, we calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n`γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96`\n\nThe time in the Galaxy's frame is:\n`Δt = (1 / √0.96) * 50 s ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s ≈ 51.031 s`\n\nAs expected, more time has passed in the Galaxy's frame than in the ejecta's frame.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame\nNow we can calculate the distance traveled as measured from the Galaxy's frame:\n`d = v * Δt`\n`d = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / √0.96) * 50 s )`\n`d = (60,000 * 50) / √0.96 km`\n`d = 3,000,000 / √0.96 km`\n`d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n### Step 5: Compare the Result with the Options\nThe calculated distance is approximately `3,061,862 km`. Let's compare this to the provided options:\nA) 2,940,000 km\nB) 3,060,000 km\nC) 3,000,000 km\nD) 2,880,000 km\n\nThe calculated value of `3,061,862 km` is closest to **B) 3,060,000 km**.\n\n**Analysis of Candidate Answers:**\nAll candidate answers correctly applied the principle of time dilation and arrived at the same numerical result (~3,062,000 km). The inconsistencies in their final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) arose because their displayed option lists were scrambled differently. However, the underlying physical reasoning and calculation in every case point to the value `3,060,000 km` as the correct answer. Based on the options provided in the question prompt, this value corresponds to B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n1.  **Identify the physical principle**: The problem describes a scenario with a very high velocity (`v = 60,000 km/s`) which is a significant fraction of the speed of light (`c ≈ 300,000 km/s`). This means the effects of Special Relativity, specifically **time dilation**, must be taken into account. The non-relativistic, or classical, approach is insufficient.\n\n2.  **Define the variables and reference frames**:\n    *   **Galaxy Frame (S)**: The stationary reference frame from which we are measuring the distance.\n    *   **Ejecta Frame (S')**: The moving reference frame.\n    *   **Velocity (v)**: `60,000 km/s`.\n    *   **Proper Time (Δt₀)**: The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's clock), which is `50 s`.\n    *   **Dilated Time (Δt)**: The time elapsed in the stationary frame (the Galaxy's clock), which we need to calculate.\n    *   **Distance (d)**: The distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's frame. This is the value we need to find.\n\n3.  **Sanity Check (Qualitative Analysis)**:\n    *   In a classical world (ignoring relativity), the distance would be simply `d = v × t = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This corresponds to option **C**.\n    *   According to time dilation, a moving clock runs slower as observed by a stationary observer. This means that while 50 seconds pass for the ejecta, *more* than 50 seconds will have passed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt > 50 s`).\n    *   Therefore, the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (`d = v × Δt`) must be *greater* than 3,000,000 km.\n    *   Looking at the options:\n        *   A) 2,940,000 km (less than 3,000,000 km)\n        *   B) 3,060,000 km (greater than 3,000,000 km)\n        *   C) 3,000,000 km (the classical, incorrect answer)\n        *   D) 2,880,000 km (less than 3,000,000 km)\n    *   Based on this qualitative check alone, **B** is the only plausible answer.\n\n4.  **Quantitative Calculation**:\n    *   The formula for the distance is `d = v × Δt`.\n    *   First, we must find the dilated time `Δt` using the formula `Δt = γ × Δt₀`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   Let's calculate `γ`:\n        *   `v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`\n        *   `v²/c² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n        *   `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96`\n    *   Now, combine the formulas to find the distance:\n        *   `d = v × (γ × Δt₀)`\n        *   `d = 60,000 km/s × (1 / √0.96) × 50 s`\n        *   `d = (60,000 × 50) / √0.96`\n        *   `d = 3,000,000 / √0.96`\n        *   `d ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798`\n        *   `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n5.  **Final Comparison**: The calculated distance is approximately `3,061,862 km`.

Identify the Core Physics Principle**\nThe problem describes an object (supernova ejecta) moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light (v = 60,000 km/s, which is 20% of the speed of light, c ≈ 300,000 km/s). It asks for a measurement of distance from a different frame of reference after a certain amount of time has passed in the moving object's frame. This is a classic application of Einstein's theory of Special Relativity, specifically the concept of **time dilation**.\n\n**2. Define the Frames of Reference**\n*   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. We want to find the distance traveled by the ejecta *as measured in this frame*.\n*   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame. The given time, 50 seconds, is measured by a clock within this frame. This is known as the **proper time (Δt₀)**.\n\n**3. State the Known Variables**\n*   Relative velocity between frames: `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   Proper time (time in the moving frame): `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n*   Speed of light: `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**4. The Logical Approach (Sanity Check)**\n*   Without relativity (in a classical Newtonian world), the distance would simply be velocity × time:\n    `d_classical = v * Δt₀ = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`.\n    This corresponds to option (C).\n*   However, due to time dilation, an observer in the \"stationary\" Galaxy frame (S) will measure time passing more slowly for the moving ejecta. This means that for the 50 seconds (`Δt₀`) that pass for the ejecta, a *longer* time (`Δt`) passes in the Galaxy's frame.\n*   Since the distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v * Δt`, and `Δt > Δt₀`, the relativistic distance `d` *must be greater* than the classical distance of 3,000,000 km.\n*   Looking at the options:\n    A) 3,060,000 km (Greater than 3,000,000 km)\n    B) 2,880,000 km (Less than 3,000,000 km)\n    C) 3,000,000 km (The classical answer)\n    D) 2,940,000 km (Less than 3,000,000 km)\n*   Based on this logic alone, only option A is physically possible.\n\n**5. The Detailed Calculation**\nTo confirm, we perform the full calculation. The distance in the Galaxy's frame `d` is given by `d = v * Δt`. The time in the Galaxy's frame `Δt` is related to the proper time `Δt₀` by the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n\n`Δt = γ * Δt₀`\nwhere `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nCombining these, the distance is:\n`d = v * (γ * Δt₀) = (v * Δt₀) / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nLet's plug in the numbers:\n*   First, `v * Δt₀ = 3,000,000 km`.\n*   Next, `(v/c)² = (60,000 / 300,000)² = (0.2)² = 0.04`.\n*   Then, `sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = sqrt(1 - 0.04) = sqrt(0.96)`.\n*   So, `d = 3,000,000 km / sqrt(0.96)`.\n\nCalculating the final value:\n`d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`.\n\n**6.

Analysis of the Physics Problem\n\nThe problem involves two inertial frames of reference moving at a relativistic speed (v = 60,000 km/s, which is 20% of the speed of light, c). We are given a time duration in the moving frame (`Δt' = 50 s`) and asked to find the distance traveled as seen by a stationary observer (in the Galaxy frame).\n\nThis requires the application of the time dilation formula from Einstein's theory of special relativity.\n\n*   **Step 1: Identify variables.**\n    *   Relative velocity, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   Speed of light, `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n    *   Proper time (time in the moving frame), `Δt' = 50 s`.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the formula.**\n    The distance (`d`) in the stationary frame is the velocity (`v`) times the time (`Δt`) elapsed in the stationary frame.\n    `d = v * Δt`\n\n    The time in the stationary frame (`Δt`) is dilated relative to the proper time (`Δt'`) by the Lorentz factor (`γ`).\n    `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    where `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n    Combining these gives the final formula for the distance:\n    `d = v * (γ * Δt') = (v * Δt') / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the numerical value.**\n    *   Calculate the non-relativistic distance part: `v * Δt' = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`.\n    *   Calculate the relativistic denominator:\n        *   `v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`\n        *   `(v/c)² = 0.04`\n        *   `√(1 - 0.04) = √0.96 ≈ 0.9798`\n    *   Divide to find the final distance:\n        *   `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96 ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n*   **Step 4: Compare with the original options.**\n    *   A) 2 880 000 km\n    *   B) 3 060 000 km\n    *   C) 2 940 000 km\n    *   D) 3 000 000 km\n\nThe calculated distance of **3,061,862 km** is closest to option **B) 3,060,000 km**.\n\n### 2.

However, the core reasoning and calculation are universally correct and consistent.\n\n*   **Sanity Check:** The non-relativistic distance is `3,000,000 km` (Option D). Due to time dilation, the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame is longer than 50 seconds, so the distance covered must be *greater* than 3,000,000 km. This immediately eliminates options A, C, and D, leaving B as the only physically possible answer.

This speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light (`c ≈ 300,000 km/s`), specifically `v = 0.2c`. Therefore, the laws of classical physics are insufficient, and the principles of Special Relativity must be applied. The key phenomenon at play is **time dilation**.\n\n2.  **Define Frames and Given Values:**\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. We want to find the distance `d` traveled in this frame.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame.\n    *   **Relative Velocity (`v`):** `60,000 km/s`.\n    *   **Proper Time (`Δt₀` or `Δt'`):** The time measured in the moving frame is `50 s`. This is the proper time because it is measured by a clock at rest in its own frame (the ejecta).\n\n3.  **Apply Time Dilation:**\n    According to special relativity, an observer in the stationary frame (S) will measure time passing more slowly in the moving frame (S'). This means the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame, `Δt`, will be longer than the 50 seconds measured in the ejecta's frame. The relationship is given by the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n4.  **Formulate the Distance Calculation:**\n    The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame (`d`) is its velocity (`v`) multiplied by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`).\n    *   `d = v * Δt`\n    *   Substituting the expression for `Δt`: `d = v * (γ * Δt₀)`\n    *   Substituting the expression for `γ`: `d = v * (1 / √(1 - v²/c²)) * Δt₀`\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   First, calculate the non-relativistic part `v * Δt₀`:\n        `60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`\n    *   Next, calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n        *   `β = v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`\n        *   `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n    *   Now, calculate the final distance `d`:\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √(0.96)`\n        `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798`\n        `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n6.  **Analyze the Candidate Answers and Compare:**\n    *   All 15 candidate answers correctly follow this exact line of reasoning and arrive at a numerical result of approximately `3,062,000 km`.\n    *   The classical (non-relativistic) distance would be `3,000,000 km`, which corresponds to option **D**. Since time dilation means more time passes in the observer's frame, the distance traveled must be *greater* than the classical distance. This logical check immediately eliminates options **A**, **C**, and **D**, leaving only **B**.\n    *   Comparing the calculated value of `3,061,862 km` to the options provided in the prompt:\n        A) 2 940 000 km.\n        B) 3 060 000 km.\n        C) 2 880 000 km.\n        D) 3 000 000 km.\n    *   The calculated value is unequivocally closest to option **B**.

This scenario requires the application of Albert Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, not classical Newtonian mechanics.\n\nThe key concept here is **Time Dilation**. An observer in a \"stationary\" frame (the Galaxy) will measure time passing more slowly for an object in a \"moving\" frame (the ejecta).\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information and the Goal**\n\n*   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame.\n*   **Moving Frame (S'):** The supernova ejecta's reference frame.\n*   **Relative Velocity (v):** 60,000 km/s.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt₀):** The time elapsed in the moving frame (S') is 50 seconds.

Lay Out the Calculation Plan**\n\n1.  The distance `d` measured in the Galaxy's frame is given by the formula `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed as measured in the Galaxy's frame.\n2.  `Δt` is not the same as `Δt₀` (50 s). We must first calculate the dilated time `Δt` using the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n3.  `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, which is calculated as:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²) `\n4.  By substituting the formulas, the distance can be calculated in one step:\n    `d = v * γ * Δt₀ = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²) `\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate the non-relativistic distance (the numerator).**\n    This is the distance if we ignored relativity. It's a useful baseline.\n    `v * Δt₀ = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`.\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor component.**\n    `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    `(v/c)² = 0.2² = 0.04`\n    `1 - (v/c)² = 1 - 0.04 = 0.96`\n    `√(1 - (v/c)²) = √0.96`\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the final distance.**\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96`\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798`\n    `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**5.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Problem and Identify the Core Physics Principle\n\nThe question describes a scenario involving two inertial frames of reference (the Galaxy and the ejecta) moving relative to each other at a very high speed.\n*   The velocity of the ejecta is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n*   The ratio `v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`, or 20% of the speed of light.\n\nBecause the velocity is a significant fraction of the speed of light, classical Newtonian physics is not sufficient. The principles of **Special Relativity** must be used. The key effect relevant to this problem is **time dilation**.\n\n### Step 2: Define Frames of Reference and Variables\n\n*   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. The goal is to find the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured by an observer in this frame.\n*   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame. A clock in this frame measures the time elapsed as `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the **proper time** (`Δt₀`), as it's measured in the object's own rest frame.\n\n### Step 3: Perform a Qualitative \"Sanity Check\"\n\nBefore any complex calculation, we can reason about the expected outcome.\n1.  **Classical Calculation:** If we ignored relativity, the distance would be simply `distance = velocity × time`.\n    `d_classical = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This corresponds to option **A**.\n2.  **Relativistic Effect (Time Dilation):** According to time dilation, a stationary observer (in the Galaxy) sees the moving clock (on the ejecta) run slower. This means that while 50 seconds pass for the ejecta, a *longer* time period (`Δt`) passes for the Galaxy.\n3.  **Conclusion:** Since the distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v × Δt`, and `Δt` is greater than 50 seconds, the distance `d` *must be greater than* the classical distance of 3,000,000 km.\n\nLet's check the options based on this logic:\n*   A) 3,000,000 km (This is the incorrect classical result)\n*   B) 2,940,000 km (Incorrect, less than the classical result)\n*   C) 2,880,000 km (Incorrect, less than the classical result)\n*   D) 3,060,000 km (**Plausible**, as it's greater than the classical result)\n\nThis sanity check alone strongly suggests that **D** is the only possible correct answer.\n\n### Step 4: Perform the Full Relativistic Calculation\n\nTo confirm our reasoning, we will calculate the exact distance.\n1.  The formula for the distance (`d`) in the stationary frame is:\n    `d = v × Δt`\n2.  The time in the stationary frame (`Δt`) is related to the proper time (`Δt'`) by the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt = γ × Δt'`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n3.  The Lorentz factor is `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n4.  Combining these gives the complete formula for the distance:\n    `d = (v × Δt') / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nNow, we plug in the values:\n*   `v × Δt' = 3,000,000 km`\n*   `v²/c² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n*   `d = 3,000,000 km / √(1 - 0.04)`\n*   `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96`\n*   `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.979796`\n*   `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this value to the options:\n\n*   A) 3,000,000 km\n*   B) 2,940,000 km\n*   C) 2,880,000 km\n*   D) 3,060,000 km\n\nThe calculated value is closest to **3,060,000 km**. This confirms the result of our initial sanity check.\n\n**Analysis of Candidate Answers:**\nAll provided candidate answers correctly identified the problem as one of special relativity, used the correct formula for time dilation, and performed the calculation to arrive at the same numerical result (`≈ 3,062,000 km`). The variation in their final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) is due to their internal systems processing the options in a different order. However, the underlying physics and the resulting value are unanimously agreed upon, pointing definitively to 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<D>>>"

This signals a problem in Special Relativity, requiring the consideration of time dilation.\n\n2.  **Define Frames and Variables**:\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S)**: The Galaxy's reference frame.

The distance formula is `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame, not the ejecta's frame.\n\n4.  **Apply Time Dilation**: According to special relativity, an observer in the stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure time passing more slowly for the moving ejecta. This means the time interval measured in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) will be longer than the proper time (`Δt'`). The relationship is given by the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    where `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is calculated as:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²) `\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation**:\n    *   First, calculate the classical distance (numerator of our final expression) which would be the answer if we ignored relativity:\n        `v * Δt' = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`.\n    *   Next, calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`.

The Governing Physical Principle: Time Dilation**\n\nBecause the ejecta is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light (`v = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2c`), we cannot use classical mechanics (`distance = velocity × time`).

Identify the Correct Physical Principle**\n\nThe velocity of the ejecta is a significant fraction of the speed of light (`v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`).

This corresponds to option D.\n*   **Relativistic (Correct) Approach:** According to time dilation, an observer in the Galaxy's frame will measure time passing more slowly for the moving ejecta. This means the time interval in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) will be *longer* than the 50 seconds measured in the ejecta's frame. Consequently, the distance measured in the Galaxy's frame (`d = v × Δt`) must be *greater* than 3,000,000 km.\n\n**3.

All provided candidate answers correctly perform this calculation, differing only in how they label the final option. Based on the options presented in the problem description, the correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Identification of the Core Physics Principle**\nThe problem describes a scenario where an object (the supernova ejecta) is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light (`v = 60,000 km/s` is 20% of the speed of light `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`). The question involves measuring time and distance from different inertial frames of reference. This is a classic application of Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, and the key principle involved is **Time Dilation**.\n\n**2. Understanding Frames of Reference and Time**\n*   **The Ejecta's Frame (S'):** This is the moving frame of reference. The time of 50 seconds is measured in this frame. Since it's measured by a clock moving along with the ejecta, this is the **proper time (Δt₀)**. So, `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n*   **The Galaxy's Frame (S):** This is considered the \"stationary\" frame of reference. We need to find the distance traveled as measured by an observer in this frame.\n\n**3. Applying the Time Dilation Formula**\nAccording to the principle of time dilation, an observer in the stationary frame (S) will measure time passing more slowly in the moving frame (S'). This means the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) will be longer than the proper time (`Δt₀`).\nThe relationship is given by:\n`Δt = γ * Δt₀`\nwhere `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as:\n`γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n**4. Calculating the Distance**\nThe distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame (`d`) is its velocity (`v`) multiplied by the time that has elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`).\n`d = v * Δt`\n\nBy substituting the time dilation formula, we get:\n`d = v * (γ * Δt₀)`\n`d = v * Δt₀ / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n**5. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n*   **Given values:**\n    *   `v = 60,000 km/s`\n    *   `Δt₀ = 50 s`\n    *   `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`\n*   **Step i: Calculate the classical distance (ignoring relativity).** This is a useful sanity check.\n    `d_classical = v * Δt₀ = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`\n    This corresponds to option C. Because of time dilation, the actual distance must be greater than this value. This immediately eliminates options A, C, and D, leaving only B as a possibility.\n*   **Step ii: Calculate the relativistic distance.**\n    *   First, calculate the `v²/c²` term:\n        `(v/c)² = (60,000 / 300,000)² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n    *   Next, calculate the denominator `√(1 - v²/c²)`:\n        `√(1 - 0.04) = √0.96`\n    *   Now, calculate the full distance `d`:\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96`\n    *   `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**6.

All candidate answers that performed the calculation correctly arrived at this numerical result.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis is a classic problem in special relativity. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the Problem**\n\n*   **Objective**: Calculate the distance traveled by a supernova ejecta as measured by an observer in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n*   **Frames of Reference**:\n    *   **S (Stationary Frame)**: The Galaxy.\n    *   **S' (Moving Frame)**: The supernova ejecta.\n*   **Given Values**:\n    *   Relative velocity, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   Time elapsed in the moving frame S', `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the **proper time** (often denoted as `Δt₀`).\n    *   The speed of light, `c`, is approximately `300,000 km/s`.\n\n### **2. Identifying the Correct Physical Principle**\n\nThe problem involves two inertial frames moving relative to each other at a significant fraction of the speed of light (`v = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2c`). This means we must use the principles of special relativity, not classical (Newtonian) physics. The key phenomenon here is **time dilation**.\n\nAn observer in the stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure time passing more slowly for the moving ejecta. Consequently, the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame, `Δt`, will be longer than the 50 seconds measured in the ejecta's frame.\n\n### **3. Formulating the Solution**\n\n1.  The distance `d` in the Galaxy's frame is given by the formula `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n2.  The time `Δt` in the Galaxy's frame is related to the proper time `Δt₀` by the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n3.  `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n4.  By substituting the formulas, we get the complete equation for the distance:\n    `d = v * (γ * Δt₀) = (v * Δt₀) / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n### **4. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n1.  **Calculate the classical distance (numerator)**: This is the distance if we ignored relativity.\n    `v * Δt₀ = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`. This corresponds to option (B) and is a useful check; the relativistic answer must be greater than this value.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`**:\n    *   First, find the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`\n    *   Next, square this ratio:\n        `(v/c)² = 0.2² = 0.04`\n    *   Calculate the denominator of the Lorentz factor:\n        `sqrt(1 - (v/c)²) = sqrt(1 - 0.04) = sqrt(0.96)`\n    *   So, `γ = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.02062`\n\n3.  **Calculate the final distance `d`**:\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / sqrt(0.96)`\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798`\n    `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n### **5. Compare with Options and Conclude**\n\nThe calculated distance is approximately `3,061,862 km`. Let's compare this to the provided options:\n*   A) 2 880 000 km.\n*   B) 3 000 000 km.

Core Principle: Time Dilation**\n*   Because the ejecta is moving at a relativistic speed (20% of the speed of light), time in the Galaxy's frame will pass faster than in the ejecta's frame.\n*   The relationship is given by the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n*   The Lorentz factor, `γ`, is calculated as: `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n**3. Calculation**\n*   The distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v * Δt`.\n*   By substituting the time dilation formula, we get: `d = v * γ * Δt₀`\n*   This can be written as a single expression: `d = (v * Δt₀) / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n**4. Executing the Calculation**\n*   First, calculate the classical distance (the numerator): `v * Δt₀ = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`.\n*   Next, calculate the term under the square root in the denominator: `(v/c)² = (60,000 / 300,000)² = (0.2)² = 0.04`.\n*   Then, `1 - (v/c)² = 1 - 0.04 = 0.96`.\n*   The final calculation for the distance is: `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`.\n*   Calculating the value: `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`.\n\n**5.

Any variation in the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) was due to the agents re-ordering the options in their individual analyses, but the selection of the value `3,060,000 km` was unanimous.

The time given (`50 s`) is measured in the ejecta's own moving reference frame (the proper time, `Δt'`). To find the distance traveled in the Galaxy's \"stationary\" frame, we must first find the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`). Due to time dilation, `Δt` will be longer than `Δt'`.\n\n2.  **State the Formulas:**\n    *   The time in the Galaxy frame (`Δt`) is related to the proper time (`Δt'`) by the Lorentz factor (`γ`):\n        `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    *   The Lorentz factor is defined as:\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    *   The distance in the Galaxy frame (`d`) is its velocity (`v`) multiplied by the time in its frame (`Δt`):\n        `d = v * Δt`\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   Combine the formulas:\n        `d = v * (γ * Δt') = (v * Δt') / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    *   Calculate the classical distance part (the numerator):\n        `v * Δt' = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`.\n    *   Calculate the relativistic part (the denominator):\n        `√(1 - v²/c²) = √(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) = √(1 - 0.2²) = √(1 - 0.04) = √0.96`\n    *   Divide the two parts:\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96 ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n4.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   The calculated distance is `3,061,862 km`.\n    *   Let's review the provided options:\n        A) 2 880 000 km\n        B) 3 060 000 km\n        C) 3 000 000 km\n        D) 2 940 000 km\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The calculated value `3,061,862 km` is closest to option B, `3,060,000 km`. The small difference is due to rounding in the option.\n\n    A sanity check confirms this. The classical, non-relativistic distance is `3,000,000 km` (Option C).

Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Frames of Reference and Given Information\n*   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. We want to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from this frame.\n*   **Moving Frame (S'):** The supernova ejecta's reference frame.\n*   **Relative Velocity (v):** The speed of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt₀):** The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's clock) is `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** A constant, approximately `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Physical Principle\nBecause the ejecta is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light (`v = 0.2c`), we cannot use classical mechanics. We must account for relativistic effects. According to special relativity, an observer in the stationary frame (S) will measure time passing more slowly for the moving object (S'). This is called **time dilation**.\n\nThe distance `d` traveled in the Galaxy's frame is calculated as `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed as measured in the Galaxy's frame, not the ejecta's frame.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt)\nThe relationship between the time in the stationary frame (`Δt`) and the proper time in the moving frame (`Δt₀`) is given by the time dilation formula:\n`Δt = γ * Δt₀`\nwhere `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n`γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nFirst, we calculate the ratio `v/c`:\n`v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\nNow, we calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n`γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96`\n\nThe time in the Galaxy's frame is:\n`Δt = (1 / √0.96) * 50 s ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s ≈ 51.031 s`\n\nAs expected, more time has passed in the Galaxy's frame than in the ejecta's frame.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame\nNow we can calculate the distance traveled as measured from the Galaxy's frame:\n`d = v * Δt`\n`d = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / √0.96) * 50 s )`\n`d = (60,000 * 50) / √0.96 km`\n`d = 3,000,000 / √0.96 km`\n`d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n### Step 5: Compare the Result with the Options\nThe calculated distance is approximately `3,061,862 km`.

The time in the Galaxy's frame `Δt` is related to the proper time `Δt₀` by the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n\n`Δt = γ * Δt₀`\nwhere `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nCombining these, the distance is:\n`d = v * (γ * Δt₀) = (v * Δt₀) / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nLet's plug in the numbers:\n*   First, `v * Δt₀ = 3,000,000 km`.\n*   Next, `(v/c)² = (60,000 / 300,000)² = (0.2)² = 0.04`.\n*   Then, `sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = sqrt(1 - 0.04) = sqrt(0.96)`.\n*   So, `d = 3,000,000 km / sqrt(0.96)`.\n\nCalculating the final value:\n`d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\nThe calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this value to the options:\n\n*   A) 3,060,000 km\n*   B) 2,880,000 km\n*   C) 3,000,000 km\n*   D) 2,940,000 km\n\nThe calculated value is extremely close to **3,060,000 km**. The minor difference of ~1,862 km is due to the rounding of the answer choice. All the provided candidate answers, despite confusion about the option letters, reached the same numerical result, confirming the calculation is correct.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThis problem requires the application of special relativity, specifically the concept of time dilation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Reference Frames:**\n    *   **The Galaxy's Frame (S):** This is considered the \"stationary\" frame of reference. We need to find the distance traveled by the ejecta as measured from this frame.\n    *   **The Ejecta's Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame of reference. The time elapsed in this frame (50 seconds) is the \"proper time.\"\n\n2.  **List Given Information:**\n    *   Relative velocity, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   Proper time (time in the moving frame), `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n    *   Speed of light, `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Physical Principle:**\n    Because the ejecta is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light (`v = 0.2c`), we cannot use classical physics (`distance = velocity × time`). We must account for time dilation. An observer in the Galaxy's frame will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) than the 50 seconds measured in the ejecta's frame.\n\n4.  **Apply the Formulas:**\n    *   The time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) is related to the proper time (`Δt₀`) by the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    *   where `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is given by:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n    *   The distance `d` traveled in the Galaxy's frame is the velocity multiplied by the time measured in that same frame:\n        `d = v * Δt`\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   **Step 1: Calculate the classical distance (for comparison/sanity check).**\n        `d_classical = v * Δt₀ = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`.\n        This is option B and is incorrect because it ignores relativity.\n\n    *   **Step 2: Use the sanity check.**\n        Due to time dilation, `Δt` will be greater than `Δt₀` (50 s). Therefore, the actual distance `d` must be greater than the classical distance of 3,000,000 km. Looking at the options:\n        A) 2,940,000 km (less than 3,000,000 km)\n        B) 3,000,000 km (the classical result)\n        C) 3,060,000 km (greater than 3,000,000 km)\n        D) 2,880,000 km (less than 3,000,000 km)\n        This quick check already isolates C as the only plausible answer.\n\n    *   **Step 3: Perform the full relativistic calculation to confirm.**\n        *   Calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n            `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n        *   Combine formulas to find the distance `d`:\n            `d = v * Δt = v * γ * Δt₀ = (v * Δt₀) / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n            `d = 3,000,000 km / sqrt(0.96)`\n        *   Calculate the final value:\n            `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated distance is `3,061,862 km`. Comparing this to the options, it is closest to `3,060,000 km`. All candidate answers correctly performed this calculation and came to the same conclusion, differing only in how they labeled the options.\n\nBased on the initial problem statement's list of options, `3,060,000 km` corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Physics Problem\n\nThe problem involves two inertial frames of reference moving at a relativistic speed (v = 60,000 km/s, which is 20% of the speed of light, c). We are given a time duration in the moving frame (`Δt' = 50 s`) and asked to find the distance traveled as seen by a stationary observer (in the Galaxy frame).\n\nThis requires the application of the time dilation formula from Einstein's theory of special relativity.\n\n*   **Step 1: Identify variables.**\n    *   Relative velocity, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   Speed of light, `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n    *   Proper time (time in the moving frame), `Δt' = 50 s`.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the formula.**\n    The distance (`d`) in the stationary frame is the velocity (`v`) times the time (`Δt`) elapsed in the stationary frame.\n    `d = v * Δt`\n\n    The time in the stationary frame (`Δt`) is dilated relative to the proper time (`Δt'`) by the Lorentz factor (`γ`).\n    `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    where `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n    Combining these gives the final formula for the distance:\n    `d = v * (γ * Δt') = (v * Δt') / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the numerical value.**\n    *   Calculate the non-relativistic distance part: `v * Δt' = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`.\n    *   Calculate the relativistic denominator:\n        *   `v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`\n        *   `(v/c)² = 0.04`\n        *   `√(1 - 0.04) = √0.96 ≈ 0.9798`\n    *   Divide to find the final distance:\n        *   `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96 ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n*   **Step 4: Compare with the original options.**\n    *   A) 2 880 000 km\n    *   B) 3 060 000 km\n    *   C) 2 940 000 km\n    *   D) 3 000 000 km\n\nThe calculated distance of **3,061,862 km** is closest to option **B) 3,060,000 km**.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the Candidate Answers\n\nAll 15 candidate answers correctly identify the problem as requiring time dilation and apply the correct formula. They all arrive at the same numerical result (approximately 3,062,000 km).\n\nThe discrepancy in their final letter choice (e.g., A, B, C, or D) stems from a different ordering of the options in their respective analyses. However, the core reasoning and calculation are universally correct and consistent.\n\n*   **Sanity Check:** The non-relativistic distance is `3,000,000 km` (Option D). Due to time dilation, the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame is longer than 50 seconds, so the distance covered must be *greater* than 3,000,000 km. This immediately eliminates options A, C, and D, leaving B as the only physically possible answer. This simple check is mentioned by Agent 3 and Agent 5.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe reasoning across all candidate answers is sound and leads to a single numerical conclusion. By matching this numerical result to the original list of options provided in the question, the correct choice is identified.\n\n*   Calculated Distance: **~3,062,000 km**\n*   Closest Option: **B) 3,060,000 km**\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics Principle:** The question describes two inertial reference frames (the Galaxy and the ejecta) moving relative to each other at a very high speed (`v = 60,000 km/s`). This speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light (`c ≈ 300,000 km/s`), specifically `v = 0.2c`. Therefore, the laws of classical physics are insufficient, and the principles of Special Relativity must be applied. The key phenomenon at play is **time dilation**.\n\n2.  **Define Frames and Given Values:**\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. We want to find the distance `d` traveled in this frame.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame.\n    *   **Relative Velocity (`v`):** `60,000 km/s`.\n    *   **Proper Time (`Δt₀` or `Δt'`):** The time measured in the moving frame is `50 s`. This is the proper time because it is measured by a clock at rest in its own frame (the ejecta).\n\n3.  **Apply Time Dilation:**\n    According to special relativity, an observer in the stationary frame (S) will measure time passing more slowly in the moving frame (S'). This means the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame, `Δt`, will be longer than the 50 seconds measured in the ejecta's frame. The relationship is given by the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n4.  **Formulate the Distance Calculation:**\n    The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame (`d`) is its velocity (`v`) multiplied by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`).\n    *   `d = v * Δt`\n    *   Substituting the expression for `Δt`: `d = v * (γ * Δt₀)`\n    *   Substituting the expression for `γ`: `d = v * (1 / √(1 - v²/c²)) * Δt₀`\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   First, calculate the non-relativistic part `v * Δt₀`:\n        `60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`\n    *   Next, calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n        *   `β = v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`\n        *   `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n    *   Now, calculate the final distance `d`:\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √(0.96)`\n        `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798`\n        `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n6.  **Analyze the Candidate Answers and Compare:**\n    *   All 15 candidate answers correctly follow this exact line of reasoning and arrive at a numerical result of approximately `3,062,000 km`.\n    *   The classical (non-relativistic) distance would be `3,000,000 km`, which corresponds to option **D**. Since time dilation means more time passes in the observer's frame, the distance traveled must be *greater* than the classical distance. This logical check immediately eliminates options **A**, **C**, and **D**, leaving only **B**.\n    *   Comparing the calculated value of `3,061,862 km` to the options provided in the prompt:\n        A) 2 940 000 km.\n        B) 3 060 000 km.\n        C) 2 880 000 km.\n        D) 3 000 000 km.\n    *   The calculated value is unequivocally closest to option **B**. The small discrepancy (`~2,000 km` out of `~3,000,000 km`) is due to the options being rounded values.\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The physics, reasoning, and calculation are consistent and correct across all provided answers. The only discrepancy is the final letter choice, which is likely due to the agents being presented with scrambled option lists. Based on the options provided in this prompt, the correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics Principles**\n\nThe problem involves two inertial frames of reference moving relative to each other at a speed that is a significant fraction of the speed of light (`v = 60,000 km/s` is 20% the speed of light). This scenario requires the application of Albert Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, not classical Newtonian mechanics.\n\nThe key concept here is **Time Dilation**. An observer in a \"stationary\" frame (the Galaxy) will measure time passing more slowly for an object in a \"moving\" frame (the ejecta).\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information and the Goal**\n\n*   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame.\n*   **Moving Frame (S'):** The supernova ejecta's reference frame.\n*   **Relative Velocity (v):** 60,000 km/s.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt₀):** The time elapsed in the moving frame (S') is 50 seconds. This is called \"proper time\" because it's measured by a clock at rest in its own frame.\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** `c` is approximately 300,000 km/s.\n*   **Goal:** Calculate the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the stationary frame (S).\n\n**3. Lay Out the Calculation Plan**\n\n1.  The distance `d` measured in the Galaxy's frame is given by the formula `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed as measured in the Galaxy's frame.\n2.  `Δt` is not the same as `Δt₀` (50 s). We must first calculate the dilated time `Δt` using the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n3.  `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, which is calculated as:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²) `\n4.  By substituting the formulas, the distance can be calculated in one step:\n    `d = v * γ * Δt₀ = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²) `\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate the non-relativistic distance (the numerator).**\n    This is the distance if we ignored relativity. It's a useful baseline.\n    `v * Δt₀ = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`.\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor component.**\n    `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    `(v/c)² = 0.2² = 0.04`\n    `1 - (v/c)² = 1 - 0.04 = 0.96`\n    `√(1 - (v/c)²) = √0.96`\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the final distance.**\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96`\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798`\n    `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**5. Compare with the Options and Conclude**\n\n*   The calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**.\n*   Let's look at the given options:\n    A) 3 000 000 km (The incorrect non-relativistic answer)\n    B) 2 880 000 km\n    C) 2 940 000 km\n    D) 3 060 000 km\n\nThe calculated value of 3,061,862 km is extremely close to **3,060,000 km**. The minor difference is due to rounding in the problem's options.\n\nTherefore, all candidate answers correctly identified the method and calculation, leading to the same numerical result. The correct option is the one closest to this value.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
