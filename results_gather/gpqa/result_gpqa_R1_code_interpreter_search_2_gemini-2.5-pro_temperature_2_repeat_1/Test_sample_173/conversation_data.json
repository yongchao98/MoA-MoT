    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Problem and Define Variables**\n\n*   Initial nucleus: Mass `M`, at rest.\n*   Initial rest-mass energy: `E_0 = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   Fission: The nucleus splits into two fragments, fragment 1 and fragment 2.\n*   Fragment masses: `m1` and `m2`. We are told `m1` is the \"more massive fragment\".\n*   Mass relationship: \"one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other\". This means `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   Sum of fragment masses: \"The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M\". This means `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   Kinetic energies: `T1` (for `m1`) and `T2` (for `m2`).\n*   **Goal:** Find the difference between `T1` calculated using relativistic mechanics (`T1_rel`) and `T1` calculated using classical mechanics (`T1_cla`). `Difference = T1_rel - T1_cla`.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Masses and Released Energy (Q-value)**\n\nFirst, let's find the rest masses (and their energy equivalents) of the fragments in terms of the initial mass `M`.\n\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n`(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, convert these masses into their rest-mass energy equivalents:\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1: `m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2: `m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\nThe energy released as kinetic energy (Q-value) is due to the \"missing\" mass, according to `E = mc^2`.\n*   `Total Kinetic Energy (T_total) = Initial Energy - Final Rest Energy`\n*   `T_total = (M * c^2) - (m1 * c^2 + m2 * c^2)`\n*   `T_total = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n*   `T_total = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\nSo, `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n### **3. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\nThe initial nucleus is at rest, so its momentum is zero. By the law of conservation of momentum, the total momentum after fission must also be zero. The two fragments must fly apart in opposite directions with equal-magnitude momenta.\n*   `p1 = p2` (where `p` denotes the magnitude of momentum).\n\n### **4. Classical (Non-Relativistic) Calculation of T1**\n\nIn classical mechanics, the relationship between kinetic energy (`T`) and momentum (`p`) is:\n`p^2 = 2 * m * T`\n\nFrom `p1 = p2`, we get `p1^2 = p2^2`.\n`2 * m1 * T1_cla = 2 * m2 * T2_cla`\n`m1 * T1_cla = m2 * T2_cla`\n\nSubstitute `m1 = 2 * m2`:\n`(2 * m2) * T1_cla = m2 * T2_cla`\n`2 * T1_cla = T2_cla`\n\nNow use the total kinetic energy equation: `T1_cla + T2_cla = 3 GeV`.\nSubstitute `T2_cla = 2 * T1_cla`:\n`T1_cla + (2 * T1_cla) = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_cla = 3 GeV`\n`T1_cla = 1 GeV`\n\nSo, the classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is `1 GeV`, which is `1000 MeV`.\n\n### **5. Relativistic Calculation of T1**\n\nIn special relativity, the energy-momentum relation is:\n`E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`, where `E` is the total energy (`E = T + m*c^2`).\n\nWe can express momentum in terms of kinetic energy:\n`(T + m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\n`(p*c)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`\n\nFrom momentum conservation, `p1 = p2`, so `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n`T1_rel^2 + 2*T1_rel*(m1*c^2) = T2_rel^2 + 2*T2_rel*(m2*c^2)`\n\nNow, we substitute the known values:\n*   `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`\n*   `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`\n*   `T2_rel = 3 GeV - T1_rel`\n\nThe equation becomes:\n`T1_rel^2 + 2*T1_rel*(198) = (3 - T1_rel)^2 + 2*(3 - T1_rel)*(99)`\n\nLet's solve for `T1_rel` (we can drop the `_rel` subscript for simplicity during the calculation).\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\nThe `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n`396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n`396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n`396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\nSo, the correct (relativistic) kinetic energy is `T1_rel = 1.005 GeV`, which is `1005 MeV`.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, we can perform this calculation using Python.\n```python\n# Values in GeV\nm1c2 = 198  # Rest energy of fragment 1\nm2c2 = 99   # Rest energy of fragment 2\nT_total = 3 # Total kinetic energy released\n\n# In the classical approximation:\n# T1 + T2 = T_total\n# m1 * T1 = m2 * T2 => (2*m2)*T1 = m2*T2 => 2*T1 = T2\n# T1 + 2*T1 = T_total => 3*T1 = T_total\nT1_cla = T_total / 3\n\n# In the relativistic calculation:\n# (p1*c)^2 = T1^2 + 2*T1*m1c2\n# (p2*c)^2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2c2\n# T2 = T_total - T1\n# We derived the equation: 600 * T1 = 603\nT1_rel = 603 / 600\n\n# Convert results from GeV to MeV and find the difference\ndiff_MeV = (T1_rel - T1_cla) * 1000\n\nprint(f\"Classical T1: {T1_cla} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Relativistic T1: {T1_rel} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Difference: {diff_MeV} MeV\")\n```\n<execute_result>\nClassical T1: 1.0 GeV\nRelativistic T1: 1.005 GeV\nDifference: 5.0 MeV\n</execute_result>\n\n### **6. Find the Difference**\n\nFinally, calculate the difference between the relativistic and classical values for `T1`.\n*   `T1_rel = 1005 MeV`\n*   `T1_cla = 1000 MeV`\n*   `Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, meaning its initial momentum is zero.\nInitial rest-mass energy, `M * c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n\nThe nucleus fissions into two fragments, m1 and m2. We are given:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2` (m1 is the more massive fragment)\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nFrom these two equations, we can find the individual masses in terms of M:\nSubstitute (1) into (2): `(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nThen, `m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`.\n\nNow, we can find their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest energy of m1: `m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest energy of m2: `m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\nThe total rest-mass energy of the fragments is `198 GeV + 99 GeV = 297 GeV`.\nThe \"missing\" rest-mass energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments (Q-value).\n`Total Kinetic Energy = T1 + T2 = Initial Energy - Final Rest Energy`\n`T_total = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n**Conservation of Momentum**\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum of the fragments must be zero. They fly apart with equal and opposite momenta.\n`p1 = p2` (where `p` is the magnitude of the momentum).\n\n**Classical Calculation of T1 (T1_cla)**\nIn classical physics, kinetic energy `T` and momentum `p` are related by `p^2 = 2 * m * T`.\nSince `p1^2 = p2^2`, we have:\n`2 * m1 * T1_cla = 2 * m2 * T2_cla`\n`(2 * m2) * T1_cla = m2 * T2_cla`\n`2 * T1_cla = T2_cla`\n\nWe also know that `T1_cla + T2_cla = 3 GeV`.\nSubstituting `T2_cla = 2 * T1_cla`:\n`T1_cla + (2 * T1_cla) = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_cla = 3 GeV`\n`T1_cla = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\n\n**Relativistic Calculation of T1 (T1_rel)**\nIn special relativity, the energy-momentum relation is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`, where E is the total energy (`E = T + m*c^2`).\nWe can write `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`.\n\nSince `p1 = p2`, we have `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`:\n`T1_rel^2 + 2 * T1_rel * (m1*c^2) = T2_rel^2 + 2 * T2_rel * (m2*c^2)`\n\nWe know:\n*   `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`\n*   `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`\n*   `T2_rel = 3 - T1_rel`\n\nLet `T1_rel = x` for simplicity.\n`x^2 + 2*x*(198) = (3 - x)^2 + 2*(3 - x)*(99)`\n`x^2 + 396x = (9 - 6x + x^2) + (6 - 2x) * 99`\n`x^2 + 396x = 9 - 6x + x^2 + 594 - 198x`\n\nThe `x^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n`396x = 603 - 204x`\n`396x + 204x = 603`\n`600x = 603`\n`x = T1_rel = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n`T1_rel = 1005 MeV`\n\n**Calculating the Difference**\n`Difference = T1_rel - T1_cla`\n`Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<A>>>"
