    "This problem can be solved using the method of images.\n\n### 1. The Method of Images\n\nThe electric field and potential outside a grounded conducting sphere due to an external point charge `q` can be modeled by an equivalent system. This system consists of the original charge `q` and an \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere. The image charge is chosen such that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero, matching the condition for a grounded conductor.\n\nFor a grounded sphere of radius `R` and a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center:\n*   The image charge `q'` is located on the line connecting the center and the charge `q`.\n*   Its distance from the center, `d'`, is given by `d' = R^2 / d`.\n*   The magnitude of the image charge is `q' = - (R/d) * q`.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. There are two common ways to calculate this.\n\n**Method 1: Integrating the Force**\n\nThe potential energy `U` is the negative of the work `W` done by the electric field as the charge `q` is brought from infinity to `d`.\n`U = -W = - ∫(from ∞ to d) F_e ⋅ dr`\n\nThe force `F_e` on the charge `q` due to the grounded sphere is the same as the electrostatic force between the charge `q` and its image `q'`. When the charge `q` is at a generic position `x` from the center, the image charge `q'(x)` and its position `x'` are:\n`q'(x) = -qR/x`\n`x' = R^2/x`\n\nThe distance between the charge `q` at `x` and its image at `x'` is `x - x' = x - R^2/x = (x^2 - R^2)/x`.\nThe force on the charge `q` is:\n`F_e(x) = k * q * q' / (x - x')^2 = k * q * (-qR/x) / ((x^2 - R^2)/x)^2`\n`F_e(x) = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\nThe work done by the field is the integral of this force from `x = ∞` to `x = d`.\n`W = ∫(from ∞ to d) [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\nTo solve the integral, we use the substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, which gives `du = 2x dx`.\n`W = -k * q^2 * (R/2) * ∫ [1/u^2] du = -k * q^2 * (R/2) * [-1/u]`\n`W = [ (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (x^2 - R^2) ]` from `∞` to `d`.\n`W = [ (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2) ] - [ (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (∞^2 - R^2) ]`\n`W = (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThe potential energy is `U = -W`.\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**Method 2: Using Potential**\n\nThe potential energy of the system can also be calculated as `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of charge `q` caused by all other charges (in this case, the induced charge on the sphere's surface).\n\nThe potential due to the induced surface charge is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n`V_induced =` Potential from `q'` at the location of `q`.\n`V_induced = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n\n*   `q' = -qR/d`\n*   Distance ` = d - d' = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`\n\n`V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d) = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, calculate the potential energy `U`:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced = (1/2) * q * [- k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nBoth methods yield the same result for the potential energy of the system.\n`U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 R / (d^2 - R^2)`\nB) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 R^2 / (d^2 - R^2)`\nC) `U = - kq^2 d / (d^2 - R^2)`\nD) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 d / (d^2 + R^2)`\n\nOur calculated result matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
