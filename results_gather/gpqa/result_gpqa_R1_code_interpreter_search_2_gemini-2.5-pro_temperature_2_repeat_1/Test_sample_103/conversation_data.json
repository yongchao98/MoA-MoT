    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the RV Method and Doppler Shift:** The Radial Velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. The star \"wobbles\" as the planet orbits it, causing its light to be blueshifted when it moves towards us and redshifted when it moves away. The amount of wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$) relative to the observer. The maximum observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, known as the RV amplitude, $K$.\n\n    The relationship is given by the Doppler formula:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{K}{c}$\n    Where $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shifts to RV Amplitudes:**\n    Since $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$ is proportional to $K$, the ratio of the maximum wavelength shifts is equal to the ratio of the RV amplitudes for the two stars.\n\n    -   For Planet #1: $\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 1} = 5$ mÅ\n    -   For Planet #2: $\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 2} = 7$ mÅ\n\n    Therefore, the ratio of the RV amplitudes is:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 2}}{\\Delta\\lambda_{max, 1}} = \\frac{7}{5}$\n\n3.  **Find the Physical Relationship between RV Amplitude (K) and Orbital Period (T):**\n    For a planet of mass $m_p$ in a circular orbit around a star of mass $M_{star}$ with a period $T$, the star's RV amplitude $K$ is given by:\n    $K = (\\frac{2\\pi G}{T})^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin(i)}{(M_{star} + m_p)^{2/3}}$\n    Where $G$ is the gravitational constant and $i$ is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n\n4.  **Simplify the Relationship based on the Problem's Information:**\n    The problem states:\n    -   The stars have the same mass: $M_{star1} = M_{star2}$.\n    -   The planets have similar masses: $m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$.\n    -   The question is well-posed, implying we can find a unique solution. This leads to the standard assumption that the orbital inclinations are the same, i.e., $\\sin(i_1) \\approx \\sin(i_2)$.\n\n    Given these conditions, most terms in the formula for $K$ are constant for both systems ($G$, $m_p$, $M_{star}$, $\\sin i$). Thus, $K$ is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period $T$.\n    $K \\propto T^{-1/3}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods:**\n    Using the proportionality from the previous step, we can write the ratio of the RV amplitudes in terms of the ratio of the periods:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{T_2^{-1/3}}{T_1^{-1/3}} = (\\frac{T_2}{T_1})^{-1/3} = (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^{1/3}$\n\n    We want to find the ratio $\\frac{T_2}{T_1}$. Let's rearrange the equation:\n    $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = (\\frac{K_2}{K_1})^3$\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = (\\frac{K_1}{K_2})^3$\n\n    Now, substitute the known ratio of the RV amplitudes:\n    $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = (\\frac{5}{7})^3$\n\n6.  **Compute the Final Value:**\n    To find the numerical value, we calculate $(\\frac{5}{7})^3$.\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods (T2/T1)\n# K1/K2 = 5/7\n# T2/T1 = (K1/K2)^3\nratio = (5/7)**3\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_ipython>\n0.36443148688046646\n</execute_ipython>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.364.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ 1.40\nB) ~ 0.36\nC) ~ 0.85\nD) ~ 1.96\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.364 is closest to option B. This means the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times the orbital period of planet #1 (i.e., it is shorter). This is consistent with our physical intuition: a larger RV signal ($K_2 > K_1$) implies the planet is closer to its star, which, by Kepler's Third Law, means it has a shorter orbital period ($T_2 < T_1$).\n\n<<<B>>>",
