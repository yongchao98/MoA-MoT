    "An organic compound shows optical isomerism if its molecule is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are the presence of a chiral center or some form of axial, planar, or helical chirality. A molecule is achiral (not optically active) if it possesses an element of symmetry like a plane of symmetry (σ) or a center of inversion (i).\n\nLet's analyze each molecule:\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative with substituents at all four ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). The substituents are methyl carboxylate (-COOCH₃) groups at positions 2 and 2', and nitro (-NO₂) groups at positions 6 and 6'.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** Due to the steric hindrance caused by these bulky ortho groups, free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is severely restricted. This forces the two rings to be non-coplanar, twisting out of a single plane. This restricted rotation gives rise to a type of stereoisomerism called **atropisomerism**, which is a form of axial chirality. The molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Consequently, it is chiral and can exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers).\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound shows optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   **Structure:** This molecule is also known as methyl lactate. Its chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** We look for a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's examine the carbon atom at position 2 (the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group):\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since all four groups attached to this carbon atom are different, it is a chiral center (or asymmetric carbon). The presence of a single chiral center in a molecule makes it chiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound shows optical isomerism.\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Structure:** The chemical formula is (C₆H₅)₂CO. It consists of a carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule does not contain any chiral centers. The central carbon is sp² hybridized. Although the phenyl rings are twisted out of the plane of the carbonyl group due to steric effects, the molecule is symmetric overall. It possesses a C₂ axis of rotation passing through the C=O bond. Crucially, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image (one can be rotated to align with the other). The molecule does not have a stable chiral conformation. Therefore, it is achiral.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond (trans configuration).\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule is planar due to the sp² hybridization of the carbon atoms in the double bond. Any planar molecule has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself). The presence of a plane of symmetry makes a molecule achiral. Dimethyl fumarate also possesses a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C bond.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (axial chirality).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>"
