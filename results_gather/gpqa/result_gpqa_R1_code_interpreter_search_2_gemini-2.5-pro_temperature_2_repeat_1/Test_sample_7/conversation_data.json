As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct conclusion:\n\n1.  **Analyze the role of Gene G2.**\n    *   The single knock-out mutant `g2` results in 0% resistance, a complete loss of the trait. This indicates that G2 is an essential gene for the resistance pathway.\n    *   Now, let's look at the double mutants involving G2. The `g1g2` mutant and the `g2g3` mutant both show 0% resistance.\n    *   This is the key observation for epistasis. When an organism is mutant for two different genes, and the resulting phenotype is that of one of the single mutants, we say that gene is epistatic (masks the effect of) the other gene.\n    *   Here, the `g2` phenotype (0% resistance) masks the `g1` phenotype (75% resistance) and the `g3` phenotype (50% resistance). The double mutants (`g1g2`, `g2g3`) have the same phenotype as the `g2` single mutant.\n    *   This epistatic relationship strongly suggests a hierarchical pathway where G2 acts upstream of both G1 and G3. Since we are told that one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream, it is almost certain that **G2 is the transcription factor** that regulates the expression of G1 and G3. This conclusion immediately eliminates option C, which states G1 is the transcription factor.\n\n2.  **Analyze the interaction between Gene G1 and Gene G3.**\n    *   Let's look at the single mutants first. The wild-type has 100% resistance.\n        *   The `g1` mutant loses 25% resistance (100% - 75%).\n        *   The `g3` mutant loses 50% resistance (100% - 50%).\n    *   If the genes acted independently in separate pathways, we would expect an additive effect. The expected resistance for the `g1g3` double mutant would be 100% - (25% loss + 50% loss) = 100% - 75% = 25%.\n    *   However, the experimental result for the `g1g3` double mutant is **10% resistance**.\n    *   The observed resistance (10%) is significantly lower than the expected additive resistance (25%). This means the combined loss of G1 and G3 has a much greater effect than the sum of their individual effects. This is a classic example of a **synergistic interaction**, also known as synthetic enhancement.\n    *   This type of interaction often occurs when two genes perform similar or compensatory functions (i.e., they are partially redundant). The system can tolerate the loss of one, but the loss of both leads to a much more severe failure. Therefore, the description **\"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\"** is the most appropriate interpretation of this result among the choices.\n    *   \"Pleiotropy\" (Option A) means a single gene affects multiple unrelated traits; we don't have the data to support this. \"Same promoter\" (Option B) is a possible mechanism but not a functional description of the interaction. So, the description in Option D is the strongest.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the concept of epistasis between G1 and G3.**\n    *   Options A and D both claim that \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\". For this to be true, the phenotype of the `g1g3` double mutant would have to be the same as the phenotype of the `g1` single mutant.\n    *   The `g1g3` phenotype is 10% resistance.\n    *   The `g1` phenotype is 75% resistance.\n    *   Since 10% ≠ 75%, G1 is *not* epistatic to G3. Similarly, G3 is not epistatic to G1 (10% ≠ 50%). So, this part of the statement in options A and D is factually incorrect based on the data.\n\n4.  **Select the Best Overall Conclusion.**\n    *   We have to choose the best option among the given choices, even if one contains a flaw. Let's compare the options based on our analysis:\n        *   **A)** G2 is a transcription factor (Correct), G1 and G3 show pleiotropy (Unsupported), G1 is epistatic towards G3 (Incorrect).\n        *   **B)** G2 is a transcription factor (Correct), G1 and G3 has the same promoter (Unsupported), G3 is epistatic towards G1 (Incorrect).\n        *   **C)** G1 is a transcription factor (Incorrect).\n        *   **D)** G2 is a transcription factor (Correct), G1 and G3 show gene redundancy (Correct Interpretation), G1 is epistatic towards G3 (Incorrect).\n    *   Option D contains two strongly supported conclusions drawn directly from the experimental data (\"G2 is a transcription factor\" and \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\"). Option A has only one supported conclusion. Despite the incorrect final clause about epistasis between G1 and G3, Option D provides the most accurate and comprehensive description of the gene interactions. The error is likely in the question's construction, but D remains the best fit.\n\n<<<D>>>"
