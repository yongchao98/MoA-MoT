    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene with Sodium Iodide**\n\n*   **Reactant B**: 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene has the formula C8H8Br4.\n*   **Reagent**: Sodium iodide (NaI) is often used as a debrominating or dehalogenating agent. In this reaction, with elevated temperature, it's expected to cause the elimination of the four bromine atoms.\n*   The reaction is `C8H8Br4 + 4 NaI -> Diene (C8H8) + 4 NaBr + 2 I2`. This is a reduction reaction where iodide (I⁻) is oxidized to iodine (I₂) and the organic molecule is reduced.\n*   We need to determine the structure of the resulting C8H8 diene. Two plausible isomers are:\n    1.  **o-Quinodimethane (or o-xylylene)**: This would require a significant skeletal rearrangement of the starting cyclohexadiene ring into a benzene ring.\n    2.  **5,6-Dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**: This structure can be formed by eliminating the four bromine atoms and two hydrogen atoms from the CHBr₂ groups to form two exocyclic double bonds (=CH₂). This transformation is C₈H₈Br₄ -> C₈H₈ (losing 4 Br atoms), which is a reduction that can be mediated by NaI. This transformation retains the original six-membered ring skeleton and is structurally more plausible than a complete rearrangement to an aromatic ring.\n\nLet's denote the formed diene as **D**. For now, we proceed assuming **D** is formed, and we will analyze its structure later.\n\n**Step 1 (continued): Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactant A**: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is a classic dienophile containing two equivalent double bonds.\n*   **Reaction**: A double Diels-Alder reaction occurs where two molecules of the diene **D** add to the two double bonds of reactant A.\n*   `A + 2 D -> Product 1`\n*   Since the dienophile (A) is symmetric with respect to its two double bonds, and two equivalents of the same diene (D) are used, the resulting **Product 1** will be a large, highly symmetric polycyclic molecule. The tert-butoxy group (-OtBu) lies on an element of symmetry.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction**: Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄/H₂O).\n*   **Transformation**: This is a standard condition for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of a tert-butyl ether to an alcohol.\n*   `Product 1 (-O-tBu) -> Product 2 (-OH) + Isobutylene`\n*   The overall structure of the polycyclic skeleton is unchanged. **Product 2** is a symmetric alcohol.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction**: Product 2 is treated with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO.\n*   **Transformation**: This is a Parikh-Doering oxidation, which selectively oxidizes primary or secondary alcohols to aldehydes or ketones under mild conditions. The alcohol group in Product 2 is secondary.\n*   `Product 2 (-CH-OH) -> Product 3 (-C=O)`\n*   **Product 3** is a symmetric polycyclic ketone.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n\n*   **Reaction**: Product 3 is heated to 150 °C.\n*   **Transformation**: Diels-Alder adducts, especially complex ones, often undergo a retro-Diels-Alder reaction upon heating. Product 3 is a double Diels-Alder adduct. It will decompose back into its constituent parts.\n*   `Product 3 -> Dienophile + 2 Diene (D)`\n*   The dienophile fragment corresponds to the original core of reactant A, but with the alcohol oxidized to a ketone. This fragment is **bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one**.\n*   This dienone is known to be thermally unstable. At 150 °C, it undergoes a retro-cheletropic reaction, eliminating carbon monoxide (CO) to form a very stable aromatic molecule, **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n*   So, the overall decomposition of Product 3 yields: `Product 3 -> Benzene + CO + 2 D`.\n*   The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogens on the **final product 4**. This implies that 4 is a single, specific organic molecule. In this context, it refers to the diene molecule **D**, which is reformed in the retro-Diels-Alder reaction.\n\n**Analysis of the Structure and NMR Spectrum of Product 4 (Diene D)**\n\n*   As argued in Step 1, the most plausible structure for the diene **D** is **5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene**.\n*   Let's determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n    *   The molecule is not planar, but on the NMR timescale, rapid conformational changes can result in an effective plane of symmetry (a Cₛ plane) that bisects the C5-C6 bond.\n    *   This symmetry makes the protons on the ring equivalent in pairs: H1 is equivalent to H4, and H2 is equivalent to H3. This gives **2 signals** from the ring protons.\n    *   The two exocyclic methylidene (=CH₂) groups are also equivalent due to this symmetry.\n    *   However, within a single methylidene group, the two protons are not equivalent. They are diastereotopic because the carbon atom they are attached to is connected to a chiral center (C5). One proton is geometrically closer to one side of the non-planar ring, and the other proton is closer to the other side. They are in different chemical environments and cannot be interchanged by any symmetry operation. Therefore, they will have different chemical shifts. This gives **2 signals** from the methylidene protons.\n    *   Total number of signals = 2 (ring) + 2 (methylidene) = **4**.\n\n*   *(Self-correction check: If the diene was o-quinodimethane, its C₂ᵥ symmetry would lead to 3 signals: two for the aromatic protons (H3/H6 and H4/H5) and one for the four equivalent methylidene protons. Since 3 is not an option, this further supports our choice for the diene's structure.)*\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe final product, 4, is 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene, which has **4** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4 is 4."
