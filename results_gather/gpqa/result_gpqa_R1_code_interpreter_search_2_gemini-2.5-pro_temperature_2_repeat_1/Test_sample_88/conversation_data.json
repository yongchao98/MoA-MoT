    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product and its NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the formation of Product 1\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane. This is a rigid, cage-like molecule with bromine atoms at two bridgehead positions.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess KOH at a high temperature (240°C). These are harsh basic/hydrolytic conditions.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Direct elimination (E2) is forbidden by Bredt's rule. An SN1/E1 mechanism involving a bridgehead carbocation is highly disfavored but possible under forcing conditions. These conditions are known to promote skeletal rearrangements in adamantane systems. A well-documented reaction for 1,3-dihalo-adamantanes under these conditions (hydrolysis at high temperature) is a rearrangement to form a **protoadamantan-4-one**. The protoadamantane skeleton (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³'⁸]decane) is a less stable isomer of adamantane.\n*   **Spectral Data for Product 1:**\n    *   **IR at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This strongly indicates the presence of a ketone (C=O) group, which is consistent with the product being protoadamantan-4-one.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** The provided NMR data (4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H)) does not match the literature spectrum of protoadamantan-4-one. The peak at 4.79 ppm is particularly anomalous. This suggests the provided spectral data may be erroneous or a simplified representation. We will proceed assuming the chemical transformation is correct, as this is a common scenario in organic chemistry roadmap problems.\n*   **Conclusion for Step 1:** Product 1 is **protoadamantan-4-one**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the formation of Product 2\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1 (protoadamantan-4-one).\n*   **Reagent:** Excess aluminum isopropoxide, Al(O-iPr)₃, with heating.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This reagent is characteristic of the Meerwein-Pondorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which reduces ketones to alcohols. However, the next step involves ozonolysis, which cleaves C=C double bonds. This implies that Product 2 must be an alkene. The combination of MPV reduction conditions (which are reversible) and heat can lead to the reduction of the ketone to an alcohol, followed by the elimination (dehydration) of water to form an alkene.\n    1.  **Reduction:** Protoadamantan-4-one is reduced to protoadamantan-4-ol.\n    2.  **Dehydration:** The alcohol (-OH at C4) is eliminated with a proton from an adjacent carbon. Elimination involving the bridgehead proton (at C3) is disfavored (Bredt's rule). Elimination involving a proton from C5 is feasible and leads to a stable alkene.\n*   **Conclusion for Step 2:** Product 2 is the alkene **protoadamant-4-ene** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³'⁸]dec-4-ene).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the formation of Product 3\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2 (protoadamant-4-ene).\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Ozone (O₃) at -78°C, 2. Dimethyl sulfide (DMS).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is an ozonolysis with a reductive workup. This reaction cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond and replaces it with two carbonyl groups. Since the double bond in protoadamant-4-ene is between two carbons that each have one hydrogen (`-CH=CH-`), the ozonolysis product will be a **dialdehyde**.\n*   **Structure of Product 3:** The C4=C5 double bond of protoadamant-4-ene is cleaved. This opens one of the rings of the tricyclic system, resulting in a C₁₀ bicyclic dialdehyde.\n    *   The double bond was between C4 and C5. C4 is adjacent to the bridgehead carbon C3 (a CH group). C5 is adjacent to the methylene carbon C6 (a CH₂ group).\n    *   Therefore, the resulting product (Product 3) is an **unsymmetrical dialdehyde**. It has two different aldehyde (-CHO) groups:\n        1.  One aldehyde group is attached to the carbon that was C3 in the original skeleton (a tertiary CH group). Let's call its aldehydic proton **Hₐ**.\n        2.  The other aldehyde group is attached to the carbon that was C6 (a secondary CH₂ group). Let's call its aldehydic proton **Hₑ**.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR of Product 3\n*   **Goal:** Determine the coupling pattern (splitting) of the most deshielded hydrogen atom.\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** In a dialdehyde, the most deshielded protons are the aldehydic protons (R-C**H**O), which typically appear at δ 9-10 ppm. All other protons are aliphatic and will appear at a much higher field (1-3 ppm). The question asks for the pattern of \"the\" most deshielded proton, implying we need to identify which of the two aldehyde protons, Hₐ or Hₑ, is further downfield.\n    *   A general trend in ¹H NMR is that substitution at the α-carbon deshields the aldehydic proton. Hₐ is on a CHO group attached to a tertiary carbon (C3), while Hₑ is on a CHO group attached to a secondary carbon (C6). Therefore, **Hₐ is likely the most deshielded proton**.\n*   **Splitting Pattern of Hₐ:** We need to analyze the couplings to Hₐ.\n    1.  **Vicinal Coupling (³J):** Hₐ is coupled to the proton on the adjacent carbon, which is C3. C3 is a CH group, so it has one proton (H3). This coupling will split the signal for Hₐ into a **doublet**.\n    2.  **Long-Range Coupling (⁴J):** In rigid cage-like systems, coupling over four bonds (often called a \"W-coupling\" due to the zigzag path of the bonds) is significant. Hₐ can couple to the protons on C2. The path is Hₐ-C(=O)-C3-C2-H₂. C2 is a CH₂ group with two protons. If these two protons are magnetically equivalent (or their coupling constants to Hₐ are coincidentally equal), they will split the signal for Hₐ into a **triplet**.\n*   **Combined Pattern:** The signal for Hₐ is first split into a doublet by H3, and each line of this doublet is then split into a triplet by the two H2 protons. The resulting pattern is a **doublet of triplets**.\n*   This pattern corresponds to option (C).\n\nLet's quickly check the other aldehyde proton, Hₑ, for completeness. It's attached to a CH₂ group, so its vicinal coupling would produce a triplet. Long-range couplings would further split this into a more complex pattern (e.g., triplet of doublets, etc.), which could potentially look like a triplet of triplets (Option A) under simplifying assumptions. However, since Hₐ is the most deshielded proton, its pattern is the one we need.\n\n**Final Conclusion:** The most deshielded proton is the aldehydic proton Hₐ. Its coupling pattern is a doublet (from the adjacent CH) of triplets (from long-range coupling to an adjacent CH₂ group).\n\n<<<C>>>"
