    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Original Decay and its Energy Spectrum**\n\n*   **Decay Process:** The original decay is `2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V`. Let's treat the initial `2A` particles and final `2B` particles as composite nuclei for simplicity, let's call them `N_A` and `N_B`. So the decay is effectively `N_A -> N_B + 2E + 2V`.\n*   **Final State:** The final state consists of five particles: the recoiling nucleus `N_B`, two `E` particles, and two `V` particles.\n*   **Energy Spectrum Shape:** In any particle decay, the total released energy (the Q-value) must be distributed among the final-state particles while conserving both energy and momentum.\n    *   If a decay produces only two particles in the final state, their energies and momenta are uniquely determined. This results in a discrete energy spectrum (a sharp peak).\n    *   If a decay produces three or more particles, the energy can be shared among them in an infinite number of ways. This results in a continuous energy spectrum for each of the outgoing particles.\n*   Since the original decay has five particles in the final state, the energy of the `E` particles (and the others) will have a continuous distribution. The problem confirms this by stating that the \"total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous\".\n\n### **2. Analyze the Variant Decay**\n\n*   **Decay Process:** The variant decay replaces the two `V` particles with a single exotic, massless particle `M`. The process is `2A -> 2B + 2E + M`, or `N_A -> N_B + 2E + M`.\n*   **Final State:** The new final state consists of four particles: the nucleus `N_B`, two `E` particles, and the particle `M`.\n*   **Energy Spectrum Shape:** This final state still has more than two particles (it has four). Therefore, the released energy will still be shared among these particles, leading to a continuous energy distribution. The spectrum of the `E` particles remains continuous. This allows us to eliminate options A and B, which claim the spectrum becomes discrete.\n*   The change in the number and type of particles in the final state will alter the probabilities of different energy distributions (due to different phase space factors), so the precise *shape* of the continuous spectrum will be adjusted.\n\n### **3. Compare the Endpoints of the Energy Spectra**\n\n*   **Q-value and Endpoint:** The endpoint of the kinetic energy spectrum of a particle corresponds to the maximum possible kinetic energy it can have. This maximum is fundamentally limited by the total energy released in the decay, known as the Q-value. The Q-value is the difference between the total rest mass of the initial particle(s) and the total rest mass of the final particles, converted to energy (`E = mc^2`).\n    *   `Q = (m_initial - m_final) * c^2`\n*   The endpoint of the *total* energy spectrum of the two `E` particles, which is given as `Q` in the problem, is the maximum value that the sum of their kinetic energies (`KE_1 + KE_2`) can take. This maximum value is essentially the Q-value of the reaction (ignoring the tiny recoil energy of the heavy nucleus).\n\n*   **Q-value of the Original Decay (`Q_orig`):**\n    `m_initial = m(2A)`\n    `m_final_orig = m(2B) + 2*m_E + 2*m_V`\n    `Q_orig = (m(2A) - (m(2B) + 2*m_E + 2*m_V)) * c^2`\n    The endpoint of the E spectrum is `Endpoint_orig ≈ Q_orig`.\n\n*   **Q-value of the Variant Decay (`Q_var`):**\n    `m_initial = m(2A)`\n    `m_final_var = m(2B) + 2*m_E + m_M`\n    `Q_var = (m(2A) - (m(2B) + 2*m_E + m_M)) * c^2`\n    The endpoint of the E spectrum in this case is `Endpoint_var ≈ Q_var`.\n\n*   **Comparing the Endpoints:**\n    We are given that particle `M` is massless, so `m_M = 0`.\n    We are told that `V` is a \"much lighter particle\". This implies it has some rest mass, so `m_V > 0`. (If it were massless, the problem would likely have stated so explicitly, as it did for M).\n\n    Let's compare the Q-values:\n    `Q_var = (m(2A) - m(2B) - 2*m_E) * c^2`\n    `Q_orig = (m(2A) - m(2B) - 2*m_E - 2*m_V) * c^2`\n\n    The difference is:\n    `Q_var - Q_orig = (-m_M*c^2) - (-2*m_V*c^2) = (2*m_V - m_M)*c^2`\n    Substituting `m_M = 0`, we get:\n    `Q_var - Q_orig = 2 * m_V * c^2`\n\n    Since `m_V > 0`, the difference `2 * m_V * c^2` is a positive value.\n    Therefore, `Q_var > Q_orig`.\n\n    This means that more energy is released in the variant decay because less mass is created in the final state (one massless particle `M` instead of two massive particles `V`). A higher Q-value means a higher maximum kinetic energy available to the `E` particles. Thus, the endpoint of the spectrum increases.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   The spectrum remains **continuous** because the final state is still a multi-body system.\n*   The endpoint of the spectrum **increases** because the total rest mass of the final state particles has decreased, leading to a larger Q-value.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
