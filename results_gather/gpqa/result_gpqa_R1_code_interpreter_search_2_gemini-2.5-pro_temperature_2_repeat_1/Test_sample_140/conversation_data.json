    "This problem requires an understanding of the elimination-addition reaction mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate, as well as the consideration of a kinetic isotope effect due to the presence of deuterium.\n\n**1. Reaction Identification**\n\n*   **Reactant:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (D, an isotope of hydrogen) at position 2.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is an extremely strong base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction of an aryl halide with a very strong base proceeds through a benzyne intermediate. The mechanism is elimination-addition.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n\nThe amide anion (:NH2-) acts as a base and removes a proton from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (the bromine atom). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two *ortho* positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n*   Position C2, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n*   Position C6, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n\nThe amide ion can abstract either the deuteron from C2 or the proton from C6. This leads to two different reaction pathways.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The amide ion removes the proton from C6. This is generally faster than removing a deuteron due to the primary kinetic isotope effect (C-H bonds are broken more easily than C-D bonds).\n    2.  This forms a phenyl carbanion at position C6.\n    3.  The carbanion at C6 attacks C1, displacing the bromide ion (Br-).\n    4.  The result is a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. This pathway is slower but still possible.\n    2.  This forms a phenyl carbanion at position C2.\n    3.  The carbanion at C2 attacks C1, displacing the bromide ion (Br-).\n    4.  The result is a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom has been removed. This intermediate is the simple, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are formed in this reaction.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition (Formation of Final Products)**\n\nThe amide anion (:NH2-) now acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the two sp-hybridized carbons of the benzyne triple bond. This is followed by protonation from the solvent (NH3). We need to consider the addition to both benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate 1 (3-deuterobenzyne)**\n    *   The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium is at C2. The nucleophile (:NH2-) can attack either C1 or C6.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH2 group attaches to C1, forming a carbanion at C6. Protonation of this carbanion by NH3 yields a product with the -NH2 group at C1 and the D at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH2 group attaches to C6, forming a carbanion at C1. Protonation of this carbanion yields a product with the -NH2 group at C6 and the D at C2. If we renumber this molecule according to IUPAC rules (the -NH2 group defines C1), the deuterium atom is at position 3. This product is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Products from Intermediate 2 (Benzyne)**\n    *   This is the standard benzyne intermediate with no deuterium.\n    *   The nucleophile (:NH2-) attacks either carbon of the triple bond (C1 or C2). Due to symmetry, both attacks lead to the same product.\n    *   The addition of :NH2- followed by protonation results in **aniline**.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nBy considering all possible pathways, we find three distinct organic products can be formed:\n1.  **Aniline** (from the non-deuterated benzyne intermediate)\n2.  **2-Deuteroaniline** (from the 3-deuterobenzyne intermediate)\n3.  **3-Deuteroaniline** (from the 3-deuterobenzyne intermediate)\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>"
