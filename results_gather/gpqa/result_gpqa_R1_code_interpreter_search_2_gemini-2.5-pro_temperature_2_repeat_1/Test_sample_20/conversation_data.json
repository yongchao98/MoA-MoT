    "*   **Analysis of Tautomerism (Compound A)**\n\n    *   Tautomerism is a form of isomerism where isomers can interconvert by a chemical reaction called tautomerization. A common example is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an α-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group) on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom.\n\n    *   **Benzoquinone (specifically, p-benzoquinone or 1,4-benzoquinone):** The structure is a six-membered ring containing two ketone groups (C=O) at opposite positions and two carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C). Its molecular formula is C₆H₄O₂.\n        Let's examine the alpha-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl carbons). All four carbons that are not part of the carbonyl groups are sp²-hybridized as they are part of C=C double bonds. They each have one hydrogen atom attached. Since there are no alpha-hydrogens on sp³-hybridized carbon atoms, benzoquinone cannot undergo the standard keto-enol tautomerism. The related compound, hydroquinone (benzene-1,4-diol), has the molecular formula C₆H₆O₂, which is different from benzoquinone. Therefore, their interconversion is a redox reaction, not tautomerism. Thus, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. Its molecular formula is C₆H₆O₃. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are sp³-hybridized and each carries two hydrogen atoms. These are alpha-hydrogens to the adjacent carbonyl groups. The presence of these highly acidic alpha-hydrogens (each flanked by two carbonyl groups) allows for keto-enol tautomerism. The molecule can tautomerize to form its enol, benzene-1,3,5-triol (also known as phloroglucinol), which has the same molecular formula (C₆H₆O₃). Since the enol form is aromatic, it is very stable, and the equilibrium lies heavily in favor of the enol form. Thus, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism**.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Compound B)**\n\n    *   Optical isomerism (enantiomerism) is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's analyze the carbon atom at position 2. It is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl group)\n        Since the central carbon is attached to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is therefore chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism (it has two enantiomers: R and S forms). Thus, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism**.\n\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid (trans-butenedioic acid). Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two ester groups (-COOCH₃) in a trans configuration across the double bond. The molecule does not have any chiral centers (no carbon is bonded to four different groups). Furthermore, the molecule has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C bond. A molecule possessing a center of inversion is achiral. Since it is achiral, it cannot be optically active. Thus, **dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism**.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer Combination**\n\n    *   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n    This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
