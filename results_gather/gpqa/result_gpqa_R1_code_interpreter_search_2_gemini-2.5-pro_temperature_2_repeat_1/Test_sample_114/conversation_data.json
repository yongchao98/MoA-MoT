    "This is a classic relativistic physics problem involving electron-positron annihilation. We need to apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Define the initial state:**\n    *   We have an electron and a positron, which have the same rest mass, denoted as `m_e`.\n    *   The electron moves from the left (let's define this as the positive x-direction) with a Lorentz factor `γ_e = 4`.\n    *   The positron moves from the right (negative x-direction) with a Lorentz factor `γ_p = 2`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the total initial energy (E_initial):**\n    *   The relativistic energy of a particle is given by `E = γmc²`.\n    *   Energy of the electron: `E_e = γ_e * m_e * c² = 4 * m_e * c²`.\n    *   Energy of the positron: `E_p = γ_p * m_e * c² = 2 * m_e * c²`.\n    *   Total initial energy is the sum of their individual energies:\n        `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4 * m_e * c² + 2 * m_e * c² = 6 * m_e * c²`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the total initial momentum (p_initial):**\n    *   Momentum is a vector. The relativistic momentum is related to energy by `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`.\n    *   From this, we can find the magnitude of the momentum: `p = sqrt(E² - (mc²)²) / c = sqrt((γmc²)² - (mc²)²) / c = sqrt(γ² - 1) * mc`.\n    *   Momentum of the electron (in the +x direction):\n        `p_e = sqrt(γ_e² - 1) * m_e * c = sqrt(4² - 1) * m_e * c = sqrt(15) * m_e * c`.\n    *   Momentum of the positron (in the -x direction):\n        `p_p = -sqrt(γ_p² - 1) * m_e * c = -sqrt(2² - 1) * m_e * c = -sqrt(3) * m_e * c`.\n    *   Total initial momentum is the vector sum. Since it's all along the x-axis:\n        `p_initial = p_e + p_p = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c`.\n\n4.  **Define the final state:**\n    *   The final state consists of two photons.\n    *   The problem states their energies are equal: `E_photon1 = E_photon2 = E_γ`.\n\n5.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   `E_initial = E_final`\n    *   `6 * m_e * c² = E_γ + E_γ = 2 * E_γ`\n    *   Solving for the energy of each photon: `E_γ = 3 * m_e * c²`.\n\n6.  **Apply Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   For a photon, momentum `p_γ` is related to energy `E_γ` by `p_γ = E_γ / c`.\n    *   So, the momentum of each photon is `p_γ = (3 * m_e * c²) / c = 3 * m_e * c`.\n    *   The initial momentum is entirely in the x-direction. This means the total final momentum must also be in the x-direction, and the y-components of the photons' momenta must cancel out.\n    *   Given one photon is \"upper-right\" and the other is \"lower-right\", and their momentum magnitudes are equal, they must be moving at equal and opposite angles `θ` and `-θ` relative to the horizontal (x-axis).\n    *   The final momentum in the x-direction is the sum of the x-components of the two photons' momenta:\n        `p_final_x = p_γ * cos(θ) + p_γ * cos(-θ) = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ)`.\n    *   Now, we equate initial and final momentum:\n        `p_initial = p_final_x`\n        `(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c = 2 * (3 * m_e * c) * cos(θ)`\n\n7.  **Solve for the angle:**\n    *   We can cancel `m_e * c` from both sides:\n        `sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = 6 * cos(θ)`\n    *   `cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6`\n    *   The total angle between the two photons is `2θ`. We need to calculate `2 * arccos((sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6)`.\n\n8.  **Calculation:**\n    *   We can use Python to compute the final value.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Calculate the value inside the arccos function\ncos_theta = (np.sqrt(15) - np.sqrt(3)) / 6\n\n# Calculate the angle theta in degrees\ntheta_degrees = np.degrees(np.arccos(cos_theta))\n\n# The total angle between the photons is 2 * theta\ntotal_angle = 2 * theta_degrees\n\nprint(total_angle)\n```\n\nThe computed result is approximately 138.2 degrees. Comparing this with the given options, the closest one is 138.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the horizontal axis, but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate producing 2 photons.\n\nThe energies of both photons were measured and they have the same value. The directions were also measured. One of the photons was moving in the upper-right direction, while another in the lower-right direction.\n\nWhat is the angle between the directions of the photons?\n\n### Reasoning and Solution\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution using the principles of conservation of energy and momentum in special relativity.\n\n1.  **Define System and Coordinates**\n    *   Let the collision occur at the origin (x=0, y=0).\n    *   The horizontal axis is the x-axis.\n    *   The electron moves from the left, so its velocity is in the +x direction.\n    *   The positron moves from the right, so its velocity is in the -x direction.\n    *   The rest mass of an electron (and a positron) is `m_e`.\n\n2.  **Calculate Initial Energy (E_initial)**\n    *   The relativistic energy of a particle is given by `E = γmc²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `m` is the rest mass, and `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   Energy of the electron (`e⁻`): `E_e = γ_e * m_e * c² = 4 * m_e * c²`\n    *   Energy of the positron (`e⁺`): `E_p = γ_p * m_e * c² = 2 * m_e * c²`\n    *   The total initial energy is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron:\n        `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4m_ec² + 2m_ec² = 6m_ec²`\n\n3.  **Calculate Initial Momentum (p_initial)**\n    *   Momentum is a vector. The magnitude of the relativistic momentum is `p = γmv = sqrt(γ² - 1)mc`.\n    *   Momentum of the electron (`p_e`): It's in the +x direction.\n        `p_e = sqrt(γ_e² - 1) * m_e * c = sqrt(4² - 1) * m_e * c = sqrt(15) * m_e * c`\n    *   Momentum of the positron (`p_p`): It's in the -x direction.\n        `p_p = -sqrt(γ_p² - 1) * m_e * c = -sqrt(2² - 1) * m_e * c = -sqrt(3) * m_e * c`\n    *   The total initial momentum is the vector sum, which in this case is the sum of the x-components:\n        `p_initial_x = p_e + p_p = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c`\n    *   The initial momentum in the y-direction is zero: `p_initial_y = 0`.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Final State (Two Photons)**\n    *   The collision produces two photons. Let's call them `γ_1` and `γ_2`.\n    *   The problem states their energies are equal: `E_γ1 = E_γ2 = E_γ`.\n\n5.  **Apply Conservation of Energy**\n    *   `E_initial = E_final`\n    *   `6m_ec² = E_γ1 + E_γ2 = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ`\n    *   Solving for the energy of each photon:\n        `E_γ = 3m_ec²`\n\n6.  **Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n    *   The momentum of a photon is `p = E/c`. So, the magnitude of the momentum for each photon is:\n        `p_γ = E_γ / c = (3m_ec²) / c = 3m_ec`\n    *   One photon moves \"upper-right\" and the other \"lower-right\". Let's say the first photon moves at an angle `θ` with respect to the x-axis, and the second moves at an angle `-φ`.\n    *   **Conservation in the y-direction:** The initial y-momentum is 0. The final y-momentum must also be 0.\n        `p_final_y = p_γ * sin(θ) + p_γ * sin(-φ) = p_γ * (sin(θ) - sin(φ))`\n        `0 = p_γ * (sin(θ) - sin(φ))`, which implies `sin(θ) = sin(φ)`. Since the photons move into the upper and lower half-planes respectively, `θ = φ`. The angles relative to the horizontal are equal in magnitude and opposite in sign.\n    *   **Conservation in the x-direction:** The initial x-momentum must equal the final x-momentum.\n        `p_initial_x = p_final_x`\n        `(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))m_ec = p_γ * cos(θ) + p_γ * cos(-θ)`\n        Since `cos(-θ) = cos(θ)`, this simplifies to:\n        `(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))m_ec = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ)`\n\n7.  **Solve for the Angle**\n    *   Now substitute the value of `p_γ = 3m_ec` into the momentum conservation equation:\n        `(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))m_ec = 2 * (3m_ec) * cos(θ)`\n    *   We can cancel `m_ec` from both sides:\n        `sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = 6 * cos(θ)`\n    *   Solve for `cos(θ)`:\n        `cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6`\n    *   The question asks for the total angle between the two photons, which is `θ + θ = 2θ`.\n    *   `θ = arccos((sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6)`\n    *   Total Angle = `2 * arccos((sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6)`\n\n8.  **Calculation**\n    *   `sqrt(15) ≈ 3.873`\n    *   `sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732`\n    *   `cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 = 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568`\n    *   `θ ≈ arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°`\n    *   Total Angle = `2 * θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° ≈ 138.2°`\n\nThe calculated angle is approximately 138 degrees, which matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
