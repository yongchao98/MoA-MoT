    "This problem requires comparing the magnitude of two energy values: the paramagnetic coupling energy ($ \\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle $) due to an external magnetic field and the energy of a specific atomic transition ($ \\Delta E $).\n\n### **1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n#### **Step 1: Define the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy ($ \\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle $)**\n\nThe energy of interaction between an atom's orbital magnetic moment and an external magnetic field is known as the Zeeman effect. The Hamiltonian for this interaction is $H_Z = -\\vec{\\mu}_L \\cdot \\vec{B}$.\nThe orbital magnetic moment is given by $\\vec{\\mu}_L = -\\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L}$, where $\\vec{L}$ is the orbital angular momentum operator.\n\nThus, the Hamiltonian becomes:\n$H_Z = \\frac{e}{2m_e} \\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nThe problem states that the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is parallel to the Oz axis, so $\\vec{B} = B\\hat{z}$. The dot product simplifies to:\n$H_Z = \\frac{eB}{2m_e} L_z$\n\nThe expectation value of this Hamiltonian gives the energy shift. The eigenvalues of the $L_z$ operator are $m\\hbar$, where $m$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number. Therefore, the energy is:\n$\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e} m B$\n\nThe term $\\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}$ is a fundamental physical constant known as the **Bohr magneton**, denoted by $\\mu_B$.\n$\\mu_B = 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/T}$\n\nSo, the formula for the paramagnetic coupling energy simplifies to:\n$\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = \\mu_B m B$\n\nGiven values:\n-   Magnetic field, $B = 1 \\text{ T}$\n-   Orbital magnetic quantum number, $m$, is small. For an order-of-magnitude comparison, we can take the smallest non-zero integer value, $m=1$.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n$\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/T}) \\times 1 \\times (1 \\text{ T}) = 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}$\n\n#### **Step 2: Define the Transition Energy ($ \\Delta E $)**\n\nThe energy of a photon emitted or absorbed during an atomic transition is related to its wavelength $\\lambda$ by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\n\nWhere:\n-   $h$ is Planck's constant\n-   $c$ is the speed of light\n-   A useful combination is $hc \\approx 1240 \\text{ eV} \\cdot \\text{nm}$\n\nThe given wavelength is:\n$\\lambda = 0.4861 \\mu\\text{m} = 486.1 \\text{ nm}$\n\nNow, we can calculate the transition energy in electron-volts (eV):\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{1240 \\text{ eV} \\cdot \\text{nm}}{486.1 \\text{ nm}} \\approx 2.55 \\text{ eV}$\n\n(Note: This wavelength corresponds to the Balmer series H-beta line in Hydrogen, the transition from n=4 to n=2).\n\n#### **Step 3: Compare the Magnitudes**\n\nNow we compare the two calculated energies:\n-   Paramagnetic coupling energy: $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle \\approx 5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}$\n-   Transition energy: $\\Delta E \\approx 2.55 \\text{ eV}$\n\nTo see the relationship clearly, let's compute their ratio:\n$\\frac{\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}}{2.55 \\text{ eV}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\nThis ratio is extremely small ($ \\sim 10^{-5} $). This means that the energy associated with the paramagnetic coupling to a 1 Tesla field is many orders of magnitude smaller than the typical energy of a visible light transition in a Hydrogen atom.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E$.\n\n#### **Step 4: Verification with Code**\n\nTo confirm the manual calculation, we can use a Python script with more precise constants.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Constants\nmu_B_eVT = 5.7883818012e-5  # Bohr magneton in eV/T\nh_eVs = 4.135667696e-15      # Planck's constant in eV*s\nc_ms = 299792458             # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Given values\nB = 1.0  # Magnetic field in Tesla\nm = 1    # Small orbital magnetic quantum number\nlambda_m = 0.4861e-6 # Wavelength in meters\n\n# Calculate Paramagnetic Coupling Energy\nH_coupling_eV = mu_B_eVT * m * B\n\n# Calculate Transition Energy\nDelta_E_eV = (h_eVs * c_ms) / lambda_m\n\n# Compare the two energies\nprint(f\"Paramagnetic Coupling Energy <H> = {H_coupling_eV:.4e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Transition Energy Delta_E = {Delta_E_eV:.4e} eV\")\n\n# Calculate the ratio\nratio = H_coupling_eV / Delta_E_eV\nprint(f\"Ratio <H>/Delta_E = {ratio:.4e}\")\n\n# Conclusion based on the ratio\nif ratio < 0.001:  # A threshold for \"much less than\"\n    print(\"Conclusion: <H> << Delta_E\")\n```\nThe output of this code will provide a precise comparison, confirming the manual analysis.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe energy of the paramagnetic coupling term is given by $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = \\mu_B m B$. For $m=1$ and $B=1$T, this energy is:\n$\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/T}) \\cdot 1 \\cdot (1 \\text{ T}) \\approx 5.8 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}$\n\nThe transition energy corresponding to a wavelength of $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\mu m = 486.1 \\text{ nm}$ is:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} = \\frac{1240 \\text{ eV} \\cdot \\text{nm}}{486.1 \\text{ nm}} \\approx 2.55 \\text{ eV}$\n\nComparing the two energy values:\n$5.8 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}$ is vastly smaller than $2.55 \\text{ eV}$.\nThe ratio is on the order of $10^{-5}$, which signifies that the paramagnetic energy is negligible compared to the atomic transition energy.\n\nThus, $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll\\Delta E$.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "An external magnetic field interacts with the orbital magnetic moment of an atomic electron, causing an energy shift. This interaction is described by the paramagnetic coupling term (also known as the Zeeman effect). We need to compare the magnitude of this energy shift with the energy of a specific atomic transition.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$\n\nThe Hamiltonian for the interaction of the orbital magnetic moment with an external magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is:\n$ H = -\\vec{\\mu}_L \\cdot \\vec{B} $\nwhere $\\vec{\\mu}_L = -\\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L}$ is the orbital magnetic dipole moment.\n\nSubstituting $\\vec{\\mu}_L$ into the Hamiltonian, we get:\n$ H = \\frac{e}{2m_e} \\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B} $\n\nThe problem states that the magnetic field is parallel to the z-axis, so $\\vec{B} = B\\hat{k}$. The expression simplifies to:\n$ H = \\frac{eB}{2m_e} L_z $\n\nThe energy shift, which is the expectation value of this Hamiltonian, is given by the eigenvalues of $L_z$, which are $m\\hbar$. Thus,\n$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\frac{eB}{2m_e} (m\\hbar) = \\left( \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e} \\right) m B $\n\nThe term in the parenthesis is a fundamental physical constant known as the **Bohr magneton**, $\\mu_B$.\n$ \\mu_B = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e} \\approx 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J/T} \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/T} $\n\nSo the energy shift is:\n$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\mu_B m B $\n\nWe are given:\n- Magnetic field, $B = 1 \\text{ T}$\n- A small value for the orbital magnetic quantum number, $m$. For an order-of-magnitude comparison, we can take the smallest non-zero integer value, $m = 1$.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/T}) \\cdot 1 \\cdot (1 \\text{ T}) $\n$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\approx 5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV} $\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Transition Energy $\\Delta E$\n\nThe energy of a photon emitted or absorbed during an atomic transition is related to its wavelength $\\lambda$ by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n$ \\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} $\n\nA useful value for the product of Planck's constant and the speed of light is $hc \\approx 1240 \\text{ eV} \\cdot \\text{nm}$.\nThe given wavelength is $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\mu\\text{m} = 486.1 \\text{ nm}$. This wavelength corresponds to the blue-green H-beta line in the hydrogen spectrum (the transition from the n=4 to the n=2 energy level).\n\nNow we can calculate the transition energy:\n$ \\Delta E = \\frac{1240 \\text{ eV} \\cdot \\text{nm}}{486.1 \\text{ nm}} \\approx 2.55 \\text{ eV} $\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Magnitudes\n\nNow we compare the two energy values:\n- Paramagnetic Coupling Energy: $ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\approx 5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV} $\n- Transition Energy: $ \\Delta E \\approx 2.55 \\text{ eV} $\n\nLet's look at the ratio:\n$ \\frac{\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}}{2.55 \\text{ eV}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5} $\n\nThe ratio is extremely small, indicating that the energy from the paramagnetic coupling with a 1 T field is many orders of magnitude smaller than the energy of a typical electronic transition in the visible spectrum.\n\nTherefore, the correct relationship is:\n$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E $\n\nThis means that the Zeeman splitting caused by a reasonably strong laboratory magnetic field is a very small perturbation compared to the energy differences between principal electron shells in an atom.\n\n<<<D>>>"
