    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Part 1: Identifying the Starting Material**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula:** The given molecular formula is C8H9NO. We first calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) to get clues about the structure.\n    DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBE) and one additional double bond or ring.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H-NMR Data:**\n    *   **δ 9.72 (t, 1H):** This signal is in the characteristic region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons (n=2, according to the n+1 rule), meaning it is next to a -CH2- group. This confirms a `-CH2-CHO` fragment.\n    *   **δ 6.98 (d, 2H) and δ 6.51 (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region (6.5-8.0 ppm), each integrating to 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring. The chemical shifts are relatively low (upfield), which indicates that the substituents on the ring are electron-donating.\n    *   **δ 6.27 (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet integrating to two protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH2) group attached to an aromatic ring. The amine group is a strong electron-donating group, which is consistent with the upfield aromatic signals.\n    *   **δ 3.66 (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a -CH2- group. Its doublet (d) splitting indicates it is coupled to a single adjacent proton (n=1), which is the aldehyde proton. This confirms the `-CH2-CHO` fragment deduced earlier.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Structure:** Based on the analysis, we have a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring. The two substituents are an amine group (-NH2) and an ethanal group (-CH2-CHO).\n\n    The structure is **2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal** (also known as 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde).\n\n    Let's verify the molecular formula:\n    *   C6H4 (para-disubstituted ring)\n    *   NH2 (amine group)\n    *   C2H3O (ethanal group, -CH2CHO)\n    *   Total: C8H9NO. The formula is correct.\n\n**Part 2: Analyzing the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material, 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal, undergoes a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n1.  **NaNO2 + HCl (diazotization):** This reagent mixture, used at low temperatures (0-5 °C), converts a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n    The product is 2-(4-diazoniophenyl)ethanal chloride.\n\n2.  **H2O (hydrolysis):** Adding water and warming the solution causes the diazonium group to be replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH), releasing N2 gas. This is a Sandmeyer-type reaction.\n    The intermediate product formed is **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal** (or 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde).\n\n3.  **aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation):** The product from step 2, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal, is treated with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This molecule contains both an aldehyde group and acidic alpha-protons (on the -CH2- group adjacent to the aldehyde). These are the perfect conditions for a self-condensation aldol reaction.\n\n**Part 3: The Aldol Condensation Mechanism**\n\nThe aldol condensation proceeds in two stages: addition and dehydration.\n\n*   **Stage 1: Aldol Addition**\n    The base (OH-) removes an acidic α-proton from one molecule of 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. Subsequent protonation of the resulting alkoxide yields the aldol addition product.\n\n    The structure of the addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option (C).\n\n*   **Stage 2: Dehydration (Condensation)**\n    The reaction is performed under \"Heat\", which promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol adduct to form a more stable, conjugated system. The hydroxyl group (-OH) from C3 and the most acidic proton, which is on C2 (alpha to the carbonyl group), are eliminated. This forms a double bond between C2 and C3.\n\n    The resulting final product has the following structure:\n    (HO-Ph)-CH2-CH=C(Ph-OH)-CHO\n    Let's name this structure according to IUPAC rules:\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (aldehyde) is 4 carbons long, with a double bond starting at C2. The parent name is **but-2-enal**.\n    *   There is a (4-hydroxyphenyl) group on C2.\n    *   There is a (4-hydroxyphenyl) group on C4.\n    *   Therefore, the final product name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe final product of the reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal, which matches option (D). Option (C) is the intermediate aldol adduct, which dehydrates upon heating to give the final product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
