    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material**\n\n*   The substrate is **(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane**.\n*   This name describes a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6.\n*   The fusion is necessarily *cis*, meaning the C1-O and C6-O bonds are on the same face of the cyclohexane ring. Let's represent this using a planar hexagon view with wedge (up) and dash (down) bonds. We will assume the oxygen atom is on the 'up' face (wedge).\n*   The molecule has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4.\n*   To satisfy the given stereochemistry (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S), we must determine the orientation (wedge/dash) of all substituents. We assign priorities based on Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules.\n\n    *   Let's draw the planar structure and assign stereochemistry:\n        *   Epoxide Oxygen: **wedge (up)**.\n        *   **At C6 (must be S):** The substituents are O(7), C1, C5, and an implicit H. Priorities: O > C1 > C5 > H. With O as wedge, the H must be **dash (down)** to give the S configuration (viewing from the H, O→C1→C5 is counter-clockwise). This is consistent.\n        *   **At C1 (must be R):** The substituents are O(7), C6, C2, and a methyl group. Priorities: O > C6 > C2 > Me. With O as wedge, the methyl group must be **dash (down)** to give the R configuration (viewing from the methyl group, O→C6→C2 is clockwise). This is consistent.\n        *   **At C3 (must be R):** Substituents are C2, C4, a methyl group, and H. Priorities: C2 > C4 > Me > H. To get R configuration, the methyl group must be **dash (down)** and H must be **wedge (up)** (viewing with H as wedge, the path C2→C4→Me is counter-clockwise, which corresponds to R).\n        *   **At C4 (must be R):** Substituents are C5, C3, a methyl group, and H. Priorities: C5 > C3 > Me > H. To get R configuration, the methyl group must be **wedge (up)** and H must be **dash (down)** (viewing with H as dash, the path C5→C3→Me is clockwise, which corresponds to R).\n\n    *   **Summary of Starting Material Stereochemistry:**\n        *   Epoxide O: **wedge**\n        *   C1-Me: **dash**\n        *   C3-Me: **dash** (H is wedge)\n        *   C4-Me: **wedge** (H is dash)\n        *   C6-H: **dash**\n\n**2. Analyze the Reagent and Reaction**\n\n*   The reagent is **Me₂CuLi** (lithium dimethylcuprate or Gilman reagent), which is a source of a soft methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n*   The problem states two key rules for the reaction of organocuprates with epoxides:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds via an **S_N2 mechanism**, which means the nucleophile attacks from the backside of the C-O bond, causing an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked.\n\n**3. Determine the Reaction Pathway**\n\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The epoxide carbons are C1 and C6. C1 is substituted with a methyl group, while C6 is substituted with a hydrogen atom. Therefore, **C6 is the less hindered carbon**, and the methyl nucleophile will attack C6.\n*   **Stereoselectivity:**\n    *   The nucleophilic attack occurs at C6.\n    *   The C6-O bond is on the **wedge** side.\n    *   The S_N2 attack must occur from the opposite side, i.e., the **dash** side.\n    *   A new C6-Me bond is formed, and it will be **dash**.\n    *   The attack causes inversion of configuration at C6. The hydrogen atom at C6, which was originally **dash**, will be pushed into the **wedge** position.\n    *   The C6-O bond breaks, and the oxygen (as an alkoxide, O⁻) remains attached to C1. Its bond (C1-O) remains **wedge**. After acidic workup, this becomes a hydroxyl group (-OH) which is **wedge**.\n    *   The configurations at C1, C3, and C4 are not affected by the reaction.\n\n**4. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\n*   **Structure using old numbering:**\n    *   At C1: OH is **wedge**, Me is **dash**.\n    *   At C6: New Me is **dash**, H is **wedge**.\n    *   At C3: Me is **dash**, H is **wedge**.\n    *   At C4: Me is **wedge**, H is **dash**.\n*   **IUPAC Naming of the Product:**\n    *   The main functional group is the alcohol (-OH), so the carbon it's attached to (old C1) becomes the new C1.\n    *   We number the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   Substituents are at old positions C1, C6, C3, C4.\n    *   Numbering clockwise (CW) from new C1 gives Me groups at new C1, C2(old C6), C4(old C4), C5(old C3). The locant set is {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n    *   Numbering counter-clockwise (CCW) gives Me groups at new C1, C3(old C3), C4(old C4), C6(old C6). The locant set is {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n    *   The set {1, 2, 4, 5} is lower, so the CW numbering is correct.\n    *   The product name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**5. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\nNow we determine the R/S configuration for each stereocenter in the product using the new numbering.\n\n*   **New C1 (Old C1):** Unchanged. Was R, remains **R**.\n    *   (Verification: OH(w), Me(d), C2, C6. Priorities: OH > C2 > C6 > Me. Me is dash. Path OH→C2→C6 is CW -> R.)\n*   **New C2 (Old C6):** Configuration is inverted. Was S, but we must re-calculate due to priority changes and inversion.\n    *   (Verification: New Me(d), H(w), C1, C3. Priorities: C1 > C3 > Me > H. H is wedge. Path C1→C3→Me is CW. CW with lowest priority group wedge -> **S**.)\n*   **New C4 (Old C4):** Unchanged. Was R, remains **R**.\n    *   (Verification: Me(w), H(d), C3, C5. Priorities: C5 > C3 > Me > H. H is dash. Path C5→C3→Me is CW -> R.)\n*   **New C5 (Old C3):** Unchanged. Was R, remains **R**.\n    *   (Verification: Me(d), H(w), C4, C6. Priorities: C4 > C6 > Me > H. H is wedge. Path C4→C6→Me is CCW. CCW with lowest priority group wedge -> R.)\n\n**6. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe final product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nComparing this to the options:\nA) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Incorrect name)\nB) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol **(Correct)**\nC) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Incorrect stereochemistry at C2)\nD) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol (Incorrect name and stereochemistry)\n\n<<<B>>>"
