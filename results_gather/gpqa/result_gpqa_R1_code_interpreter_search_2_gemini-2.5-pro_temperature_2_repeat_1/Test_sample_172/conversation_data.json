The problem states the electron has a speed v = 2 * 10^8 m/s. This is a significant fraction of the speed of light (c ≈ 3 * 10^8 m/s), so we must use the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n    E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²\n    where m₀ is the rest mass of the electron.\n\n    Differentiating both sides with respect to p:\n    2E (dE/dp) = 2p c²\n    dE/dp = pc² / E\n\n    Now we use the relativistic definitions of energy and momentum:\n    E = γm₀c²\n    p = γm₀v\n    where γ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n    Substituting these into the expression for dE/dp:\n    dE/dp = (γm₀v)c² / (γm₀c²) = v\n\n    Therefore, the relationship between the uncertainties is surprisingly simple and holds for both relativistic and non-relativistic cases:\n    ΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp\n\n4.  **Combine the equations and calculate the value:**\n    *   From the uncertainty principle, the minimum uncertainty in momentum is:\n        Δp_min = ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx)\n    *   Substituting this into our energy-momentum uncertainty relation:\n        ΔE_min = v ⋅ Δp_min = v ⋅ (ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx))\n\n5.  **Plug in the numerical values:**\n    *   v = 2 * 10^8 m/s\n    *   Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 * 10⁻⁹ m = 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   ħ ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n\n    Now, let's use a Python script for an accurate calculation.\n\n```python\n# Constants\nhbar = 1.054571817e-34  # Reduced Planck constant in J.s\nv = 2e8  # speed of the electron in m/s\ndelta_x = 0.1e-9  # uncertainty in position in m\n\n# From Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, the minimum uncertainty in momentum is:\n# delta_p_min = hbar / (2 * delta_x)\ndelta_p_min = hbar / (2 * delta_x)\n\n# The relation between energy and momentum uncertainty is Delta_E = v * Delta_p.\n# So, the minimum uncertainty in energy is:\ndelta_E_min = v * delta_p_min\n\nprint(f\"{delta_E_min:.3e}\")\n```\n>>>\n1.055e-16\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 1.055 × 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    A) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\n    B) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\n    C) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\n    D) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\n\nThe calculated value, 1.055 × 10⁻¹⁶ J, is very close to 10⁻¹⁶ J.
