    "This problem is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the uncertainty in a quantum state's energy (ΔE) to its lifetime (Δt).\n\n**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n*   **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The relationship between the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the lifetime (Δt) of a state is given by:\n    ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where ħ (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant. For calculation purposes, we can use the minimum uncertainty, so we can write:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt\n\n*   **Interpretation of \"Clearly Resolved\":** For two energy levels, E1 and E2, to be clearly resolved or distinguished, the difference in their energies, |E1 - E2|, must be greater than the energy uncertainty (also known as the natural linewidth) of the levels. A common criterion is that the energy difference must be greater than the larger of the two individual energy uncertainties.\n\n*   **Calculate Energy Uncertainties:** We first need to calculate the energy uncertainty (ΔE) for each state. The value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ) in units of eV·s is approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n    *   **For State 1:**\n        *   Lifetime (Δt₁) = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty (ΔE₁) ≈ ħ / Δt₁\n\n    *   **For State 2:**\n        *   Lifetime (Δt₂) = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty (ΔE₂) ≈ ħ / Δt₂\n\n*   **Determine the Limiting Factor:** State 1 has a shorter lifetime (10⁻⁹ s) compared to State 2 (10⁻⁸ s). According to the uncertainty principle, a shorter lifetime leads to a *larger* energy uncertainty. Therefore, ΔE₁ will be larger than ΔE₂, and this larger uncertainty is the primary factor limiting our ability to resolve the two energy levels.\n\n*   **Apply the Resolution Criterion:** To clearly distinguish the two states, the energy difference between them must be larger than the largest energy uncertainty:\n    |E1 - E2| > ΔE₁\n\n*   **Calculation:** Let's calculate the value of ΔE₁ to find the minimum required energy separation.\n\n```python\n# Value of reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nh_bar_eVs = 6.582e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states in seconds\ndelta_t1 = 1e-9\ndelta_t2 = 1e-8\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (Delta_E approx h_bar / Delta_t)\ndelta_E1 = h_bar_eVs / delta_t1\ndelta_E2 = h_bar_eVs / delta_t2\n\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty of State 1 (ΔE1): {delta_E1:.2e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty of State 2 (ΔE2): {delta_E2:.2e} eV\")\nprint(f\"For the states to be clearly resolved, the energy difference |E1 - E2| must be greater than the larger uncertainty, which is ΔE1.\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, we need |E1 - E2| > {delta_E1:.2e} eV\")\n\n# Let's check the given options:\noptions = {'A': 1e-9, 'B': 1e-11, 'C': 1e-4, 'D': 1e-8}\n\nprint(\"\\nChecking the options:\")\nfor key, value in options.items():\n    if value > delta_E1:\n        print(f\"Option {key}) {value:.1e} eV is greater than {delta_E1:.2e} eV.

This is a possible value.\nOption D) 1.0e-08 eV is NOT greater than 6.58e-07 eV.\n\n**2. Conclusion**\n\nThe energy uncertainty for the state with the shorter lifetime (10⁻⁹ s) is approximately 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV. To clearly distinguish this level from another, the energy separation must be greater than this value.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA) 10⁻⁹ eV < 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV\nB) 10⁻¹¹ eV < 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV\nC) 10⁻⁴ eV > 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV\nD) 10⁻⁸ eV < 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nOnly option C (10⁻⁴ eV) provides an energy difference large enough to resolve the two energy levels.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The user's question asks to identify which of the given options for the energy difference between two quantum states would allow them to be clearly resolved. The lifetimes of the states are given as τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ seconds and τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ seconds.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** This principle establishes a fundamental limit on the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle, known as complementary variables, can be known. For energy (E) and time (t), the relationship is:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    Here, ΔE represents the uncertainty in energy, Δt represents the lifetime of the state, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV⋅s).\n    The term ΔE is often referred to as the natural linewidth of the energy level. It represents the intrinsic \"fuzziness\" or spread in the energy of a state with a finite lifetime.\n\n2.  **Condition for Resolution:** For two energy levels, E₁ and E₂, to be considered \"clearly resolved\" or distinguishable, the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their individual energy uncertainties (linewidths). A common and practical criterion is that the energy separation must be greater than the sum of the half-widths of the levels. A simpler, more conservative criterion is that the separation must be larger than the broadest of the two linewidths.\n\n3.  **Calculating the Linewidths (ΔE):** We need to calculate the energy uncertainty for each state using ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt.\n    *   **For state 1:**\n        *   Lifetime Δt₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV⋅s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n    *   **For state 2:**\n        *   Lifetime Δt₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV⋅s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n4.  **Identifying the Limiting Factor:** State 1 has a shorter lifetime, which results in a larger energy uncertainty (ΔE₁ > ΔE₂). This broader linewidth is the dominant factor that limits our ability to distinguish the energy levels. Therefore, to resolve the levels, the energy difference between them must be greater than this larger uncertainty, ΔE₁.\n    *   Condition: |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n5.  **Evaluating the Options:** We now compare the given options to this required condition:\n    *   A) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is much smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Not resolvable.\n    *   B) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is even smaller than option A. Not resolvable.\n    *   **C) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is significantly larger than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV (100,000 x 10⁻⁹ eV vs. ~0.66 x 10⁻⁶ eV). This energy separation is large enough for the levels to be clearly resolved.**\n    *   D) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Not resolvable.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only option that provides an energy difference greater than the largest energy uncertainty of the two states is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n<<<C>>>"
