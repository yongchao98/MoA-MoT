    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Initial State\n*   The particle has spin 1/2 and is initially in a magnetic field `B` pointing in the +Z direction.\n*   The Hamiltonian for this initial situation is `H_i = -μ · B = -γ * S · B = -γ * B * S_z`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `S_z` is the z-component of the spin operator.\n*   The particle is \"aligned\" with the field. This means it's in the lowest energy state. The eigenstates of `H_i` are the eigenstates of `S_z`: spin-up `|+z>` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z>` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n*   The energies are `E_up = -γ * B * (+ħ/2)` and `E_down = -γ * B * (-ħ/2)`. Assuming `γ > 0` (which is true for many particles like the proton, though negative for the electron), the lower energy state is `|+z>`.\n*   So, the state of the particle at time `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n### 2. Understand the New Situation (t > 0)\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction with the same magnitude `B`.\n*   The new Hamiltonian, which governs the time evolution of the system, is `H = -μ · B = -γ * S · (B * ĵ) = -γ * B * S_y`. Here, `S_y` is the y-component of the spin operator.\n\n### 3. Time Evolution of the State\nThe state of the particle evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, with the solution:\n`|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * H * t / ħ) |ψ(0)>`\nSubstituting the Hamiltonian `H = -γ * B * S_y`, we get:\n`|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * (-γ * B * S_y) * t / ħ) |+z>`\n`|ψ(t)> = exp(i * γ * B * t / ħ * S_y) |+z>`\n\nTo proceed, we can use the matrix representation of the spin operators in the S_z basis:\n`S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\nThe initial state is `|+z> = [[1], [0]]`.\n\nSubstituting `S_y` into the exponential:\n`|ψ(t)> = exp(i * γ * B * t / ħ * (ħ/2) * σ_y) |+z>`\n`|ψ(t)> = exp(i * (γ * B * t / 2) * σ_y) |+z>`\n\nWe use the property of Pauli matrices: `exp(i * a * σ_k) = cos(a) * I + i * sin(a) * σ_k`, where `I` is the identity matrix. Here, `a = γ * B * t / 2` and `k=y`.\nThe time evolution operator `U(t) = exp(i * (γ*B*t/2) * σ_y)` becomes:\n`U(t) = cos(γ*B*t/2) * [[1, 0], [0, 1]] + i * sin(γ*B*t/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n`U(t) = [[cos(γ*B*t/2), 0], [0, cos(γ*B*t/2)]] + [[0, sin(γ*B*t/2)], [-sin(γ*B*t/2), 0]]`\n`U(t) = [[cos(γ*B*t/2), sin(γ*B*t/2)], [-sin(γ*B*t/2), cos(γ*B*t/2)]]`\n\nNow, we find the state at time `t` by applying this operator to the initial state `|+z>`:\n`|ψ(t)> = U(t) |+z> = [[cos(γ*B*t/2), sin(γ*B*t/2)], [-sin(γ*B*t/2), cos(γ*B*t/2)]] * [[1], [0]]`\n`|ψ(t)> = [[cos(γ*B*t/2)], [-sin(γ*B*t/2)]]`\n\nIn Dirac notation, this is:\n`|ψ(t)> = cos(γ*B*t/2) * |+z> - sin(γ*B*t/2) * |-z>`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Expectation Value\nWe need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z(t)>`. Since `μ_z = γ * S_z`, we calculate `<S_z(t)>`.\n`<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`\n\nFirst, apply the `S_z` operator to `|ψ(t)>`:\n`S_z |ψ(t)> = S_z * [cos(γ*B*t/2) * |+z> - sin(γ*B*t/2) * |-z>]`\n`S_z |ψ(t)> = cos(γ*B*t/2) * S_z|(+z)> - sin(γ*B*t/2) * S_z|(-z)>`\n`S_z |ψ(t)> = cos(γ*B*t/2) * (ħ/2)|+z> - sin(γ*B*t/2) * (-ħ/2)|-z>`\n`S_z |ψ(t)> = (ħ/2) * [cos(γ*B*t/2)|+z> + sin(γ*B*t/2)|-z>]`\n\nNow, take the inner product with `<ψ(t)|`:\n`<ψ(t)| = cos(γ*B*t/2) * <+z| - sin(γ*B*t/2) * <-z|`\n`<S_z(t)> = (cos(γ*B*t/2)<+z| - sin(γ*B*t/2)<-z|) * (ħ/2)[cos(γ*B*t/2)|+z> + sin(γ*B*t/2)|-z>]`\n\nUsing the orthogonality of the basis states (`<+z|+z>=1`, `<+z|-z>=0`, etc.), we get:\n`<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * [cos²(γ*B*t/2) - sin²(γ*B*t/2)]`\n\nUsing the double-angle trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`:\n`<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos(2 * γ*B*t/2)`\n`<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos(γ*B*t)`\n\n### 5. Determine the Oscillation Frequency\nThe average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n`<μ_z(t)> = γ * <S_z(t)> = γ * (ħ/2) * cos(γ*B*t)`\n\nThis expression describes an oscillation. An oscillation of the form `A * cos(ωt + φ)` has an angular frequency `ω`.\nBy comparing `γ*(ħ/2)*cos(γ*B*t)` with the general form, we can identify the angular frequency `ω` as the coefficient of `t` inside the cosine function.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency is `ω = γ * B`.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as Larmor precession. The spin vector, initially pointing along the z-axis, precesses around the new magnetic field direction (the y-axis) at the Larmor frequency `ω = γB`. Its projection on the z-axis oscillates as `cos(ωt)`.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nB) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nC) gamma*B\nD) gamma*B/2\n\nThe calculated frequency `γB` matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
