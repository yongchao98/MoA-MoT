    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2 from the given spectral data.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) to understand the number of rings and/or double/triple bonds in the molecule.\nThe formula for DBE is: `DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`\nDBE = 9 + 1 - (11 / 2) + (1 / 2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\nA DBE of 5 typically suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBE: 1 ring + 3 double bonds) and one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** This pair of medium-to-strong bands is highly characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2). The presence of two distinct peaks rules out a secondary amine (-NHR) or a secondary amide (-NHCOR).\n*   **1720 cm-1:** This strong band is in the carbonyl region. The frequency is typical for an ester (R-COO-R'). It is a bit high for a typical amide (~1680 cm-1) and fits well for a conjugated ester.\n\n**Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH2) and a carbonyl group, likely an ester (-COO-).\n\n**3. Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** The 't' stands for triplet, and '3H' means it corresponds to 3 protons. A triplet integrating to 3H is a classic signal for a methyl group (-CH3) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** The 'q' stands for quartet, and '2H' means it corresponds to 2 protons. A quartet integrating to 2H is a classic signal for a methylene group (-CH2-) that is adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3). This signal, combined with the triplet at 1.20 ppm, confirms the presence of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm indicates that the -CH2- is attached to a highly electronegative atom, almost certainly an oxygen atom, as in an ethyl ester (-O-CH2CH3).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** The 'bs' stands for a broad singlet, integrating to 2 protons. This chemical shift and broadness are characteristic of amine (-NH2) protons. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The 'd' stands for doublet. We have two doublets in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm), each integrating to 2 protons. This specific pattern (two doublets, 2H each) is a definitive indicator of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   The doublet at the higher chemical shift (8.0 ppm) corresponds to the protons *ortho* (adjacent) to an electron-withdrawing group (EWG). An ester group (-COOEt) is an EWG.\n    *   The doublet at the lower chemical shift (7.0 ppm) corresponds to the protons *ortho* to an electron-donating group (EDG). An amine group (-NH2) is a strong EDG.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nLet's combine all the pieces:\n*   We have a benzene ring with two substituents in a 1,4 (para) arrangement.\n*   The substituents are a primary amine (-NH2) and an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n*   The placement of these groups must match the NMR shifts: the protons next to the amine are upfield (~7.0 ppm), and the protons next to the ester are downfield (~8.0 ppm). This confirms the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n**5. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This has an ester, but the ethyl group is part of the acyl chain (CH3CH2CO-). The -CH2- protons in this environment would appear around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. So, this is incorrect.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure (also known as Benzocaine) perfectly matches all the spectral data: a 1,4-disubstituted ring, a primary amine (-NH2), and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3). The chemical shifts, splitting patterns, and IR frequencies are all consistent.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the two N-H bands in the IR. It also lacks a primary amine and would show a formyl proton (H-C=O) signal in the NMR, which is absent.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This has a 1,3 (meta) substitution pattern, which would give a more complex NMR signal in the aromatic region, not two clean doublets.\n\nTherefore, the only structure that fits all the data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
