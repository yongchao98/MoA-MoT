    "This problem requires us to calculate the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) from the dissociation of a Ca-EDTA complex solution.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical Equilibrium**\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex ($[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$) from calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) and fully deprotonated EDTA ($Y^{4-}$) is represented by the following equilibrium:\n$Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [CaY]^{2-}$\n\nThe formation constant ($K_f$) for this reaction is given as:\n$K_f = \\frac{[[CaY]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5.0 \\times 10^{10}$\n\nWe are starting with a solution of the complex, so we need to consider its dissociation, which is the reverse reaction:\n$[CaY]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this dissociation reaction is the dissociation constant ($K_d$), which is the inverse of the formation constant:\n$K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5.0 \\times 10^{10}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n**2. Set up an ICE Table**\nWe can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species         | $[CaY]^{2-}$ | $Ca^{2+}$ | $Y^{4-}$   |\n|-----------------|--------------|-----------|------------|\n| **I**nitial (M)   | 0.02         | 0         | 0          |\n| **C**hange (M)    | -x           | +x        | +x         |\n| **E**quilibrium(M)| 0.02 - x     | x         | x          |\n\nThe problem statement \"pH is ideal\" implies we can assume EDTA is fully deprotonated, so the stoichiometry is 1:1:1 as shown.\n\n**3. Solve the Equilibrium Expression**\nNow we substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the dissociation constant expression:\n$K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}{[[CaY]^{2-}]} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{0.02 - x}$\n$2.0 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{x^2}{0.02 - x}$\n\nBecause the formation constant ($K_f$) is very large, the dissociation constant ($K_d$) is very small. This means that very little of the complex will dissociate, so 'x' will be much smaller than the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can therefore make the simplifying approximation:\n$0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n$2.0 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n\nNow, we solve for 'x':\n$x^2 \\approx (2.0 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times (0.02)$\n$x^2 \\approx 4.0 \\times 10^{-13}$\n$x = \\sqrt{4.0 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n$x = \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-14}}$\n$x = (\\sqrt{40}) \\times 10^{-7}$\n$x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is equal to x.\n\n**4. Final Check**\nThe calculated concentration $[Ca^{2+}] = 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\nLet's check our approximation: $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ is indeed very small compared to 0.02, so the approximation was valid.\n\nComparing our result to the given options:\nA) 1.0x10^-2 M\nB) 2.0x10^-2 M\nC) 6.3x10^-7 M\nD) 5.0x10^-3 M\n\nOur calculated value matches option C.\n\nTo confirm with a calculation:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex\nC_initial = 0.02 # M\n\n# Formation constant\nKf = 5.0e10\n\n# The equilibrium is [CaY] <=> Ca + Y\n# The dissociation constant is Kd = 1/Kf\n# Kd = [Ca][Y]/[CaY]\n# Let x = [Ca] = [Y] at equilibrium.\n# Then [CaY] = C_initial - x\n# So, Kd = x^2 / (C_initial - x)\n# Since Kd is very small, we approximate C_initial - x ~= C_initial\n# Kd ~= x^2 / C_initial\n# x^2 ~= Kd * C_initial\n# x = sqrt(Kd * C_initial) = sqrt((1/Kf) * C_initial)\n\nx = math.sqrt((1/Kf) * C_initial)\n\nprint(f\"The concentration of calcium ions is {x:.1e} M.\")\n```\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) in a solution initially containing 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, denoted as $[CaY]^{2-}$.\n\n**1. Reaction and Equilibrium Constant:**\n\nThe formation of the complex is given by the reaction:\n$Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [CaY]^{2-}$\nThe formation constant ($K_f$) for this is given as $K_{f} = K_{Ca-EDTA} = 5.0 \\times 10^{10}$.\n\nSince we start with the complex, we need to consider its dissociation, which is the reverse reaction:\n$[CaY]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\nThe equilibrium constant for this dissociation reaction is the dissociation constant, $K_d$, which is the reciprocal of the formation constant:\n$K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5.0 \\times 10^{10}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\nThe expression for the dissociation constant is:\n$K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}{[[CaY]^{2-}]}$\n\n**2. ICE Table for Equilibrium Concentrations:**\n\nWe can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the concentrations of the species at equilibrium. Let 'x' be the change in concentration due to dissociation.\n\n| Species         | $[CaY]^{2-}$ (M) | $Ca^{2+}$ (M) | $Y^{4-}$ (M) |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|------------|\n| **Initial**     | 0.02            | 0           | 0          |\n| **Change**      | -x              | +x          | +x         |\n| **Equilibrium** | 0.02 - x        | x           | x          |\n\nNote: The problem states an \"ideal pH,\" which we interpret to mean that all the free EDTA is in the fully deprotonated $Y^{4-}$ form, so we don't need to consider conditional formation constants.\n\n**3. Calculation:**\n\nNow, we plug the equilibrium concentrations into the dissociation constant expression:\n$2.0 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{0.02 - x}$\n\nBecause the value of $K_d$ is very small, we can assume that very little of the complex dissociates. This means 'x' will be much smaller than the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can therefore make a simplifying approximation:\n$0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n$2.0 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n\nNow, we solve for x, which represents the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ ions:\n$x^2 \\approx (2.0 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times (0.02)$\n$x^2 \\approx 4.0 \\times 10^{-13}$\n$x = \\sqrt{4.0 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n$x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7} M$\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This value is significantly smaller than 0.02 M, confirming that our initial approximation was valid.\n\n**4. Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the calculated value to the options:\nA) 1.0x10^-2 M\nB) 2.0x10^-2 M\nC) 6.3x10^-7 M\nD) 5.0x10^-3 M\n\nThe calculated concentration matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
