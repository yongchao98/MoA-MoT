    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the functional groups and main structure:**\n    *   The problem states the compound is a **di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring**. This means we start with a benzene ring (`C6H6`) that has two hydrogen atoms replaced by substituents. The core of this part is a `C6H4` unit.\n    *   The **FTIR spectrum** shows an **ester group**. The general formula for an ester is R-COO-R'. This adds a `-COO-` unit to our molecule.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR data to identify the substituents:**\n    *   **\"no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups\"**: This is a very important constraint. It rules out common groups like ethyl (`-CH2CH3`), propyl (`-CH2CH2CH3`), ethoxy (`-OCH2CH3`), etc. Any alkyl parts must be methyl (`-CH3`) or tertiary/quaternary (like isopropyl `-CH(CH3)2` or t-butyl `-C(CH3)3`).\n    *   **Ester Group Identity**: Since we have an ester group (`-COO-`) and no `-CH2-` signals, the ester cannot be an ethyl ester, propyl ester, etc. The simplest possibility that fits is a **methyl ester**, where one of the substituents on the ring is `-COOCH3`. This fragment contains a methyl group that would show up as one `-CH3` signal (a singlet). Another possibility is an acetate ester attached to a phenolic oxygen, e.g., `Ring-O-CO-CH3`. This also contains a `-CH3` group and no `-CH2-` group. Both possibilities have the same atom count for the ester part (`C2H3O2`).\n    *   **Vinyl-H Signals**: The spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets)\".\n        *   Vinyl-H are protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (`C=C`).\n        *   A doublet means a proton is coupled to only one other proton.\n        *   A doublet of quartets (dq) means a proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons: one single proton (giving the doublet splitting) and a group of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet splitting).\n        *   This pattern is characteristic of a **propenyl group**, `-CH=CH-CH3`. Let's label the protons: `Ha-C=C(Hb)-CH3`.\n            *   `Ha` would be coupled to `Hb`, appearing as a doublet.\n            *   `Hb` would be coupled to `Ha` (doublet) and the three protons of the `-CH3` group (quartet), appearing as a doublet of quartets.\n        *   This fragment (`-CH=CH-CH3`) perfectly matches the vinyl-H data. It also contains a `-CH3` group.\n    *   **-CH3 Signals**: The spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups\".\n        *   We have identified two `-CH3` groups from our analysis:\n            1.  One from the ester function (e.g., in `-COOCH3`).\n            2.  One from the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n        *   These two methyl groups are in different chemical environments, so they would indeed give two separate signals. This confirms our fragment assignments.\n    *   **Aromatic-H Signals**: The spectrum shows \"two signals corresponding to aromatic-H\". A di-substituted benzene ring has four aromatic protons. Having only two signals strongly suggests a symmetric substitution pattern, most commonly **para-substitution (1,4-disubstituted)**, which makes the protons at positions 2 and 6 equivalent, and the protons at positions 3 and 5 equivalent, resulting in two signals.\n\n3.  **Assemble the fragments and determine the formula:**\n    Based on the analysis, the molecule is composed of the following fragments:\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring: `C6H4`\n    *   A methyl ester group: `-COOCH3`\n    *   A propenyl group: `-CH=CH-CH3`\n\n    Now, let's sum the atoms from these fragments to find the molecular formula:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 1 (from -COO-) + 1 (from -OCH3) + 3 (from -CH=CH-CH3) = **11 C**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 3 (from -OCH3) + 5 (from -CH=CH-CH3) = **12 H**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from -COO-) = **2 O**\n\n    The chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   Formula for DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)\n    *   DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    *   Our proposed structure (e.g., methyl 4-propenylbenzoate) has:\n        *   1 Benzene ring (4 DoU: 1 ring + 3 double bonds)\n        *   1 Carbonyl double bond (C=O) (1 DoU)\n        *   1 Vinyl double bond (C=C) (1 DoU)\n    *   Total DoU = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6. The formula is consistent with the deduced structure.\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    The calculated formula is C11H12O2, which matches option D.\n\nA) C11H14O2 (DoU = 5. Inconsistent with having both a benzene ring and a C=C bond)\nB) C12H12O2 (DoU = 7. Would require an additional ring or double bond not indicated by NMR)\nC) C12H14O2 (DoU = 6. To have this formula with no CH2 groups is difficult and inconsistent with the propenyl fragment deduced from NMR)\nD) C11H12O2 (DoU = 6. Perfectly consistent with all spectral data)\n\n<<<D>>>"
