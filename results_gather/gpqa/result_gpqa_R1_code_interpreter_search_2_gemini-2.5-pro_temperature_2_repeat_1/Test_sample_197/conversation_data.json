    "This problem requires us to calculate the molar fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species.\n\n**1. Identify the species:**\nThe cobalt-containing species in the solution are:\n- Free `Co^2+`\n- `[Co(SCN)]^+`\n- `[Co(SCN)2]` (the blue complex)\n- `[Co(SCN)3]^-`\n- `[Co(SCN)4]^2-`\n\n**2. Express concentrations in terms of `[Co^2+]`:**\nUsing the overall stability constants (βn), we can express the concentration of each complex as a function of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co^2+]` and the thiocyanate concentration `[SCN^-]`:\n- `[Co(SCN)]^+ = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]`\n- `[Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2`\n- `[Co(SCN)3]^- = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^3`\n- `[Co(SCN)4]^2- = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^4`\n\n**3. Define the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)`:**\nThe total cobalt concentration is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]^+ + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3]^- + [Co(SCN)4]^2-`\n\nSubstituting the expressions from step 2:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][SCN^-] + β2[Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 + β3[Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 + β4[Co^2+][SCN^-]^4`\n\nFactor out `[Co^2+]`:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4)`\n\n**4. Define the fraction of the desired complex (α2):**\nThe fraction of the `[Co(SCN)2]` complex, which we'll call α2, is the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration:\n`α2 = [Co(SCN)2] / c(Co)`\n\nSubstitute the expressions from steps 2 and 3:\n`α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4))`\n\nThe `[Co^2+]` term cancels out, simplifying the equation:\n`α2 = (β2 * [SCN^-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4)`\n\n**5. Calculate the value of α2:**\nNow, we can plug in the given values to solve for α2:\n- `[SCN^-] = 0.1` M\n- `β1 = 9`\n- `β2 = 40`\n- `β3 = 63`\n- `β4 = 16`\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the denominator (let's call it D):\n`D = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1^2) + (63 * 0.1^3) + (16 * 0.1^4)`\n`D = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001)`\n`D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016`\n`D = 2.3646`\n\nNext, calculate the value of the numerator (let's call it N):\n`N = β2 * [SCN^-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\nFinally, calculate α2 and the percentage:\n`α2 = N / D = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\nPercentage = `α2 * 100 ≈ 16.916%`\n\nTo verify the calculation:\n```python\nSCN_conc = 0.1\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n\nnumerator = beta2 * SCN_conc**2\ndenominator = 1 + beta1*SCN_conc + beta2*SCN_conc**2 + beta3*SCN_conc**3 + beta4*SCN_conc**4\n\nfraction = numerator / denominator\npercentage = fraction * 100\n\nprint(f\"{percentage=}\")\n```\n```output\npercentage=16.916180326482276\n```\nThe calculated percentage is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The molar fraction of a specific complex, `[Co(SCN)n]^(2-n)`, in a solution containing `Co^2+` and `SCN^-` can be calculated using the formula for the distribution coefficient, αn. The distribution coefficient represents the ratio of the concentration of the specific complex to the total concentration of all metal-containing species.\n\nThe species present in the solution are `Co^2+`, `[Co(SCN)]^+`, `[Co(SCN)2]`, `[Co(SCN)3]^-`, and `[Co(SCN)4]^2-`.\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is given by:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]^+ + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3]^- + [Co(SCN)4]^2-`\n\nUsing the overall stability constants (β), we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion `[Co^2+]` and the ligand `[SCN^-]` concentrations:\n- `[Co^2+]`\n- `[Co(SCN)]^+ = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]`\n- `[Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2`\n- `[Co(SCN)3]^- = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^3`\n- `[Co(SCN)4]^2- = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^4`\n\nThe fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `α2`, is given by:\n`α2 = [Co(SCN)2] / c(Co)`\n\nSubstituting the expressions for the concentrations, the `[Co^2+]` term cancels out, leading to the general formula:\n`αn = (βn * [SCN^-]^n) / (1 + Σ(βi * [SCN^-]^i))` where i goes from 1 to 4.\n\nFor our specific case (n=2, the dithiocyanato complex), the formula is:\n`α2 = (β2 * [SCN^-]^2) / (1 + β1*[SCN^-]^1 + β2*[SCN^-]^2 + β3*[SCN^-]^3 + β4*[SCN^-]^4)`\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- `[SCN^-] = 0.1` M\n- `β1 = 9`\n- `β2 = 40`\n- `β3 = 63`\n- `β4 = 16`\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nNumerator:\n`β2 * [SCN^-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\nDenominator:\n`1 + β1*[SCN^-] + β2*[SCN^-]^2 + β3*[SCN^-]^3 + β4*[SCN^-]^4`\n`= 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1^2) + (63 * 0.1^3) + (16 * 0.1^4)`\n`= 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001)`\n`= 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016`\n`= 2.3646`\n\nNow, calculate `α2`:\n`α2 = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo get the percentage, multiply by 100:\nPercentage = `0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThis matches the result from the code execution.\n\n<<<C>>>"
