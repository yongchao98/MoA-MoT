    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This is a substituted cyclohexanone, which acts as a nucleophile precursor (a Michael donor).\n    *   **Reagent:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester, a classic Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   The reaction is a **Michael addition**.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Enolate):**\n    *   The base (t-BuOK) removes an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form an enolate.\n    *   Let's analyze the α-carbons of the ketone (carbons adjacent to the C=O group at C1):\n        *   **C2:** This carbon is quaternary, bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It has **no** α-protons.\n        *   **C6:** This carbon is tertiary, bonded to a methyl group and a hydrogen atom. It has **one** α-proton.\n    *   Since only C6 has a proton, the deprotonation must occur at this position. The base t-BuOK removes the proton from C6, forming an enolate ion. The choice of base (bulky or not) is irrelevant for regioselectivity here, as there is only one possible site for deprotonation.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic enolate (with the negative charge primarily on C6) attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   Nucleophile (enolate from ketone) attacks Electrophile (ethyl acrylate): The C6 of the cyclohexanone ring forms a new covalent bond with the β-carbon (the CH₂) of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n4.  **Protonation and Final Product Structure:**\n    *   An intermediate enolate is formed from the ethyl acrylate part, which is then protonated (usually by the conjugate acid of the base, t-BuOH, or during aqueous workup) to give the final stable product.\n    *   The new substituent attached to C6 of the cyclohexanone ring is `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` (an ethoxycarbonylethyl group).\n    *   The final product molecule has the following structure: A cyclohexanone ring with the C=O at the original C1 position, an ethyl and a methyl group at C2, and a methyl group plus the new `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group at C6.\n\n5.  **Naming Product A:**\n    *   The options name the product as a derivative of ethyl propanoate. This requires numbering the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent. According to IUPAC rules for naming complex substituents, the point of attachment to the parent chain is given the locant C1.\n    *   Let's re-number our product's ring system for naming purposes:\n        *   The attachment point (original C6) becomes **C1**. This carbon has a methyl group.\n        *   The adjacent keto-carbon (original C1) becomes **C2**. This is the `oxo` group.\n        *   The adjacent quaternary carbon (original C2) becomes **C3**. This carbon has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   The substituent name is therefore **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The full name of the product is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This matches the name for Product A in options C and D.\n\n---\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). Nitroalkanes are acidic at the α-carbon. This is the Michael donor precursor.\n    *   **Reagent:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, a Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH). A strong base.\n    *   The reaction is a **Michael addition**.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile (Nitronate anion):**\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates the acidic α-carbon (C1) of 1-nitropropane.\n    *   `CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂ + OH⁻ → CH₃CH₂CH⁻-NO₂ (nitronate anion) + H₂O`\n    *   This carbanion is stabilized by the electron-withdrawing nitro group.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbanion from 1-nitropropane attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The electrophile is `CH₃(γ)-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`. The attack occurs at the β-carbon.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between C1 of 1-nitropropane and C3 of the original butene chain (the β-carbon).\n\n4.  **Protonation and Final Product Structure:**\n    *   The resulting intermediate carbanion (alpha to the nitrile group) is protonated by water to give the final product.\n    *   The final product structure is: `CH₃-CH(CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n\n5.  **Naming Product B:**\n    *   To name this molecule, we find the longest carbon chain that includes the principal functional group (the nitrile, -CN).\n    *   The nitrile carbon is defined as **C1**.\n    *   The longest chain is: `NC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(4)(NO₂)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`.\n    *   The chain has 6 carbons, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are:\n        *   A methyl group at **C3**.\n        *   A nitro group at **C4**.\n    *   The full name of the product is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This matches the name for Product B in options B and C.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   The correct name for **Product A** is `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`. This eliminates options A and B.\n*   The correct name for **Product B** is `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`. This eliminates options A and D.\n\nCombining these two conclusions, the only option that correctly identifies both products is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
