    "This problem requires us to calculate and compare the transit probabilities of two exoplanets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The transit probability ($P_{transit}$) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by the ratio of the host star's radius ($R_s$) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis ($a$).\n\n$P_{transit} = \\frac{R_s}{a}$\n\nTo find the semi-major axis ($a$), we can use Kepler's Third Law. The simplified form, assuming the planet's mass ($M_p$) is much smaller than the star's mass ($M_s$), is:\n\n$P^2 \\propto \\frac{a^3}{M_s}$\n\nWhere $P$ is the orbital period. We can rearrange this to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n\n$a^3 \\propto M_s \\cdot P^2$\n$a \\propto (M_s \\cdot P^2)^{1/3}$\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for $a$ back into the transit probability formula:\n\n$P_{transit} \\propto \\frac{R_s}{(M_s \\cdot P^2)^{1/3}}$\n$P_{transit} \\propto R_s \\cdot M_s^{-1/3} \\cdot P^{-2/3}$\n\nWe are given the following relationships between the two systems:\n*   The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: $P_1 = P_2 / 3$, or $\\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   The host star of Planet_1 is twice as massive as the host star of Planet_2: $M_{s1} = 2 \\cdot M_{s2}$, or $\\frac{M_{s1}}{M_{s2}} = 2$.\n*   Both host stars have the same radius: $R_{s1} = R_{s2}$, or $\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}} = 1$.\n\nNow, let's find the ratio of the transit probability of Planet_1 to that of Planet_2 ($\\frac{P_{transit,1}}{P_{transit,2}}$):\n\n$\\frac{P_{transit,1}}{P_{transit,2}} = \\frac{R_{s1} \\cdot M_{s1}^{-1/3} \\cdot P_1^{-2/3}}{R_{s2} \\cdot M_{s2}^{-1/3} \\cdot P_2^{-2/3}}$\n\nWe can group the terms:\n\n$\\frac{P_{transit,1}}{P_{transit,2}} = \\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{M_{s1}}{M_{s2}}\\right)^{-1/3} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{-2/3}$\n\nNow, we substitute the given ratios:\n\n$\\frac{P_{transit,1}}{P_{transit,2}} = (1) \\cdot (2)^{-1/3} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{-2/3}$\n\nLet's simplify the expression:\n\n$\\frac{P_{transit,1}}{P_{transit,2}} = 2^{-1/3} \\cdot (3^{-1})^{-2/3}$\n$\\frac{P_{transit,1}}{P_{transit,2}} = 2^{-1/3} \\cdot 3^{2/3}$\n$\\frac{P_{transit,1}}{P_{transit,2}} = \\frac{3^{2/3}}{2^{1/3}}$\n$\\frac{P_{transit,1}}{P_{transit,2}} = \\frac{(3^2)^{1/3}}{2^{1/3}}$\n$\\frac{P_{transit,1}}{P_{transit,2}} = \\frac{9^{1/3}}{2^{1/3}}$\n$\\frac{P_{transit,1}}{P_{transit,2}} = \\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right)^{1/3}$\n$\\frac{P_{transit,1}}{P_{transit,2}} = (4.5)^{1/3}$\n\nTo find the numerical value, we can compute the cube root of 4.5.\n```python\nimport math\nratio = 4.5**(1/3)\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n1.650963595133465\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation shows that the probability of Planet_1 transiting is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2.

    "The problem asks us to determine which of two exoplanets, Planet_1 or Planet_2, has a higher probability of transiting its host star, and by what factor.\n\n1.  **Understand the concept of transit probability.**\n    The geometric probability of a planet transiting its star (i.e., passing in front of the star from our line of sight) depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. For a planet on a circular orbit, the probability ($P_{transit}$) is given by:\n    $P_{transit} = \\frac{R_s}{a}$\n    where $R_s$ is the radius of the host star and $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n2.  **Relate the semi-major axis to the given parameters.**\n    We are not given the semi-major axis directly, but we are given the orbital period ($P$) and the mass of the host star ($M_s$). Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion relates these quantities. The law states:\n    $P^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G(M_s + M_p)} a^3$\n    where $G$ is the gravitational constant and $M_p$ is the planet's mass. Since the planet's mass is typically negligible compared to the star's mass ($M_p \\ll M_s$), we can simplify this to:\n    $P^2 \\propto \\frac{a^3}{M_s}$\n    We can rearrange this to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n    $a^3 \\propto M_s \\cdot P^2$\n    $a \\propto (M_s \\cdot P^2)^{1/3}$\n\n3.  **Derive a proportional relationship for transit probability.**\n    Now, substitute the expression for $a$ into the transit probability formula:\n    $P_{transit} \\propto \\frac{R_s}{(M_s \\cdot P^2)^{1/3}}$\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    $P_{transit} \\propto R_s \\cdot M_s^{-1/3} \\cdot P^{-2/3}$\n\n4.  **Set up the ratio of probabilities for the two planets.**\n    We want to compare the transit probability of Planet_1 ($P_{transit,1}$) to that of Planet_2 ($P_{transit,2}$). We can do this by taking their ratio:\n    $\\frac{P_{transit,1}}{P_{transit,2}} = \\frac{R_{s1} \\cdot M_{s1}^{-1/3} \\cdot P_1^{-2/3}}{R_{s2} \\cdot M_{s2}^{-1/3} \\cdot P_2^{-2/3}}$\n    We can group the terms for the two systems:\n    $\\frac{P_{transit,1}}{P_{transit,2}} = \\left(\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{M_{s1}}{M_{s2}}\\right)^{-1/3} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right)^{-2/3}$\n\n5.  **Plug in the given values from the problem description.**\n    *   The host stars have the same radii: $R_{s1} = R_{s2}$, so $\\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}} = 1$.\n    *   The star hosting Planet_1 is twice as massive as the host of Planet_2: $M_{s1} = 2 \\cdot M_{s2}$, so $\\frac{M_{s1}}{M_{s2}} = 2$.\n    *   The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: $P_1 = P_2 / 3$, so $\\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the ratio.**\n    Substitute these values into the ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{P_{transit,1}}{P_{transit,2}} = (1) \\cdot (2)^{-1/3} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{-2/3}$\n    Simplify the expression:\n    $\\frac{P_{transit,1}}{P_{transit,2}} = 2^{-1/3} \\cdot (3^{-1})^{-2/3}$\n    $\\frac{P_{transit,1}}{P_{transit,2}} = 2^{-1/3} \\cdot 3^{(-1) \\cdot (-2/3)}$\n    $\\frac{P_{transit,1}}{P_{transit,2}} = 2^{-1/3} \\cdot 3^{2/3}$\n    This can be written using roots:\n    $\\frac{P_{transit,1}}{P_{transit,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt[3]{3^2}}{\\sqrt[3]{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt[3]{9}}{\\sqrt[3]{2}} = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{9}{2}} = \\sqrt[3]{4.5}$\n\n7.  **Compute the numerical value.**\n    We need to calculate the cube root of 4.5.\n    $(4.5)^{1/3} \\approx 1.65096$\n\n    This result means that the probability of Planet_1 transiting is approximately 1.65 times higher than the probability of Planet_2 transiting. Therefore, Planet_1 is the preferred target for observation.\n\n8.  **Compare with the given options.**\n    *   A) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit. (Incorrect)\n    *   B) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit. (Incorrect)\n    *   C) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit. (Incorrect)\n    *   D) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit. (Correct)\n\nThe calculation shows that Planet_1 has a ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.\n\n<<<D>>>"
