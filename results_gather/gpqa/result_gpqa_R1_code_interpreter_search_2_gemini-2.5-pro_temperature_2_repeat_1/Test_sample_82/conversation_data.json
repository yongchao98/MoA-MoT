    "This problem requires calculating the pH at two different points during a titration of a weak acid (acetic acid) with a strong base (NaOH).\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial state after dilution.**\nFirst, we need to determine the concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.\n*   Initial volume of acetic acid, V1 = 20.00 cm3 = 20.00 mL\n*   Initial concentration of acetic acid, C1 = 0.05 M\n*   Final volume after adding 20.00 cm3 of water, V2 = 20.00 cm3 + 20.00 cm3 = 40.00 cm3 = 40.00 mL\nWe can use the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2 to find the new concentration (C2).\nC2 = (C1 * V1) / V2\nC2 = (0.05 M * 20.00 mL) / 40.00 mL\nC2 = 1.0 / 40.00 M = 0.025 M\nSo, we are titrating a 40.00 mL solution of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\nAt any point during the titration of a weak acid with a strong base before the equivalence point, the solution is a buffer containing the weak acid (CH3COOH) and its conjugate base (CH3COO-). The pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\npH = pKa + log([CH3COO-]/[CH3COOH])\n\n*   First, we calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10^-5) ≈ 4.73\n\n*   \"25% titration\" means that 25% of the original acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH3COO-). This leaves 75% of the acetic acid unreacted.\n*   Therefore, the ratio of the conjugate base to the acid, [CH3COO-]/[CH3COOH], is 25/75 = 1/3.\n\n*   Now, we plug these values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.73 - log(3)\n    pH ≈ 4.73 - 0.477\n    pH ≈ 4.253\n\nSo, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted with the NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH3COONa). The solution contains only the acetate ion (CH3COO-), which is the conjugate base of a weak acid and will hydrolyze water to produce OH- ions, making the solution basic.\nCH3COO- (aq) + H2O (l) ⇌ CH3COOH (aq) + OH- (aq)\n\n*   First, we need to find the volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point. At this point, moles of acid = moles of base.\n    Moles of acid = C_acid * V_acid = 0.025 mol/L * 0.040 L = 0.001 mol\n    Volume of NaOH = Moles of acid / C_base = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 mL\n\n*   Next, calculate the total volume of the solution at the equivalence point:\n    Total volume = V_acid_diluted + V_NaOH = 40.00 mL + 10.00 mL = 50.00 mL = 0.050 L\n\n*   Now, calculate the concentration of the acetate ion ([CH3COO-]) at the equivalence point. The moles of acetate formed are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid.\n    [CH3COO-] = Moles of acetate / Total volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n\n*   We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for the acetate ion, which can be found using the relationship Kw = Ka * Kb, where Kw = 1.0 x 10^-14 at 25°C.\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10^-14) / (1.85 x 10^-5) ≈ 5.405 x 10^-10\n\n*   Now we can find the concentration of OH- from the hydrolysis reaction. We set up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis:\n    Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-] / [CH3COO-]\n    Let [OH-] = x. Then [CH3COOH] = x, and [CH3COO-] = 0.02 - x.\n    5.405 x 10^-10 = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n    Since Kb is very small, we can assume x is negligible compared to 0.02, so (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    5.405 x 10^-10 ≈ x^2 / 0.02\n    x^2 ≈ (5.405 x 10^-10) * 0.02 = 1.081 x 10^-11\n    x = [OH-] ≈ √(1.081 x 10^-11) ≈ 3.288 x 10^-6 M\n\n*   Finally, we calculate pOH and then pH:\n    pOH = -log([OH-]) = -log(3.288 x 10^-6) ≈ 5.483\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n\nSo, the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52.\n\n**Summary of Results:**\n*   pH at 25% titration ≈ 4.26\n*   pH at equivalence point ≈ 8.52\n\nComparing these results with the given options, they match option B.\n\nTo verify the calculations, let's run a Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given Data ---\ninitial_vol_acid = 20.00 / 1000 # L\ninitial_conc_acid = 0.05 # M\nvol_water = 20.00 / 1000 # L\nconc_naoh = 0.1 # M\nKa_acid = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# --- Step 1: Dilution ---\n# Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution\nfinal_vol_acid = initial_vol_acid + vol_water\nconc_acid_diluted = (initial_conc_acid * initial_vol_acid) / final_vol_acid\n\n# --- Step 2: pH at 25% Titration ---\npKa = -math.log10(Ka_acid)\n# Using Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n# At 25% titration, ratio [A-]/[HA] = 25/75 = 1/3\nratio = 1/3\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(ratio)\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\n\n# --- Step 3: pH at Equivalence Point ---\n# Calculate moles of acid initially present\nmoles_acid_initial = conc_acid_diluted * final_vol_acid\n\n# Calculate volume of NaOH and total volume at equivalence point\nvol_naoh_eq = moles_acid_initial / conc_naoh\ntotal_volume_eq = final_vol_acid + vol_naoh_eq\n\n# Calculate concentration of acetate at equivalence point\nmoles_acetate = moles_acid_initial\nconc_acetate = moles_acetate / total_volume_eq\n\n# Calculate Kb for acetate\nKb_acetate = Kw / Ka_acid\n\n# Calculate [OH-] from hydrolysis, assuming x = [OH-] is small\n# Kb = x^2 / C_acetate\nconc_OH = math.sqrt(Kb_acetate * conc_acetate)\n\n# Calculate pOH and then pH\npOH_eq = -math.log10(conc_OH)\npH_eq = 14.00 - pOH_eq\n\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_eq:.2f}\")\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculations:\n\n**1. Calculate the Concentration of Acetic Acid After Dilution**\nFirst, we need to find the new concentration of acetic acid after it's diluted with water. We can use the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂.\n\n*   Initial Concentration (M₁): 0.05 M\n*   Initial Volume (V₁): 20.00 cm³ (or 20.00 mL)\n*   Final Volume (V₂): 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³ (or 40.00 mL)\n*   Final Concentration (M₂): M₂ = (M₁V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n\nSo, the titration starts with a 40.00 cm³ solution of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n**2. Calculate the pH at 25% Titration**\nAt any point before the equivalence point, the solution is a buffer containing the weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻). We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\npH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid])\n\n*   **Calculate pKa:**\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   **Determine the ratio:**\n    \"25% titration\" means that 25% of the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base (acetate), and 75% remains as unreacted acetic acid.\n    Ratio = [CH₃COO⁻] / [CH₃COOH] = 25 / 75 = 1/3\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.73 - log(3)\n    pH = 4.73 - 0.477\n    pH ≈ 4.253, which rounds to **4.26**.\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at the Equivalence Point**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻), a weak base.\n\nCH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n\n*   **Find the moles of acid:**\n    Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.0400 L = 0.001 mol\n*   **Find the volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence:**\n    At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH = moles of acid = 0.001 mol.\n    Volume = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   **Find the total volume and concentration of acetate at equivalence:**\n    Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n    Concentration of acetate [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n*   **Find Kb for the acetate ion:**\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n*   **Calculate [OH⁻] from hydrolysis:**\n    Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]. Let x = [OH⁻].\n    5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.02\n    x² ≈ 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\nThe calculated pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52.\n\n<<<B>>>"
