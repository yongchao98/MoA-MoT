    "This problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the stereochemical outcomes of two reaction sequences and then applying the principles of achiral and chiral chromatography.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1\n\n*   **Starting material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene, which is achiral.\n    `CH3CH2CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH2CH3` (propyl groups are *trans*).\n*   **Reagent 1: mCPBA.** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction, which is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond. A standard rule of stereochemistry is that the *syn*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   (E)-oct-4-ene is converted into a racemic mixture of *trans*-4,5-epoxyoctane. These enantiomers are (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n*   **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This causes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The mechanism is an Sₙ2-like backside attack by a water molecule, which is an *anti*-addition. We need to consider the result of this *anti*-addition on both enantiomers of the epoxide formed in the first step.\n    *   **Starting with (4R,5R)-epoxide:**\n        *   Water attacks C4: The configuration at C4 inverts from R to S. The resulting diol is (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Water attacks C5: The configuration at C5 inverts from R to S. The resulting diol is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   (4S,5R)- and (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol are descriptors for the *same* meso compound. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to internal symmetry (e.g., a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry).\n    *   **Starting with (4S,5S)-epoxide:**\n        *   Water attacks C4 (S→R): The product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (the meso compound).\n        *   Water attacks C5 (S→R): The product is (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (the meso compound).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** Both enantiomers of the intermediate epoxide yield the same single, achiral product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2\n\n*   **Starting material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene, which is achiral.\n    `CH3CH2CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH2CH3` (propyl groups are *cis*).\n*   **Reagent 1: mCPBA.** The *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom to a *cis*-alkene results in a *meso* compound.\n    *   (Z)-oct-4-ene is converted into meso-*cis*-4,5-epoxyoctane (i.e., (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane). This is a single, achiral product.\n*   **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This performs an *anti*-addition (ring-opening) on the meso-epoxide.\n    *   **Starting with meso-(4R,5S)-epoxide:**\n        *   Water attacks C4 (R-center): Inversion of configuration gives an S-center at C4. The C5 center is unaffected (S). The product is **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        *   Water attacks C5 (S-center): Inversion of configuration gives an R-center at C5. The C4 center is unaffected (R). The product is **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The reaction produces two products, (4S,5S)-diol and (4R,5R)-diol. These molecules are non-superimposable mirror images, meaning they are a pair of enantiomers. Since they are formed in equal amounts from an achiral starting material, the product is a **racemic mixture of octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe meso-diol is a diastereomer of the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are enantiomers of each other.\n\n### Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and thus different retention times. The meso-diol will be separated from the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They cannot be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **two peaks**: one for the meso-diol and one for the co-eluting pair of enantiomers.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment. It can separate enantiomers.\n    *   The chiral stationary phase interacts differently with each of the three stereoisomers.\n    *   The meso-diol (achiral) will produce one peak.\n    *   The (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are enantiomers and will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, resulting in different retention times. They will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **three peaks**: one for the meso-diol, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis yields:\n*   Standard HPLC: 2 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
