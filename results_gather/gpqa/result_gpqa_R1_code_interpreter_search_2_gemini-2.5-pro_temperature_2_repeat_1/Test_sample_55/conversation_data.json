    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning to solve this problem.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Process\n\nThe problem asks about the decay of a hydrogen atom from the `|3,0,0>` state (also known as the 3s state) to the `|1,0,0>` state (the 1s or ground state) through a sequence of two electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means the atom will first decay to an intermediate state, and then from that intermediate state, it will decay to the final ground state. We need to identify a valid intermediate state and calculate the probability of this entire decay path.\n\n### 2. Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\n\nElectric dipole transitions are governed by a set of selection rules, which dictate which transitions are \"allowed\":\n*   **Principal Quantum Number (n):** The change `Δn = n_final - n_initial` can be any integer. For decay (spontaneous emission), `n_final < n_initial`.\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum Quantum Number (l):** The change must be `Δl = l_final - l_initial = ±1`.\n*   **Magnetic Quantum Number (m):** The change must be `Δm = m_final - m_initial = 0` or `±1`.\n\n### 3. Step 1: Transition from |3,0,0> to an Intermediate State\n\n*   **Initial State:** `|n=3, l=0, m=0>`\n*   We apply the selection rules to find the possible intermediate state `|n', l', m'>`:\n    *   **Δl = ±1:** Since the initial state has `l=0`, the intermediate state must have `l'=1`.\n    *   **Δn < 0:** `n'` must be less than 3. For an `l'=1` state (a p-orbital), the lowest possible principal quantum number is `n=2`. So, the intermediate state must have `n'=2`. Any `n'=1` state has `l=0`, so a transition `|3,0,0> -> |1,1,m'>` is forbidden.\n    *   **Δm = 0, ±1:** Since the initial state has `m=0`, the intermediate state can have `m' = 0+0 = 0`, or `m' = 0+1 = 1`, or `m' = 0-1 = -1`.\n\n*   Therefore, the allowed intermediate states are `|2,1,0>`, `|2,1,1>`, and `|2,1,-1>`. These three states form the 2p subshell.\n\n### 4. Step 2: Transition from Intermediate State to |1,0,0>\n\n*   **Final State:** `|n=1, l=0, m=0>`\n*   Let's check if the transition from our identified intermediate states to the final state is allowed:\n    *   **From |2,1,m'> to |1,0,0>:**\n        *   `Δn = 1 - 2 = -1` (Allowed)\n        *   `Δl = 0 - 1 = -1` (Allowed)\n        *   `Δm = 0 - m'`. For `m'=-1, 0, 1`, the possible values for `Δm` are `+1, 0, -1`. All of these are allowed by the selection rules.\n*   So, all three cascade routes are possible:\n    1.  `|3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>`\n    2.  `|3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>`\n    3.  `|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>`\n\n### 5. Calculating the Probability (Branching Ratio)\n\nThe \"probability\" in this context refers to the branching ratio: what fraction of the total decays follow a specific path?\n\n*   **Probability of Step 1:** The initial state `|3,0,0>` is spherically symmetric (it's an s-state with `l=0`). In the absence of any external fields that could break this symmetry, the atom has no preferred direction. Therefore, the decay to the three degenerate `|2,1,m'>` states must be equally probable.\n    *   This can be proven more rigorously using the Wigner-Eckart theorem. The transition rate is proportional to the square of the transition matrix element. For a transition from a state with total angular momentum J=0 (here, l=0), the rates to all sublevels `M_J` of a final J' state are equal.\n    *   So, the probabilities for the first step are:\n        *   `P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) = 1/3`\n        *   `P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>) = 1/3`\n        *   `P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>) = 1/3`\n\n*   **Probability of Step 2:** Now consider the atom in an intermediate state, for example, `|2,1,0>`. What can it decay to?\n    *   From `l=1`, it can decay to `l'=0` or `l'=2`.\n    *   `n'` must be less than 2.\n    *   Decay to an `l'=2` state is impossible, as the minimum `n` for `l=2` is `n=3`, but we need `n'<2`.\n    *   So, it must decay to an `l'=0` state. The only `l'=0` state with `n'<2` is the `n'=1` state, `|1,0,0>`.\n    *   Therefore, any atom that reaches the 2p subshell (`|2,1,m'>`) is guaranteed to decay to the 1s state (`|1,0,0>`). The probability of this second step is 1.\n\n*   **Total Probability of the Route:** The total probability for a specific route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n    *   For the route `|3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>`, the probability is `P(step 1) * P(step 2) = (1/3) * 1 = 1/3`.\n\n### 6. Conclusion\n\nWe analyze the given options:\n\n*   A) `|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩` and `2/3`. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   B) `|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩` and `1/4`. The route is valid, but the probability should be `1/3`, not `1/4`.\n*   C) `|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩` and `1/4`. The route is valid, but the probability should be `1/3`, not `1/4`.\n*   D) `|3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩` and `1/3`. Both the transition route and its corresponding probability are correct.\n\nThus, option D correctly identifies a possible decay path and its associated probability.\n\n<<<D>>>"
