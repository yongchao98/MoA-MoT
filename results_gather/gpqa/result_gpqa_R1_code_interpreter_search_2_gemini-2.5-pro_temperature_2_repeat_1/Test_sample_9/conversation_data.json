    "This question requires understanding the relationship between a planet's mass, composition, and density.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning process for each option:\n\n1.  **Analyze Option (a): An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.**\n    This serves as our reference point. Earth has a known average density of approximately 5.51 g/cm³. Let's denote this as ρ_E.\n\n2.  **Analyze Option (b): A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³.**\n    The density is explicitly given as ~5.5 g/cm³. This is very close to Earth's density. So, ρ_b ≈ ρ_E.\n\n3.  **Analyze Option (c): A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.**\n    This is the crucial part of the problem. For planets with the same composition, the density is not constant with mass. A more massive planet has a stronger gravitational pull, which compresses its material more tightly. This effect, known as gravitational compression or self-compression, causes the planet's overall density to increase. Therefore, a planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times its mass will be significantly denser than Earth. Thus, ρ_c > ρ_E.\n\n4.  **Analyze Option (d): A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.**\n    This is the opposite of case (c). With less mass, the gravitational compression is weaker. The material is less compressed than in Earth. Consequently, its average density will be lower than Earth's density. Thus, ρ_d < ρ_E.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy comparing the densities:\n*   ρ_a ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n*   ρ_b ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n*   ρ_c > 5.51 g/cm³\n*   ρ_d < 5.51 g/cm³\n\nThe planet in option (c) is the only one guaranteed to have a density significantly higher than Earth's. Therefore, it has the highest density among the given choices.\n\nTo illustrate with a more quantitative estimate, planetary models show that the radius (R) of a rocky planet scales with its mass (M) approximately as R ∝ M^0.27.\n\n*   **For planet (c):** Mass (M_c) = 5 M_E.\n    *   Radius (R_c) ≈ R_E * (5)^0.27 ≈ 1.56 R_E.\n    *   Volume (V_c) ∝ R_c³ ≈ (1.56)³ V_E ≈ 3.8 V_E.\n    *   Density (ρ_c) = M_c / V_c ≈ (5 M_E) / (3.8 V_E) ≈ 1.32 * (M_E / V_E) ≈ 1.32 * ρ_E.\n    *   This gives a density of approximately 1.32 * 5.51 g/cm³ ≈ 7.3 g/cm³.\n\nThis calculation confirms that the 5-Earth-mass planet is considerably denser than the others.\n\n<<<A>>>"
