    "This is a problem of special relativity, specifically involving time dilation.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify Reference Frames:**\n    *   Let the Galaxy be the stationary reference frame, S.\n    *   Let the supernova ejecta be the moving reference frame, S'.\n\n2.  **Identify Given Values:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time interval measured in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame) is `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the \"proper time\" because it's measured in the frame where the clock (in this case, the process happening within the ejecta) is at rest.\n    *   The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance traveled by the ejecta as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (S). The formula for distance is `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time interval measured in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n4.  **Apply the Time Dilation Formula:**\n    *   According to the principle of time dilation, an observer in a stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval for events occurring in a moving frame (the ejecta) than an observer in the moving frame itself.\n    *   The relationship is given by the formula: `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   The Lorentz factor is defined as `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   First, calculate `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Next, calculate `(v/c)²`:\n        `(v/c)² = 0.2² = 0.04`\n    *   Now, calculate `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):**\n    *   Using the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame (d):**\n    *   Now, we can calculate the distance `d = v * Δt`.\n        `d = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n        `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n        `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\nTo get the final numerical value, let's use a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000.0  # Relative velocity in km/s\ndelta_t_prime = 50.0  # Proper time in seconds\nc = 300000.0  # Speed of light in km/s\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\nbeta_squared = (v/c)**2\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta_squared)\n\n# Calculate the time in the Galaxy's frame (dilated time)\ndelta_t = gamma * delta_t_prime\n\n# Calculate the distance in the Galaxy's frame\ndistance = v * delta_t\n\nprint(f\"{distance:.0f}\")\n```\n>>>\n3061862\n>>>\nThe calculation shows that the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame is approximately 3,061,862 km. This is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:** The core of the question is about how time and distance are measured in two different inertial reference frames moving relative to each other at a significant fraction of the speed of light. This is a classic special relativity problem.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reference Frames:**\n    *   Frame S: The Galaxy's reference frame (considered \"stationary\").\n    *   Frame S': The ejecta's reference frame (the \"moving\" frame).\n\n3.  **List the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time interval measured in the moving frame S' (the ejecta's own frame) is `Δt' = 50 s`. This is the *proper time* (`t₀`) because it's the time measured by a clock at rest in its own frame.\n    *   The speed of light, `c`, is approximately `300,000 km/s`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Goal:** We need to find the distance `d` traveled by the ejecta as measured by an observer in the Galaxy's reference frame (Frame S).\n\n5.  **Formulate the Plan:**\n    *   The distance in the Galaxy's frame is given by the formula `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed as measured in the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   We don't have `Δt` directly. We have `Δt'`, the time in the ejecta's frame. Due to **time dilation**, an observer in the stationary frame (Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval for events occurring in the moving frame (ejecta).\n    *   The time dilation formula is `Δt = γ * Δt'`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is calculated as `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   So, the plan is:\n        a. Calculate the Lorentz factor, `γ`.\n        b. Use `γ` to calculate the dilated time `Δt` in the Galaxy's frame.\n        c. Use `Δt` and the velocity `v` to calculate the distance `d` in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n6.  **Execute the Plan (Calculation):**\n\n    *   **Step a: Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\n        *   First, find the ratio `v/c`:\n            `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n        *   Next, square this ratio:\n            `(v/c)² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n        *   Now, calculate `γ`:\n            `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n    *   **Step b: Calculate the Dilated Time (Δt)**\n        *   Use the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n            `Δt = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n        *   `sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798`\n        *   `Δt ≈ (1 / 0.9798) * 50 s ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n\n    *   **Step c: Calculate the Distance (d)**\n        *   Use the distance formula `d = v * Δt`\n        *   `d = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s`\n        *   `d ≈ 3,061,800 km`\n\n7.  **Refine Calculation with Python for Precision:**\n    The previous manual calculation is a good check. For a more precise answer, we can use the Python script.\n    The code calculated the distance as `3061862 km`.\n    ```\n    # Code execution result\n    3061862\n    ```\n\n8.  **Compare with Options and Conclude:**\n    *   The calculated distance is `3,061,862 km`.\n    *   Let's look at the given options:\n        A) 3,000,000 km (This is the non-relativistic answer: `60,000 km/s * 50 s`)\n        B) 2,880,000 km\n        C) 3,060,000 km\n        D) 2,940,000 km\n    *   Our calculated value of `3,061,862 km` is extremely close to option C, `3,060,000 km`. The small difference is likely due to the options being rounded.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
