    "To determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to identify which of them are chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature leading to chirality is the presence of a stereocenter (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups). However, we must also check for elements of symmetry (like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion) that would make the molecule achiral despite having stereocenters (as in meso compounds).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   This molecule does not contain any chiral centers (carbon atoms bonded to four different groups). The carbons of the double bond are sp2 hybridized, and the other carbons in the ethyl and methyl groups do not have four different substituents.\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that can pass through the `Cl-CH=C-CH2-CH3` atoms if the ethyl group is oriented correctly. Due to the lack of a chiral center and the presence of a plane of symmetry in an accessible conformation, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name itself specifies a single, specific stereoisomer using the `(3aR,7aS)` notation. The R and S designations are used to specify the absolute configuration of chiral centers.\n    *   The existence of a specific R/S designation means the molecule has chiral centers and is being described as a single enantiomer. A pure enantiomer is, by definition, chiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   The molecule is symmetric, with a `HOOC-CH(CH3)-` group on both sides of the C2-C3 bond.\n    *   The specified configuration is (2R, 3S), which means the two stereocenters have opposite configurations. In a symmetrical molecule like this, if the stereocenters have opposite configurations (one R, one S), the compound is a **meso compound**.\n    *   Meso compounds have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, which makes them achiral despite having chiral centers. They are superimposable on their mirror images.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. The configurations at the two chiral centers are the same: (2R, 3R).\n    *   This configuration eliminates the internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion found in the meso isomer. The molecule is not superimposable on its mirror image, which is the (2S, 3S) isomer.\n    *   (2R,3R)- and (2S,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid form an enantiomeric pair. Each one is chiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The name includes the `(R)` descriptor, indicating a specific enantiomer of a chiral molecule.\n    *   The chiral center is C1, which is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, the `-CH2-CH=CH-` part of the ring, and the `-CH2-CH2-CH=` part of the ring. These two paths around the ring are different.\n    *   Since it is named as a single enantiomer, it is chiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This compound has three hydroxyl groups on a cyclohexane ring at positions 1, 3, and 5. The descriptor `(1s,3s,5s)` indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are `cis` to each other (i.e., on the same side of the ring).\n    *   Let's visualize the molecule with all three OH groups pointing \"up\". This molecule possesses a high degree of symmetry. It has three planes of symmetry. Each plane passes through one C-OH bond and the opposite carbon atom (C4, C6, or C2, respectively). For example, the plane containing C1-OH and C4 bisects the ring, and the C2/C3 part is a mirror image of the C6/C5 part. The OH on C3 is a mirror image of the OH on C5.\n    *   Due to these planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   Let's check for any chiral centers. The cyclopentyl ring carbon attached to the carbonyl is bonded to two `-CH2-` groups in the ring. The rest of the chain `-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2` has no chiral centers because the carbon at position 3 is bonded to a hydrogen and two identical methyl groups.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers. Furthermore, it possesses a plane of symmetry that can pass through the cyclopentyl-C=O-C-C backbone, bisecting the two methyl groups of the isopropyl group.\n    *   Since the molecule is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary of Optically Active Compounds:**\n\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nIn total, there are **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<A>>>"
