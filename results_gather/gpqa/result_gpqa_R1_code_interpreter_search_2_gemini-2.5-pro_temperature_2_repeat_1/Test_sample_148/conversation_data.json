    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Data from 1H NMR:**\n    *   **Observation:** A single proton (the alpha-proton) gives rise to two distinct peaks.\n    *   **Observation:** The integrals of these two peaks are roughly equal and sum to 1H.\n    *   **Inference:** This tells us that there are two distinct chemical species in the sample. These two species are structurally very similar (hence the similar chemical shifts) and are present in approximately a 1:1 ratio. Because they are giving different signals in the NMR, they must be in different chemical environments. This rules out enantiomers (Option A) because enantiomers are indistinguishable in an achiral environment like a standard NMR solvent; they would produce a single set of peaks.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Data from LC-MS:**\n    *   **Observation:** The sample separates into two distinct peaks on the LC (liquid chromatography).\n    *   **Inference:** This confirms the presence of two different compounds that are separable based on their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   **Observation:** Both peaks give the exact same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the target molecule.\n    *   **Inference:** This confirms that the two compounds are isomersâ€”they have the same chemical formula and molecular weight. This definitively rules out contamination with a precursor (Option D) or a product of \"double coupling\" (Option B), as both would have a different molecular weight than the expected product.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Conclusions from Both Techniques:**\n    *   We have a ~1:1 mixture of two isomers.\n    *   These isomers are not enantiomers (ruled out by NMR).\n    *   Therefore, they must be diastereoisomers.\n    *   **What are diastereoisomers?** They are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. This occurs when a molecule has two or more chiral centers, and the isomers differ in the configuration (R/S) at some, but not all, of those chiral centers.\n    *   **How does this fit the data?** Diastereomers have different physical and chemical properties. This is why they can be separated by LC and why they give different signals in an NMR spectrum.\n    *   **Plausibility in context:** In peptide synthesis, the alpha-carbon of an activated amino acid is susceptible to epimerization (a change in stereochemistry at one chiral center) during the coupling reaction. If the starting peptide chain has at least one other chiral center (which it will, as it's made of L-amino acids), the formation of the D-epimer at the new position creates a diastereomer. For example, coupling L-Ala onto L-Val could result in both L-Ala-L-Val and D-Ala-L-Val, which are diastereomers of each other.\n\n4.  **Final Evaluation of Options:**\n    *   A) Enantiomers: Incorrect. Would not show two peaks in NMR or standard LC.\n    *   B) 'Double coupling': Incorrect. Would have a different (higher) mass.\n    *   C) Diastereoisomers: Correct. Explains all observations: two isomers with the same mass but different physical properties, leading to two peaks in both NMR and LC. It's also a common side product in peptide synthesis.\n    *   D) Precursor contamination: Incorrect. Would have a different (lower) mass.\n\nThe observation that the peaks are still distinct at an *elevated temperature* in the LC-MS further strengthens the case for diastereomers (which are configurationally stable) over rapidly interconverting conformational isomers (rotamers), which might coalesce at higher temperatures.\n\n<<<C>>>"
