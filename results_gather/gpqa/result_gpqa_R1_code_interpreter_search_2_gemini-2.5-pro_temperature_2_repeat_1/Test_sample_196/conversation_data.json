    "*   **Step 1: Elucidate the structure of Compound X from the spectroscopic data.**\n\n    *   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   A very broad absorption in the range of **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n        *   A strong, sharp absorption at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the C=O stretching vibration of a carbonyl group, consistent with a carboxylic acid conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n        *   Absorptions at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are characteristic of C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet far downfield is a classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-CO**H**). This confirms the IR analysis.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. The doublet at 8.0 ppm is significantly downfield, which is consistent with protons being ortho to a strong electron-withdrawing group like a carboxylic acid. The doublet at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the other substituent.\n        *   **Combining the data so far:** The structure is a para-substituted benzoic acid, with an unknown alkyl group 'R' at position 4: R-C₆H₄-COOH.\n        *   **Analysis of the alkyl group (R):**\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is a terminal ethyl fragment (-CH₂C**H**₃).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons is consistent with the methylene group (-C**H**₂-) of the ethyl fragment. It is a multiplet because it is split by the terminal CH₃ (making it a quartet) and also by the proton at 2.9 ppm (making it a more complex multiplet).\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-C**H**₃) adjacent to a single proton (-CH-).\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for a single proton. This proton is adjacent to the benzene ring (a benzylic proton), which accounts for its downfield shift. It is coupled to the three protons of the doublet at 1.4 ppm and the two protons of the multiplet at 1.7 ppm (total of 5 neighboring protons), hence it appears as a multiplet (a sextet ideally, but often complex).\n        *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** We have an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) and a methyl group (-CH₃) attached to a single methine (-CH-) carbon. The methine carbon is attached to the benzene ring. This structure is CH₃-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-, which is a *sec*-butyl group.\n        *   **Conclusion for Compound X:** The full structure of Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the reaction and predict the product.**\n\n    *   **Reaction:** Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) is reacted with **red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI)**.\n    *   **Reagents' Function:** This combination (Red P / HI) is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce carbonyl-containing functional groups, including carboxylic acids, to the corresponding alkane. Specifically, it reduces a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Transformation:**\n        *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n        *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n        *   The rest of the molecule, the benzene ring and the sec-butyl group, remains unchanged under these conditions.\n        *   Final Product: The product is 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which can also be named **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Match the product with the given options.**\n\n    *   A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect. The alkyl group is sec-butyl, not isobutyl.\n    *   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect. This is not the product of the reduction.\n    *   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - Incorrect. This is the starting material, Compound X.\n    *   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - Correct. This matches our predicted product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
