    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch.\n    *   Taken together, these two peaks strongly indicate the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the class of compound but doesn't distinguish between the options.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This confirms the absence of C=C double bonds with attached protons. All four given structures are saturated, which is consistent with this information.\n    *   **Splitting Patterns:** The key to solving this problem lies in the complex splitting patterns observed. We need to find the structure that has protons matching these multiplicities.\n        *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).** This means a single proton (a methine, CH) is being split by three different neighboring groups of protons:\n            *   One neighboring proton (n=1, doublet, n+1=2).\n            *   A group of two neighboring protons (n=2, triplet, n+1=3).\n            *   A group of three neighboring protons (n=3, quartet, n+1=4).\n        *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).** This means a different single proton (another methine, CH) is being split by three different neighboring groups:\n            *   One neighboring proton (n=1, doublet, n+1=2).\n            *   A group of two neighboring protons (n=2, triplet, n+1=3).\n            *   Another, non-equivalent group of two neighboring protons (n=2, triplet, n+1=3).\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Candidate Structure:**\n    Let's analyze the expected ¹H NMR signals for the methine (CH) protons in each molecule. Note that the condensed formulas can be ambiguous, so we will deduce the structure and then check its signals. The order of multiplicity (e.g., dtq vs. dqt) depends on the magnitude of the coupling constants (J-values), but the components (doublet, triplet, quartet) are what we need to find.\n\n    *   **A) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH -> 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid** (`HOOC-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH3`)\n        Let's analyze the methine protons:\n        *   **H at C2**: Coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet) and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H, triplet). This would give a **doublet of triplets (dt)**.\n        *   **H at C3**: Coupled to H at C2 (1H, doublet), the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H, triplet), and the terminal CH₃ (3H, quartet). This would be a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n        This structure has a `dtq` but not a `dtt`. So, it's incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH -> 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid** (`HOOC-CH₂-CH(Me)-CH(Me)₂`)\n        Let's analyze the methine protons:\n        *   **H at C3**: Coupled to the CH₂ at C2 (2H, triplet), the H at C4 (1H, doublet), and the C3-methyl group (3H, quartet). This gives a **triplet of doublets of quartets (tdq)**.\n        *   **H at C4**: Coupled to the H at C3 (1H, doublet) and the two methyl groups at C4 (6H total, septet). This gives a **doublet of septets**.\n        This structure has neither a `dtq` nor a `dtt`. So, it's incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH -> 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid** (`HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH₃`)\n        Let's draw this structure to analyze its two different methine protons at C3 and C4.\n        ```\n                                     CH₂CH₃ (ethyl on C4)\n                                    /\n           HOOC-CH₂-CH -- CH--CH₃\n                       |\n                       CH₂CH₃ (ethyl on C3)\n        ```\n        Let's analyze the signals for the methine protons:\n        *   **H at C3**: It is coupled to three different neighboring groups:\n            1.  The `CH₂` group at C2 (2 protons -> **triplet**).\n            2.  The `CH` proton at C4 (1 proton -> **doublet**).\n            3.  The `CH₂` group of the ethyl substituent at C3 (2 protons -> **triplet**).\n            The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the observed signals.\n        *   **H at C4**: It is also coupled to three different neighboring groups:\n            1.  The `CH` proton at C3 (1 proton -> **doublet**).\n            2.  The terminal `CH₃` group at C5 (3 protons -> **quartet**).\n            3.  The `CH₂` group of the ethyl substituent at C4 (2 protons -> **triplet**).\n            The resulting signal is a **doublet of quartets of triplets (dqt)**. This has the same components as the observed `dtq` signal. This matches the second observed signal.\n\n        Since this structure produces both a `dtt` and a `dtq` (or `dqt`) signal, it is the correct compound.\n\n    *   **D) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH -> 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid** (`CH₃CH₂-CH(Me)-CH(Me)-COOH`)\n        Let's analyze the methine protons:\n        *   **H at C2**: Coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet) and the C2-methyl group (3H, quartet). This gives a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n        *   **H at C3**: Coupled to H at C2 (1H, doublet), the C3-methyl group (3H, quartet), and the ethyl group's CH₂ at C4 (2H, triplet). This gives a **doublet of quartets of triplets (dqt)**.\n        This structure has a `dqt` but not a `dtt`. So, it's incorrect.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    Only structure **C**, which corresponds to 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, can produce both a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) and a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).\n\n<<<C>>>"
