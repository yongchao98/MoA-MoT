    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure\nThe chemical formula given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\nFirst, we need to determine the number of carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms to get the molecular formula. Let's break down the structure part by part:\n1.  **(CH3)2C=**: This part has 1 central carbon atom and 2 methyl (CH3) groups. So, it's 1 + 2 = 3 Carbon atoms and 2 * 3 = 6 Hydrogen atoms.\n2.  **=CH-**: This part has 1 Carbon atom and 1 Hydrogen atom.\n3.  **-CH2-**: This part has 1 Carbon atom and 2 Hydrogen atoms.\n4.  **-CH(CH3)-**: This part has 1 carbon in the main chain and 1 in the methyl branch. So, it's 1 + 1 = 2 Carbon atoms and 1 + 3 = 4 Hydrogen atoms.\n5.  **-CH2-**: This part has 1 Carbon atom and 2 Hydrogen atoms.\n6.  **-CH=**: This part has 1 Carbon atom and 1 Hydrogen atom.\n7.  **=C(CH3)2**: This part has 1 central carbon and 2 methyl groups. So, it's 1 + 2 = 3 Carbon atoms and 2 * 3 = 6 Hydrogen atoms.\n\nTotal Carbon atoms (C) = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12\nTotal Hydrogen atoms (H) = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n### Step 2: Count the Number of Each Type of Bond\nWe need to count the single (C-C), double (C=C), and carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds.\n\n*   **C-H bonds**: The number of hydrogen atoms is 22. Since each hydrogen forms a single bond with a carbon atom, there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C bonds**: The structure clearly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds: `C=C` and `C=C`. So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds**: Let's count the single bonds between carbon atoms.\n    *   In the (CH3)2C= group, there are 2 C-C bonds.\n    *   Between =CH- and -CH2-, there is 1 C-C bond.\n    *   Between -CH2- and -CH(CH3)-, there is 1 C-C bond.\n    *   In the -CH(CH3)- group, there is 1 C-C bond to the methyl group.\n    *   Between -CH(CH3)- and -CH2-, there is 1 C-C bond.\n    *   Between -CH2- and -CH=, there is 1 C-C bond.\n    *   In the =C(CH3)2 group, there are 2 C-C bonds.\n    *   Total C-C bonds = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n    *(Self-verification: For an acyclic molecule, the total number of bonds is the total number of atoms minus 1. Total atoms = 12 (C) + 22 (H) = 34. Total bonds = 34 - 1 = 33. Our count: 22 (C-H) + 2 (C=C) + 9 (C-C) = 33. The count is correct.)*\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf)\nThe enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) is calculated using the following formula based on Hess's Law and bond energies:\n\nΔHf = [Σ Enthalpy of atomization of reactants] - [Σ Bond energy of products]\n\nThe formation reaction from elements in their standard state is:\n12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\n**A. Calculate the enthalpy of atomization of reactants:**\nThis is the energy required to convert the reactants (12 moles of solid carbon and 11 moles of H2 gas) into gaseous atoms.\n\n*   Enthalpy for Carbon: 12 mol * ΔH_atomization(C) = 12 mol * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   Enthalpy for Hydrogen: This requires breaking 11 moles of H-H bonds. 11 mol * BE(H-H) = 11 mol * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n*   Total enthalpy of atomization of reactants = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n**B. Calculate the total bond energy of the product (C12H22):**\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the product molecule.\n\n*   Energy for C-C bonds: 9 * BE(C-C) = 9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ/mol\n*   Energy for C=C bonds: 2 * BE(C=C) = 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol\n*   Energy for C-H bonds: 22 * BE(C-H) = 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ/mol\n*   Total bond energy of product = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n**C. Calculate ΔHf:**\nΔHf = (Total enthalpy of atomization of reactants) - (Total bond energy of product)\nΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n### Step 4: Convert Units to Match Options\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. The options provided are in both kJ/mol and kJ/g. We must check the value in kJ/g.\n\n*   First, calculate the molar mass of C12H22.\n    *   Molar Mass (M) = (12 * Atomic mass of C) + (22 * Atomic mass of H)\n    *   M = (12 * 12 g/mol) + (22 * 1 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n*   Next, convert the enthalpy of formation from kJ/mol to kJ/g.\n    *   ΔHf (kJ/g) = ΔHf (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\n    *   ΔHf (kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol = 11.4457... kJ/g.\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get **11.45 kJ/g**. This matches option D.\nI will write some python code to verify my calculations.\n```python\n# Given data\nenthalpy_atom_C = 1000  # kJ/mol\nbe_H_H = 100            # kJ/mol\nbe_C_C = 200            # kJ/mol\nbe_C_equal_C = 300      # kJ/mol\nbe_C_H = 400            # kJ/mol\n\n# Molecular formula is C12H22\nnum_C = 12\nnum_H = 22\n\n# Bond counts\nnum_C_H_bonds = 22\nnum_C_C_bonds = 9\nnum_C_equal_C_bonds = 2\n\n# Calculate enthalpy of atomization of reactants (12 C(s) + 11 H2(g))\n# 12 C(s) -> 12 C(g)\n# 11 H2(g) -> 22 H(g)\nenthalpy_atom_reactants = (num_C * enthalpy_atom_C) + (num_H/2 * be_H_H)\n\n# Calculate total bond energy of the product (enthalpy of atomization of the product)\n# C12H22(g) -> 12 C(g) + 22 H(g)\nbond_energy_product = (num_C_C_bonds * be_C_C) + \\\n                      (num_C_equal_C_bonds * be_C_equal_C) + \\\n                      (num_C_H_bonds * be_C_H)\n\n# Calculate enthalpy of formation\n# 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) -> C12H22(g)\n# dHf = dH_atom_reactants - dH_atom_product (where dH_atom_product is the total bond energy)\ndelta_hf_mol = enthalpy_atom_reactants - bond_energy_product\n\n# Calculate molar mass of C12H22\nmolar_mass_C = 12  # g/mol\nmolar_mass_H = 1   # g/mol\nmolar_mass_C12H22 = (num_C * molar_mass_C) + (num_H * molar_mass_H)\n\n# Convert enthalpy of formation to kJ/g\ndelta_hf_gram = delta_hf_mol / molar_mass_C12H22\n\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation (kJ/mol): {delta_hf_mol}\")\nprint(f\"Molar mass (g/mol): {molar_mass_C12H22}\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation (kJ/g): {delta_hf_gram}\")\n```\n>>>\nEnthalpy of formation (kJ/mol): 1900.0\nMolar mass (g/mol): 166\nEnthalpy of formation (kJ/g): 11.44578313253012\n<<<D>>>",
    "To calculate the enthalpy of formation of (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2, we follow these steps:\n\n### **1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nFirst, let's determine the molecular formula by counting the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms in the given compound:\n(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\n\n*   Number of Carbon (C) atoms: 2 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 (from CH(CH3)) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 (from (CH3)2) = 12 carbon atoms.\n*   Number of Hydrogen (H) atoms: 6 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 (from CH(CH3)) + 2 + 1 + 6 (from (CH3)2) = 22 hydrogen atoms.\n\nSo, the molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n### **2. Count the Number of Bonds**\n\nNext, we count the number of each type of bond in the molecule:\n\n*   **C-H bonds**: There are 22 hydrogen atoms, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C bonds**: The structure clearly shows two double bonds, so there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds**: The remaining bonds between carbon atoms are single bonds. Counting them from the structure:\n    *   (CH3)2**C=** : 2 C-C bonds\n    *   **=CH-CH2-** : 1 C-C bond\n    *   **-CH2-CH(CH3)-** : 1 C-C bond\n    *   **-CH(CH3)-** : 1 C-C bond within the branch\n    *   **-CH(CH3)-CH2-** : 1 C-C bond\n    *   **-CH2-CH=** : 1 C-C bond\n    *   **=C(CH3)2** : 2 C-C bonds\n    *   Total C-C bonds = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the following thermodynamic cycle:\n\n**Reactants in standard state → Gaseous atoms → Product**\n\nThe reaction for formation is:\n12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\n**Step 3.1: Enthalpy of atomization of reactants (Energy Input)**\nThis is the energy required to convert the reactants from their standard states into gaseous atoms (12 C(g) + 22 H(g)).\n\n*   Atomization of 12 moles of Carbon: 12 mol × ΔH_atomization(C) = 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n*   Atomization of 11 moles of Hydrogen (H2): 11 mol × BE(H-H) = 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n*   **Total Energy Input = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = 13100 kJ**\n\n**Step 3.2: Total bond energy of the product (Energy Released)**\nThis is the energy released when 1 mole of the product (C12H22) is formed from its constituent gaseous atoms. It is the sum of all bond energies in the molecule.\n\n*   Energy from 9 C-C bonds: 9 × BE(C-C) = 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   Energy from 2 C=C bonds: 2 × BE(C=C) = 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n*   Energy from 22 C-H bonds: 22 × BE(C-H) = 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   **Total Energy Released = 1800 kJ + 600 kJ + 8800 kJ = 11200 kJ**\n\n**Step 3.3: Calculate ΔHf (per mole)**\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy input and the energy released.\n\n*   ΔHf = (Total Energy Input) - (Total Energy Released)\n*   ΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n### **4. Convert Units to Match the Options**\n\nThe options are given in kJ/mol and kJ/g. Let's convert our result to kJ/g to check against the options.\n\n*   Calculate the molar mass of C12H22:\n    *   Molar Mass = (12 × 12.01 g/mol) + (22 × 1.01 g/mol) ≈ 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n*   Convert ΔHf from kJ/mol to kJ/g:\n    *   ΔHf (kJ/g) = ΔHf (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\n    *   ΔHf (kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol ≈ **11.45 kJ/g**.\n\nComparing our results with the given options:\nA) 11200 kJ/mol - This is the total bond energy of the product, not the enthalpy of formation.\nB) 67.4 kJ/mol - Incorrect.\nC) 1900 kJ/g - This is incorrect; the value is 1900 kJ/mol.\nD) 11.44 kJ/g - This matches our calculated value of ~11.45 kJ/g.\n\n<<<D>>>"
