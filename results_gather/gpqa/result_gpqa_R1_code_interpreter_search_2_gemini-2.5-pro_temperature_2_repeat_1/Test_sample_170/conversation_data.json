    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic substitution reaction with bromine.\n\n### **1. Classify the Substituents**\n\nFirst, we need to classify the substituent on the benzene ring for each substance. Substituents can be classified based on two properties:\n*   **Directing effect:** Whether they direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the *ortho* and *para* positions or to the *meta* position.\n*   **Activating/Deactivating effect:** Whether they make the ring more or less reactive than benzene itself towards electrophilic substitution.\n\nLet's classify each substituent:\n1.  **ะก6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** -CH3 is an alkyl group. It is an **activating** and **ortho, para-directing** group.\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** -COOC2H5 is an ester group. It is a **deactivating** and **meta-directing** group.\n3.  **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** -Cl is a halogen. It is **deactivating** but **ortho, para-directing**.\n4.  **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** -NO2 is a nitro group. It is a strongly **deactivating** and **meta-directing** group.\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** -C2H5 is an alkyl group. It is an **activating** and **ortho, para-directing** group.\n6.  **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** -COOH is a carboxylic acid group. It is a **deactivating** and **meta-directing** group.\n\n### **2. Ranking Substances with Meta-Directors**\n\nSubstances 2, 4, and 6 are meta-directors. In an electrophilic substitution, these substances will yield the meta-isomer as the major product. The yields of the ortho and para-isomers will be very low.\n\nTo rank them by their para-isomer yield, we need to consider the strength of their deactivating and meta-directing effect. The stronger the deactivating effect, the more strongly the substitution is directed to the meta position, and thus the lower the yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength for these groups is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n(Nitro > Carboxylic acid > Ester)\n\nTherefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order of their deactivating strength.\nLowest para-yield < ... < Highest para-yield (among meta-directors)\nC6H5-NO2 (4) < C6H5-COOH (6) < C6H5-COOC2H5 (2)\n\nThis gives us the first part of our sequence: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### **3. Ranking Substances with Ortho, Para-Directors**\n\nSubstances 1, 3, and 5 are ortho, para-directors. These will produce significant amounts of both ortho and para isomers. The ratio of para to ortho product is influenced mainly by two factors: electronics and steric hindrance.\n\n*   **Steric Hindrance:** A larger substituent group will block the ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher proportion of the para-isomer.\n*   **Electronic Effects:** The inductive effect of a substituent, which falls off with distance, can also play a role.\n\nLet's compare the substituents: -CH3 (1), -C2H5 (5), and -Cl (3).\n\n*   **Comparing -CH3 and -C2H5:** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased steric hindrance will disfavor attack at the ortho positions more for ethylbenzene than for toluene, leading to a higher relative yield of the para-isomer for ethylbenzene.\n    *   Para yield: -CH3 (1) < -C2H5 (5)\n\n*   **Comparing with -Cl:** The chloro group is a special case. While it is sterically not very large, it has a strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect. This effect is strongest at the ortho position (closest to the chlorine), making it less reactive than the para position. This electronic effect, combined with its steric hindrance, makes chlorobenzene exceptionally selective for the para-isomer. The para-isomer is the major product by a large margin (often close to 90%). Its para-yield is significantly higher than for the alkyl-substituted benzenes.\n    *   Para yield: -C2H5 (5) < -Cl (3)\n\nCombining these gives the order of increasing para-yield for the ortho, para-directors:\n**1 < 5 < 3**\n\n### **4. Combining the Rankings**\n\nNow, we combine the rankings for both groups. The meta-directors will have the lowest para-yields, followed by the ortho, para-directors.\n\n*   **Meta-directors order:** 4 < 6 < 2\n*   **Ortho, para-directors order:** 1 < 5 < 3\n\nThe complete sequence for increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
