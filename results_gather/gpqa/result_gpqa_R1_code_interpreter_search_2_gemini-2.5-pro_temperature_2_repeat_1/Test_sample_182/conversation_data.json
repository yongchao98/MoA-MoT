    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the reactant.**\n    The reactant is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break down its structure to find its molecular formula and index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD).\n    *   The core is a `cyclohex-3-ene` ring. This is a 6-membered carbon ring with one double bond. A ring itself counts as one degree of unsaturation, and a double bond counts as another. So, this part contributes an IHD of 1 + 1 = 2.\n    *   `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH) is attached at position 1. This group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which adds 1 to the IHD.\n    *   `formyl` group (-CHO) is attached at position 2. This is an aldehyde group and also contains a C=O double bond, adding another 1 to the IHD.\n    *   `vinyl` group (-CH=CH2) is attached at position 5. This group contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), which adds another 1 to the IHD.\n\n    So, the total IHD of the starting material is the sum of all contributions:\n    IHD_reactant = 1 (for the ring) + 1 (for the C=C in the ring) + 1 (for the C=O in COOH) + 1 (for the C=O in CHO) + 1 (for the C=C in vinyl group) = 5.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the reaction.**\n    The reagent used is red phosphorus (Red P) with an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This is a very strong reducing agent. Its function is to reduce nearly all oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds to their corresponding saturated hydrocarbon parts.\n    *   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is completely reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   A formyl (aldehyde) group (-CHO) is completely reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   A carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), both in the ring and in the vinyl group, is reduced to a single bond (C-C).\n    *   The cyclic structure of the cyclohexane ring is stable and will not be opened under these conditions.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the structure of the product.**\n    The reaction reduces all the functional groups and unsaturations mentioned above but leaves the carbon skeleton intact.\n    *   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring (the double bond is saturated).\n    *   The `carboxylic acid` group at C1 becomes a `methyl` group.\n    *   The `formyl` group at C2 becomes a `methyl` group.\n    *   The `vinyl` group at C5 becomes an `ethyl` group (-CH2CH3).\n    The resulting product is a saturated substituted cycloalkane: **1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.**\n    The IHD (also called degree of unsaturation) is calculated based on the structure of the product molecule. The formula is:\n    IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds)\n\n    Let's analyze the product, **1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane**:\n    *   **Number of rings:** There is one cyclohexane ring. So, number of rings = 1.\n    *   **Number of π bonds:** The reaction has reduced all C=C and C=O double bonds to single bonds. The product is a fully saturated molecule. So, the number of π bonds (double or triple bonds) is 0.\n\n    Therefore, the IHD of the product is:\n    IHD_product = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n*   **Step 5: Verify using molecular formulas (Optional but good practice).**\n    *   Reactant (C10H12O3): IHD = 10 - 12/2 + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5. (Matches our structural analysis).\n    *   Product (1,2-dimethyl-5-ethylcyclohexane): The molecule consists of a C6 ring, two -CH3 groups, and one -C2H5 group. Total Carbons = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10. The molecular formula for a substituted cyclohexane (general formula CnH2n) is C10H20.\n    *   IHD_product = C - H/2 + 1 = 10 - 20/2 + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1. (Matches our structural analysis).\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1.\n\n<<<B>>>"
