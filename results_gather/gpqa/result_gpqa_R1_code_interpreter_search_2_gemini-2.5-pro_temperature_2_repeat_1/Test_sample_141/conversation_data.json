    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to determine the geometrical position (i.e., the Bloch vector `r = (rx, ry, rz)`) in the qubit space that corresponds to the given density matrix:\n    \n    $\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$\n    \n\n2.  **Recall the Relationship between Density Matrix and Bloch Vector:**\n    Any single-qubit density matrix `ρ` can be represented using the Bloch vector `r` and the Pauli matrices `σ = (σx, σy, σz)` as:\n    \n    $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}) = \\frac{1}{2}(I + r_x\\sigma_x + r_y\\sigma_y + r_z\\sigma_z)$\n    \n    where `I` is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n    \n    Conversely, the components of the Bloch vector `r` can be calculated from a given density matrix `ρ` using the following formula, which is derived from the property `Tr(σi * σj) = 2δij`:\n    \n    $r_i = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\cdot \\sigma_i)$\n    \n\n3.  **Step 1: Express the given density matrix `ρ` in matrix form.**\n    *   The standard basis kets are $|0\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $|1\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   The corresponding bras are $\\langle 0| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\langle 1| = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   Now, we compute the outer products (projectors):\n        *   $|0\\rangle\\langle 0| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n        *   $|1\\rangle\\langle 1| = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   Substitute these into the expression for `ρ`:\n        $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n        $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   This is the identity matrix scaled by 1/2, which is known as the **maximally mixed state**.\n\n4.  **Step 2: Calculate the components of the Bloch vector `r`.**\n    *   We need the Pauli matrices:\n        $\\sigma_x = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $\\sigma_y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $\\sigma_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   Calculate $r_x = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\cdot \\sigma_x)$:\n        $\\rho \\cdot \\sigma_x = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1/2 \\\\ 1/2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n        $r_x = \\text{Tr} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1/2 \\\\ 1/2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = 0 + 0 = 0$\n    *   Calculate $r_y = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\cdot \\sigma_y)$:\n        $\\rho \\cdot \\sigma_y = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i/2 \\\\ i/2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n        $r_y = \\text{Tr} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i/2 \\\\ i/2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = 0 + 0 = 0$\n    *   Calculate $r_z = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\cdot \\sigma_z)$:\n        $\\rho \\cdot \\sigma_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n        $r_z = \\text{Tr} \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = 1/2 - 1/2 = 0$\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The components of the Bloch vector are $(r_x, r_y, r_z) = (0, 0, 0)$.
