    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Part 1: Calculate the Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nTo find the relative speed of the two astronauts, we must use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula because their speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. The formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving in the same direction is:\n\nv_rel = (u - v) / (1 - (u * v) / c²)\n\nWhere:\n*   u is the speed of the first astronaut, u = v₁ = 0.6c\n*   v is the speed of the second astronaut, v = v₂ = 0.5c\n*   c is the speed of light.\n\nSubstitute the values into the formula:\n\nv_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\nv_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3c² / c²)\nv_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)\nv_rel = 0.1c / 0.7\nv_rel ≈ 0.142857 c\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **v_rel = 0.14c**.\n\n**Part 2: Calculate the Total Energy of the System (E)**\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total energies of the two astronauts. The total energy (E) of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is given by the formula:\n\nE = γmc²\n\nWhere:\n*   m is the rest mass of the particle.\n*   γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the energy of the first astronaut (E₁):\n*   Mass (m₁) = 2m\n*   Velocity (v₁) = 0.6c\n*   Lorentz factor (γ₁):\n    γ₁ = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.36) = 1 / √(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\n*   Energy (E₁):\n    E₁ = γ₁ * m₁ * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = **2.5 mc²**\n\nNext, let's calculate the energy of the second astronaut (E₂):\n*   Mass (m₂) = 3m\n*   Velocity (v₂) = 0.5c\n*   Lorentz factor (γ₂):\n    γ₂ = 1 / √(1 - (0.5c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.25) = 1 / √(0.75) ≈ 1 / 0.866 ≈ 1.1547\n*   Energy (E₂):\n    E₂ = γ₂ * m₂ * c² ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c² ≈ **3.464 mc²**\n\nFinally, calculate the total energy (E) of the system by adding the individual energies:\nE = E₁ + E₂\nE = 2.5 mc² + 3.464 mc²\nE = **5.964 mc²**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately **0.14c**, and the total energy is approximately **5.96 mc²**. These results match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
