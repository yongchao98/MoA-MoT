    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by:\n    `T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\n    where:\n    *   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the planet's semi-major axis.\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio of Temperatures:** We need to find `T_eq1 / T_eq2`.\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_1))^(1/2) * (1 - A_1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_2))^(1/2) * (1 - A_2)^(1/4)]`\n    The problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so `T_star` and `R_star` are the same for both. It is also given that both planets have the same albedo (`A_1 = A_2`). Therefore, these terms cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [(1 / a_1)^(1/2)] / [(1 / a_2)^(1/2)] = (a_2 / a_1)^(1/2) = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)`\n    This means the ratio of equilibrium temperatures depends only on the ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n4.  **Determine the Semi-Major Axis (a):** The radial velocity (RV) method data can be used to find the semi-major axis.\n    *   First, relate the given Doppler shift (`Δλ`) to the star's radial velocity amplitude (`K_star`).\n        `Δλ / λ_0 = K_star / c`  =>  `K_star = c * (Δλ / λ_0)`\n        where `λ_0` is the rest wavelength (6300 Å) and `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   Next, relate `K_star` to the orbital parameters. For a circular orbit and assuming the mass of the planet is much smaller than the star (`M_p << M_star`), the velocity amplitude of the star is given by:\n        `K_star = (M_p / M_star) * v_p * sin(i)`\n        where `v_p` is the planet's orbital velocity and `i` is the inclination of the orbit.\n        Since the planets are detected by both transit and RV methods, we can assume the inclination `i` is close to 90°, which means `sin(i) ≈ 1`.\n        `K_star ≈ (M_p / M_star) * v_p`\n    *   The planet's orbital velocity `v_p` for a circular orbit is:\n        `v_p = sqrt(G * (M_star + M_p) / a) ≈ sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\n    *   Substitute `v_p` back into the `K_star` equation:\n        `K_star = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) = (M_p * sqrt(G)) / sqrt(M_star * a)`\n    *   Now, solve for the semi-major axis `a`:\n        `K_star^2 = (M_p^2 * G) / (M_star * a)`\n        `a = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K_star^2)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a_2 / a_1):**\n    `a_2 / a_1 = [(G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K_star2^2)] / [(G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K_star1^2)]`\n    The gravitational constant `G` and the star's mass `M_star` cancel out:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / K_star2^2) * (K_star1^2 / M_p1^2) = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_star1 / K_star2)^2`\n    We also know that `K_star` is directly proportional to `Δλ` (`K_star = c * Δλ / λ_0`). So, the ratio `K_star1 / K_star2` is equal to `Δλ_1 / Δλ_2`.\n    `a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2`\n\n6.  **Substitute the Ratio of Axes into the Temperature Ratio Formula:**\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1) = sqrt[ (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2 ]`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)`\n\n7.  **Plug in the Given Values and Calculate:**\n    *   Mass of Planet 1, `M_p1` = 7 Earth masses\n    *   Mass of Planet 2, `M_p2` = 5 Earth masses\n    *   Doppler shift for Planet 1, `Δλ_1` = 0.03 Å\n    *   Doppler shift for Planet 2, `Δλ_2` = 0.04 Å\n\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4) = 15 / 28`\n\nNow, let's perform the final calculation.\n```python\n# Given values\nMp1_Me = 7  # Mass of Planet 1 in Earth masses\nMp2_Me = 5  # Mass of Planet 2 in Earth masses\ndelta_lambda1 = 0.03  # Doppler shift for Planet 1 in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda2 = 0.04  # Doppler shift for Planet 2 in Angstroms\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq1 / T_eq2 is derived as:\n# T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (Mp2 / Mp1) * (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2)\n\n# Calculate the ratio of masses\nmass_ratio = Mp2_Me / Mp1_Me\n\n# Calculate the ratio of Doppler shifts\nshift_ratio = delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2\n\n# Calculate the final temperature ratio\ntemp_ratio = mass_ratio * shift_ratio\n\nprint(temp_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.5357142857142857\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation yields approximately 0.536. This value is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula:\n`T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\nwhere `T_star` is the star's temperature, `R_star` is the star's radius, `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, and `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 (`T_eq1`) and Planet2 (`T_eq2`).\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_1))^(1/2) * (1 - A_1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_2))^(1/2) * (1 - A_2)^(1/4)]`\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star (`T_star` and `R_star` are constant) and have the same albedo (`A_1 = A_2`), the equation simplifies to:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a_2 / a_1)^(1/2)`\n\nNow, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes (`a_2 / a_1`). We can use the information from the radial velocity method. The Doppler shift (`Δλ`) is related to the star's radial velocity amplitude (`K_star`) by:\n`K_star = c * (Δλ / λ_0)`\nwhere `c` is the speed of light and `λ_0` is the rest wavelength. Since `c` and `λ_0` are constants, `K_star` is directly proportional to `Δλ`.\n`K_star1 / K_star2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2`\n\nFor a circular orbit, assuming the planet's mass (`M_p`) is much smaller than the star's mass (`M_star`), the star's velocity amplitude is:\n`K_star = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\nwhere `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\nSolving for `a`:\n`K_star^2 = (M_p^2 * G * M_star) / (M_star^2 * a) = (M_p^2 * G) / (M_star * a)`\n`a = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K_star^2)`\n\nNow, we can find the ratio `a_2 / a_1`:\n`a_2 / a_1 = [(G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K_star2^2)] / [(G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K_star1^2)]`\n\nThe constants `G` and `M_star` cancel out:\n`a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / K_star2^2) * (K_star1^2 / M_p1^2) = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_star1 / K_star2)^2`\n\nSubstitute `K_star1 / K_star2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2`:\n`a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2`\n\nFinally, substitute this back into the temperature ratio equation:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1) = sqrt[ (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2 ]`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)`\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   `M_p1` = 7 Earth masses\n*   `M_p2` = 5 Earth masses\n*   `Δλ_1` = 0.03 Å\n*   `Δλ_2` = 0.04 Å\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04) = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4) = 15 / 28`\n`15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>"
