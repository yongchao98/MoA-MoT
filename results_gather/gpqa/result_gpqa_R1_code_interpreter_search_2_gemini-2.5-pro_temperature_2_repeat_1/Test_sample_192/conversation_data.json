    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We are given the relationship between the number of stars and parallax (`plx`). Let's denote the number of stars as `N`. The problem states that the number of stars *varies with parallax*. This is best interpreted as a distribution function, meaning the number of stars per unit interval of parallax, `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   Given relationship: `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`. The symbol `∝` means \"is proportional to\".\n    *   We need to find how the number of stars changes with distance `r`, specifically \"per unit range of distance\". This quantity is `dN/dr`.\n\n2.  **Establish the Connection between Distance and Parallax:**\n    *   Stellar parallax (`plx`) and distance (`r`) are fundamentally related. Parallax is the apparent shift in a star's position due to the Earth's orbit around the Sun.\n    *   The relationship is inverse: `plx = 1/r`. (This is the simplified formula where `r` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds. For proportionality, the specific units don't matter, only the inverse relationship).\n\n3.  **Use the Chain Rule for Differentiation:**\n    *   We want to find `dN/dr`, and we are given information about `dN/d(plx)`. We can connect these two derivatives using the chain rule:\n        `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the necessary components:**\n    *   **First term:** We are given this proportionality:\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\n    *   **Second term:** We need to find the derivative of parallax with respect to distance:\n        `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`\n        `d(plx)/dr = d/dr(r⁻¹) = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n\n5.  **Combine the components:**\n    *   Substitute the proportionalities into the chain rule equation. When dealing with proportionality, we can ignore the negative sign, as it only indicates direction (i.e., as `r` increases, `plx` decreases). We are interested in the magnitude of the change.\n        `dN/dr ∝ (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n        `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx^5) * (1/r²)`\n\n6.  **Express the final relationship in terms of `r` only:**\n    *   Our current expression for `dN/dr` has both `plx` and `r`. To get the final answer, we must have it only in terms of `r`. We use the relationship `plx = 1/r` to substitute for `plx`.\n        `dN/dr ∝ (1 / (1/r)⁵) * (1/r²)`\n\n7.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    *   First, simplify the parallax term: `1 / (1/r)⁵ = 1 / (1/r⁵) = r⁵`.\n    *   Now substitute this back into the main expression:\n        `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²)`\n        `dN/dr ∝ r⁵/r²`\n        `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe number of stars per unit range of distance, `dN/dr`, changes in proportion to `r³`.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
