    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n**1. Analysis of the Mass Spectrum (MS)**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with its most abundant isotopes. The nominal molecular mass is 156 u.\n*   **Isotope Pattern (M+2):** There is a significant peak at m/z = 158, which is two mass units higher than the molecular ion peak. Its relative intensity is 32% of the M+ peak (100%). This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 (100:32) is a distinctive fingerprint for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (³⁵Cl isotope has ~75.8% natural abundance, ³⁷Cl isotope has ~24.2% abundance, ratio ~3.1:1).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The unknown compound has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol and contains one chlorine atom. We can check the molecular formula of the options. All proposed compounds, C₇H₅ClO₂, have a nominal mass of (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + 35 + (2 * 16) = 156 u. So, the MS data is consistent with all options but confirms the presence of one Cl.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Infrared (IR) Spectrum**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration within a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. When considered with the broad O-H peak, it strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. Aldehydes (Option A) and chloroformates (Option B) have C=O groups, but they do not have the characteristic very broad O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is almost certainly a carboxylic acid. This evidence strongly favors options C and D and rules out A and B.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectrum**\n\n*   **Signal at 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** This very downfield signal is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). It typically appears between 10-13 ppm and is a singlet because it does not couple with other protons. This confirms the conclusion from the IR spectrum.\n*   **Signals at 8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift:** These signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm). The integration (2H + 2H) shows there are a total of 4 protons on a benzene ring, meaning the ring is disubstituted.\n    *   **Splitting Pattern:** The key piece of information is the symmetrical pattern: two doublets, each representing two equivalent protons. This specific pattern is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. In a para-disubstituted ring, the two protons ortho to one substituent are chemically equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent are also equivalent, resulting in two distinct signals that appear as doublets due to coupling with their immediate neighbors.\n    *   **Comparing Options:**\n        *   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is para-disubstituted. It would produce exactly this symmetrical pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region.\n        *   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is ortho-disubstituted. The four aromatic protons are all in different chemical environments and would produce four separate and more complex signals (e.g., doublets of doublets, triplets of doublets), not two simple doublets of 2H each.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nAll pieces of spectral evidence converge on a single structure.\n*   **MS** shows MW=156 and one Cl atom.\n*   **IR** shows a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **¹H NMR** confirms the carboxylic acid and shows a 1,4-(para) substituted aromatic ring.\n\nThe only structure that fits all these criteria is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>"
