    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Compound A2 from the mass percentage.**\n    The problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (YFx) with a weight percentage of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n    Let M(Y) be the molar mass of element Y, M(F) be the molar mass of fluorine (19.00 g/mol), and x be the number of fluorine atoms in A2.\n    The formula for the weight percentage is:\n    ɷF = (x * M(F)) / (M(Y) + x * M(F))\n    0.3196 = (x * 19.00) / (M(Y) + 19.00 * x)\n\n    We can rearrange this formula to solve for M(Y):\n    M(Y) * 0.3196 + 19.00 * x * 0.3196 = 19.00 * x\n    M(Y) * 0.3196 = 19.00 * x * (1 - 0.3196)\n    M(Y) * 0.3196 = 19.00 * x * 0.6804\n    M(Y) = x * (19.00 * 0.6804) / 0.3196\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * x\n\n2.  **Test integer values of x to find a plausible element Y.**\n    We can create a table of possible molar masses for Y based on different integer values of x and look for a match with a real element.\n    *   If x = 1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol. This is close to Argon (Ar, 39.95) or Calcium (Ca, 40.08). These elements are not known to form five binary fluorides.\n    *   If x = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is very close to Bromine (Br, 79.90). However, bromine is only known to form three stable binary fluorides (BrF, BrF3, BrF5).\n    *   If x = 3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is an excellent match for Antimony (Sb, 121.76 g/mol). The difference is less than 0.5%.\n    *   If x = 4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol. Close to Terbium (Tb, 158.9) or Dysprosium (Dy, 162.5), but lanthanides typically form LnF3 and are not the best fit for the described reactivity.\n    *   If x = 6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is close to Plutonium (Pu, 244). However, as explored in the thoughts, this path doesn't lead to a valid answer for the molecular weight of A4.\n\n3.  **Confirm the identity of Y and A2.**\n    The best fit is Y = Antimony (Sb) and x = 3, which means A2 = SbF3. Let's verify the mass percentage for SbF3 using precise molar masses.\n    ```python\n    # Molar masses\n    M_Sb = 121.76  # g/mol\n    M_F = 18.9984 # g/mol\n\n    # Compound A2 is SbF3\n    x = 3\n    M_SbF3 = M_Sb + x * M_F\n    \n    # Calculate weight percentage of Fluorine\n    omega_F = (x * M_F) / M_SbF3\n    \n    print(f\"Molecular weight of SbF3: {M_SbF3:.2f} g/mol\")\n    print(f\"Weight percentage of F in SbF3: {omega_F*100:.2f}%\")\n    ```\n    The calculated weight percentage is 31.88%, which is extremely close to the given value of 31.96%. This confirms that Y is Sb and A2 is SbF3.\n\n4.  **Identify substance A4.**\n    The problem asks for the molecular weight range of A4. A4 is one of the five binary fluorides of antimony. The most common and stable binary fluorides of antimony are Antimony Trifluoride (SbF3) and Antimony Pentafluoride (SbF5). A4 must be one of these (or a less common one).\n    Let's calculate their molecular weights:\n    *   **Molecular Weight of SbF3**: We calculated this above as 178.75 g/mol.\n    *   **Molecular Weight of SbF5**: M(SbF5) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = 216.76 g/mol.\n\n5.  **Match the molecular weight with the given options.**\n    Now we check which of these molecular weights falls into the ranges provided in the multiple-choice options.\n    *   A) 220-240\n    *   B) 160-180\n    *   C) 110-130\n    *   D) 140-160\n\n    The molecular weight of SbF3 (178.76 g/mol) falls squarely within the range of **160-180**.\n    The molecular weight of SbF5 (216.76 g/mol) does not fall into any of the ranges (it's close to range A, but outside it).\n\n    Therefore, the substance A4 must be SbF3.\n\n6.  **Consistency Check (Optional but good practice).**\n    *   Y = Sb, A2 = SbF3, A4 = SbF3. This means A2 and A4 are the same substance, which is permitted.\n    *   The \"solution of A4\" is a \"solution of SbF3\". SbF3 is a colorless solid, and its solutions can be colorless. This fits.\n    *   The other facts (bright-red A1, decomposition at 293 K, five binary fluorides) are inconsistent with the common knowledge of antimony chemistry (SbF5, which should be A1, is colorless and more stable). This suggests either there is an error in the problem statement regarding these qualitative descriptions, or they refer to very exotic and unstable species. However, the quantitative data (the mass percentage) provides a clear and unambiguous path to the solution.\n\nThe molecular weight of A4 (SbF3) is approximately 178.8 g/mol, which belongs to the range 160-180.\n\n<<<B>>>"
