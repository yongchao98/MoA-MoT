    "This problem asks for the scalar and vector potentials, V and $\\vec{A}$, generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Li√©nard-Weichert potentials. The solution requires starting from the general expressions for potentials from a time-varying charge and current distribution and applying them to the specific case of a point charge.\n\n1.  **Fundamental Equations:** The electromagnetic potentials for a general time-dependent charge density $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t')$ and current density $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t')$ are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n    where the fields are observed at position $\\vec{r}$ and time $t$. The source densities are evaluated at the *retarded time*, $t_r = t - \\dfrac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|}{c}$. This accounts for the finite time it takes for the electromagnetic signal to travel from the source point $\\vec{r'}$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$ at the speed of light $c$.\n\n2.  **Point Charge Densities:** For a single point charge $q$ moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge and current densities can be represented using the Dirac delta function:\n    $\\rho(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\cdot \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r'}, t') = q \\cdot \\vec{v}(t') \\cdot \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\vec{v}(t') = \\dfrac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}$.\n\n3.  **Substituting into Potential Integrals:** We substitute these densities into the potential formulas. For the scalar potential V:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{q \\cdot \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n    Here, $t_r = t - \\dfrac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|}{c}$. The integral is over the spatial variable $\\vec{r'}$. The delta function constrains $\\vec{r'}$ to be the position of the charge, $\\vec{s}(t_r)$. However, the retarded time $t_r$ itself depends on $\\vec{r'}$, which complicates the direct evaluation of the integral.\n\n4.  **Evaluating the Integral:** The standard procedure to evaluate this integral involves a careful change of variables or by considering the apparent volume of the moving charge due to the retardation effect. This yields a crucial correction factor in the denominator. The result of this non-trivial integration (a standard result in advanced electrodynamics) is:\n    $\\int \\dfrac{\\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r' = \\left[ \\dfrac{1}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}|(1 - \\frac{(\\vec{r}-\\vec{s})\\cdot\\vec{v}}{|\\vec{r}-\\vec{s}|c})} \\right]_{t_r}$\n    The subscript $t_r$ indicates that all quantities inside the brackets (position $\\vec{s}$ and velocity $\\vec{v}$) must be evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n5.  **Using the Problem's Notation:** The problem defines:\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$: the vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$: the distance from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n    *   $\\vec{v}$: the velocity of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n    With this notation, the denominator term becomes:\n    $d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{dc}) = d - \\dfrac{\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c} = \\dfrac{dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c}$\n\n6.  **Final Expressions for V and A:**\n    Substituting this result back into the expression for V:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{1}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o(dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})}$\n\n    A similar procedure is followed for the vector potential $\\vec{A}$:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}(t_r) \\cdot \\delta^3(\\vec{r'} - \\vec{s}(t_r))}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'$\n    The integration yields:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o q c \\vec{v}}{4\\pi(dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})}$\n\n7.  **Comparing with Options:** The derived expressions for V and $\\vec{A}$ are:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    $\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n    These expressions match exactly with option B. The other options are incorrect. Option A and D use the static potential form, ignoring retardation effects correctly. Option C has an incorrect sign in the denominator. The minus sign in $(dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})$ is crucial and arises from the Doppler-like effect on the fields from a moving source.\n\n<<<B>>>"
