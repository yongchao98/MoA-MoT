    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Goal:** The objective is to find a mutation that will *most probably* eliminate an anti-nutritional compound. This means we are looking for a mutation that is most likely to result in a non-functional protein (enzyme) responsible for synthesizing the compound.\n\n2.  **Types of Mutations and Their Effects:**\n    *   **Silent Mutation:** A change in the DNA sequence that does not change the amino acid sequence. This has no effect on the protein.\n    *   **Missense Mutation:** A change in the DNA sequence that results in a different amino acid being incorporated. This might affect protein function, but it could also have little or no effect. Its impact is uncertain.\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** A change in the DNA sequence that results in a premature STOP codon. This truncates the protein, and if it occurs early in the gene, it almost always results in a completely non-functional protein.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides not divisible by three. This alters the reading frame of the gene, scrambling all subsequent amino acids and often leading to a premature stop codon. This also almost always results in a non-functional protein.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Intact Gene Sequence:**\n    Let's first translate the beginning of the intact gene's coding sequence to establish a baseline. The gene is read in triplets (codons) starting from `ATG`.\n    *   **Sequence:** 5’-**ATG TTT CTC GCT**...-3’\n    *   **Translation:**\n        *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Met)\n        *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (Phe)\n        *   `CTC` -> Leucine (Leu)\n        *   `GCT` -> Alanine (Ala)\n    *   **Original Protein Start:** Met-Phe-Leu-Ala... This is the functional protein we want to disable.\n\n4.  **Analyzing the Mutant Sequences:**\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:**\n        *   **Sequence:** 5’-**ATG TTC TAC GCT**...-3’\n        *   **Changes:** The second codon changes from `TTT` to `TTC`, and the third codon changes from `CTC` to `TAC`.\n        *   **Translation:**\n            *   `ATG` -> Met\n            *   `TTC` -> Phenylalanine (Phe). (Note: `TTT` and `TTC` both code for Phe, so this part is a silent mutation).\n            *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Tyr). (Note: `CTC` [Leu] becomes `TAC` [Tyr]).\n        *   **Effect:** This is a **missense mutation**, changing Leucine to Tyrosine. This might inactivate the protein, but it is not guaranteed.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:**\n        *   **Sequence:** 5’-**ATG TTC TAA GCT**...-3’\n        *   **Changes:** The second codon changes from `TTT` to `TTC`, and the third codon changes from `CTC` to `TAA`.\n        *   **Translation:**\n            *   `ATG` -> Met\n            *   `TTC` -> Phenylalanine (Phe). (Silent mutation).\n            *   `TAA` -> **STOP**.\n        *   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. It introduces a premature stop codon. The protein synthesis will stop after just two amino acids. The resulting `Met-Phe` peptide is far too short to be functional. This will almost certainly eliminate the compound.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:**\n        *   **Sequence:** 5’-**ATG TTT TAC GCT**...-3’\n        *   **Changes:** The third codon `CTC` changes to `TAC`.\n        *   **Translation:** `ATG` (Met) -> `TTT` (Phe) -> `TAC` (Tyr).\n        *   **Effect:** This is a **missense mutation**, the same type as in Mutant 1. It is not the most reliable way to disable the protein.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:**\n        *   **Sequence:** 5’-**ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT**...-3’\n        *   **Changes:** The provided sequence seems to show a deletion. Let's compare to the intact gene:\n            *   Intact: ... `CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT` ...\n            *   Mutant 4: ... `TAC GCT --- ACT TCT` ...\n            It appears the codon `GGT` has been deleted (an in-frame deletion) and there's also a `CTC` -> `TAC` missense mutation. An in-frame deletion removes an amino acid but keeps the rest of the protein sequence correct. Like a missense mutation, this may or may not inactivate the protein.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The question asks which mutation will *most probably* eliminate the compound. Comparing the effects:\n    *   Mutants 1, 3, and 4 cause missense mutations or in-frame deletions, which might inactivate the protein but don't guarantee it.\n    *   Mutant 2 causes a nonsense mutation, introducing a stop codon very early in the sequence. This leads to a severely truncated, non-functional protein. This is the most reliable and probable method for eliminating the protein's function among the choices provided.\n\n<<<C>>>"
