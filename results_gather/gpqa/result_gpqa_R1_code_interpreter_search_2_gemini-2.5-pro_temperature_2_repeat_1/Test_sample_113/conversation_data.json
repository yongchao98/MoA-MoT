    "*   **Analysis of the first reaction:**\n    *   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    *   This is the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN⁻ from NaCN) attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This opens the π-bond of the C=O group, forming an alkoxide intermediate.\n    *   CH₃-CO-CH₂-CH₃ + CN⁻ ---> CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃\n    *   This alkoxide intermediate is then protonated to form the final stable product, a hydroxyl group (-OH). Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺).\n    *   CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃ + H⁺ ---> CH₃-C(OH)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃ (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile)\n    *   An acidic medium, represented by H₃O⁺, provides the necessary protons for this step. While reacting NaCN directly with a strong acid is hazardous (produces HCN gas), the reaction is typically performed by either generating HCN in situ with a mineral acid or, more commonly, by an acidic workup after the initial nucleophilic addition. Therefore, H₃O⁺ is the correct representation for the proton source A.\n    *   NaHSO₃ is used to form crystalline bisulfite addition products, which is a different reaction used for purification, not for cyanohydrin synthesis.\n    *   Therefore, **A = H₃O⁺**.\n\n*   **Analysis of the second reaction:**\n    *   **Reaction:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n    *   This reaction shows the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   **Mechanism:** This transformation is called nitrile hydrolysis. It can be catalyzed by either strong acid or strong base in the presence of water and heat.\n    *   In acid-catalyzed hydrolysis (what is shown in the options), the nitrile is heated with a strong aqueous acid like HCl or H₂SO₄. Water acts as the nucleophile, and the reaction proceeds through an amide intermediate to yield the carboxylic acid and an ammonium ion.\n    *   R-C≡N + 2 H₂O + H⁺ ---> R-COOH + NH₄⁺\n    *   Comparing the options for reagent B:\n        *   **HCl (Hydrochloric acid)** is a strong acid and is a standard reagent used for the hydrolysis of nitriles.\n        *   **CH₃COOH (Acetic acid)** is a weak acid. It is generally not strong enough to effectively catalyze the complete hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid under typical laboratory conditions.\n    *   Therefore, the most suitable reagent B is **HCl**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, the correct reagent for the first reaction (A) is H₃O⁺, and the correct reagent for the second reaction (B) is HCl.\n    *   This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
