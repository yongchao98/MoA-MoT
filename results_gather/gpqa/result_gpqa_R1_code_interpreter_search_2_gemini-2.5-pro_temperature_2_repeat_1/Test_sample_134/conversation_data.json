    "The reasoning process to determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson X is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Interaction:** The problem provides the interaction Lagrangian between a bosonic field X and a fermionic field $\\psi_f$:\n    $$ \\mathcal{L}_{int} = -\\lambda_f \\bar{\\psi}_f (v + X) \\psi_f = -\\lambda_f v \\bar{\\psi}_f \\psi_f - \\lambda_f X \\bar{\\psi}_f \\psi_f $$\n    The term $- \\lambda_f X \\bar{\\psi}_f \\psi_f$ describes the interaction vertex responsible for the decay of the boson X into a fermion-antifermion pair ($f\\bar{f}$). This means that if kinematically allowed, the boson X can decay via the channel $X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$.\n\n2.  **State the Kinematic Condition:** A decay process is kinematically allowed only if the mass of the initial decaying particle is greater than the sum of the masses of the final state particles.\n    *   Initial particle: Boson X with mass $M_X = 6$ GeV.\n    *   Final particles: A fermion $f$ and its corresponding antiparticle $\\bar{f}$. A particle and its antiparticle have identical mass, so $m_f = m_{\\bar{f}}$.\n    *   The kinematic condition is: $M_X > m_f + m_{\\bar{f}}$.\n    *   Substituting the masses, we get: $M_X > 2m_f$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Given Mass:** We are given $M_X = 6$ GeV. The condition becomes:\n    $$ 6 \\text{ GeV} > 2m_f $$\n    Dividing by 2, we find the condition for the mass of the fermion $f$:\n    $$ m_f < 3 \\text{ GeV} $$\n    Therefore, the boson X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair ($f\\bar{f}$) where the mass of the fermion $f$ is less than 3 GeV.\n\n4.  **Check Masses of Fundamental Fermions:** We now need to check the masses of all fundamental fermions (quarks and leptons) to see which ones satisfy the condition $m_f < 3$ GeV. The approximate masses are:\n\n    *   **Leptons:**\n        *   Electron ($e$): $m_e \\approx 0.000511$ GeV. ($0.000511 < 3$) $\\implies$ **Allowed** ($X \\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$).\n        *   Muon ($\\mu$): $m_{\\mu} \\approx 0.1057$ GeV. ($0.1057 < 3$) $\\implies$ **Allowed** ($X \\rightarrow \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$).\n        *   Tau ($\\tau$): $m_{\\tau} \\approx 1.777$ GeV. ($1.777 < 3$) $\\implies$ **Allowed** ($X \\rightarrow \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$).\n\n    *   **Quarks:**\n        *   Up ($u$): $m_u \\approx 0.0022$ GeV. ($0.0022 < 3$) $\\implies$ **Allowed** ($X \\rightarrow u\\bar{u}$).\n        *   Down ($d$): $m_d \\approx 0.0047$ GeV. ($0.0047 < 3$) $\\implies$ **Allowed** ($X \\rightarrow d\\bar{d}$).\n        *   Strange ($s$): $m_s \\approx 0.095$ GeV. ($0.095 < 3$) $\\implies$ **Allowed** ($X \\rightarrow s\\bar{s}$).\n        *   Charm ($c$): $m_c \\approx 1.27$ GeV. ($1.27 < 3$) $\\implies$ **Allowed** ($X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}$).\n        *   Bottom ($b$): $m_b \\approx 4.18$ GeV. ($4.18 > 3$) $\\implies$ **Not Allowed**.\n        *   Top ($t$): $m_t \\approx 173$ GeV. ($173 > 3$) $\\implies$ **Not Allowed**.\n\n5.  **Compile the List and Compare with Options:**\n    The complete list of kinematically allowed decay channels is:\n    $X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}, s\\bar{s}, u\\bar{u}, d\\bar{d}, \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}, \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}, e^{+}e^{-}$\n\n    Now let's compare this list with the given options:\n    *   A) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ (Incorrect: includes disallowed $b\\bar{b}$ and misses $c\\bar{c}, \\mu^+\\mu^-$)\n    *   B) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ (Correct: matches our list exactly)\n    *   C) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ (Incorrect: includes disallowed $b\\bar{b}$ and misses $c\\bar{c}$)\n    *   D) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},t\\bar{t},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ (Incorrect: includes disallowed $t\\bar{t}$)\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
