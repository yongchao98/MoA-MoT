    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning for each reaction:\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Michael Donor:** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of a strong base like sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic α-proton between the two carbonyl groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate ion, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, (p-tolyl)-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon (the one attached to the p-tolyl group) is electrophilic.\n*   **Reaction:** The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate in a Michael addition (1,4-conjugate addition).\n    1.  `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` attacks `(p-tolyl)-CᵦH=CαH-COOCH₃`.\n    2.  A new C-C bond forms between the malonate carbon and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    3.  The double bond shifts, and an intermediate enolate is formed at the α-position: `(p-tolyl)-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - C⁻H-COOCH₃`.\n    4.  This enolate is protonated during workup (by the ethanol solvent) to give the final product.\n*   **Product A Structure:** The final product has the structure `(p-tolyl)-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n*   **Naming Product A:** Let's analyze the names given in the options.\n    *   The options use a `propane-tricarboxylate` nomenclature. We need to find the name that matches our product's structure.\n    *   Let's draw the structure for `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate` (from option B). The name implies a propane (3-carbon) backbone. The substituents are: two methoxycarbonyl groups at C1 (`-CH(COOCH₃)₂`), a p-tolyl group at C2 (`-CH(p-tolyl)-`), and one methoxycarbonyl group at C3 (`-CH₂(COOCH₃)`). Assembling these fragments gives `(MeOOC)CH₂ - CH(p-tolyl) - CH(COOCH₃)₂`. This matches our derived product structure.\n    *   Let's draw `trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate` (from option A). This implies a different connectivity: `p-tolyl-CH₂ - CH(COOMe) - CH(COOMe)₂`. This structure does not match our product.\n    *   Therefore, the correct name for product A is `trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate`.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Michael Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine of cyclohexanone. Enamines are nucleophilic at the β-carbon (C2 of the cyclohexene ring). This is a key step in the Stork enamine alkylation.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), CH₃-CH=CH-CN. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n*   **Reaction:**\n    1.  The nucleophilic β-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    2.  This forms an iminium ion intermediate and a nitrile-stabilized carbanion, which is then protonated.\n    3.  The crucial step is the workup with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). This hydrolyzes the iminium ion intermediate back into a carbonyl group.\n*   **Product B Structure:** The overall result is the alkylation of cyclohexanone at the α-position (C2). The alkylating group is derived from the but-2-enenitrile, becoming `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`. So, the product is a cyclohexanone ring with a `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group attached to the carbon next to the carbonyl group.\n*   **Naming Product B:** The product is a substituted butanenitrile. Numbering the nitrile chain from the cyano group (`CN`=1), the cyclohexanone ring is at position 3. The substituent is a `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group. Thus, the name is `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`. The keto form (`C=O`) is the stable tautomer, not the enol form (`C=C-OH`) given in options A and C.\n*   Therefore, product B is `3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile`.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   This is a retrosynthesis problem. We are given the product and one reactant, and we need to find the other reactant (C).\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** But-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃.\n*   **Analysis:** The product is formed by adding reactant C to but-3-en-2-one. In a Michael addition, the nucleophile (enolate of C) adds to the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated system.\n    1.  The fragment `-(CH₂)CH₂C(=O)CH₃` in the product comes from the acceptor, MVK (`CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`). The C-C bond was formed at the β-carbon, which is the `CH₂` end of this fragment.\n    2.  The nucleophile must have been the rest of the molecule: the enolate of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`.\n    3.  `Cyclohexane-1,3-dione` has very acidic protons on the CH₂ group between the two ketones (C2). The base (KOH) deprotonates this carbon to form a potent nucleophile.\n    4.  This nucleophile attacks MVK to form the product.\n*   **Reactant C:** Therefore, reactant C is `cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. While it exists largely as its enol tautomer, the standard name for the compound is the diketone form.\n\n### Conclusion:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination corresponds exactly to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
