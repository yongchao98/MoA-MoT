    "**Detailed Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction I:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n        *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n        *   Numbering from the ethyl end: C1 is the terminal methyl, C3 is the carbonyl carbon, and C5 is the carbon with the methoxy group.\n        *   There is a pre-existing stereocenter at C5, and its configuration is specified as (S). This compound is chiral.\n    *   **Reaction:** Reduction of a ketone with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup. LAH reduces the carbonyl group (C=O) at C3 to a hydroxyl group (-OH), forming a secondary alcohol.\n    *   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The reduction of the prochiral carbonyl carbon at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting material is chiral (due to the (S) center at C5), the attack of the hydride ion (from the achiral LAH) on the two faces of the carbonyl group will produce two different products.\n        *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol\n        *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol\n    *   These two products have the same configuration at C5 but different configurations at C3. Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction II:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n        *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n        *   This molecule is symmetrical and **achiral**.\n    *   **Reaction:** Reduction of a dione with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ will reduce both carbonyl groups to hydroxyl groups.\n    *   **Product:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. We need to analyze all possible stereoisomers.\n        *   The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n        *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They constitute a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, they will be formed as a racemic mixture.\n        *   Let's consider the (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) isomers. Due to the symmetry of the molecule (the groups on C2 and C4 are identical), (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) designation describes the exact same meso compound.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces three stereoisomers: a pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and one meso compound.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Combined Product Mixture:**\n    The final mixture, before being injected into the HPLC, contains all the products from both reactions. There are a total of 5 distinct stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n4.  **Determine the Number of Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   Normal-phase HPLC is an **achiral** separation technique. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Constitutional isomers and diastereomers have different physical properties and thus can be separated.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will co-elute, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   Let's analyze the 5 products:\n        *   The products from Reaction I ((1) and (2)) are **diastereomers**. They will be separated, giving **2 peaks**.\n        *   The products from Reaction II ((3), (4), and (5)):\n            *   (3) and (4) are **enantiomers**. They will not be separated and will give **1 peak**.\n            *   (5) is a **meso compound**, which is a diastereomer of (3) and (4). It has different physical properties and will be separated from the peak of (3) and (4), giving another **1 peak**.\n            *   So, the products of Reaction II give a total of **2 peaks**.\n        *   Finally, we must consider if the products from Reaction I will co-elute with the products from Reaction II. The products from Reaction I are 5-methoxyhexane-3-ols (C₇H₁₆O₂), while the products from Reaction II are pentane-2,4-diols (C₅H₁₂O₂). These are **constitutional isomers** with different molecular formulas, structures, and polarities. They will be easily separated from each other.\n        *   Therefore, the total number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC is the sum of peaks from Reaction I products and Reaction II products: 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This allows for the separation of **all stereoisomers**, including enantiomers. The chiral stationary phase interacts differently with each stereoisomer, leading to different retention times.\n    *   We have 5 distinct stereoisomeric compounds in our mixture:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexane-3-ol (Diastereomer of 1)\n        3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Enantiomer of 3)\n        5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (Diastereomer of 3 and 4)\n    *   Since all five compounds are stereochemically distinct and will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, they will all be resolved.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram from the chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
