    "Here's my thinking process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    I first need to understand the conditions under which a star can be observed by two specific instruments: ESPRESSO at Paranal Observatory and HIRES at Keck Observatory. The problem gives two primary types of constraints:\n    *   **Geographical/Positional:** The star must be visible from the location of both observatories.\n    *   **Brightness:** The star's apparent V magnitude must be brighter than the detection limit of each instrument.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Constraints in Detail:**\n\n    *   **Positional Constraint (Observability):**\n        *   The problem states to disregard pointing limits and telescope altitudes, simplifying the calculation. A star is generally considered visible from an observatory if it rises above the horizon at some point.\n        *   Keck Observatory is in the Northern Hemisphere. From the provided link, its latitude is approximately 19.8° N. For an object to be visible (rise above the horizon), its declination (DEC) must be greater than the observatory's co-latitude in the south. So, DEC > (19.8° - 90°) = -70.2°.\n        *   Paranal Observatory is in the Southern Hemisphere. The link shows its latitude is approximately 24.6° S. For an object to be visible, its declination must be less than the observatory's co-latitude in the north. So, DEC < (90° - 24.6°) = 65.4°.\n        *   **Combined Positional Rule:** For a star to be visible from *both* observatories, its declination must be within the range: **-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°**.\n\n    *   **Brightness Constraint (Apparent Magnitude):**\n        *   ESPRESSO (Paranal): Can observe stars with apparent V magnitude (let's call it `m_V`) brighter than 17 mag. This means `m_V < 17`.\n        *   HIRES (Keck): Can observe stars with `m_V` brighter than 16 mag. This means `m_V < 16`.\n        *   **Combined Brightness Rule:** To be detected by *both*, the star must satisfy the stricter of the two limits. Therefore, the star's apparent V magnitude must be **`m_V < 16`**.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Star Against the Constraints:**\n    Now I will go through each star one by one, checking its position and then its brightness. For brightness, I may need to calculate the apparent magnitude (`m_V`) from the absolute magnitude (`M_V`) and distance (`d`) using the distance modulus formula: `m_V = M_V + 5*log10(d/10pc) + A_V`. The term `A_V` represents interstellar absorption (extinction), which is given by `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`.\n\n    *   **Star 1:**\n        *   **Position:** DEC = -75°. This is outside the required range (-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°). It's too far south to be seen from Keck.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Star 1 cannot be observed by both. **Eliminated.**\n\n    *   **Star 2:**\n        *   **Position:** DEC = +55°. This is within the required range. It's visible from both observatories.\n        *   **Brightness:** The apparent V magnitude is given directly as `m_V = 16.5` mag.\n        *   Checking against the brightness rule: Is `16.5 < 16`? No.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Star 2 is not bright enough for HIRES. **Eliminated.**\n\n    *   **Star 3:**\n        *   **Position:** DEC = +48°. This is within the required range. Visible from both.\n        *   **Brightness:** The apparent V magnitude is given as `m_V = 15.5` mag. The problem also provides `E(B-V) = 0.6`, but \"apparent magnitude\" refers to the brightness as observed from Earth, which already includes the effects of any absorption. Therefore, I should use the given value.\n        *   Checking against the brightness rule: Is `15.5 < 16`? Yes.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Star 3 meets both the position and brightness criteria. **Viable Candidate.**\n\n    *   **Star 4:**\n        *   **Position:** DEC = -48°. This is within the required range. Visible from both.\n        *   **Brightness:** I need to calculate the apparent magnitude `m_V`.\n            *   `M_V` = 15.5 mag\n            *   `d` = 10 pc\n            *   `E(B-V)` = 0.4 mag, so `A_V` = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag.\n            *   `m_V = M_V + 5*log10(d/10pc) + A_V`\n            *   `m_V = 15.5 + 5*log10(10/10) + 1.24 = 15.5 + 5*log10(1) + 1.24 = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = 16.74` mag.\n        *   Checking against the brightness rule: Is `16.74 < 16`? No.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Star 4 is not bright enough for HIRES. **Eliminated.**\n\n    *   **Star 5:**\n        *   **Position:** DEC = +60°. This is within the required range. Visible from both.\n        *   **Brightness:** I need to calculate the apparent magnitude `m_V`.\n            *   `M_V` = 16.5 mag\n            *   `d` = 5 pc\n            *   No extinction mentioned, so `A_V` = 0.\n            *   `m_V = M_V + 5*log10(d) - 5`\n            *   `m_V = 16.5 + 5*log10(5) - 5`\n            *   Using a calculator, `log10(5) ≈ 0.699`.\n            *   `m_V = 16.5 + 5*(0.699) - 5 = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = 14.995` mag.\n        *   Checking against the brightness rule: Is `14.995 < 16`? Yes.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Star 5 meets both the position and brightness criteria. **Viable Candidate.**\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The stars that satisfy all conditions are Star 3 and Star 5. I will now look for the option that pairs these two stars. Option C is \"Star3 and Star5\".\n\nI'll write a Python script to verify these calculations precisely.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_and_check_stars():\n    # --- Observational Constraints ---\n    keck_lat = 19.8  # Latitude of Keck Observatory in degrees (North)\n    paranal_lat = -24.6 # Latitude of Paranal Observatory in degrees (South)\n\n    # Visibility limits based on declination (DEC)\n    # For Keck (Northern Hemisphere): DEC > lat - 90\n    keck_dec_min = keck_lat - 90\n    # For Paranal (Southern Hemisphere): DEC < 90 + lat\n    paranal_dec_max = 90 + paranal_lat\n\n    # Brightness limits for apparent V magnitude (m_V)\n    espresso_limit = 17.0\n    hires_limit = 16.0\n    # The combined limit is the stricter one\n    combined_mag_limit = min(espresso_limit, hires_limit)\n    \n    # --- Star Data ---\n    stars = {\n        \"Star1\": {\"DEC\": -75, \"M_V\": 15.5, \"d\": 10, \"E(B-V)\": 0},\n        \"Star2\": {\"DEC\": 55, \"m_V\": 16.5}, # m_V is given directly\n        \"Star3\": {\"DEC\": 48, \"m_V\": 15.5}, # m_V is given directly\n        \"Star4\": {\"DEC\": -48, \"M_V\": 15.5, \"d\": 10, \"E(B-V)\": 0.4},\n        \"Star5\": {\"DEC\": 60, \"M_V\": 16.5, \"d\": 5, \"E(B-V)\": 0}\n    }\n    \n    observable_stars = []\n\n    print(\"--- Analysis ---\")\n    for name, data in stars.items():\n        # Step 1: Check Positional (Declination) Constraint\n        dec = data[\"DEC\"]\n        is_visible_from_keck = dec > keck_dec_min\n        is_visible_from_paranal = dec < paranal_dec_max\n        is_visible_from_both = is_visible_from_keck and is_visible_from_paranal\n        \n        print(f\"\\n{name}:\")\n        print(f\"  DEC = {dec} deg\")\n        print(f\"  Keck visibility requires DEC > {keck_dec_min:.1f}.

    "To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, we must check two conditions for each star:\n1.  **Positional Visibility:** The star must be observable from the location of both observatories.\n2.  **Brightness:** The star's apparent V magnitude (`m_V`) must be brighter than the detection limit of both instruments.\n\n**1. Positional Visibility Constraint**\n\nA star is visible from an observatory if its declination (DEC) allows it to rise above the horizon.\n*   **Keck Observatory (Northern Hemisphere):** Located at a latitude of approximately +19.8° N. For a star to be visible, its declination must be greater than the observatory's latitude minus 90°.\n    `DEC > 19.8° - 90°`\n    `DEC > -70.2°`\n*   **Paranal Observatory (Southern Hemisphere):** Located at a latitude of approximately -24.6° S. For a star to be visible, its declination must be less than the observatory's latitude plus 90°.\n    `DEC < -24.6° + 90°`\n    `DEC < +65.4°`\n*   **Combined Rule:** For a star to be visible from both observatories, its declination must be in the range: **-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°**.\n\n**2. Brightness Constraint**\n\nThe star must be bright enough for both instruments.\n*   **ESPRESSO limit:** `m_V < 17`\n*   **HIRES limit:** `m_V < 16`\n*   **Combined Rule:** To be detected by both, the star must satisfy the stricter limit: **`m_V < 16`**.\n\nNow let's evaluate each star.\n\n**Star1**\n*   **Position:** DEC = -75°. This is not greater than -70.2°, so it is **not visible from Keck**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Eliminated.\n\n**Star2**\n*   **Position:** DEC = +55°. This is within the range (-70.2° to +65.4°), so it is visible from both.\n*   **Brightness:** `m_V = 16.5`. This is not less than 16, so it is **too faint for HIRES**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Eliminated.\n\n**Star3**\n*   **Position:** DEC = +48°. This is within the visible range.\n*   **Brightness:** The apparent magnitude is given as `m_V = 15.5`. This is less than 16.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Observable by both.**\n\n**Star4**\n*   **Position:** DEC = -48°. This is within the visible range.\n*   **Brightness:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude `m_V`. The formula relating apparent magnitude (`m_V`), absolute magnitude (`M_V`), distance (`d` in parsecs), and absorption (`A_V`) is `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d/10) + A_V`.\n    *   `M_V` = 15.5\n    *   `d` = 10 pc\n    *   `A_V` = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag\n    *   `m_V` = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10/10) + 1.24 = 15.5 + 5 * log10(1) + 1.24 = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = **16.74**\n    *   This is not less than 16, so it is **too faint for HIRES**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Eliminated.\n\n**Star5**\n*   **Position:** DEC = +60°. This is within the visible range.\n*   **Brightness:** We calculate `m_V`.\n    *   `M_V` = 16.5\n    *   `d` = 5 pc\n    *   No absorption is mentioned, so `A_V` = 0.\n    *   `m_V` = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5/10) + 0 = 16.5 + 5 * log10(0.5) = 16.5 + 5 * (-0.301) ≈ 16.5 - 1.5 = **15.0**\n    *   This is less than 16.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Observable by both.**\n\nThe stars that satisfy both conditions are Star3 and Star5.\n\n<<<C>>>"
