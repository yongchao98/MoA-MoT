    "To solve this problem, we need to find the partition function Z for a system of three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each spin can take a value of either +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by the Hamiltonian:\n\nE = -J [S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3]\n\nThe partition function, Z, is defined as the sum over all possible states (configurations) of the system of the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), where β = 1/(kT).\n\nZ = Σ_states e^(-βE)\n\nSince there are three spins and each can take two values, there are a total of 2^3 = 8 possible states for the system. We will calculate the energy for each state.\n\nThe possible spin configurations are:\n1.  All spins are aligned in the same direction.\n    *   State (+1, +1, +1): S1=1, S2=1, S3=1\n        E1 = -J [(1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J (1 + 1 + 1) = -3J\n    *   State (-1, -1, -1): S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1\n        E2 = -J [(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J (1 + 1 + 1) = -3J\n    There are 2 states with energy E = -3J.\n\n2.  Two spins are aligned in one direction, and one is in the opposite direction.\n    *   One spin is -1, and two are +1. There are three such configurations:\n        *   (+1, +1, -1): S1=1, S2=1, S3=-1\n            E3 = -J [(1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J (1 - 1 - 1) = J\n        *   (+1, -1, +1): S1=1, S2=-1, S3=1\n            E4 = -J [(1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1)] = -J (-1 + 1 - 1) = J\n        *   (-1, +1, +1): S1=-1, S2=1, S3=1\n            E5 = -J [(-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J (-1 - 1 + 1) = J\n    *   One spin is +1, and two are -1. There are three such configurations:\n        *   (+1, -1, -1): S1=1, S2=-1, S3=-1\n            E6 = -J [(1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J (-1 - 1 + 1) = J\n        *   (-1, +1, -1): S1=-1, S2=1, S3=-1\n            E7 = -J [(-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J (-1 + 1 - 1) = J\n        *   (-1, -1, +1): S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=1\n            E8 = -J [(-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1)] = -J (1 - 1 - 1) = J\n    There are 6 states with energy E = J.\n\nNow we can write the partition function by summing the Boltzmann factors for all 8 states. We can group the states by their energy levels. The partition function Z is given by:\n\nZ = Σ_i g_i * e^(-βE_i)\n\nwhere g_i is the degeneracy (number of states) of the energy level E_i.\n\nIn our system, we have two energy levels:\n*   E1 = -3J with degeneracy g1 = 2\n*   E2 = J with degeneracy g2 = 6\n\nSo, the partition function is:\n\nZ = g1 * e^(-βE1) + g2 * e^(-βE2)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2 * e^(3Jβ) + 6 * e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\nB) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\nC) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\nD) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\n\nOur calculated partition function Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ) matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
