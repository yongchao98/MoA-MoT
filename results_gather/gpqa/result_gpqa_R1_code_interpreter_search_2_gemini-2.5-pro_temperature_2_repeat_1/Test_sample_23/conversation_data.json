    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   We are given that substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   The general formula for a hydrocarbon is C_n H_m.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by: `mass % H = (m * Ar(H)) / (n * Ar(C) + m * Ar(H))`, where `Ar` is the atomic mass.\n*   Using integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1) for simplicity, the formula becomes: `mass % H = m / (12n + m)`.\n*   Let's test the formula for saturated alkanes (C_n H_{2n+2}) and cycloalkanes/alkenes (C_n H_{2n}).\n    *   For a saturated cycloalkane (general formula C_n H_{2n}):\n        Mass fraction H = `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857`.\n        This value, 14.2857%, is extremely close to the given 14.28%.\n*   We are also told that Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This confirms that Z must be a saturated hydrocarbon. A compound with the formula C_n H_{2n} that is saturated must be a cycloalkane.\n*   Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the general formula C_n H_{2n}.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Carbon Skeleton**\n\n*   The problem states that hydrogenation of both mixture X (containing liquids A and B) and mixture Y (containing liquids C and D) yields *only* substance Z.\n*   This is a critical clue. It means that all four compounds (A, B, C, and D) share the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n*   Z is described as a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvents are based on a six-membered ring (cyclohexane) or a seven-membered ring system (methylcyclohexane, derived from toluene). Let's evaluate the simplest case.\n*   Let's assume the carbon skeleton is a six-membered ring. This means n=6.\n    *   Z = Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D, and it does not decolorize bromine water. This indicates C and D are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Z is a component of mixture Y. Let's set D = Z = Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Cyclohexane is saturated and does not decolorize bromine water.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y (C + D) gives only Z (cyclohexane). Since D is already cyclohexane, compound C must also hydrogenate to give cyclohexane.\n*   C must be a C₆ compound that has a cyclohexane skeleton, does not decolorize bromine water, and is a liquid. The perfect candidate is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is unreactive with bromine water under normal conditions and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane.\n*   So, Mixture Y = {Benzene (C₆H₆), Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)}.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Components of Mixture X and the Reaction**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B. It undergoes a disproportionation reaction on heating with Platinum to form the equimolar mixture Y.\n*   A + B --(Pt, heat)--> C + D\n*   Substituting the identities of C and D:\n    A + B --> Benzene (C₆H₆) + Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)\n*   This reaction is an intermolecular hydrogen transfer. For the atoms to balance, the total number of carbon and hydrogen atoms on both sides must be equal. Since both A and B have the C₆ skeleton, the carbons are balanced. For hydrogen:\n    (H atoms in A) + (H atoms in B) = (H atoms in Benzene) + (H atoms in Cyclohexane)\n    (H atoms in A) + (H atoms in B) = 6 + 12 = 18.\n*   The question asks for \"the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\", which corresponds to this sum. The answer should be 18.\n\n**Step 5: Verify the Properties of Mixture X**\n\n*   Let's identify plausible structures for A and B. We need two C₆ compounds with a cyclohexane skeleton whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18. They must both decolorize bromine water (i.e., contain double bonds) and have no conjugated double bonds.\n*   A plausible pair is:\n    *   **A = Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**. It has one double bond.\n    *   **B = 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**. It has two non-conjugated double bonds.\n*   Let's check if this pair fits all conditions:\n    *   Both are C₆ liquids at room temperature.\n    *   The sum of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both will decolorize bromine water due to the presence of C=C double bonds.\n    *   Hydrogenation of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀ + H₂) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈ + 2H₂) both produce cyclohexane (Z). This matches.\n    *   1,4-cyclohexadiene does not have conjugated double bonds (unlike its isomer, 1,3-cyclohexadiene).\n    *   The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ --> C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a known catalytic hydrogen transfer reaction, fitting the description of a disproportionation. One molecule is hydrogenated (reduced) while the other is dehydrogenated (oxidized).\n\nThe entire set of conditions is met with this C₆ system. The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>"
