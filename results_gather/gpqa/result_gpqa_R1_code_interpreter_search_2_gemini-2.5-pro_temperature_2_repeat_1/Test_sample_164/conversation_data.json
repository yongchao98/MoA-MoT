    "Here's my reasoning process to determine the correct statement:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** The core chemical challenge is to create a polyethylene polymer with regular branches using *only ethylene* as the starting material.\n    *   Standard polyethylene (High-Density Polyethylene, HDPE) is linear. `n CH2=CH2 -> -(CH2-CH2)n-`.\n    *   Standard branched polyethylene (Linear Low-Density Polyethylene, LLDPE) is made by copolymerizing ethylene with an alpha-olefin like 1-butene or 1-hexene.\n    *   Since only ethylene is allowed as a reactant, a multi-functional catalyst system is needed. One catalyst must perform polymerization, and a second catalyst must create the alpha-olefin comonomer *in situ* from ethylene itself. This process is called tandem catalysis.\n    *   The \"essential additional reaction step\" mentioned by the senior scientist is the selective oligomerization of ethylene. For example: `3 CH2=CH2 -> CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3` (trimerization to 1-hexene).\n    *   This newly formed 1-hexene is then copolymerized with more ethylene by the first catalyst, creating regular butyl branches (`-C4H9`) on the polymer chain.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Statements:**\n\n    *   **Statement D: \"One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.\"**\n        *   Group VIa (or Group 6) of the periodic table includes Chromium (Cr), Molybdenum (Mo), and Tungsten (W).\n        *   The selective trimerization of ethylene to 1-hexene is a well-established and industrially significant reaction. The most famous and effective catalysts for this transformation are based on **Chromium (Cr)**. These systems, often using specific phosphine-based ligands (like PNP-type ligands), are highly selective for 1-hexene.\n        *   Using a Cr-based oligomerization catalyst in tandem with a polymerization catalyst (like a Ziegler-Natta or metallocene type) is the archetypal example of the system the scientist wants to build.\n        *   Therefore, this statement is a precise and fundamental chemical fact directly relevant to solving the problem. It is **correct**.\n\n    *   **Statement A: \"Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.\"**\n        *   The \"essential additional reaction step\" is the oligomerization.\n        *   The Cr-based oligomerization catalysts mentioned above, as well as the polymerization catalysts they are paired with, are typically activated by organoaluminum compounds. The most common activator is methylaluminoxane (MAO) or a modified version (MMAO).\n        *   Since aluminum-based activators are, in fact, crucial for these systems, this statement is **incorrect**.\n\n    *   **Statement C: \"Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.\"**\n        *   Noble metals include Pd, Pt, Rh, etc. Catalysts based on late transition metals like palladium and nickel (nickel isn't noble but is often discussed with them in this context) can polymerize or oligomerize ethylene. For example, Brookhart catalysts based on Pd or Ni are famous for this.\n        *   However, they typically produce hyperbranched structures through a \"chain-walking\" mechanism, which is different from the goal of incorporating *regular* branches by creating a specific comonomer like 1-hexene.\n        *   While they *can* be used for ethylene reactions and are generally more expensive than Cr or Ti catalysts, they are not the primary choice for this specific tandem strategy. The statement is arguably correct in a very general sense but less relevant and precise than Statement D.\n\n    *   **Statement B: \"Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.\"**\n        *   This is a question of industrial fact. Tandem catalysis for producing LLDPE from ethylene alone has indeed been commercialized. Major chemical companies with significant operations in the US, such as Univation Technologies (a joint venture of Dow and ExxonMobil) and Chevron Phillips Chemical, have developed and deployed such technologies (e.g., in the UNIPOL™ process).\n        *   So, this statement is also **correct**.\n\n3.  **Choose the Best Answer:** Both B and D are correct statements. However, the question is posed from the perspective of a scientist looking for a technical solution. Statement D describes the fundamental chemical principle and the key type of catalyst required to achieve the goal (\"*how* to do it\"). Statement B describes the commercial status of the technology (\"it *is being* done\"). In a scientific context, the explanation of the underlying chemical system (D) is the more direct and primary piece of information compared to the commercial fact (B). Statement D explains *why* statement B is true. Therefore, D is the most fitting answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
