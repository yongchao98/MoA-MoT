    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nWe need to identify two compounds from the given list that, when mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio, produce a specific 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**2. Analyze the Provided NMR Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture:** 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe will analyze the symmetry of each compound to predict the number of signals and their splitting patterns. A \"singlet\" signal means the corresponding protons have no adjacent, non-equivalent proton neighbors to cause splitting.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetric. It has two planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They have no proton neighbors, so they will appear as a single **singlet**. Integration: 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are all equivalent due to symmetry. They will appear as a single **singlet**. Integration: 12H.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** No symmetry. All protons are technically in unique environments.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are two protons at positions 4 and 6. Neither has an adjacent proton neighbor. Thus, they will appear as two distinct **singlets**. Integration: 1H each.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 5 are all in different chemical environments. They will produce four distinct **singlets**. Integration: 3H each.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 4 alkyl singlets (3H each).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are adjacent to each other. They will couple (ortho-coupling), producing a **multiplet** (specifically, a pair of doublets), not singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound cannot be in the mixture because it does not produce singlet signals in the aromatic region. This **eliminates options A and C**.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** This molecule has ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). The CH2 protons are adjacent to CH3 protons, so they will be split into a **quartet**. The CH3 protons are adjacent to CH2 protons and will be split into a **triplet**. The problem states all signals in the aliphatic region are singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound cannot be in the mixture. This **eliminates option D**.\n\n**4. Analyze the Remaining Option (B)**\n\nBy elimination, the only possible answer is B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Let's verify if a 1:1 mixture of these two compounds can match the given spectrum.\n\n*   **Compounds:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n*   **Ratio:** 1:1.\n\n**Aromatic Region Analysis:**\n*   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: 1 singlet (integral = 2H).\n*   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: 2 singlets (each with integral = 1H).\n*   In the mixture, we have three potential signals with a relative integration of 2:1:1.\n*   The problem states we observe **two signals** in a **1:1 ratio**. This is possible through \"accidental equivalence\", where signals with different origins happen to have the same chemical shift.\n*   **Plausible Scenario:** The two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene have nearly identical chemical shifts and overlap to appear as a single signal with an integral of 1H + 1H = 2H.\n*   The spectrum would then show:\n    *   Signal 1: The 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n    *   Signal 2: The combined 2H singlet from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n*   This results in two singlets with an integration ratio of 2H:2H, which simplifies to 1:1. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n**Aliphatic Region Analysis:**\n*   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes: 1 singlet (integral = 12H).\n*   1,2,3,5-TMB contributes: 4 singlets (each with integral = 3H).\n*   In the mixture, we have five potential signals with relative integrations of 12:3:3:3:3.\n*   The problem states we observe **three signals** in a **2:1:1 ratio**.\n*   The total number of methyl protons in the 1:1 mixture is 12H + (4 x 3H) = 24H.\n*   A 2:1:1 ratio for a total of 24 protons corresponds to integrals of:\n    *   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n    *   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n*   **Plausible Scenario:**\n    *   The singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene accounts for the 12H signal.\n    *   The four 3H singlets from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene overlap in pairs. Two methyls overlap to form one 6H signal, and the other two methyls overlap to form a second 6H signal.\n*   This combination gives three signals with integrals of 12H, 6H, and 6H, which has a ratio of 2:1:1. This also perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe process of elimination removes options A, C, and D based on fundamental NMR splitting rules. A detailed analysis of option B shows that a 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene can produce the observed spectrum, assuming plausible accidental overlaps of signals, which are common in NMR.\n\n<<<B>>>"
