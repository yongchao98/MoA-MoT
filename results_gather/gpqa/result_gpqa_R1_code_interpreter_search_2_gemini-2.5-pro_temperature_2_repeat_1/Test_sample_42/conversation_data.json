    "Here is my step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the description and draw the structure.**\n    *   The base is a benzene ring.\n    *   The highest priority functional group mentioned is the carboxylic acid (-COOH). According to IUPAC rules, this group defines the parent name of the molecule as **benzoic acid**, and the carbon it is attached to is numbered C1.\n    *   We are told three groups are *meta* to one another: carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), and cyano (-CN). If -COOH is at C1, its meta positions are C3 and C5. Thus, the -CHO and -CN groups are at C3 and C5.\n    *   We are told several groups' positions relative to the carboxylic acid at C1:\n        *   A hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂) are *ortho*. This places them at C2 and C6.\n        *   A methoxy group (-OCH₃) is *para*. This places it at C4.\n    *   So far, the substitution pattern is:\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2/C6: -OH and -N(CH₃)₂\n        *   C3/C5: -CHO and -CN\n        *   C4: -OCH₃\n    *   To resolve the ambiguities, we use the final piece of information: the methoxy (-OCH₃) and the alcohol (-OH) are both *ortho* to the cyano group (-CN).\n        *   Let's assume the -CN group is at C3. The ortho positions to C3 are C2 and C4.\n        *   We already placed the -OCH₃ group at C4, which is consistent.\n        *   For the -OH group to be ortho to C3, it must be at C2.\n        *   This arrangement places the -OH at C2. Consequently, the -N(CH₃)₂ group must be at C6. The -CN is at C3, so the -CHO must be at C5.\n\n2.  **Confirm the final structure.**\n    Let's verify this single, unambiguous structure against all given constraints:\n    *   **C1:** -COOH\n    *   **C2:** -OH (hydroxy)\n    *   **C3:** -CN (cyano)\n    *   **C4:** -OCH₃ (methoxy)\n    *   **C5:** -CHO (formyl)\n    *   **C6:** -N(CH₃)₂ (dimethylamino)\n    *   -COOH(1), -CHO(5), -CN(3) are meta to each other: Yes (1,3,5 relationship).\n    *   -OH(2), -N(CH₃)₂(6) are ortho to -COOH(1): Yes.\n    *   -OCH₃(4) is para to -COOH(1): Yes.\n    *   -OCH₃(4), -OH(2) are ortho to -CN(3): Yes.\n    The structure is correct.\n\n3.  **Apply IUPAC naming rules.**\n    *   **Parent:** The highest priority group is -COOH, so the parent name is `benzoic acid`. C1 is the carbon with the -COOH group.\n    *   **Numbering:** The numbering of the ring must be chosen to give the lowest possible set of locants to the substituents, and if that results in a tie, to give the lowest number to the substituent cited first alphabetically.\n        *   Our determined structure results from a specific numbering (C2=-OH, C3=-CN, etc.). Let's confirm this is the correct IUPAC numbering.\n        *   The substituent locants are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Numbering in the opposite direction would give the same set of locants.\n        *   When locant sets are identical, we alphabetize the prefixes and give the lowest number to the prefix that comes first alphabetically.\n        *   The substituent prefixes in alphabetical order are: `cyano`, `dimethylamino`, `formyl`, `hydroxy`, `methoxy`.\n        *   Our structure assigns `cyano` to position **3**.\n        *   If we numbered the other way, `dimethylamino` would be at C2, `formyl` at C3, `methoxy` at C4, `cyano` at C5, and `hydroxy` at C6. This would assign `cyano` to position **5**.\n        *   Since 3 < 5, the first numbering scheme is correct.\n    *   **Assemble the name:** List the substituent prefixes in alphabetical order, preceded by their locants.\n        *   `cyano` is at C3 -> `3-cyano`\n        *   `dimethylamino` is at C6 -> `6-(dimethylamino)`\n        *   `formyl` is at C5 -> `5-formyl`\n        *   `hydroxy` is at C2 -> `2-hydroxy`\n        *   `methoxy` is at C4 -> `4-methoxy`\n\n4.  **Final Name Construction.**\n    Putting it all together alphabetically:\n    **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options.**\n    *   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - Incorrect numbering.\n    *   B) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - Prefixes are not in alphabetical order.\n    *   C) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - This matches our derived name exactly.\n    *   D) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - Prefixes are not in alphabetical order.\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
