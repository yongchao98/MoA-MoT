    "The user is asking to identify an immunological process based on an experimental setup and its results. Let's break down the key elements of the experiment:\n\n1.  **Antigen:** Rotavirus inner capsid proteins are delivered orally.\n2.  **Site of Immune Response:** Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs in the gut, show fluorescence, indicating the antigen has reached them and is being processed.\n3.  **Cellular Activity:** A \"proliferating cell population\" is isolated from the Peyer's patches. This proliferation is a hallmark of an adaptive immune response, specifically the clonal expansion of B cells (and T cells) that have recognized the antigen.\n4.  **Genetic Analysis:** The \"variable heavy chain gene\" of these proliferating cells is sequenced. The heavy chain gene is a component of the B cell receptor (and the antibody it will secrete).\n5.  **Key Observation:** \"High variability\" is found in this specific gene region.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A) Complement activation:** This is a part of the innate immune system that enhances the ability of antibodies and phagocytic cells to clear microbes and damaged cells. It does not involve any genetic changes in lymphocytes.\n*   **B) Class switching recombination:** This process occurs in activated B cells within germinal centers (found in Peyer's patches). It changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain gene, switching the antibody isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgA or IgG). This affects the antibody's function but does *not* alter the *variable* region, which is responsible for antigen binding. The question specifically mentions variability in the *variable* heavy chain gene.\n*   **C) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a cellular mechanism that occurs in activated B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches. The process deliberately introduces point mutations into the DNA of the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). This creates a pool of B cells with slightly different B cell receptors. Through a process of selection, B cells with mutations that increase their affinity for the antigen are favored to survive and proliferate. This directly results in \"high variability\" in the variable heavy chain genes of the proliferating B cell population and is a key mechanism for affinity maturation of the antibody response. This perfectly matches the observations.\n*   **D) VDJ recombination:** This is the genetic recombination process that assembles the variable region genes of immunoglobulins and T cell receptors during the initial development of lymphocytes (B cells in the bone marrow, T cells in the thymus). It happens *before* the lymphocyte encounters an antigen. While it generates the initial diversity of the B cell repertoire, it is not a process that occurs in an already-activated, proliferating population of cells in a secondary lymphoid organ in response to an antigen. The observed variability is being generated *during* the immune response, not before it.\n\nBased on the evidence—proliferating cells in a secondary lymphoid organ showing high variability specifically in the variable heavy chain gene following antigen exposure—the process described is somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
