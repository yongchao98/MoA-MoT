    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Operator and Direction Vector**\n\n    The problem provides the components of the operator $\\vec{P}$:\n    $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    These are the spin operators for a spin-1/2 particle, where $\\vec{P} = \\vec{S} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\vec{\\sigma}$, with $\\vec{\\sigma}$ being the vector of Pauli matrices.\n\n    The direction vector $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane. In spherical coordinates, this means the azimuthal angle $\\phi=0$. The unit vector $\\vec{n}$ can be written in terms of the polar angle $\\theta$ as:\n    $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$\n    For $\\phi=0$, this becomes:\n    $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$\n\n2.  **Construct the Operator along the Direction $\\vec{n}$**\n\n    The operator representing the component of $\\vec{P}$ along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_{\\vec{n}} = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n    $P_{\\vec{n}} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n    $P_{\\vec{n}} = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_y (0) + P_z \\cos\\theta$\n    $P_{\\vec{n}} = \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\sin\\theta + \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\cos\\theta$\n\n    Combining the matrices:\n    $P_{\\vec{n}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    $P_{\\vec{n}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n3.  **Set Up the Eigenvalue Equation**\n\n    We are looking for the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. Let the eigenvector be represented by the column vector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalue equation is $P_{\\vec{n}}|\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda|\\psi\\rangle$.\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    We can cancel the factor $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ from both sides:\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Solve for the Eigenvector Components**\n\n    The matrix equation gives us a system of two linear equations:\n    1.  $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n    2.  $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\n    Let's solve the first equation for the relationship between $a$ and $b$:\n    $b \\sin\\theta = a - a \\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n\n    Using the half-angle trigonometric identities $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$ and $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$:\n    $b [2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)] = a [2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)]$\n\n    Assuming $\\sin(\\theta/2) \\neq 0$ (i.e., $\\theta \\neq 0, 2\\pi$), we can divide both sides by $2\\sin(\\theta/2)$:\n    $b \\cos(\\theta/2) = a \\sin(\\theta/2)$\n    This gives us the ratio $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$.\n\n    So, any eigenvector must be of the form $|\\psi\\rangle = C \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$ for some normalization constant $C$. A convenient choice for the un-normalized eigenvector is to set the component $a = \\cos(\\theta/2)$. Then $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2) = \\cos(\\theta/2) \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\sin(\\theta/2)$.\n    So, an un-normalized eigenvector is $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n5.  **Normalize the Eigenvector**\n\n    The final step is to normalize the eigenvector. The normalization condition is that the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the components must equal 1. For our vector $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$:\n    Normalization = $|\\cos(\\theta/2)|^2 + |\\sin(\\theta/2)|^2 = \\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$.\n\n    The vector is already normalized. Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is:\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    The elements of this eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n6.  **Compare with Options**\n\n    *   A) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)$: Incorrect. State vectors should not contain units of $\\hbar$.\n    *   B) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2))$: Incorrect. Also contains $\\hbar$ and incorrect coefficients.\n    *   C) $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))$: This matches our calculated result.\n    *   D) $(\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta))$: Incorrect. The dependence is on $\\theta$, not $\\theta/2$. This represents a general qubit state but is not the eigenvector for this specific operator.\n\nThe correct elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n<<<C>>>"
