    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n    *   277 Kelvin is equal to 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K).\n    *   This is a very strong match. Therefore, **B is heavy water, D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Gas W:** The problem states that gas W's molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons. Since we know D₂O is involved, a likely candidate for the gas is deuterium gas (D₂).\n    *   A deuterium atom (D or ²H) contains 1 proton and 1 neutron.\n    *   A D₂ molecule therefore contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons. The numbers are equal. This fits the description perfectly.\n\n3.  **Identify the Reaction:** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to release D₂ gas (W) and a precipitate (G). Heating G releases D₂O (B).\n    *   This suggests a reaction where a deuteride (X) reacts with a liquid (Y) to form a deuteroxide (G).\n    *   The reaction `G --(heat)--> B (D₂O)` suggests that G is a metal deuteroxide which decomposes upon heating. For example: `2 M(OD)n → M₂On + n D₂O`.\n    *   If Y were D₂O, the reaction would be `Metal-Deuteride (X) + D₂O (Y) → D₂ (W) + Metal-Deuteroxide (G)`. This seems a consistent scenario.\n\n4.  **Identify Substance X:** We have several crucial clues for X:\n    *   It contains a heavier isotope, which we've established is deuterium (D).\n    *   It is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and its \"very close analog\" is also used. This points to a common reagent and its deuterated version.\n    *   It reacts with a keto acid to produce a product with 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid (e.g., R-CO-COOH) contains 3 oxygen atoms. A reduction reaction that converts both the ketone (C=O) and the carboxylic acid (-COOH) groups to alcohols (-OH) would result in a product with 2 oxygen atoms (a diol). This indicates that X is a strong reducing agent.\n    *   Common pairs of reducing agents in organic chemistry are sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) and its deuterated form (NaBD₄), and lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) and its deuterated form (LiAlD₄).\n    *   Let's test X = **LiAlD₄** (Lithium Aluminum Deuteride).\n        *   Its analog is LiAlH₄. They are both strong reducing agents used in organic chemistry. **(Fits)**\n        *   It contains deuterium. **(Fits)**\n        *   It reduces keto acids to diols (2 oxygens). **(Fits)**\n        *   Let's check the reaction with Y = D₂O: `LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂`.\n            *   The reaction is known to be violent. **(Fits)**\n            *   It releases D₂ gas (W). **(Fits)**\n            *   It forms a precipitate, G = Al(OD)₃ (Aluminum deuteroxide is insoluble). **(Fits)**\n            *   Heating G (Al(OD)₃) yields B (D₂O): `2 Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O`. **(Fits)**\n    *   All clues point conclusively to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:** The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in Substance X (LiAlD₄). The phrasing \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... must be summed\" means we need to sum the masses for all atoms of those elements in the formula.\n    *   **Elements in LiAlD₄:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Atomic Numbers:** H(Z=1), Li(Z=3), Al(Z=13).\n    *   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen.\n    *   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum.\n    *   **Atomic Masses (using integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes):**\n        *   The isotope of Hydrogen is Deuterium (D or ²H). Mass number = 2.\n        *   The main stable isotope of Aluminum is ²⁷Al. Mass number = 27.\n    *   **Calculate the total mass from each element in the formula LiAlD₄:**\n        *   Total mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen): There are 4 deuterium atoms. Summed mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   Total mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is 1 aluminum atom. Summed mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Calculate the final cumulative sum:**\n        *   Sum = (Total mass from H) + (Total mass from Al) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe result of the calculation is 35.\n\n<<<A>>>"
