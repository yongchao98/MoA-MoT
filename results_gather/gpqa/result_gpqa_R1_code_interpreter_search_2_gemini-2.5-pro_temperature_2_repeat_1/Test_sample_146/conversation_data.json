    "This problem involves the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and a slowly moving antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) into four new particles ($2A^{+}$ and $2A^{-}$). We can solve this by applying the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n**1. Initial State Analysis:**\n*   The reaction is: $p + \\bar{p} \\rightarrow 2A^{+} + 2A^{-}$\n*   The proton ($p$) is assumed to be at rest in the lab frame.\n*   The antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) is described as \"slowly moving,\" which means we can approximate its kinetic energy as zero. Its velocity is negligible compared to the speed of light.\n*   Therefore, the total initial kinetic energy of the system is approximately zero.\n*   The total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton. The mass of an antiproton is the same as the mass of a proton ($m_p = m_{\\bar{p}}$).\n    *   $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.27 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n    *   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 m_p c^2$\n*   Since both initial particles are essentially at rest, the total initial momentum ($P_{initial}$) of the system is zero.\n\n**2. Final State Analysis:**\n*   The final state consists of four particles: two $A^{+}$ and two $A^{-}$.\n*   All four particles have the same mass, $m_A$, with a rest energy of $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n*   The total energy of a single particle A is given by the relativistic formula $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor and $v$ is the velocity of the particle.\n*   Due to the conservation of momentum (since $P_{initial}=0$, $P_{final}$ must also be zero), the four particles must be created with velocities that vectorially sum to zero. By symmetry, they will all have the same kinetic energy and thus the same speed, $v$.\n*   The total final energy ($E_{final}$) is the sum of the energies of the four A particles:\n    *   $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n**3. Applying Conservation of Energy:**\n*   According to the principle of conservation of energy, the total initial energy must equal the total final energy.\n    *   $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    *   $2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n**4. Solving for Velocity (v):**\n*   First, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n*   Now, we plug in the given values:\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{938.27 \\, \\text{MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\, \\text{MeV}} = \\frac{938.27}{600} \\approx 1.5638$\n*   Next, we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to solve for the velocity $v$.\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n    *   $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n    *   $1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    *   $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    *   $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n*   Substitute the calculated value of $\\gamma$:\n    *   $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n    *   $v/c \\approx 0.7688$\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
