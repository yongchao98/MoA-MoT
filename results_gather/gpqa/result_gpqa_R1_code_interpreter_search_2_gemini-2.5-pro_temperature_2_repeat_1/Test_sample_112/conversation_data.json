    "*   **Analysis of FTIR Spectrum:**\n    1.  **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic indicator of an O-H stretching vibration that is involved in hydrogen bonding. The significant broadness is highly characteristic of the O-H group in a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    2.  **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When seen in conjunction with a broad O-H peak, it further strengthens the evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group.\n    3.  **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n*   **Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    1.  **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of an alkene functional group, corroborating the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry:**\n    1.  **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** We need to identify a common, stable fragment with this mass-to-charge ratio. The molecular weight of the carboxyl group (-COOH) is calculated as: 12.01 (C) + 16.00 (O) + 16.00 (O) + 1.01 (H) = 45.02. A peak at m/z = 45 is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids, representing the [COOH]⁺ cation.\n\n*   **Putting It All Together:**\n    1.  The combined evidence from FTIR (broad O-H, C=O) and Mass Spectrometry (m/z = 45) strongly indicates the presence of a **carboxylic acid** group (-COOH). This means the molecule must contain two oxygen atoms. This eliminates options A (C₆H₁₂O) and B (C₆H₁₀O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n    2.  We are left with C (C₆H₁₀O₂) and D (C₆H₁₂O₂).\n    3.  The evidence from FTIR (C=C stretch) and 1H NMR (vinyl hydrogens) proves the existence of a **carbon-carbon double bond** (an alkene).\n    4.  Now, we must use the concept of **Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU)** to differentiate between C and D. The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is `DoU = C + 1 - H/2`.\n        *   For a saturated C6 acyclic molecule, the formula would be C₆H₁₄.\n        *   Option C (C₆H₁₀O₂): DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This corresponds to two degrees of unsaturation. One is accounted for by the C=O in the carboxylic acid, and the other is accounted for by the C=C of the alkene. This fits all the data perfectly.\n        *   Option D (C₆H₁₂O₂): DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This corresponds to only one degree of unsaturation. This could account for the carboxylic acid's C=O bond (e.g., hexanoic acid), but it cannot also have a C=C double bond.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Only the formula C₆H₁₀O₂ is consistent with the presence of both a carboxylic acid group and a carbon-carbon double bond.\n\n<<<C>>>"
