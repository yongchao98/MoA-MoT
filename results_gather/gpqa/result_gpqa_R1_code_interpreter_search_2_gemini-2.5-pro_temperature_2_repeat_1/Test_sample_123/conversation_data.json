    "This is a classic problem involving special relativity (time dilation) and radioactive decay.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the core physics:**\n    *   **Radioactive Decay:** The number of particles `N` that have not decayed after a time `t` from an initial sample `N₀` follows an exponential decay law:\n        N(t) = N₀ * e^(-t/τ)\n        where `τ` is the mean proper lifetime of the particle. The time `t` in this formula must be the time measured in the particle's own rest frame (the proper time).\n    *   **Time Dilation:** Particles moving at relativistic speeds experience time more slowly than a stationary observer. The time elapsed in the stationary observer's frame (the lab frame), `t_lab`, is related to the proper time `t_proper` by the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n        t_lab = γ * t_proper\n        Therefore, the time experienced by the particle is:\n        t_proper = t_lab / γ\n\n2.  **Set up the problem:**\n    *   The particles are created at the center of the detector and travel to the inner wall. The distance they travel is the radius `R` = 30 m.\n    *   They travel at \"ultra-relativistic velocities\", which means their speed `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`. We can approximate `v ≈ c`.\n    *   The time it takes for a particle to reach the detector wall in the lab frame is:\n        t_lab = R / v ≈ R / c\n    *   The proper time that passes for the particle during this journey is:\n        t_proper = t_lab / γ = (R/c) / γ\n\n3.  **Formulate the decay equation for this scenario:**\n    *   Substitute the proper time `t_proper` into the decay equation. The fraction of particles `N/N₀` that reach the wall (i.e., survive the journey) is:\n        N/N₀ = e^(-t_proper / τ) = e^(-(R / (cγ)) / τ)\n    *   We can group the constants together:\n        N/N₀ = e^(-R / (γ * cτ))\n    *   The term `cτ` is the particle's proper decay length. Let's call the constant part `K = R / (cτ)`. This constant depends on the detector radius and the particle's intrinsic properties, but not on its speed or Lorentz factor. The equation becomes:\n        N/N₀ = e^(-K/γ)\n\n4.  **Use the initial condition to find the constant K:**\n    *   We are given that when `γ₁ = 20`, the fraction of surviving particles is `N/N₀ = 1/3`.\n    *   Substitute these values into our equation:\n        1/3 = e^(-K/20)\n    *   To solve for `K`, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n        ln(1/3) = -K/20\n        -ln(3) = -K/20\n        K = 20 * ln(3)\n\n5.  **Use the value of K to solve for the new Lorentz factor (γ₂):**\n    *   The question asks for the Lorentz factor `γ₂` required for the surviving fraction to be `N/N₀ = 2/3`.\n    *   We use the same formula with the new values and the constant `K` we just found:\n        2/3 = e^(-K/γ₂)\n        2/3 = e^(-(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂)\n    *   Again, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        ln(2/3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂\n    *   Using the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b)`:\n        ln(2) - ln(3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂\n    *   Now, we solve for `γ₂`:\n        γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / (ln(2) - ln(3))\n        γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(3) - ln(2))\n\n6.  **Calculate the final numerical value:**\n    To get a precise value, we can use a python script for the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the known values from the problem\ngamma_1 = 20.0\nfraction_1 = 1.0/3.0\nfraction_2 = 2.0/3.0\n\n# The survival fraction F is given by F = exp(-K/gamma), where K is a constant.\n# From the first condition: ln(F1) = -K/gamma1\n# K = -gamma1 * ln(F1)\n# K = -20 * ln(1/3) = 20 * ln(3)\nK = gamma_1 * math.log(1.0/fraction_1)\n\n# From the second condition: ln(F2) = -K/gamma2\n# We need to find gamma2.\n# gamma2 = -K / ln(F2)\ngamma_2 = -K / math.log(fraction_2)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n[code interpreter output]\n54.19159957308722\n\nThe calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19.

    "The problem relates the survival fraction of decaying particles to their Lorentz factor.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Survival Equation:** The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive after a certain time `t_proper` in their own rest frame is given by the exponential decay law:\n    `f = N/N₀ = e^(-t_proper / τ)`\n    where `τ` is the mean proper lifetime of the particle.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** The particles are moving at relativistic speeds. The time elapsed in the lab frame (`t_lab`) is related to the proper time (`t_proper`) experienced by the particle through the Lorentz factor (`γ`):\n    `t_lab = γ * t_proper`\n    Therefore, `t_proper = t_lab / γ`.\n\n3.  **Time of Flight:** The particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" meaning their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time it takes for them to travel the detector radius `R` = 30 m in the lab frame is:\n    `t_lab ≈ R / c`\n\n4.  **Combined Equation:** Substituting `t_proper` into the survival equation, we get the fraction of particles reaching the detector wall:\n    `f = e^(-(R/c) / (γτ)) = e^(-R / (γcτ))`\n    The term `R / (cτ)` is a constant that depends on the detector and the type of particle, but not on its speed. Let's call this constant `A = R / (cτ)`. The equation simplifies to:\n    `f = e^(-A/γ)`\n\n5.  **Using the First Condition:** We are given that for `γ₁ = 20`, the survival fraction is `f₁ = 1/3`.\n    `1/3 = e^(-A / 20)`\n    To solve for `A`, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -A / 20`\n    `-ln(3) = -A / 20`\n    `A = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n6.  **Solving for the Second Condition:** We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, for which the survival fraction is `f₂ = 2/3`. We use the same formula with the value of `A` we just found.\n    `2/3 = e^(-A / γ₂)`\n    `2/3 = e^(-(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂)`\n    Again, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(2/3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n    Now, solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3)`\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b)`, and `-ln(x/y) = ln(y/x)`:\n    `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / - (ln(2) - ln(3))`\n    `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n\n7.  **Calculation:**\n    `γ₂ = (20 * 1.0986) / (1.0986 - 0.6931)`\n    `γ₂ = 21.972 / 0.4055`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19, which is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
