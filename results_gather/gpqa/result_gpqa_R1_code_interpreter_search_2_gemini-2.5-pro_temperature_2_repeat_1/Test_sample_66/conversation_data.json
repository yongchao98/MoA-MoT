    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the System and the States\n\n*   **Initial State:** The system consists of two electrons in p-orbitals, meaning their individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$. The system is in a coupled angular momentum state $|\\psi_{initial}\\rangle = |l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   In this coupled basis, the quantum numbers $l=2$ and $m=-1$ represent the total orbital angular momentum and its z-component, respectively.\n    *   The state $|\\psi_{initial}\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum squared operator $L^2$ and the total z-component of angular momentum operator $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_z$ for this state is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n*   **Final State:** A measurement is made of the individual z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. We want to find the probability of obtaining specific eigenvalues.\n    *   The desired eigenvalue for $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. The state corresponding to this outcome has the magnetic quantum number $m_{l1}=-1$.\n    *   The desired eigenvalue for $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$. The state corresponding to this outcome has the magnetic quantum number $m_{l2}=-1$.\n    *   Therefore, the final state we are projecting onto is the joint eigenstate of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, which is described in the uncoupled basis: $|\\psi_{final}\\rangle = |l_1, m_{l1}\\rangle |l_2, m_{l2}\\rangle = |1, -1\\rangle |1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n### 2. The Physics of the Measurement\n\nThe probability of a system, initially in state $|\\psi_{initial}\\rangle$, being measured in state $|\\psi_{final}\\rangle$ is given by the square of the magnitude of their inner product:\n$P = |\\langle\\psi_{final}|\\psi_{initial}\\rangle|^2$\n\nSubstituting the specific states from our problem:\n$P = |\\langle(1, -1)(1, -1) | (1, 1, 2, -1)\\rangle|^2$\n\n### 3. Method 1: Using Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients\n\nThe inner product $\\langle(l_1, m_{l1})(l_2, m_{l2}) | (l_1, l_2, l, m)\\rangle$ is precisely the definition of a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, often written as $\\langle l_1, m_{l1}, l_2, m_{l2} | l, m\\rangle$.\n\nSo, we need to find the value of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient:\n$C = \\langle 1, -1, 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$\n\nClebsch-Gordan coefficients are non-zero only if certain selection rules are met. One fundamental rule is that the total magnetic quantum number must be the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers:\n$m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$\n\nLet's check this condition for our coefficient:\n*   The total magnetic quantum number of the initial state is $m = -1$.\n*   The sum of the magnetic quantum numbers of the final state is $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\nSince $m \\neq m_{l1} + m_{l2}$ (i.e., $-1 \\neq -2$), the selection rule is violated. This means the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero.\n$C = \\langle 1, -1, 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$\n\nTherefore, the probability is:\n$P = |0|^2 = 0$\n\n### 4. Method 2: Using Properties of Operators and Eigenstates\n\nThis method provides a more conceptual understanding.\n1.  The initial state $|\\psi_{initial}\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the total z-component angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n    $L_z |\\psi_{initial}\\rangle = -1\\hbar |\\psi_{initial}\\rangle$\n\n2.  The final state $|\\psi_{final}\\rangle = |1, -1\\rangle|1, -1\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of $L_{1z}$ (eigenvalue $-\\hbar$) and $L_{2z}$ (eigenvalue $-\\hbar$). It is therefore also an eigenstate of their sum, $L_z$:\n    $L_z |\\psi_{final}\\rangle = (L_{1z} + L_{2z})|1, -1\\rangle|1, -1\\rangle = (L_{1z}|1, -1\\rangle)|1, -1\\rangle + |1, -1\\rangle(L_{2z}|1, -1\\rangle)$\n    $= (-\\hbar|1, -1\\rangle)|1, -1\\rangle + |1, -1\\rangle(-\\hbar|1, -1\\rangle)$\n    $= -2\\hbar |1, -1\\rangle|1, -1\\rangle = -2\\hbar |\\psi_{final}\\rangle$\n\n3.  The operator $L_z$ is a Hermitian operator. A fundamental theorem of linear algebra states that eigenstates of a Hermitian operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal.\n    Since $|\\psi_{initial}\\rangle$ and $|\\psi_{final}\\rangle$ are eigenstates of $L_z$ with different eigenvalues ($-1\\hbar$ and $-2\\hbar$), they must be orthogonal.\n    $\\langle\\psi_{final}|\\psi_{initial}\\rangle = 0$\n\n4.  The probability of the measurement is the square of this inner product:\n    $P = |\\langle\\psi_{final}|\\psi_{initial}\\rangle|^2 = |0|^2 = 0$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth methods lead to the same conclusion: the probability of measuring the system in the state with $m_{l1}=-1$ and $m_{l2}=-1$ is zero. This is because the initial state has a total z-component of angular momentum corresponding to $m=-1$, while the desired final state has a total z-component corresponding to $m=-2$. This transition is forbidden by the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum during the measurement projection.\n\n<<<B>>>"
