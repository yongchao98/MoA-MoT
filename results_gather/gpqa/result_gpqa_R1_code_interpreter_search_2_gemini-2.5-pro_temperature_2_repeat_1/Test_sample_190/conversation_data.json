    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n*   This molecule is a cyclohexanone derivative.\n*   It has three functional groups: a ketone (C=O), a primary alcohol (-CH2OH), and an alkene (isopropenyl group, -C(CH3)=CH2).\n*   The substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone at position 1.\n\n**Step 1: Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. Benzyl bromide (BnBr) is an alkylating agent.\n*   **Reaction:** The molecule has two acidic protons: the proton on the alcohol's hydroxyl group (-OH) and the α-protons adjacent to the ketone. The alcohol proton (pKa ≈ 16-18) is more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20).\n*   NaH will preferentially deprotonate the alcohol to form a sodium alkoxide (-CH2O⁻Na⁺).\n*   This alkoxide is a strong nucleophile and will react with benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis (an SN2 reaction) to form a benzyl ether.\n*   **Product 1:** The -CH2OH group is converted to a benzyloxymethyl group (-CH2OBn, where Bn = benzyl, -CH2Ph). The ketone and the isopropenyl group are unaffected.\n    *   **Structure of Product 1:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl.**\n\n*   **Reagents:** p-Toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH2) and an acid catalyst (HCl).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard condensation reaction between a ketone and a hydrazide derivative to form a tosylhydrazone. The ketone's carbonyl oxygen is replaced by =N-NHTs.\n*   **Product 2:** The tosylhydrazone of Product 1.\n    *   **Structure of Product 2:** N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide.\n\n**Step 3: Treatment at low temperature with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl).**\n\n*   **Reagents:** n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi) is a very strong base.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents is used for the **Shapiro reaction**. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of a strong base (like n-BuLi).\n    1.  The first equivalent of n-BuLi deprotonates the -NH- group.\n    2.  The second equivalent deprotonates the carbon α to the C=N bond, creating a vinyl anion.\n    3.  This intermediate spontaneously eliminates the p-toluenesulfinate anion (Ts⁻) and nitrogen gas (N₂) to form a new C=C double bond where the ketone used to be. The reaction effectively deoxygenates the ketone to an alkene.\n*   The n-butyl group from n-BuLi is not incorporated into the product. The aqueous workup with NH4Cl is to quench any excess base.\n*   **Product 3:** An alkene is formed on the cyclohexyl ring. The benzyloxy and isopropenyl groups remain.\n    *   **Structure of Product 3:** 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene (or its regioisomer, which doesn't affect the final product). The molecule now contains two C=C double bonds and a benzyl ether.\n\n**Step 4: Stirring with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H2).**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) is a hydrogenation catalyst. H2 is the source of hydrogen.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation, which performs several transformations:\n    1.  **Reduction of Alkenes:** Both the C=C bond in the cyclohexene ring and the C=C bond in the isopropenyl group will be reduced (hydrogenated) to C-C single bonds.\n        *   Cyclohexene → Cyclohexane.\n        *   Isopropenyl group (-C(CH3)=CH2) → Isopropyl group (-CH(CH3)2).\n    2.  **Hydrogenolysis of Benzyl Ether:** The C-O bond in the benzyl ether (-CH2OCH2Ph) is cleaved by hydrogenolysis. The protecting benzyl group is removed, regenerating the alcohol.\n        *   Benzyloxymethyl group (-CH2OBn) → Hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH).\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations, the final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. The relative 1,3- (or 1,5- if counting from the original ketone) substitution pattern on the ring is preserved. This molecule is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. The Shapiro reaction in step 3 removes the tosylhydrazone group entirely.\n*   B) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This structure perfectly matches the outcome of the four-step reaction sequence. It has a cyclohexane ring, an isopropyl group, and a hydroxymethyl group in the correct relative positions.\n*   C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. A butyl group from n-BuLi is not added in a Shapiro reaction. Also, the ketone is eliminated, not reduced to an alcohol, and the benzyl ether should be removed in step 4.\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This is the product if the benzyl ether was not cleaved during the hydrogenation step. While possible under very mild conditions, the standard H2/Pd-C reaction is expected to cleave the benzyl ether, especially when reducing two other C=C bonds. Therefore, B is the major and expected product.\n\n<<<B>>>"
