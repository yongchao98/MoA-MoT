    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the relationship between distance and parallax.**\n    Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to a star. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n    `plx = 1/d`\n    This means that the distance `d` can be expressed as:\n    `d = 1/plx`\n\n2.  **Model the distribution of stars.**\n    The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This implies that the number density of stars, `ρ` (the number of stars per unit volume), is constant throughout space.\n    `ρ = constant`\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of stars in a spherical shell.**\n    We want to find the number of stars at a certain distance. Let's consider a thin spherical shell of space with radius `d` and thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of a sphere of radius `d` is `V = (4/3)πd³`.\n    *   The volume of the thin shell (`dV`) can be found by differentiating the volume with respect to the radius `d`:\n        `dV = d/dd[(4/3)πd³] * dd = 4πd² dd`\n    *   The number of stars (`dN`) within this thin shell is the number density `ρ` multiplied by the volume of the shell `dV`:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² dd`\n\n4.  **Express the number of stars in terms of parallax.**\n    Our goal is to find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/d(plx)`. To do this, we need to substitute `d` and `dd` in the equation for `dN` with expressions involving `plx` and `d(plx)`.\n    *   We already have `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   We need to find the relationship between `dd` and `d(plx)`. We can get this by differentiating `d = 1/plx` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx)[plx⁻¹] = -1 * plx⁻² = -1/plx²`\n        Therefore, `dd = -(1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n    *   When we are counting stars, we are interested in the number within a parallax range, so we use the magnitude of the change. We take the absolute value:\n        `|dd| = (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n\n5.  **Substitute and find the final relationship.**\n    Now, we substitute the expressions for `d` and `|dd|` back into our equation for `dN`:\n    `dN = 4πρd² |dd|`\n    `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n    `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Determine the number of stars per unit range of parallax.**\n    To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we divide `dN` by `d(plx)`:\n    `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n7.  **Conclusion.**\n    Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n    `dN/d(plx) ~ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
