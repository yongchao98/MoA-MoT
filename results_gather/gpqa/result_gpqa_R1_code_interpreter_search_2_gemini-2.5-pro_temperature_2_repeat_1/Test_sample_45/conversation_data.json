    "*   **Step 1: Identify the reactant and the reaction.**\n    The reactant is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Its structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. The carbon atom at position 3 (C3) is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, a methyl group (-CH3), an ethyl group (-CH2CH3), and a vinyl group (-CH=CH2).\n    The problem states the reactant is \"racemic,\" which means it is a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers: (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene. Let's denote them as 'R' and 'S' for simplicity.\n    The reagent is Grubbs catalyst, which catalyzes olefin metathesis. Since there is only one type of alkene reactant (ignoring stereochemistry for a moment), this will be a self-metathesis reaction.\n\n*   **Step 2: Predict the products of self-metathesis.**\n    The general scheme for self-metathesis of a terminal alkene R'-CH=CH2 is:\n    2 R'-CH=CH2  --> R'-CH=CH-R' + CH2=CH2 (ethene)\n    In our case, R' is the sec-butyl group, specifically -(CH(CH3)CH2CH3).\n    So, the reaction is:\n    2 CH2=CH-CH(CH3)CH2CH3 --> CH3CH2CH(CH3)-CH=CH-CH(CH3)CH2CH3 + CH2=CH2\n    The question asks for the number of possible products *excluding ethene*. We therefore need to determine the number of possible stereoisomers of the larger product, which is named 4,7-dimethyldec-5-ene.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the stereochemistry of the product.**\n    The product, 4,7-dimethyldec-5-ene, has two potential sources of stereoisomerism:\n    1.  The chiral centers at C4 and C7, which originate from the C3 chiral center of the reactant molecules.\n    2.  The new double bond at C5=C6, which can have either E (trans) or Z (cis) geometry.\n\n*   **Step 4: Consider the different reaction combinations.**\n    Since the starting material is a racemic mixture of R and S enantiomers, three types of couplings can occur between two reactant molecules:\n    1.  (R)-enantiomer + (R)-enantiomer  (R+R coupling)\n    2.  (S)-enantiomer + (S)-enantiomer  (S+S coupling)\n    3.  (R)-enantiomer + (S)-enantiomer  (R+S coupling)\n\n*   **Step 5: Determine the products from each coupling.**\n\n    1.  **R + R coupling:** Two molecules of (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene react.\n        The product will have R configuration at both chiral centers, C4 and C7. The resulting molecule is (4R, 7R)-4,7-dimethyldec-5-ene.\n        This molecule is chiral. The double bond can be E or Z, creating two diastereomers:\n        *   Product 1: (E)-(4R,7R)-4,7-dimethyldec-5-ene\n        *   Product 2: (Z)-(4R,7R)-4,7-dimethyldec-5-ene\n\n    2.  **S + S coupling:** Two molecules of (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene react.\n        The product will have S configuration at both C4 and C7. The resulting molecule is (4S, 7S)-4,7-dimethyldec-5-ene.\n        These are the enantiomers of the products from the R+R coupling. They are also distinct compounds. This coupling also produces two diastereomers:\n        *   Product 3: (E)-(4S,7S)-4,7-dimethyldec-5-ene (enantiomer of Product 1)\n        *   Product 4: (Z)-(4S,7S)-4,7-dimethyldec-5-ene (enantiomer of Product 2)\n\n    3.  **R + S coupling:** One molecule of (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene reacts with one molecule of (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene.\n        The product will have one R and one S center: (4R, 7S)-4,7-dimethyldec-5-ene.\n        Let's analyze the symmetry of this molecule. The parent structure, 4,7-dimethyldec-5-ene, is symmetrical about the central double bond. This means the two stereocenters (C4 and C7) are chemically equivalent. When a molecule has two equivalent stereocenters with opposite configurations (R,S), it is a meso compound. A meso compound is achiral and is superimposable on its mirror image.\n        Since the R+S product is a meso compound, there is no separate enantiomer. However, we still have the E/Z isomerism of the double bond. This leads to two diastereomeric meso compounds:\n        *   Product 5: (E)-(4R,7S)-4,7-dimethyldec-5-ene (a meso compound)\n        *   Product 6: (Z)-(4R,7S)-4,7-dimethyldec-5-ene (a meso compound)\n\n*   **Step 6: Count the total number of distinct products.**\n    We have found a total of 6 distinct stereoisomers that can be formed in this reaction (excluding ethene):\n    *   One pair of enantiomers from R+R and S+S coupling with E-geometry (2 products).\n    *   One pair of enantiomers from R+R and S+S coupling with Z-geometry (2 products).\n    *   Two diastereomeric meso compounds from the R+S coupling (2 products).\n\n    Total number of products = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\n<<<A>>>"
