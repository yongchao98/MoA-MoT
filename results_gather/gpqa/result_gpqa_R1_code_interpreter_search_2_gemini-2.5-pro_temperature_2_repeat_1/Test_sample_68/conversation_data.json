    "This problem requires us to determine the minimum resolution a detector needs to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle $X^0$. \"Observing\" a decay in a detector like a bubble chamber means being able to distinguish the creation point of the particle from its decay point. This requires the particle to travel a certain minimum distance, `d`, which is the resolution of the detector. If the particle travels a distance less than `d`, its track is too short to be resolved, and the decay is not observed.\n\nTherefore, the fraction of observed decays is the fraction of particles that travel a distance `L` greater than or equal to the resolution `d`.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Relativistic Kinematics**:\n    The particle $X^0$ has a high energy ($E=27$ GeV) compared to its rest mass ($m_0c^2=3.41$ GeV), which means it is moving at a relativistic speed. First, we must calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n    The total energy $E$ is related to the rest mass $m_0$ and the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ by the equation:\n    $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0 c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}$\n\n2.  **Time Dilation**:\n    The lifetime of the particle in the laboratory frame ($\\tau_{lab}$) is longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) due to time dilation.\n    $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n\n3.  **Particle Speed**:\n    The speed of the particle in the lab frame, $v$, can be calculated from the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n    We can express the speed as a fraction of the speed of light, $\\beta = v/c$.\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\n4.  **Exponential Decay Law**:\n    The probability that a particle survives for a time `t` in the lab frame is given by the exponential decay law:\n    $P(\\text{survival time} \\ge t) = e^{-t/\\tau_{lab}}$\n    We can express this in terms of the distance traveled, $L = vt$. So, $t = L/v$.\n    The probability that a particle travels a distance `L` or more before decaying is:\n    $P(\\text{decay distance} \\ge L) = e^{-L/(v\\tau_{lab})}$\n\n5.  **Determining the Resolution**:\n    We need to observe at least 30% of the decays. This means the probability of a particle traveling a distance greater than or equal to our detector resolution `d` must be at least 0.30.\n    $P(\\text{decay distance} \\ge d) \\ge 0.30$\n    $e^{-d/(v\\tau_{lab})} \\ge 0.30$\n    To find the required resolution, we consider the boundary condition:\n    $e^{-d/(v\\tau_{lab})} = 0.30$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $\\frac{-d}{v\\tau_{lab}} = \\ln(0.30)$\n    $d = -v \\tau_{lab} \\ln(0.30)$\n\n6.  **Calculation**:\n    We can substitute the expressions for $v$ and $\\tau_{lab}$:\n    $d = -(c\\beta) (\\gamma \\tau_0) \\ln(0.30)$\n    A useful simplification is $\\beta\\gamma = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2} \\times \\gamma = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n    So, $d = -c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1} \\ln(0.30)$\n\n    Now, let's plug in the given values:\n    *   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n    *   $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    *   $\\gamma = 27 / 3.41 \\approx 7.9179$\n    *   $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n\n    Let's perform the calculation with a Python script for better precision.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Constants and Given Values\nc = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\ntau0 = 8e-16   # Proper lifetime in s\nE = 27         # Energy in GeV\nm0 = 3.41      # Rest mass in GeV/c^2\nfraction = 0.3 # Fraction of decays to observe\n\n# 1.

Calculate the lab-frame lifetime\ntau_lab = gamma * tau0\n\n# 4. Calculate the required distance 'd'\n# d = -v * tau_lab * ln(fraction)\nd = -v * tau_lab * np.log(fraction)\n\n# Print the final result in meters and scientific notation\nprint(f\"{d:.2e} m\")\n```\n>>>\n2.27e-06 m\n>>>\n\nThe calculation shows that the required distance is $d \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Looking at the options provided:\nA) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\nB) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\nC) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\nD) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\n\nOur calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is very close to option C ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). The minor discrepancy might arise from using a slightly different value for the speed of light or from the options being approximations. However, the order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$) and the leading digits match well only with option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This problem asks for the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays of particle $X^0$.

    "The reasoning and calculations performed are correct. Let's summarize the steps and the result to arrive at the final answer.\n\n1.  **Objective**: Find the minimum resolution `d` of a detector required to observe at least 30% of particle decays. This means finding the distance `d` for which the probability of the particle traveling a distance `L ≥ d` is equal to 0.3.\n\n2.  **Formula**: The probability of a particle traveling a distance `d` or more before decaying is given by the exponential decay law:\n    $P(L \\ge d) = e^{-d/\\lambda}$\n    where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the laboratory frame. Setting this probability to 0.3, we solve for `d`:\n    $d = -\\lambda \\ln(0.3)$\n\n3.  **Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**: The mean decay length depends on the particle's lab-frame velocity (`v`) and lab-frame lifetime ($\\tau_{lab}$):\n    $\\lambda = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$\n    Both `v` and $\\tau_{lab}$ are determined by the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n\n4.  **Calculations**:\n    *   **Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$)**: $\\gamma = \\frac{\\text{Total Energy (E)}}{\\text{Rest Mass Energy} (m_0 c^2)} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n    *   **Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**: The mean decay length is given by $\\lambda = c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$, where $\\tau_0$ is the proper lifetime.\n        $\\lambda = (2.998 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\times \\sqrt{(7.918)^2 - 1} \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n    *   **Required Resolution (d)**:\n        $d = -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times \\ln(0.3)$\n        $d \\approx -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (-1.204)$\n        $d \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: The calculated required resolution is approximately $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ meters. We compare this result with the given options:\n    A) 2.08 x 10⁻³ m\n    B) 2.08 x 10⁻⁹ m\n    C) 2.08 x 10⁻⁶ m\n    D) 2.08 x 10⁻¹ m\n\nThe calculated value $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is very close to option C, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$) matches perfectly, and the numerical value is the closest among all options. The slight difference is likely due to the precision of the constants or values given in the problem statement. Therefore, C is the correct choice.\n\n<<<C>>>"
