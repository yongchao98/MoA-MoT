    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the principle of physics:** The problem involves a relativistic particle in a conservative force field (a spring-like force). The most straightforward way to solve this is by using the principle of conservation of total relativistic energy.\n\n2.  **Define the total relativistic energy:** The total energy $E$ of a particle with rest mass $m$ and velocity $v$ in a potential field $U(x)$ is the sum of its kinetic energy, its rest energy, and its potential energy.\n    *   Relativistic kinetic energy + rest energy is given by $E_{kin+rest} = \\gamma mc^2 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   The potential energy for a spring obeying Hook's law ($F=-kx$) is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$. We set the potential energy to be zero at the equilibrium position ($x=0$).\n    *   Therefore, the total energy of the system is:\n        $E_{total} = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n3.  **Apply the conservation of energy:** The total energy of the isolated system must remain constant throughout the motion. We can evaluate the total energy at two specific points in the oscillation and set them equal.\n    *   **Point 1: At maximum amplitude ($x = A$)**\n        At the maximum displacement, the mass momentarily stops, so its velocity is $v=0$.\n        The total energy at this point is:\n        $E_1 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n    *   **Point 2: At the equilibrium position ($x = 0$)**\n        At the equilibrium position, the potential energy is zero ($U(0)=0$), and the speed is at its maximum, $v = v_{max}$.\n        The total energy at this point is:\n        $E_2 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} + \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n4.  **Equate the energies and solve for $v_{max}$:**\n    According to the conservation of energy, $E_1 = E_2$.\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n    Now, we need to algebraically manipulate this equation to solve for $v_{max}$.\n    *   Divide both sides by $mc^2$:\n        $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n    *   Square both sides of the equation:\n        $\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}$\n\n    *   Take the reciprocal of both sides to isolate the term containing $v_{max}$:\n        $\\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2} = 1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$\n\n    *   Rearrange the equation to solve for $v_{max}^2/c^2$:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n    *   Multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n        $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n5.  **Compare the result with the given options:**\n    The derived expression matches option (C) exactly.\n\n    *   A) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}}$ (Incorrect)\n    *   B) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}}$ (Incorrect)\n    *   C) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$ (Correct)\n    *   D) $v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$ (Incorrect, this is the classical non-relativistic answer)\n\n<<<C>>>"
