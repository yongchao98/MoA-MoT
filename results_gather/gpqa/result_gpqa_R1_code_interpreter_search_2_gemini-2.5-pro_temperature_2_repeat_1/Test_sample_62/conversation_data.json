    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Model and Energy Levels\n\nThe problem describes a diatomic molecule using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The total energy of the molecule is the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies, and it's quantized. The energy `E` for a given state defined by the vibrational quantum number `v` (v = 0, 1, 2, ...) and the rotational quantum number `J` (J = 0, 1, 2, ...) is given by:\n\nE(v, J) = E_vibrational + E_rotational\nE(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * J(J + 1)\n\nwhere:\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (≈ 1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration.\n*   `I` is the moment of inertia of the molecule.\n\n### 2. Identifying the Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:** The molecule is in its \"fundamental state\". This is the ground state, which corresponds to the lowest possible energy. This occurs when both quantum numbers are at their minimum values: `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\n    *   E_initial = E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * 0(0 + 1) = (1/2)ħω\n\n*   **Final State:** The molecule absorbs a photon and switches to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\". We need to consider the selection rules for photon absorption in a diatomic molecule:\n    *   Vibrational selection rule: Δv = +1 (for absorption)\n    *   Rotational selection rule: ΔJ = ±1\n\n    Starting from `J = 0`, a transition with ΔJ = -1 is impossible (since `J` cannot be negative). Therefore, the only allowed change is `ΔJ = +1`.\n\n    Combining these rules, the lowest-energy allowed transition from the ground state `(v=0, J=0)` is to the state `(v=1, J=1)`.\n    *   E_final = E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * 1(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I\n\n### 3. Calculating the Energy of the Absorbed Photon\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon (`E_photon`) must be equal to the difference in energy between the final and initial states (`ΔE`).\n\nΔE = E_final - E_initial\nΔE = [ (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I ] - [ (1/2)ħω ]\nΔE = ħω + ħ²/I\n\n### 4. Calculating the Required Quantities\n\nTo find `ΔE`, we need to calculate the moment of inertia, `I`. The formula for `I` is:\nI = μR²\n\nwhere `R` is the bond length and `μ` is the reduced mass of the molecule, calculated as:\nμ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)\n\nFirst, we must convert all given values to SI units:\n*   Mx = 20 amu = 20 * (1.66054 × 10⁻²⁷ kg) = 3.321 × 10⁻²⁶ kg\n*   My = 2 amu = 2 * (1.66054 × 10⁻²⁷ kg) = 3.321 × 10⁻²⁷ kg\n*   R = 2 Å = 2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   ω = 4 × 10¹⁴ rad/s\n*   ħ = 1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n*   c = 2.99792 × 10⁸ m/s\n\nNow we can perform the calculations. We will use a Python script for precision.\n\n### 5. Computing the Final Answer\n\nThe script will:\n1.  Define constants and convert inputs to SI units.\n2.  Calculate the reduced mass `μ`.\n3.  Calculate the moment of inertia `I`.\n4.  Calculate the total energy difference `ΔE`.\n5.

    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Model:** The problem specifies a diatomic molecule (X-Y) described by the quantum rotation-vibration model. This means the molecule can both rotate and vibrate, and its total energy is the sum of these two quantized energies.\n\n2.  **Energy Levels Formula:** The energy `E` of a state with vibrational quantum number `v` (v = 0, 1, 2, ...) and rotational quantum number `J` (J = 0, 1, 2, ...) is:\n    E(v, J) = E_vibrational + E_rotational = ħω(v + 1/2) + B * J(J + 1)\n    where `B = ħ² / 2I` is the rotational constant, `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant, `ω` is the vibrational angular frequency, and `I` is the moment of inertia.\n\n3.  **Identify the Initial State:** The molecule starts in its \"fundamental state,\" which is the ground state with the lowest possible energy.

Therefore, the only allowed rotational transition is `ΔJ = +1`.\n    Combining these rules, the lowest-energy allowed transition from the ground state `(v=0, J=0)` is to the final state `(v=1, J=1)`.\n    *   E_final = E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + B * 1(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B\n\n5.  **Calculate the Transition Energy (ΔE):** The energy of the absorbed photon must equal the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n    *   ΔE = E_final - E_initial\n    *   ΔE = [ (3/2)ħω + 2B ] - [ (1/2)ħω ]\n    *   ΔE = ħω + 2B\n    *   Substituting `B = ħ² / 2I`, we get: ΔE = ħω + ħ²/I\n\n6.  **Calculate the Photon's Momentum (p):** The energy of a photon is related to its momentum by `E = pc`, where `c` is the speed of light. Therefore, the photon's momentum is:\n    *   p = ΔE / c = (ħω + ħ²/I) / c\n\n7.  **Calculate Numerical Values:** We need to compute `I`, the moment of inertia, which is `I = μR²`, where `μ` is the reduced mass.\n    *   **Convert to SI units:**\n        *   Mx = 20 amu = 20 * 1.66054 × 10⁻²⁷ kg\n        *   My = 2 amu = 2 * 1.66054 × 10⁻²⁷ kg\n        *   R = 2 Å = 2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   **Calculate reduced mass (μ):**\n        *   μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)\n    *   **Calculate moment of inertia (I):**\n        *   I = μR²\n    *   **Calculate ΔE and then p.**\n\nThe calculation involves several physical constants and variables.

Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n### Step 1: Define the Energy of the System\n\nThe energy `E` of the diatomic molecule in the rotation-vibration model is given by the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies, which are quantized:\n\nE(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * J(J + 1)\n\nwhere:\n*   `v` is the vibrational quantum number (v = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   `J` is the rotational quantum number (J = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (≈ 1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration (given as 4 × 10¹⁴ rad/s).\n*   `I` is the moment of inertia of the molecule.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State (Fundamental State):** This is the ground state with the lowest possible energy, which occurs when both quantum numbers are at their minimum: `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\n    *   E_initial = E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) = (1/2)ħω\n\n*   **Final State:** The molecule absorbs a photon, which causes a transition to a higher energy state. Such transitions are governed by quantum mechanical selection rules. For a typical infrared absorption by a heteronuclear diatomic molecule, these rules are:\n    *   **Δv = +1**\n    *   **ΔJ = ±1**\n\n    Applying these rules to the initial state (v=0, J=0):\n    *   The vibrational state must change from v=0 to v=1 (since Δv = +1).\n    *   The rotational state must change from J=0 to J=1 (since ΔJ = +1; a change of -1 is not possible as J cannot be negative).\n\n    Therefore, the final state that the molecule transitions to is **(v=1, J=1)**.\n    *   E_final = E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * 1(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Energy of the Absorbed Photon (ΔE)\n\nThe photon's energy must equal the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n\nΔE = E_final - E_initial\nΔE = [ (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I ] - [ (1/2)ħω ]\nΔE = ħω + ħ²/I\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Photon's Momentum (p)\n\nThe energy of a photon (`E`) is related to its momentum (`p`) and the speed of light (`c`) by the formula `E = pc`. Therefore:\n\np = ΔE / c = (ħω + ħ²/I) / c\n\n### Step 5: Perform the Numerical Calculation\n\nWe will use the provided values and physical constants, first calculating the moment of inertia `I = μR²`, where `μ` is the reduced mass.\n\n`μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)`\n\nThe most reliable way to perform this multi-step calculation is with a script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define physical constants in SI units\nHBAR = 1.05457e-34      # J*s (Reduced Planck constant)\nC = 2.99792e8          # m/s (Speed of light)\nAMU_TO_KG = 1.66054e-27  # kg\nANGSTROM_TO_M = 1.0e-10  # m\n\n# Given parameters from the problem\nMx_amu = 20.0\nMy_amu = 2.0\nR_angstrom = 2.0\nomega_rad_s = 4.0e14\n\n# 1. Convert parameters to SI units\nMx_kg = Mx_amu * AMU_TO_KG\nMy_kg = My_amu * AMU_TO_KG\nR_m = R_angstrom * ANGSTROM_TO_M\n\n# 2. Calculate the reduced mass (mu)\nmu = (Mx_kg * My_kg) / (Mx_kg + My_kg)\n\n# 3. Calculate the moment of inertia (I)\nI = mu * (R_m**2)\n\n# 4. Calculate the change in energy (Delta_E) for the allowed ro-vibrational transition\n# from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=1)\n# Delta_E = hbar*omega + hbar^2/I\nDelta_E_total = (HBAR * omega_rad_s) + ((HBAR**2) / I)\n\n# 5. Calculate the photon's momentum (p) using p = E/c\np = Delta_E_total / C\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(f\"{p:.2e}\")\n```\nThe output from the code confirms the calculation: `1.41e-28`.\n\nThe calculated momentum is p ≈ 1.41 × 10⁻²⁸ N·s. Comparing this to the options:\n\nA) p = 2.3 × 10⁻²⁷ N·s\nB) p = 1.1 × 10⁻²⁷ N·s\nC) p = 1.9 × 10⁻²⁸ N·s\nD) p = 1.4 × 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThe result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
