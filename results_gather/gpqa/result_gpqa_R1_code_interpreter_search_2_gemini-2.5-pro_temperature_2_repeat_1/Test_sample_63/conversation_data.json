    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental steps and identify the products.**\n    *   The initial mixture of salts A and B is heated and decomposes completely into a mixture of gases.\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** This substance is a powerful dehydrating agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)2 solution):** This is limewater, which turns milky in the presence of acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. Since the mass did not change, no acidic gases were formed.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper is a reducing agent. It reacts with oxidizing gases. The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the formation of copper(II) oxide (CuO), meaning the gas contained oxygen atoms. The mass increase is purely the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   **Remaining gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n\n2.  **Calculate the moles of each product.**\n    *   **Water (H₂O):**\n        *   Mass = 3.60 g\n        *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol\n        *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n    *   **Oxygen atoms from Tube №3:**\n        *   Mass increase (mass of oxygen atoms) = 0.80 g\n        *   Molar Mass of O = 16.0 g/mol\n        *   Moles of O atoms = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        This oxygen came from an oxidizing gas. Common examples from thermal decomposition are O₂ or N₂O. If the gas was O₂, the reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO, and 0.025 mol of O₂ would be needed to provide 0.05 mol of O atoms. If the gas was N₂O, the reaction is Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂, and 0.05 mol of N₂O would be needed to provide 0.05 mol of O atoms.\n    *   **Gas C:**\n        *   Volume = 2.24 L at STP.\n        *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n        *   Gas C is inert to all the reagents, which strongly suggests it is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n3.  **Deduce the composition of the original salts.**\n    *   The decomposition products contain the elements Hydrogen (from H₂O), Oxygen (from H₂O and the oxidizing gas), and Nitrogen (from Gas C).\n    *   Since only gases are formed (no solid residue), the salts likely contain a cation that fully decomposes into gases, such as the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺). Metal cations would typically leave a solid metal oxide.\n    *   The anions must contain Nitrogen and Oxygen. The most common are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n    *   Let's hypothesize that the two salts are Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n4.  **Test the hypothesis with decomposition reactions.**\n    *   The heating temperature is 200°C. The standard decomposition reactions are:\n        *   Salt A (NH₄NO₂): NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n        *   Salt B (NH₄NO₃): NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)  *(This is the dominant reaction around 200°C)*\n    *   This set of reactions produces N₂, N₂O, and H₂O.\n    *   When this gas mixture passes through the tubes:\n        *   Tube 1 absorbs H₂O.\n        *   Tube 2 (Ca(OH)₂) does nothing, as N₂ and N₂O are not acidic. This matches the observation.\n        *   Tube 3 (hot Cu) reacts with N₂O: Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂.\n        *   The remaining gas C would be the original N₂ from NH₄NO₂ decomposition plus the N₂ formed from the N₂O reaction.\n\n5.  **Verify the amounts based on the hypothesis.**\n    *   The problem states the mixture is \"equimolar\". Let 'x' be the moles of NH₄NO₂ and 'x' be the moles of NH₄NO₃.\n    *   **Water (H₂O):** From the reactions, moles of H₂O = 2x (from NH₄NO₂) + 2x (from NH₄NO₃) = 4x.\n        *   We know moles of H₂O = 0.2 mol. So, 4x = 0.2 mol, which means **x = 0.05 mol**.\n    *   **Oxidizing gas (N₂O):** N₂O is produced only from NH₄NO₃. Moles of N₂O = x = 0.05 mol.\n        *   This amount of N₂O contains 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms.\n        *   Mass of oxygen = 0.05 mol * 16.0 g/mol = 0.80 g. This perfectly matches the mass increase of tube №3.\n    *   **Final Gas C (N₂):**\n        *   N₂ from NH₄NO₂ decomposition: x = 0.05 mol.\n        *   N₂ from the reaction of N₂O with Cu: Moles of N₂ produced equals moles of N₂O reacted = x = 0.05 mol.\n        *   Total moles of N₂ = 0.05 + 0.05 = 0.1 mol. This perfectly matches the calculated moles of Gas C.\n    *   **Initial Mass:** Let's check if the total mass is correct.\n        *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.0 g/mol.\n        *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.0 g/mol.\n        *   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 64.0 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80.0 g/mol) = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g. This matches the given initial mass.\n\n6.  **Calculate the final answer.**\n    *   The hypothesis is confirmed. Salts A and B are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n    *   The question asks for the **total number of all atoms** in salts A and B (i.e., in one formula unit of each).\n    *   **Atoms in NH₄NO₂:** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Atoms in NH₄NO₃:** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Total atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate moles of H2O produced\nmass_h2o = 3.60  # g\nmolar_mass_h2o = 18.015  # g/mol\nmoles_h2o = mass_h2o / molar_mass_h2o\n\n# Step 2: Calculate moles of O atoms that reacted with Cu\nmass_o_increase = 0.80  # g\nmolar_mass_o = 15.999  # g/mol\nmoles_o_atoms = mass_o_increase / molar_mass_o\n\n# Step 3: Calculate moles of the final gas C\nvolume_gas_c = 2.24  # L\nmolar_volume_stp = 22.4  # L/mol\nmoles_gas_c = volume_gas_c / molar_volume_stp\n\n# The analysis suggests the salts are NH4NO2 and NH4NO3 in an equimolar mixture.\n# Let x be the moles of each salt.\n# Reactions:\n# NH4NO2 -> N2 + 2 H2O\n# NH4NO3 -> N2O + 2 H2O\n# In tube 3: N2O + Cu -> N2 + CuO\n#\n# Moles of H2O = 2*x + 2*x = 4*x\n# So, x = moles_h2o / 4\nx = moles_h2o / 4\n\n# The oxidizing gas is N2O from NH4NO3, moles = x\n# Moles of O atoms in this N2O = x\n# The final gas C is N2.\n# Moles N2 = (from NH4NO2) + (from N2O decomp) = x + x = 2x\n#\n# Let's verify these values with our calculations.\n# x should be moles_o_atoms.

Is it?\n# Let's print the calculated values to see if they are consistent.\n# x_from_h2o = moles_h2o / 4\n# x_from_o = moles_o_atoms\n# x_from_n2 = moles_gas_c / 2\n\n# Since all evidence points to the salts being NH4NO2 and NH4NO3, we calculate the total atoms.\n# Salt A: NH4NO2\natoms_in_A = 2 + 4 + 2 # N, H, O\n\n# Salt B: NH4NO3\natoms_in_B = 2 + 4 + 3 # N, H, O\n\ntotal_atoms = atoms_in_A + atoms_in_B\nprint(total_atoms)\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "An equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B, is heated and decomposes completely into gases. Let's analyze the fate of these gases.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Products:**\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂)**: This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution)**: This solution is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. Since the mass did not change, no acidic gases were produced in the decomposition.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper)**: Hot copper acts as a reducing agent, reacting with oxidizing gases. The reaction forms copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n        *   Molar mass of an oxygen atom (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of oxygen atoms = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n    *   **Gas C**: After all reactions, 2.24 L of a gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert to all previous reagents.\n        *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n        *   An inert gas commonly formed from the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n2.  **Identifying the Salts:**\n    *   The decomposition products contain hydrogen (from H₂O), oxygen (from H₂O and the oxidizing gas), and nitrogen (from Gas C).\n    *   Since the salts decompose completely into gases, they likely contain the ammonium cation (NH₄⁺), which decomposes into gases. The anions must contain nitrogen and oxygen. Common candidates are nitrite (NO₂⁻) and nitrate (NO₃⁻).\n    *   Let's hypothesize that the salts are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n3.  **Verifying with Stoichiometry:**\n    *   The decomposition reactions at around 200°C are:\n        *   **Salt A (e.g., NH₄NO₂):** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n        *   **Salt B (e.g., NH₄NO₃):** NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n    *   The gas mixture entering the tubes is N₂, N₂O, and H₂O.\n    *   Tube 1 removes H₂O.\n    *   Tube 3 (hot copper) reacts with the oxidizing gas, N₂O: Cu(s) + N₂O(g) → CuO(s) + N₂(g).\n    *   The problem states the initial mixture was equimolar. Let's say we have 'x' moles of NH₄NO₂ and 'x' moles of NH₄NO₃.\n\n    *   **Check Moles:**\n        *   **H₂O:** From the reactions, moles of H₂O produced = 2x (from NH₄NO₂) + 2x (from NH₄NO₃) = 4x.\n            We know moles of H₂O = 0.2 mol. So, 4x = 0.2 mol, which means **x = 0.05 mol**.\n        *   **Oxygen:** The oxidizing gas is N₂O, and 'x' moles of it are produced. It contains 'x' moles of oxygen atoms. From our calculations, the moles of oxygen atoms = 0.05 mol. This confirms that x = 0.05 mol.\n        *   **Gas C (N₂):** The final gas is N₂. Its total moles come from two sources:\n            1.  'x' moles from the decomposition of NH₄NO₂.\n            2.  'x' moles from the reduction of N₂O by copper (N₂O → N₂).\n            Total moles of N₂ = x + x = 2x. Using x = 0.05 mol, we get Total N₂ = 0.1 mol. This matches our calculation for Gas C.\n        *   **Mass:** Let's verify the initial mass.\n            *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ ≈ 64.0 g/mol.\n            *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ ≈ 80.0 g/mol.\n            *   Total mass = (0.05 mol × 64.0 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 80.0 g/mol) = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g. This matches the given initial mass.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:**\n    The hypothesis is confirmed. The salts are A = NH₄NO₂ and B = NH₄NO₃ (or vice-versa). The question asks for the total number of atoms in both salts.\n    *   Number of atoms in one formula unit of NH₄NO₂ = 2(N) + 4(H) + 2(O) = 8 atoms.\n    *   Number of atoms in one formula unit of NH₄NO₃ = 2(N) + 4(H) + 3(O) = 9 atoms.\n    *   Total number of atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
