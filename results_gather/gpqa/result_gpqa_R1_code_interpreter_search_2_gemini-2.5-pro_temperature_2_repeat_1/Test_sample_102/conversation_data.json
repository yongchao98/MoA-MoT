    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Parent ring:** Benzene\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    *   A bromine atom (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The groups are at positions 1, 3, and 5. This is a \"meta, meta\" substitution pattern where all substituents are meta to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Properties of the Substituents**\n\nTo devise a synthesis, we must understand how each substituent affects further reactions on the benzene ring (its directing effect and its activating/deactivating effect).\n\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** This is a **deactivating** group and a **meta-director**. It is introduced via Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** This is a **deactivating** group and an **ortho-, para-director**. It is introduced via bromination.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** This is a strongly **deactivating** group and a **meta-director**. It is introduced via nitration.\n\nA critical rule in synthesis is that **Friedel-Crafts reactions (both acylation and alkylation) do not work on strongly deactivated rings**, such as those bearing a -NO₂ group.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nWe must start with benzene and add the three substituents in the correct order to achieve the 1,3,5-pattern.\n\n**Option A:** i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...\n\n*   **Step i: Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acetophenone.**\n    *   This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. Benzene is acylated to form acetophenone. The ring now has a meta-directing -COCH₃ group. This is a good first step.\n*   **Step ii: Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 3-Bromoacetophenone.**\n    *   The -COCH₃ group on acetophenone is a meta-director. Therefore, bromination occurs at the meta position (C3) to give 3-bromoacetophenone. Now we have substituents at positions 1 and 3. This is correct.\n*   **Step iii: 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.**\n    *   Now we nitrate the ring which has two substituents: -COCH₃ (at C1) and -Br (at C3).\n    *   The -COCH₃ group is a meta-director, so it directs the incoming -NO₂ group to position C5.\n    *   The -Br group is an ortho-, para-director, so it directs the incoming -NO₂ group to positions C2, C4, and C6.\n    *   There is a directing conflict. However, the -COCH₃ group is a strong deactivator, making the positions ortho and para to it (C2, C4, C6) very unreactive towards electrophilic attack. The nitration will preferentially occur at the position that is least deactivated, which is C5 (meta to the acetyl group). Both groups directing to C5, or at least the acetyl group not deactivating C5 as much as other positions, makes C5 the most likely site of reaction. Thus, this step produces the target molecule.\n\nThe first three steps of sequence A provide a logical and feasible route to the desired product. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) seem extraneous and would modify the final product, which contradicts the goal. However, compared to other options, this sequence has the only viable chemical logic to create the correct substitution pattern.\n\n**Option B:** i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...\n\n*   **Step i: Benzene → Nitrobenzene.**\n*   **Step ii: Nitrobenzene → Aniline.**\n*   **Step iii: Aniline + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃.** This reaction fails. The amino group (-NH₂) of aniline is a Lewis base and reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), deactivating the ring and preventing the Friedel-Crafts reaction. Even if we modify this to first form acetanilide, the -NHCOCH₃ group is an ortho-, para-director, which would lead to the wrong isomers in subsequent steps. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Option C:** i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ...\n\n*   **Step i: Benzene → Bromobenzene.**\n*   **Step ii: Bromobenzene + HNO₃/H₂SO₄.** The -Br group is an ortho-, para-director. This reaction would produce a mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. It does not produce the 1,3-isomer needed as an intermediate. This option leads to the wrong substitution pattern and is incorrect.\n\n**Option D:** i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) ... ; vi) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ...\n\n*   This sequence starts with the nitration of benzene. At some point (step vi), it attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a ring that is substituted with a bromine and (implied) a nitro group. As established, Friedel-Crafts acylation does not work on a ring that is strongly deactivated by a nitro group. Therefore, this sequence is not viable.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly the reaction sequence outlined in option A correctly utilizes the directing effects of the substituents to build the 1,3,5-substituted target molecule. The first step installs a meta-director, which then controls the position of the second substituent. Finally, the combined effects of the first two substituents direct the third group to the last remaining meta position. Despite the presence of confusing, superfluous steps at the end of option A, its core synthetic strategy is the only correct one among the choices.\n\n<<<A>>>"
