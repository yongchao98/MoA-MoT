    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product and Starting Material Structures**\n\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is a stereoisomer of `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a lactone, which is a cyclic ester. The structure is a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom and a carbonyl group (`-C=O`). The chirality, or stereochemistry, is at carbon 4, where an ethyl group is attached. We have two possible products: `(R)` and `(S)` enantiomers.\n\n    *   Structure of `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`: A six-membered ring `O-CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-C(=O)-`. The chiral center is the `CH(Et)` carbon.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options provided are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. Although the IUPAC name is a bit unconventional, the structure that makes chemical sense for these reactions is a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (3-ethylglutaric acid) where one carboxylic acid group is converted to an isobutyl ester.\n\n    *   Structure of starting material: `iBu-O-OC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`.\n    *   This molecule has two functional groups susceptible to reduction: an ester (`-COO-iBu`) and a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`).\n    *   It also has a stereocenter at carbon 3, `CH(Et)`, which will become carbon 4 in the final lactone product. The reactions described do not affect this stereocenter, meaning its configuration (R or S) will be retained in the product.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reagents and their Selectivity**\n\nThis problem hinges on understanding the selective reactivity of the two reducing agents, `LiBH4` and `BH3`.\n\n*   **BH3 (Borane):** Borane is a highly selective reducing agent. It is particularly effective at reducing carboxylic acids (`-COOH`) to primary alcohols (`-CH2OH`). Crucially, it reacts with carboxylic acids much faster than with esters. Therefore, `BH3` will selectively reduce the `-COOH` group while leaving the `-COO-iBu` group intact.\n\n*   **LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride):** Lithium borohydride is a stronger reducing agent than `NaBH4` but less reactive than `LiAlH4`. It can reduce esters to primary alcohols. In the presence of both an ester and a carboxylic acid, `LiBH4` shows selectivity for the ester. This is because the acidic proton of the carboxylic acid reacts first with the hydride reagent to form a lithium carboxylate salt (`-COO- Li+`) and H2 gas. This carboxylate salt is less electrophilic and thus less reactive towards further reduction compared to the ester group. Therefore, `LiBH4` will selectively reduce the ester group (`-COO-iBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`), leaving the carboxylic acid group untouched (as a salt until acidic workup).\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  Starting material A (`iBu-OOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`) reacts with `LiBH4`.\n    2.  `LiBH4` selectively reduces the **ester** group to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid is deprotonated.\n    3.  The intermediate is `HO-CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO- Li+`.\n    4.  Acidic workup (`H+`) protonates the carboxylate to form a hydroxy-carboxylic acid: `HO-CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`.\n    5.  This hydroxy-acid undergoes acid-catalyzed intramolecular cyclization (esterification) to form the six-membered lactone, `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions occur at the functional groups (ester and acid), not at the chiral center (`C3-Et`). Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is preserved in the product. Since the product is the `(R)` enantiomer, the starting material A must also be the `(R)` enantiomer.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** `A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  Starting material B (`iBu-OOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`) reacts with `BH3`.\n    2.  `BH3` selectively reduces the **carboxylic acid** group to a primary alcohol.\n    3.  After workup, the intermediate is a hydroxy-ester: `iBu-OOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`.\n    4.  Under acidic conditions (`H+`), this hydroxy-ester undergoes intramolecular transesterification. The alcohol group attacks the ester's carbonyl carbon, displacing isobutanol (`iBu-OH`) and forming the six-membered lactone, `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the chiral center is not affected. The stereochemistry is retained. Since the product is the `(S)` enantiomer, the starting material B must also be the `(S)` enantiomer.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** `B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material **A** is the **(R)-isomer**.\n*   Starting material **B** is the **(S)-isomer**.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
