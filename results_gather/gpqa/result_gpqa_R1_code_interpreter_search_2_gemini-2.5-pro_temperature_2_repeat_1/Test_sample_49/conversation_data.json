    "This is an excellent question that tests knowledge of the structure of calculations in quantum field theory. Let's break down the expression to figure out the number of loops in the Feynman diagram.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the given expression:**\n    The expression provided is `alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`.\n    In quantum field theory, the result of a calculation for a Feynman diagram amplitude can typically be factored into several parts:\n    *   **Coupling constants:** These represent the strength of the interactions. Here, we have `alpha^3` and `g^2`. `alpha` and `g` are coupling constants. The powers indicate how many times the corresponding interactions (vertices) appear in the diagram.\n    *   **Numerical factors:** These come from various sources like symmetry factors of the diagram, traces over gamma matrices, or group theory factors. Here, `sqrt(2)` and `8` are such factors.\n    *   **Kinematic factors:** These involve external momenta and masses of particles. The term `(Q/M)^2` is a typical kinematic factor, representing the ratio of two energy scales (`Q` and `M`).\n    *   **Loop factors:** This is the crucial part. When calculating diagrams with closed loops, one has to integrate over the momentum circulating in each loop. These integrations produce characteristic factors involving `pi`.\n\n2.  **Identify the loop factor:**\n    The key to finding the number of loops lies in the `1/(4pi)^6` term.\n    In a quantum field theory in four-dimensional spacetime, every loop corresponds to an integral over an undetermined four-momentum, let's call it `k`. The integration measure is `d^4k / (2pi)^4`.\n\n3.  **The mathematics of loop integrals:**\n    For a single loop, the integral is of the form `âˆ« d^4k / (2pi)^4 * f(k)`, where `f(k)` depends on the propagators in the loop.\n    When this integral is performed (often using techniques like Wick rotation and dimensional regularization), the four-dimensional integration over the loop momentum `k` consistently produces a geometric factor of `1 / (16pi^2)`.\n    We can write `16pi^2` as `(4pi)^2`. So, a **single loop** in a 4D theory contributes a factor of `1 / (4pi)^2` to the amplitude.\n\n4.  **Generalize for L loops:**\n    If a diagram has `L` independent loops, there will be `L` independent loop momenta to integrate over. This leads to `L` such integrations, and the resulting overall factor will be the single-loop factor raised to the power of `L`.\n    Factor from `L` loops = `(1 / (4pi)^2)^L = 1 / (4pi)^(2L)`.\n\n5.  **Solve for the number of loops (L):**\n    We are given that the expression for the diagram contains the factor `1 / (4pi)^6`.\n    By comparing this with the general formula, we can set up an equation:\n    `1 / (4pi)^(2L) = 1 / (4pi)^6`\n    Now, we just need to equate the exponents in the denominator:\n    `2L = 6`\n    Solving for `L` gives:\n    `L = 3`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The presence of the factor `1/(4pi)^6` is a strong and standard indicator that the calculation involved three loop integrals. The other terms in the expression (`alpha^3`, `g^2`, etc.) are entirely consistent with what one would expect for a three-loop diagram in a complex theory.\n\nTherefore, the Feynman diagram must have contained 3 loops.\n\n<<<C>>>"
