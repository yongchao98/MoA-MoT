    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Number of Protons and Fragments:**\n\n*   The data provides signals for a total of 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons.\n*   Let's check the molecular formulas of the potential compounds:\n    *   Propenyl acetate (C5H8O2): 5 Carbons, 8 Hydrogens, 2 Oxygens. This matches the total proton count.\n    *   Butenyl acetate (C6H10O2): 6 Carbons, 10 Hydrogens, 2 Oxygens. This does not match the proton count.\n*   Based on the proton count alone, we can eliminate **Cis-butenyl acetate** and **Trans-butenyl acetate**. The compound must be a propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Analyze Individual Signals and Coupling:**\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is characteristic of protons on a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group (an acetyl group, -C(=O)CH3).\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Corresponds to three equivalent protons, a methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (s - singlet):** There are no adjacent protons, which is consistent with an acetyl group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This signal confirms the presence of an acetate group in the molecule.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is in the allylic region (protons on a carbon adjacent to a C=C double bond).\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Corresponds to a methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d - doublet):** The methyl protons are split by one neighboring proton. This suggests a -CH-CH3 fragment.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This indicates a methyl group attached to the double bond.\n\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** This is in the vinylic region (protons directly on a C=C double bond).\n    *   **Integration (1H):** Corresponds to one proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq - doublet of quartets):** This proton is coupled to two different sets of neighbors. The \"doublet\" part means it's coupled to one adjacent proton. The \"quartet\" part means it is coupled to three other adjacent protons (a methyl group).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This proton is on the double bond and is adjacent to both another vinylic proton and a methyl group. This fits the `CH3-CH=` part of the propenyl group.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** A very downfield signal in the vinylic region. This is expected for a vinylic proton attached to a carbon that is also bonded to an electronegative atom like oxygen (C=CH-O).\n    *   **Integration (1H):** Corresponds to one proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d - doublet):** This proton is coupled to only one neighboring proton.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is the crucial piece of information for determining the stereochemistry. The coupling constant between two protons across a double bond (vinylic coupling) is stereochemistry-dependent:\n        *   **Trans** coupling (protons on opposite sides of the double bond) is typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n        *   **Cis** coupling (protons on the same side of the double bond) is smaller, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The J value of 16.0 Hz strongly indicates a **trans** relationship between the two vinylic protons.\n\n**3. Assemble the Structure:**\n\n*   We have confirmed the presence of an acetate group (`-O-C(=O)CH3`) and a propenyl group (`CH3-CH=CH-`).\n*   The coupling pattern confirms the connectivity: `CH3-CH=CH-O-C(=O)CH3`.\n*   The large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) confirms the `trans` stereochemistry around the double bond.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
