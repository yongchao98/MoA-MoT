    "Here's a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** The core of the question is to compare two different mean free paths (MFP) in the same physical environment (the sample chamber of a TEM).\n    *   **λ1:** The mean free path of gas molecules colliding with *each other*.\n    *   **λ2:** The mean free path of beam electrons scattering off those *same* gas molecules.\n    *   The key parameters are:\n        *   Number density of gas molecules (`n`): This is the same for both calculations, as the pressure, volume, and temperature of the gas are constant.\n        *   Collision partners: Gas-gas vs. Electron-gas.\n        *   Energy of colliding particles: The gas molecules are at thermal energy. The electrons are at very high energy (1000 kV).\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Mean Free Path (MFP):**\n    The general formula for MFP (`λ`) is:\n    `λ = 1 / (n * σ)`\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the number density of the target particles.\n    *   `σ` is the collision (or scattering) cross-section.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Two Scenarios:**\n    Since the number density `n` of the gas molecules is the same for both `λ1` and `λ2`, the difference between them must come from the difference in their respective collision cross-sections.\n    *   `λ1 ∝ 1 / σ1` (where `σ1` is the gas-gas collision cross-section)\n    *   `λ2 ∝ 1 / σ2` (where `σ2` is the electron-gas scattering cross-section)\n\n4.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ1 vs. σ2):**\n    *   **σ1 (Gas-Gas Collision):** This is the \"kinetic cross-section.\" It describes the effective area for a collision between two gas molecules. These molecules are neutral, of roughly the same size, and move at relatively low thermal speeds. Their interaction is governed by short-range van der Waals forces. We can model them as hard spheres of diameter `d`. The cross-section for a collision between two such spheres is `σ1 = πd²`. Due to the relative motion of all molecules, a correction factor of `√2` is introduced in the denominator of the full MFP formula, but for comparing the cross-sections themselves, `σ1` is determined by the physical size of the molecules. It's a relatively large value.\n\n    *   **σ2 (Electron-Gas Scattering):** This describes the effective area for a high-energy electron to be scattered by a gas molecule. Here, the situation is vastly different:\n        *   **Size:** The electron is a point-like particle compared to the gas molecule.\n        *   **Energy:** The electron has extremely high energy (1000 keV), meaning it's moving at a relativistic speed (close to the speed of light).\n        *   **Interaction:** Due to its immense speed, the electron spends very little time in the vicinity of any single gas molecule. This drastically reduces the probability of an interaction (scattering) occurring. The scattering cross-section for high-energy charged particles is known to be very small and decreases with increasing energy.\n\n5.  **Form the Conclusion about Cross-Sections:**\n    A slow, large molecule moving through a crowd of other molecules (`σ1`) is much more likely to collide than a tiny, hyper-fast particle zipping through the same crowd (`σ2`).\n    Therefore, the gas-gas kinetic cross-section is much larger than the high-energy electron-gas scattering cross-section.\n    `σ1 >> σ2`\n\n6.  **Relate Back to Mean Free Path:**\n    Since the mean free path is *inversely* proportional to the cross-section:\n    *   `λ = 1 / (n * σ)`\n    Because `σ1 >> σ2`, it must follow that `λ1 << λ2`.\n\n    In physical terms, the electrons will travel a much, much longer average distance before being scattered by a residual gas molecule than a gas molecule will travel before colliding with another gas molecule.\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) λ2 < λ1 (Incorrect)\n    *   B) λ2 = λ1... (Incorrect)\n    *   C) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 (Incorrect, the difference is much larger than 22%)\n    *   D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 (Correct)\n\n    This option correctly states that `λ2` is larger than `λ1`. While the actual ratio `λ2/λ1` is likely several orders of magnitude, this inequality is mathematically sound and is the only choice that reflects the correct physical relationship. The number 1.22 is simply a value greater than 1 used to construct the option.\n\n<<<D>>>"
