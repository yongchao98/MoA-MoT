    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reaction Analysis\n\n1.  **Product 1: Acetic acid + Br2, pyridine, acetic anhydride**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is an α-bromination of a carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. Acetic acid (CH3COOH) has one α-carbon (the methyl group). One of the α-hydrogens is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n2.  **Product 2: Product 1 + ethanol, H2SO4 (acid catalyst)**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester. The carboxyl group (-COOH) of bromoacetic acid reacts with ethanol (CH3CH2OH).\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n3.  **Product 3: Product 2 + sodium cyanide (NaCN)**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻), a strong nucleophile, attacks the primary carbon bearing the bromine atom, displacing the bromide ion (Br⁻).\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3).\n\n4.  **Final Product 4: Product 3 + excess NaH + 1,5-dibromopentane**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a multi-step process involving deprotonation and alkylation.\n        *   **Deprotonation:** Ethyl cyanoacetate has highly acidic α-hydrogens on the methylene group (-CH2-), as it is flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (a cyano group, -CN, and an ester group, -COOEt). Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, removes one of these protons to form a resonance-stabilized enolate anion: Na⁺[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻.\n        *   **First Alkylation:** The enolate anion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br) in an SN2 reaction, displacing one bromide. This forms the mono-alkylated intermediate: NC-CH((CH2)5Br)-COOEt.\n        *   **Second Deprotonation:** The problem states that **excess** NaH is used. This implies there is enough base to remove the second, remaining α-hydrogen from the mono-alkylated intermediate, forming a new enolate: Na⁺[NC-C((CH2)5Br)-COOEt]⁻.\n        *   **Intramolecular Cyclization:** This new anion undergoes a very favorable intramolecular SN2 reaction. The nucleophilic carbon attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide and forming a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Structure of Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n        ```\n              CN\n              |\n            C - COOCH2CH3\n           / \\\n          CH2 CH2\n          |   |\n          CH2 CH2\n           \\ /\n            CH2\n        ```\n\n### 1H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 4\n\nThe question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogens, which requires analyzing the molecule's symmetry and the stereochemical relationships between protons. We assume the spectrum is taken at room temperature, allowing for rapid conformational changes (chair flips) of the cyclohexane ring.\n\n1.  **Symmetry:** Due to rapid chair flipping, the time-averaged conformation of ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate possesses a plane of symmetry (Cs). This plane passes through C1 (the quaternary carbon), the cyano group, the ester group, and the C4 carbon of the ring. This symmetry has important consequences:\n    *   Carbon C2 is equivalent to C6.\n    *   Carbon C3 is equivalent to C5.\n\n2.  **Counting the Distinct Hydrogen Signals:**\n    *   **Ethyl Group (-OCH2CH3):**\n        *   **-CH3 protons (3H):** These three protons are equivalent due to free rotation around the C-C bond. They will produce **1 signal**.\n        *   **-CH2- protons (2H):** The molecule is achiral. The two protons of the methylene group are rendered equivalent by the molecule's plane of symmetry (they are enantiotopic). Thus, they are chemically equivalent in a standard NMR experiment and will produce **1 signal**.\n\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:** In a substituted cyclohexane, even with rapid flipping, the time-averaged environments of axial and equatorial protons are different. Geminal protons (on the same carbon) are diastereotopic unless related by a local symmetry element.\n        *   **C2 and C6 protons (4H total):** The axial and equatorial protons at C2 are diastereotopic. The same is true for C6. Due to the plane of symmetry, the two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) are chemically equivalent. The two equatorial protons (one on C2, one on C6) are also chemically equivalent. However, the axial protons are not equivalent to the equatorial protons. This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n        *   **C3 and C5 protons (4H total):** The same logic applies. The two axial protons (at C3 and C5) are equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons (at C3 and C5) are equivalent to each other. This gives another **2 distinct signals**.\n        *   **C4 protons (2H total):** The axial and equatorial protons at C4 are not interchanged by the plane of symmetry (which contains the C1-C4 bond axis but the H atoms are puckered out of the plane) and are diastereotopic with respect to the substituents at C1. Therefore, they are chemically distinct. This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n\n3.  **Total Count:**\n    *   From the ethyl group: 1 (for CH3) + 1 (for CH2) = 2 signals\n    *   From the cyclohexane ring: 2 (for C2/C6) + 2 (for C3/C5) + 2 (for C4) = 6 signals\n    *   **Total = 2 + 6 = 8 signals.**\n\nThe 8 chemically distinct types of hydrogens are:\n1.  Ethyl -CH3\n2.  Ethyl -OCH2-\n3.  Axial protons at C2 and C6\n4.  Equatorial protons at C2 and C6\n5.  Axial protons at C3 and C5\n6.  Equatorial protons at C3 and C5\n7.  Axial proton at C4\n8.  Equatorial proton at C4\n\nThe question explicitly asks to count all chemically distinct hydrogens, even if they are not easily distinguishable in a practical spectrum. Therefore, the theoretical count based on diastereotopicity is the correct approach.\n\n<<<C>>>"
