Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum**\n*   **A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a definitive spectroscopic signature for the O-H stretch of a **carboxylic acid** (-COOH). The extreme broadness is caused by strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding between acid molecules.\n*   **A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Combined with the broad O-H peak, it confirms the presence of a **carboxylic acid**.\n*   **A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (**alkene, C=C**).\n*   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n**2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** This is an explicit confirmation of the FTIR data. Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond, which definitively confirms the presence of an **alkene** group.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Mass Spectrometry Data**\n*   **A fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a classic and highly diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the mass of the **carboxyl cation, [COOH]⁺**. (Mass calculation: 12.01 (C) + 2 * 16.00 (O) + 1.01 (H) ≈ 45). This strongly corroborates the presence of the carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**4. Synthesizing the Evidence and Evaluating the Candidate Formulas**\nThe combined evidence from all three techniques points to a single conclusion: the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This provides two critical constraints for determining the correct molecular formula.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The Number of Oxygen Atoms.** Since the compound is a carboxylic acid (-COOH), its molecular formula must contain exactly **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates the options that contain only one oxygen atom.\n    *   A) C6H12O2 (Possible)\n    *   B) C6H10O (**Eliminated**)\n    *   C) C6H12O (**Eliminated**)\n    *   D) C6H10O2 (Possible)\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU).** The DoU indicates the total number of pi bonds and rings in a molecule. Our compound contains one C=O double bond (in the acid) and one C=C double bond (in the alkene). Therefore, it must have a total DoU of **2**. We can calculate the DoU for the remaining options using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   For **A) C6H12O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid and does not allow for the C=C bond confirmed by FTIR and NMR. This formula corresponds to a saturated carboxylic acid (e.g., hexanoic acid) and is therefore incorrect.\n    *   For **D) C6H10O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DoU of 2 perfectly matches the structural requirements derived from the spectra (one C=O bond and one C=C bond).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly the molecular formula **C6H10O2** satisfies all the spectroscopic evidence. It has the two oxygen atoms required for a carboxylic acid and the two degrees of unsaturation required for both the carbonyl and the alkene double bonds.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on the analysis of the candidate answers and the spectroscopic data, here is a step-by-step breakdown to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Spectroscopic Evidence**\n\nThere is a complete consensus among all candidate answers regarding the interpretation of the spectral data, and their analysis is chemically sound.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The combination of a very broad absorption peak at ~3000 cm⁻¹ (O-H stretch, broadened by H-bonding) and a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ (C=O stretch) is a definitive signature for a **carboxylic acid** functional group (-COOH).\n    *   The strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (**alkene**, C=C), indicating the molecule is unsaturated.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The observation of \"vinyl-hydrogens\" explicitly confirms the presence of hydrogens on a C=C double bond, providing direct evidence for the **alkene** group.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   The fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic diagnostic tool. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl cation, **[COOH]⁺** (Mass = 12.01 (C) + 2 * 16.00 (O) + 1.01 (H) ≈ 45). This strongly confirms the carboxylic acid group.\n\n**2. Synthesis of Conclusions**\n\nAll three analytical techniques consistently prove that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This leads to two critical requirements for the correct molecular formula:\n\n*   **Requirement 1 (Oxygen Count):** It must be a carboxylic acid, so the formula must contain **two oxygen atoms (O₂) **.\n*   **Requirement 2 (Degree of Unsaturation):** The \"degree of unsaturation\" (DoU) indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds. The molecule has one C=O bond and one C=C bond, so it must have a **total DoU of 2**.\n\n**3. Evaluation of the Candidate Formulas**\n\nLet's evaluate the given options against these two requirements. The options are A) C6H10O, B) C6H12O, C) C6H10O2, and D) C6H12O2.\n\n*   **Step 1: Apply Oxygen Count Requirement.**\n    We must have two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates:\n    *   A) C6H10O (only 1 oxygen)\n    *   B) C6H12O (only 1 oxygen)\n\n    This leaves us with **C) C6H10O2** and **D) C6H12O2**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Apply Degree of Unsaturation Requirement.**\n    We must have a DoU of 2. We use the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   **For C) C6H10O2:**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This perfectly matches the requirement for one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n    *   **For D) C6H12O2:**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This is incorrect. A DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O bond, implying a saturated molecule (like hexanoic acid), which contradicts the clear evidence of a C=C bond from FTIR and NMR.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only molecular formula that satisfies all experimental evidence is **C6H10O2**. It has the two oxygen atoms required for a carboxylic acid and the two degrees of unsaturation required to account for both the carbonyl and alkene double bonds. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n**1. Analysis of Spectroscopic Data**\n\nThe first step is to interpret the information provided by each characterization technique to identify the functional groups present in the unknown compound.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The broadness is a key indicator that distinguishes it from an alcohol's O-H peak.\n    *   A **strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Its presence, combined with the broad O-H peak, confirms the carboxylic acid functional group.\n    *   A **strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), indicating the molecule contains an **alkene** functional group and is therefore unsaturated.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of **\"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\"** is explicit confirmation of the C=C double bond. Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a double bond.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   The **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is highly diagnostic. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl cation, **[COOH]⁺**, calculated as: 12 (Carbon) + 16 (Oxygen) + 16 (Oxygen) + 1 (Hydrogen) = 45. This strongly confirms the presence of the carboxylic acid group.\n\n**2. Synthesis of Evidence**\n\nThe combined data from all three techniques leads to a definitive conclusion about the structure of the unknown:\n*   The compound contains a **carboxylic acid** group (-COOH).\n*   The compound contains an **alkene** group (C=C).\n*   Therefore, the unknown is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n\n**3. Evaluation of the Molecular Formula Options**\n\nWe can now use these structural requirements to evaluate the candidate formulas provided in the question's list: A) C6H10O, B) C6H10O2, C) C6H12O2, and D) C6H12O.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The Number of Oxygen Atoms**\n    *   Since the molecule is a carboxylic acid (-COOH), its formula **must contain two oxygen atoms**.\n    *   This immediately eliminates option **A) C6H10O** and option **D) C6H12O**, which each have only one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with two possibilities: **B) C6H10O2** and **C) C6H12O2**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation represents the total number of pi bonds and rings in a molecule. Our analysis shows the molecule must have at least two degrees of unsaturation: one for the C=O bond in the carboxylic acid and one for the C=C bond of the alkene.\n    *   The required DoU = 1 (for C=O) + 1 (for C=C) = **2**.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the two remaining options using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`:\n        *   **For C) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU is incorrect. It only accounts for the C=O bond, implying a saturated structure, which contradicts the FTIR and NMR evidence for a C=C bond.\n        *   **For B) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DoU of 2 perfectly matches our requirement for one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only molecular formula that is consistent with all the spectroscopic data is **C6H10O2**. It has the correct number of oxygen atoms for a carboxylic acid and the correct degree of unsaturation (2) to account for both the carbonyl and the alkene double bonds. Based on the options provided in the question, this formula corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on a careful review of the problem and the candidate responses.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Spectroscopic Data**\n\nThe first step is to interpret the provided spectral data to identify the functional groups present in the unknown compound. There is a strong consensus among all candidate answers on this interpretation.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum**:\n    *   The combination of a **very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** (O-H stretch, broadened by hydrogen bonding) and a **strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** (C=O carbonyl stretch) is a definitive signature for a **carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH)**.\n    *   The additional **strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, which means the compound is an alkene.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum**:\n    *   The explicit mention of **\"vinyl-hydrogens\"** provides unambiguous confirmation of the C=C double bond (alkene), as these are protons directly attached to the carbons of the double bond.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry**:\n    *   A **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a highly diagnostic piece of evidence. This mass corresponds precisely to the [COOH]⁺ fragment (mass of Carbon (12) + 2 * mass of Oxygen (16) + mass of Hydrogen (1) = 45). This strongly corroborates the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from Spectral Data**: The compound is definitively an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n\n**2. Evaluating the Chemical Formula Options**\n\nBased on the spectral analysis, the correct molecular formula must satisfy two critical requirements:\n1.  **It must contain two oxygen atoms** to form the carboxylic acid group.\n2.  **It must have a Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of 2** to account for the two double bonds present (one C=O and one C=C).\n\nLet's evaluate the four choices given in the prompt against these requirements. The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated with the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **C6H12O (Choice B)**: Fails. It only has one oxygen and cannot be a carboxylic acid. Its DoU is 1.\n*   **C6H10O (Choice C)**: Fails. It only has one oxygen and cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n*   **C6H12O2 (Choice D)**: Fails. While it has two oxygens, its Degree of Unsaturation is `DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1`. A DoU of 1 can only account for the C=O of the carboxylic acid, implying the carbon chain is saturated. This contradicts the FTIR and NMR evidence for a C=C bond.\n*   **C6H10O2 (Choice A)**: **Success**. It has two oxygen atoms. Its Degree of Unsaturation is `DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2`. This DoU of 2 perfectly accounts for both the C=O bond of the acid and the C=C bond of the alkene.\n\n**3. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe chemical reasoning is straightforward and robust. The only formula that fits all the pieces of spectroscopic evidence is **C6H10O2**. According to the question's list of options, this formula corresponds to choice A.\n\nThe candidate answers all performed the chemical reasoning correctly, but some were inconsistent in mapping their final correct formula to the provided lettered choices. By following the logic and mapping it directly to the prompt's list, the correct answer is unambiguously determined.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic sign of an O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid (-COOH), broadened by extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Together with the broad O-H peak, this confirms the presence of a **carboxylic acid functional group**.\n    *   A strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=C (alkene) double bond stretch.\n    *   *Conclusion from FTIR*: The molecule is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **Analyze 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   The observation of \"vinyl-hydrogens\" is direct proof of the presence of an **alkene (C=C)** functional group, as these are the hydrogens attached directly to the double-bonded carbons. This confirms the FTIR analysis.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a highly diagnostic piece of evidence for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl cation fragment, [COOH]⁺.\n    *   Calculation: (1 × mass of Carbon) + (2 × mass of Oxygen) + (1 × mass of Hydrogen) = 12 + (2 × 16) + 1 = 45. This strongly confirms the **carboxylic acid group**.\n\n4.  **Synthesize Evidence and Evaluate Candidate Formulas:**\n    *   The combined data from all three techniques conclusively proves the molecule contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n    *   **Requirement 1: Oxygen Count.** The presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) mandates that the molecular formula must contain **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options C) C6H12O and D) C6H10O.\n\n    *   **Requirement 2: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU).** The DoU represents the sum of all pi bonds and rings in a molecule. The evidence requires a minimum DoU of 2:\n        *   One degree of unsaturation from the C=O bond in the carboxylic acid.\n        *   One degree of unsaturation from the C=C bond of the alkene.\n        *   Total required DoU = 2.\n\n    *   We now compare the remaining options, A) C6H10O2 and B) C6H12O2, by calculating their DoU using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n        *   For **B) C6H12O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. A DoU of 1 can only account for the C=O bond, implying a saturated molecule. This contradicts the FTIR and NMR data showing a C=C bond.\n        *   For **A) C6H10O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. A DoU of 2 perfectly matches the two required double bonds (one C=O and one C=C).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only molecular formula that satisfies all the spectroscopic evidence is **C6H10O2**. It has the required two oxygen atoms for a carboxylic acid and the correct degree of unsaturation (2) to account for both the carbonyl and the alkene double bonds. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided data and the reasoning from the other agents.\n\n**1. Analysis of Spectroscopic Data**\n\nThe candidate answers are unanimous and correct in their interpretation of the spectral data. Let's consolidate the key findings:\n\n*   **FTIR Analysis:**\n    *   The combination of a very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ (O-H stretch, broadened by hydrogen bonding) and a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ (C=O stretch) is the definitive signature of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group.\n    *   A second strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, indicating the molecule is an alkene.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **1H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The observation of \"vinyl-hydrogens\" provides explicit confirmation of the C=C double bond, as these are protons directly attached to the alkene carbons. This supports the FTIR data.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is highly diagnostic. This mass corresponds precisely to the carboxyl cation, **[COOH]⁺** (mass = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45). This provides a third, independent confirmation of the carboxylic acid group.\n\n**2. Establishing Critical Requirements for the Formula**\n\nSynthesizing the information above leads to two non-negotiable requirements for the correct molecular formula:\n*   **Careful Point 1: It must contain two oxygen atoms.** The confirmed presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group means the formula must be of the form CₓHᵧO₂.\n*   **Careful Point 2: It must have a Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of 2.** The Degree of Unsaturation represents the sum of all pi bonds and rings. The data confirms one pi bond from the carbonyl (C=O) of the acid and a second pi bond from the alkene (C=C). Therefore, the total DoU must be 2.\n\n**3. Evaluating the Candidate Formulas**\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options against these two critical requirements. The formula for the Degree of Unsaturation is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **A) C6H10O:**\n    *   Oxygen count: 1. Fails Requirement 1. It cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **B) C6H12O:**\n    *   Oxygen count: 1. Fails Requirement 1. It cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **C) C6H10O2:**\n    *   Oxygen count: 2. Passes Requirement 1.\n    *   DoU calculation: `6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2`. Passes Requirement 2. This is a perfect match for an unsaturated carboxylic acid with one C=C bond.\n\n*   **D) C6H12O2:**\n    *   Oxygen count: 2. Passes Requirement 1.\n    *   DoU calculation: `6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1`. Fails Requirement 2. A DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O of the carboxylic acid, implying the carbon chain is saturated. This contradicts the FTIR and NMR evidence for a C=C bond.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemical reasoning across all candidate answers is sound and leads to the correct molecular formula. The only formula that satisfies all the experimental data—having two oxygens and a degree of unsaturation of two—is **C6H10O2**. Based on the options provided in the question, this corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula by synthesizing the provided reasoning and data.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Functional Groups from the Spectroscopic Data**\n\nThe first and most critical step is to interpret what each piece of spectroscopic data tells us about the unknown compound's functional groups. The provided candidate answers show a strong and correct consensus on these points.\n\n*   **FTIR Analysis:**\n    *   A **very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** and a **strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** together are a definitive signature of a **carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH)**. The first peak is the O-H stretch (broadened by hydrogen bonding), and the second is the C=O stretch.\n    *   A **strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, which means the molecule is an alkene.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The observation of **\"vinyl-hydrogens\"** is explicit proof of hydrogens attached to a C=C double bond. This independently confirms the molecule is an **alkene**, supporting the FTIR conclusion.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   The **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a highly diagnostic piece of evidence. This mass corresponds precisely to the **carboxyl cation, [COOH]⁺** (Carbon=12, Oxygen=16, Oxygen=16, Hydrogen=1; Total = 45). This strongly confirms the presence of the carboxylic acid group.\n\n**Step 2: Establish the Requirements for the Molecular Formula**\n\nBased on the unambiguous conclusions from Step 1, the correct molecular formula must satisfy two key requirements:\n\n1.  **It must contain two oxygen atoms (O₂) to form a carboxylic acid group.**\n2.  **It must be unsaturated with a degree of unsaturation (DoU) of at least 2.** The DoU (number of rings + pi bonds) must account for the C=O bond in the acid (1 DoU) and the C=C bond in the alkene chain (1 DoU). Therefore, the total DoU must be exactly 2.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Formulas Against the Requirements**\n\nLet's test the four given options against our two requirements. The formula for Degree of Unsaturation is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **A) C6H10O:**\n    *   **Oxygen Count:** Fails. It only has one oxygen, so it cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n*   **B) C6H10O2:**\n    *   **Oxygen Count:** Passes. It has two oxygen atoms.\n    *   **DoU Calculation:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Passes. The DoU of 2 perfectly matches the requirement for one C=O bond and one C=C bond. **This is a perfect match for all the evidence.**\n*   **C) C6H12O:**\n    *   **Oxygen Count:** Fails. It only has one oxygen, so it cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n*   **D) C6H12O2:**\n    *   **Oxygen Count:** Passes. It has two oxygen atoms.\n    *   **DoU Calculation:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Fails. A DoU of 1 can only account for the C=O bond, implying the rest of the molecule is saturated. This contradicts the clear FTIR and NMR evidence for a C=C bond.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nThe only chemical formula that satisfies all the conditions derived from the spectral data is **C6H10O2**. It has two oxygen atoms, allowing for a carboxylic acid, and a degree of unsaturation of 2, allowing for both the carbonyl and the alkene double bonds. The candidate answers, despite some clerical errors in selecting the final letter, unanimously support this scientific conclusion through their reasoning.\n\nThe correct formula C6H10O2 corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula by synthesizing the provided reasoning from other agents.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Spectroscopic Evidence**\nThere is a strong and correct consensus among all candidate answers regarding the interpretation of the spectral data.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The combination of a **very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** and a **strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** is definitively identified as a **carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH)**. The broad peak is the hydrogen-bonded O-H stretch, and the 1700 cm⁻¹ peak is the C=O carbonyl stretch.\n    *   The **strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is correctly assigned to a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, indicating the molecule is an alkene.\n    *   *Conclusion:* The unknown is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **1H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The presence of **\"vinyl-hydrogens\"** is correctly noted as explicit confirmation of the C=C double bond, supporting the FTIR analysis.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   The **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is unanimously and correctly identified as the carboxyl cation, **[COOH]⁺**. This is a classic fragmentation pattern that provides strong, independent confirmation of the carboxylic acid group (Mass = 12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45).\n\n**2. Synthesis and Logical Deduction**\nThe analysis leads to two critical requirements that the correct molecular formula must meet:\n\n*   **Requirement 1: It must contain two oxygen atoms.** A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contains two oxygen atoms. This requirement immediately eliminates the formulas C6H12O and C6H10O.\n*   **Requirement 2: It must have a Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of 2.** The DoU (also called double bond equivalent) is the sum of all pi bonds and rings in a molecule. Our analysis has identified two pi bonds:\n    1.  One C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid.\n    2.  One C=C double bond in the alkene chain.\n    Therefore, the total DoU must be 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n**3. Evaluation of the Remaining Options**\nWe are left to choose between **C6H10O2** and **C6H12O2**. We will calculate the DoU for each using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`\n\n*   **For C6H12O2:**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n    *   This DoU is insufficient. It only accounts for the C=O bond of the acid and implies the rest of the molecule is saturated, which contradicts the clear evidence for a C=C bond from FTIR and NMR.\n\n*   **For C6H10O2:**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n    *   This DoU is a perfect match. It accommodates both the C=O bond and the C=C bond, making it fully consistent with all the spectroscopic data.\n\n**4. Final Decision**\nThe scientific reasoning presented in all the candidate answers correctly converges on the conclusion that the chemical formula must be **C6H10O2**. Many of the candidate answers selected an incorrect final letter due to clerical errors in mapping their correct formula back to the original options list. Based on the initial question's options:\n\nA) C6H12O\nB) C6H12O2\nC) C6H10O\nD) C6H10O2\n\nThe correct formula **C6H10O2** corresponds to option **D**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on a thorough review of the provided spectroscopic data and the candidate answers.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Spectroscopic Data**\n\nThe first step is to interpret each piece of data to determine the functional groups present in the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic and definitive signature of the O-H stretch of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl region and represents a C=O double bond. Combined with the broad O-H peak, it confirms the **carboxylic acid** group.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (**C=C**), indicating the presence of an **alkene** functional group. The molecule is unsaturated.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **\"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\"**: This is explicit confirmation of a C=C double bond. Vinyl-hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of an alkene. This supports the conclusion from the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45**: This is a highly diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. The mass corresponds to the **carboxyl cation, [COOH]⁺**.\n        *   Calculation: Mass of Carbon (12) + 2 x Mass of Oxygen (16) + Mass of Hydrogen (1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45 amu.\n    *   This provides a third, independent piece of evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n\n### **Step 2: Synthesize the Evidence and Determine Requirements for the Formula**\n\nFrom the combined spectroscopic data, we can be highly confident about two key features of the molecule:\n1.  It contains a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**.\n2.  It contains an **alkene group (C=C)**.\n\nThese features place specific constraints on the possible molecular formula:\n*   **Constraint 1 (Oxygen Count):** A carboxylic acid contains two oxygen atoms. Therefore, the correct formula must be of the form CₓHᵧ**O₂**.\n*   **Constraint 2 (Degree of Unsaturation - DoU):** The DoU indicates the number of rings and pi bonds. Our molecule has one pi bond in the C=O group and one pi bond in the C=C group, for a total **required DoU of 2**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Formulas**\n\nLet's evaluate the options provided in the question based on these two constraints.\nThe options are:\nA) C6H12O2\nB) C6H12O\nC) C6H10O\nD) C6H10O2\n\n*   **Applying Constraint 1 (Oxygen Count):** The formula must have two oxygen atoms.\n    *   A) C6H12O2: Correct (2 oxygens)\n    *   B) C6H12O: Incorrect (1 oxygen) -> **Eliminate**\n    *   C) C6H10O: Incorrect (1 oxygen) -> **Eliminate**\n    *   D) C6H10O2: Correct (2 oxygens)\n\nWe are left with options A and D.\n\n*   **Applying Constraint 2 (Degree of Unsaturation):** The formula must have a DoU of 2. We use the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   For **A) C6H12O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU is incorrect. It can only account for the C=O bond of the acid, implying a saturated structure, which contradicts the FTIR and NMR data.\n    *   For **D) C6H10O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DoU of 2 is a perfect match. It accounts for both the C=O bond and the C=C bond.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only formula that is consistent with all pieces of spectroscopic evidence is **C6H10O2**. It has the two required oxygen atoms for a carboxylic acid and the correct degree of unsaturation (2) to accommodate both a carbonyl and an alkene double bond. According to the question's list of options, C6H10O2 is **option D**.\n\nIt is noteworthy that while the reasoning presented in nearly all the candidate answers correctly identifies C6H10O2 as the formula, many select an incorrect final letter due to working with a differently ordered list of options. The chemical analysis itself, however, is universally consistent and correct.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\n**Detailed Analysis of the Problem**\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the logic required to solve the problem, synthesizing the consistent reasoning found across all candidate answers.\n\n**1. Interpretation of Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **FTIR Analysis:**\n    *   **Broad Peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is the most telling feature. A \"very broad\" peak in this region (typically 2500-3300 cm⁻¹) is the classic signature for the O-H stretch of a **carboxylic acid** (-COOH). The extreme broadness is caused by strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **Strong Peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Combined with the broad O-H peak, it confirms the presence of a **carboxylic acid** functional group.\n    *   **Strong Peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (**C=C**), indicating the presence of an **alkene** functional group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The FTIR data provides unambiguous evidence that the compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **\"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\"**: This is an explicit confirmation of an alkene (C=C). Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a double bond. This corroborates the FTIR findings.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45**: This is a highly diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. Its mass corresponds to the carboxyl cation, [COOH]⁺. (Calculation: 12 for Carbon + 16 for Oxygen + 16 for Oxygen + 1 for Hydrogen = 45 amu).\n\n**2. Synthesizing the Evidence to Constrain the Formula**\n\nFrom the combined spectral data, we have two non-negotiable facts about the unknown molecule:\n1.  It contains a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**.\n2.  It contains an **alkene group (C=C)**.\n\nThese facts allow us to evaluate the candidate formulas:\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The Number of Oxygen Atoms**\n    *   The presence of a carboxylic acid requires the molecule to contain exactly **two oxygen atoms**.\n    *   This immediately eliminates the options **C6H12O** and **C6H10O**.\n    *   We are left with two possibilities: **C6H10O2** and **C6H12O2**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation represents the total number of pi bonds and rings in a molecule.\n    *   Our molecule has one pi bond in the alkene's C=C and one pi bond in the acid's C=O.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule must have a total **DoU of 2**.\n    *   We can calculate the DoU for the remaining two options using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n        *   **For C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This is incorrect. A DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O of the carboxylic acid, implying the carbon chain is saturated. This contradicts the FTIR and NMR data.\n        *   **For C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This is correct. This DoU of 2 perfectly accommodates both the C=O and C=C double bonds.\n\n**3. Conclusion and Final Answer Selection**\n\n*   The only chemical formula that satisfies all the experimental evidence is **C6H10O2**. The analysis provided by all candidate agents, despite some clerical errors in the final letter choice, correctly reached this same conclusion.\n*   Now, we map this correct formula back to the specific options provided in the question:\n    A) C6H12O2\n    B) C6H12O\n    C) C6H10O\n    D) C6H10O2\n\n*   The formula C6H10O2 corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n**1. Analysis of the Spectroscopic Data**\n\nThe first step is to analyze what each piece of spectroscopic data indicates. The candidate answers show remarkable consensus on these interpretations.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   A **very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** combined with a **strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** is the definitive signature of a **carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH)**. The broad peak is the O-H stretch, significantly broadened by strong hydrogen bonding, and the 1700 cm⁻¹ peak is the C=O carbonyl stretch.\n    *   The **strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, which means the molecule is an alkene.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The observation of **\"vinyl-hydrogens\"** explicitly confirms the presence of hydrogens directly attached to the C=C double bond, corroborating the conclusion that the molecule is an alkene.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   The **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a highly diagnostic piece of data. This mass corresponds to the **carboxyl cation, [COOH]⁺** (Atomic masses: C=12, O=16, H=1 -> 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45). This strongly confirms the presence of the carboxylic acid group.\n\n**2. Synthesis of All Evidence and Structural Requirements**\n\nCombining all the data, we have conclusively determined that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This sets two hard constraints on the correct molecular formula:\n\n1.  **Number of Oxygen Atoms:** A carboxylic acid (-COOH) group contains **two oxygen atoms**. This requirement immediately eliminates formulas with only one oxygen atom.\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU (or Double Bond Equivalent) is the total number of rings and pi (π) bonds. Our compound has:\n    *   One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid), contributing 1 DoU.\n    *   One C=C double bond (from the alkene), contributing 1 DoU.\n    *   Therefore, the correct formula must have a total DoU of **2**.\n\n**3. Evaluating the Candidate Formulas**\n\nNow, let's evaluate the four options provided in the question against these two requirements. The options are:\n*   A) C6H12O2\n*   B) C6H10O2\n*   C) C6H10O\n*   D) C6H12O\n\n*   **Step 1: Check Oxygen Count.**\n    *   Options C) C6H10O and D) C6H12O have only one oxygen atom. They cannot be carboxylic acids and are therefore incorrect.\n    *   This leaves us with options **A) C6H12O2** and **B) C6H10O2**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Check Degree of Unsaturation.** We use the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   **For A) C6H12O2:**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n        A DoU of 1 can only account for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid. This formula represents a *saturated* carboxylic acid, which contradicts the FTIR and NMR data showing a C=C bond. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **For B) C6H10O2:**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n        A DoU of 2 perfectly matches the requirements for both the C=O bond and the C=C bond. This formula is fully consistent with all experimental data.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe only formula that satisfies all the spectral evidence is C6H10O2. It has the correct number of oxygen atoms for a carboxylic acid and the correct degree of unsaturation (2) to account for both the carbonyl and alkene double bonds.\n\nThe provided options were:\nA) C6H12O2\nB) C6H10O2\nC) C6H10O\nD) C6H12O\n\nThe correct formula is C6H10O2, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the candidate responses and the original question.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Spectroscopic Data**\n\nAll candidate answers show a strong consensus on interpreting the provided spectra. This shared reasoning is a reliable foundation for the correct answer.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   The combination of a **very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** (O-H stretch, broadened by H-bonding) and a **strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** (C=O carbonyl stretch) is a definitive signature for a **carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH)**.\n    *   The **strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, which means the molecule is an alkene.\n    *   *Conclusion from FTIR*: The unknown is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of **\"vinyl-hydrogens\"** explicitly confirms the presence of the C=C double bond (alkene), corroborating the FTIR data.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   The **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a classic and diagnostic piece of evidence for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the mass of the **carboxyl cation, [COOH]⁺** (Carbon=12 + 2xOxygen=32 + Hydrogen=1 = 45 amu).\n\n**2. Synthesis and Logical Deductions**\n\nCombining all the spectroscopic evidence, we have two critical requirements for the molecular formula:\n\n*   **Requirement 1: It must contain a carboxylic acid.** This means the formula must have **two oxygen atoms**.\n*   **Requirement 2: It must be unsaturated.** It contains one C=O double bond (in the acid) and one C=C double bond (in the alkene chain). Each double bond represents one degree of unsaturation. Therefore, the total **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)** for the molecule must be **2**.\n\n**3. Evaluation of the Molecular Formula Options**\n\nLet's evaluate the choices from the original question based on these two requirements.\n\nOriginal Options:\nA) C6H10O\nB) C6H12O\nC) C6H12O2\nD) C6H10O2\n\n*   **Check Requirement 1 (Oxygen Count):** The formula must contain O₂. This immediately eliminates **A) C6H10O** and **B) C6H12O**.\n\n*   **Check Requirement 2 (Degree of Unsaturation):** We are left with options C and D. We can calculate their DoU using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`. We are looking for a DoU of 2.\n    *   **For C) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid, implying the carbon chain is saturated. This contradicts the FTIR and NMR evidence for a C=C bond. Therefore, option C is incorrect.\n    *   **For D) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DoU of 2 perfectly matches the evidence, accounting for one C=O bond and one C=C bond. Therefore, option D is correct.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe scientific reasoning presented in all candidate answers is sound and unanimously concludes that the molecule's formula must be C6H10O2. The only discrepancy among the candidates is the mapping of this correct formula to the final letter choice. By adhering strictly to the options provided in the original question, C6H10O2 corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **FTIR Data Interpretation**: All candidate answers correctly interpret the FTIR spectrum.\n    *   A very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ combined with a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is a definitive signature for a **carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH)**.\n    *   A strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicates a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, meaning the molecule is an alkene.\n    *   **Consensus**: The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Data Interpretation**: All candidates correctly interpret the ¹H NMR data.\n    *   The presence of \"vinyl-hydrogens\" explicitly confirms the existence of the C=C double bond (alkene), which supports the FTIR analysis.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Data Interpretation**: All candidates correctly interpret the Mass Spectrometry data.\n    *   The fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic indicator of a carboxylic acid, corresponding to the mass of the [COOH]⁺ fragment (Carbon=12 + Oxygen=16 + Oxygen=16 + Hydrogen=1 = 45).\n\n**Synthesizing the Evidence**\n\nThe combined, unanimous conclusion from the spectral analysis is that the unknown molecule must contain both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n**Evaluating the Formula Options**\n\nThis leads to two strict requirements for the molecular formula:\n\n1.  **Oxygen Count**: The molecule must contain **two oxygen atoms** to be a carboxylic acid. This immediately eliminates options with one oxygen atom: C6H12O (A) and C6H10O (C).\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**: The DoU represents the total number of rings and pi bonds. The molecule has one pi bond in the C=O of the acid and one pi bond in the C=C of the alkene, requiring a total **DoU of 2**. We must check the remaining options against this requirement using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   **For C6H12O2 (Option D)**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This is incorrect as it only accounts for the C=O bond, not the C=C bond.\n    *   **For C6H10O2 (Option B)**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This is a perfect match, accounting for both the C=O and C=C double bonds.\n\n**Careful Points & Final Decision**\n\n*   The scientific reasoning across all 15 candidate answers is unanimous and sound, concluding that the correct molecular formula is **C6H10O2**.\n*   The only point of failure in some answers is correctly mapping this formula back to the lettered choice provided in the original question.\n*   According to the original question's list, the formula C6H10O2 corresponds to option B.\n\nThe correct chemical formula that satisfies all spectroscopic evidence is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer by synthesizing the information from the candidate answers and performing a rigorous evaluation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data:** The first step is to interpret what each piece of evidence tells us about the unknown compound's structure.\n    *   **FTIR Spectrum**:\n        *   A **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** combined with a **strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** is the definitive signature of a **carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH)**. The broadness is caused by the O-H bond's hydrogen bonding, and the 1700 cm⁻¹ peak is the C=O carbonyl stretch.\n        *   A **strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, which means the molecule is an alkene.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum**:\n        *   The observation of **\"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\"** explicitly confirms the presence of hydrogens on a C=C double bond.

This mass corresponds precisely to the [COOH]⁺ fragment (atomic masses: C=12, O=16, H=1; Total = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45).\n    *   **Combined Conclusion**: The evidence from all three techniques points to one unambiguous conclusion: the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n\n2.  **Translate Structural Features into Formula Requirements:**\n    *   **Oxygen Count**: Because the compound is a carboxylic acid (-COOH), its molecular formula **must contain two oxygen atoms (O₂)**.\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**: The DoU represents the total number of pi bonds and rings in a molecule. The unknown has one pi bond from the C=O group and another from the C=C group. Therefore, the molecule must have a total DoU of **2**.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Candidate Formulas:**\n    Let's test the given options against these two requirements.\n    *   Options: A) C6H12O, B) C6H10O2, C) C6H12O2, D) C6H10O.\n    *   **Filtering by Oxygen Count**: We can immediately eliminate formulas with only one oxygen atom: A) C6H12O and D) C6H10O.\n    *   **Remaining Options**: We are left with B) C6H10O2 and C) C6H12O2.\n\n4.  **Final Check using Degree of Unsaturation:**\n    We will now use the DoU formula, `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`, to decide between the two remaining options. We are looking for a DoU of 2.\n    *   **For C) C6H12O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. A DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O double bond, implying the rest of the molecule is saturated.

Its presence, combined with the broad O-H peak, confirms the carboxylic acid functional group.\n    *   A **strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), indicating the molecule contains an **alkene** functional group.\n    *   *Conclusion from FTIR*: The unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **Interpret the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of **\"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\"** provides direct, unambiguous confirmation of the C=C double bond. Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a double bond.\n\n3.  **Interpret the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   The **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is highly diagnostic. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl cation, **[COOH]⁺**, which is a classic fragment from a carboxylic acid. (Mass calculation: 12 for Carbon + 16 for Oxygen + 16 for Oxygen + 1 for Hydrogen = 45).\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Evidence and Establish Requirements for the Formula:**\n    The combined evidence from all three techniques leads to a definitive conclusion about the unknown compound's structure: it must be an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This imposes two strict requirements on its molecular formula:\n    *   **Requirement 1 (Oxygen Count):** Since the molecule is a carboxylic acid (-COOH), its formula **must contain two oxygen atoms (O₂) **.\n    *   **Requirement 2 (Degree of Unsaturation - DoU):** The DoU represents the total number of pi bonds and rings. The evidence shows the molecule has two pi bonds: one from the C=O bond in the carboxylic acid and one from the C=C bond of the alkene. Therefore, the required **DoU must be 2**.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Candidate Formulas:**\n    We will now test the provided options against these two requirements, using the DoU formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    The options are:\n    A) C6H10O\n    B) C6H12O\n    C) C6H12O2\n    D) C6H10O2\n\n    *   **Filtering by Requirement 1 (Oxygen Count):**\n        *   A) C6H10O (1 oxygen) -> Incorrect.\n        *   B) C6H12O (1 oxygen) -> Incorrect.\n        *   We are left with options C) C6H12O2 and D) C6H10O2.\n\n    *   **Filtering by Requirement 2 (Degree of Unsaturation):**\n        *   For **C) C6H12O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O bond, implying a saturated carbon chain. This contradicts the FTIR and NMR evidence for a C=C bond. Therefore, C is incorrect.\n        *   For **D) C6H10O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DoU of 2 perfectly matches our requirement, accounting for both the C=O bond and the C=C bond. This is the correct formula.\n\n### **List of Careful Points**\n*   The **broadness** of the FTIR peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is the key piece of evidence differentiating a carboxylic acid from an alcohol.\n*   The m/z = 45 fragment is a powerful piece of **confirmatory evidence** for the -COOH group, solidifying the FTIR interpretation.\n*   It is most efficient to **first filter the options by the non-negotiable atom count** (two oxygens) before performing the more involved Degree of Unsaturation calculation.\n*   All candidate answers correctly deduced the chemical formula is C6H10O2; discrepancies in the final letter arose from inconsistent ordering of the options in their prompts. The chemical reasoning itself is sound and unanimous.\n*   The final selection must map the correct chemical formula to the options as they are presented in the question.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\nThe only chemical formula that fits all the pieces of spectroscopic evidence is **C6H10O2**. According to the provided options, this corresponds to **D**.\n\n<<<D>>>"

Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum**\n*   **A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a definitive spectroscopic signature for the O-H stretch of a **carboxylic acid** (-COOH). The extreme broadness is caused by strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding between acid molecules.\n*   **A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Combined with the broad O-H peak, it confirms the presence of a **carboxylic acid**.\n*   **A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (**alkene, C=C**).\n*   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n**2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** This is an explicit confirmation of the FTIR data. Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond, which definitively confirms the presence of an **alkene** group.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Mass Spectrometry Data**\n*   **A fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a classic and highly diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the mass of the **carboxyl cation, [COOH]⁺**. (Mass calculation: 12.01 (C) + 2 * 16.00 (O) + 1.01 (H) ≈ 45). This strongly corroborates the presence of the carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**4. Synthesizing the Evidence and Evaluating the Candidate Formulas**\nThe combined evidence from all three techniques points to a single conclusion: the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This provides two critical constraints for determining the correct molecular formula.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The Number of Oxygen Atoms.** Since the compound is a carboxylic acid (-COOH), its molecular formula must contain exactly **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates the options that contain only one oxygen atom.\n    *   A) C6H12O2 (Possible)\n    *   B) C6H10O (**Eliminated**)\n    *   C) C6H12O (**Eliminated**)\n    *   D) C6H10O2 (Possible)\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU).** The DoU indicates the total number of pi bonds and rings in a molecule. Our compound contains one C=O double bond (in the acid) and one C=C double bond (in the alkene). Therefore, it must have a total DoU of **2**. We can calculate the DoU for the remaining options using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   For **A) C6H12O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid and does not allow for the C=C bond confirmed by FTIR and NMR. This formula corresponds to a saturated carboxylic acid (e.g., hexanoic acid) and is therefore incorrect.\n    *   For **D) C6H10O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DoU of 2 perfectly matches the structural requirements derived from the spectra (one C=O bond and one C=C bond).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly the molecular formula **C6H10O2** satisfies all the spectroscopic evidence. It has the two oxygen atoms required for a carboxylic acid and the two degrees of unsaturation required for both the carbonyl and the alkene double bonds.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on the analysis of the candidate answers and the spectroscopic data, here is a step-by-step breakdown to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Spectroscopic Evidence**\n\nThere is a complete consensus among all candidate answers regarding the interpretation of the spectral data, and their analysis is chemically sound.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The combination of a very broad absorption peak at ~3000 cm⁻¹ (O-H stretch, broadened by H-bonding) and a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ (C=O stretch) is a definitive signature for a **carboxylic acid** functional group (-COOH).\n    *   The strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (**alkene**, C=C), indicating the molecule is unsaturated.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The observation of \"vinyl-hydrogens\" explicitly confirms the presence of hydrogens on a C=C double bond, providing direct evidence for the **alkene** group.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   The fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic diagnostic tool. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl cation, **[COOH]⁺** (Mass = 12.01 (C) + 2 * 16.00 (O) + 1.01 (H) ≈ 45). This strongly confirms the carboxylic acid group.\n\n**2. Synthesis of Conclusions**\n\nAll three analytical techniques consistently prove that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This leads to two critical requirements for the correct molecular formula:\n\n*   **Requirement 1 (Oxygen Count):** It must be a carboxylic acid, so the formula must contain **two oxygen atoms (O₂) **.\n*   **Requirement 2 (Degree of Unsaturation):** The \"degree of unsaturation\" (DoU) indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds. The molecule has one C=O bond and one C=C bond, so it must have a **total DoU of 2**.\n\n**3. Evaluation of the Candidate Formulas**\n\nLet's evaluate the given options against these two requirements. The options are A) C6H10O, B) C6H12O, C) C6H10O2, and D) C6H12O2.\n\n*   **Step 1: Apply Oxygen Count Requirement.**\n    We must have two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates:\n    *   A) C6H10O (only 1 oxygen)\n    *   B) C6H12O (only 1 oxygen)\n\n    This leaves us with **C) C6H10O2** and **D) C6H12O2**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Apply Degree of Unsaturation Requirement.**\n    We must have a DoU of 2. We use the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   **For C) C6H10O2:**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This perfectly matches the requirement for one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n    *   **For D) C6H12O2:**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This is incorrect. A DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O bond, implying a saturated molecule (like hexanoic acid), which contradicts the clear evidence of a C=C bond from FTIR and NMR.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only molecular formula that satisfies all experimental evidence is **C6H10O2**. It has the two oxygen atoms required for a carboxylic acid and the two degrees of unsaturation required to account for both the carbonyl and alkene double bonds. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n**1. Analysis of Spectroscopic Data**\n\nThe first step is to interpret the information provided by each characterization technique to identify the functional groups present in the unknown compound.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The broadness is a key indicator that distinguishes it from an alcohol's O-H peak.\n    *   A **strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Its presence, combined with the broad O-H peak, confirms the carboxylic acid functional group.\n    *   A **strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), indicating the molecule contains an **alkene** functional group and is therefore unsaturated.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of **\"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\"** is explicit confirmation of the C=C double bond. Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a double bond.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   The **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is highly diagnostic. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl cation, **[COOH]⁺**, calculated as: 12 (Carbon) + 16 (Oxygen) + 16 (Oxygen) + 1 (Hydrogen) = 45. This strongly confirms the presence of the carboxylic acid group.\n\n**2. Synthesis of Evidence**\n\nThe combined data from all three techniques leads to a definitive conclusion about the structure of the unknown:\n*   The compound contains a **carboxylic acid** group (-COOH).\n*   The compound contains an **alkene** group (C=C).\n*   Therefore, the unknown is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n\n**3. Evaluation of the Molecular Formula Options**\n\nWe can now use these structural requirements to evaluate the candidate formulas provided in the question's list: A) C6H10O, B) C6H10O2, C) C6H12O2, and D) C6H12O.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The Number of Oxygen Atoms**\n    *   Since the molecule is a carboxylic acid (-COOH), its formula **must contain two oxygen atoms**.\n    *   This immediately eliminates option **A) C6H10O** and option **D) C6H12O**, which each have only one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with two possibilities: **B) C6H10O2** and **C) C6H12O2**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation represents the total number of pi bonds and rings in a molecule. Our analysis shows the molecule must have at least two degrees of unsaturation: one for the C=O bond in the carboxylic acid and one for the C=C bond of the alkene.\n    *   The required DoU = 1 (for C=O) + 1 (for C=C) = **2**.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the two remaining options using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`:\n        *   **For C) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU is incorrect. It only accounts for the C=O bond, implying a saturated structure, which contradicts the FTIR and NMR evidence for a C=C bond.\n        *   **For B) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DoU of 2 perfectly matches our requirement for one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only molecular formula that is consistent with all the spectroscopic data is **C6H10O2**. It has the correct number of oxygen atoms for a carboxylic acid and the correct degree of unsaturation (2) to account for both the carbonyl and the alkene double bonds. Based on the options provided in the question, this formula corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on a careful review of the problem and the candidate responses.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Spectroscopic Data**\n\nThe first step is to interpret the provided spectral data to identify the functional groups present in the unknown compound. There is a strong consensus among all candidate answers on this interpretation.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum**:\n    *   The combination of a **very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** (O-H stretch, broadened by hydrogen bonding) and a **strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** (C=O carbonyl stretch) is a definitive signature for a **carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH)**.\n    *   The additional **strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, which means the compound is an alkene.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum**:\n    *   The explicit mention of **\"vinyl-hydrogens\"** provides unambiguous confirmation of the C=C double bond (alkene), as these are protons directly attached to the carbons of the double bond.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry**:\n    *   A **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a highly diagnostic piece of evidence. This mass corresponds precisely to the [COOH]⁺ fragment (mass of Carbon (12) + 2 * mass of Oxygen (16) + mass of Hydrogen (1) = 45). This strongly corroborates the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from Spectral Data**: The compound is definitively an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n\n**2. Evaluating the Chemical Formula Options**\n\nBased on the spectral analysis, the correct molecular formula must satisfy two critical requirements:\n1.  **It must contain two oxygen atoms** to form the carboxylic acid group.\n2.  **It must have a Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of 2** to account for the two double bonds present (one C=O and one C=C).\n\nLet's evaluate the four choices given in the prompt against these requirements. The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated with the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **C6H12O (Choice B)**: Fails. It only has one oxygen and cannot be a carboxylic acid. Its DoU is 1.\n*   **C6H10O (Choice C)**: Fails. It only has one oxygen and cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n*   **C6H12O2 (Choice D)**: Fails. While it has two oxygens, its Degree of Unsaturation is `DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1`. A DoU of 1 can only account for the C=O of the carboxylic acid, implying the carbon chain is saturated. This contradicts the FTIR and NMR evidence for a C=C bond.\n*   **C6H10O2 (Choice A)**: **Success**. It has two oxygen atoms. Its Degree of Unsaturation is `DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2`. This DoU of 2 perfectly accounts for both the C=O bond of the acid and the C=C bond of the alkene.\n\n**3. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe chemical reasoning is straightforward and robust. The only formula that fits all the pieces of spectroscopic evidence is **C6H10O2**. According to the question's list of options, this formula corresponds to choice A.\n\nThe candidate answers all performed the chemical reasoning correctly, but some were inconsistent in mapping their final correct formula to the provided lettered choices.

Together with the broad O-H peak, this confirms the presence of a **carboxylic acid functional group**.\n    *   A strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=C (alkene) double bond stretch.\n    *   *Conclusion from FTIR*: The molecule is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **Analyze 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   The observation of \"vinyl-hydrogens\" is direct proof of the presence of an **alkene (C=C)** functional group, as these are the hydrogens attached directly to the double-bonded carbons. This confirms the FTIR analysis.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a highly diagnostic piece of evidence for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl cation fragment, [COOH]⁺.\n    *   Calculation: (1 × mass of Carbon) + (2 × mass of Oxygen) + (1 × mass of Hydrogen) = 12 + (2 × 16) + 1 = 45. This strongly confirms the **carboxylic acid group**.\n\n4.  **Synthesize Evidence and Evaluate Candidate Formulas:**\n    *   The combined data from all three techniques conclusively proves the molecule contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n    *   **Requirement 1: Oxygen Count.** The presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) mandates that the molecular formula must contain **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options C) C6H12O and D) C6H10O.\n\n    *   **Requirement 2: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU).** The DoU represents the sum of all pi bonds and rings in a molecule. The evidence requires a minimum DoU of 2:\n        *   One degree of unsaturation from the C=O bond in the carboxylic acid.\n        *   One degree of unsaturation from the C=C bond of the alkene.\n        *   Total required DoU = 2.\n\n    *   We now compare the remaining options, A) C6H10O2 and B) C6H12O2, by calculating their DoU using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n        *   For **B) C6H12O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. A DoU of 1 can only account for the C=O bond, implying a saturated molecule. This contradicts the FTIR and NMR data showing a C=C bond.\n        *   For **A) C6H10O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. A DoU of 2 perfectly matches the two required double bonds (one C=O and one C=C).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only molecular formula that satisfies all the spectroscopic evidence is **C6H10O2**. It has the required two oxygen atoms for a carboxylic acid and the correct degree of unsaturation (2) to account for both the carbonyl and the alkene double bonds.

Analysis of Spectroscopic Data**\n\nThe candidate answers are unanimous and correct in their interpretation of the spectral data. Let's consolidate the key findings:\n\n*   **FTIR Analysis:**\n    *   The combination of a very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ (O-H stretch, broadened by hydrogen bonding) and a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ (C=O stretch) is the definitive signature of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group.\n    *   A second strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, indicating the molecule is an alkene.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **1H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   The observation of \"vinyl-hydrogens\" provides explicit confirmation of the C=C double bond, as these are protons directly attached to the alkene carbons. This supports the FTIR data.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is highly diagnostic. This mass corresponds precisely to the carboxyl cation, **[COOH]⁺** (mass = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45). This provides a third, independent confirmation of the carboxylic acid group.\n\n**2. Establishing Critical Requirements for the Formula**\n\nSynthesizing the information above leads to two non-negotiable requirements for the correct molecular formula:\n*   **Careful Point 1: It must contain two oxygen atoms.** The confirmed presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group means the formula must be of the form CₓHᵧO₂.\n*   **Careful Point 2: It must have a Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of 2.** The Degree of Unsaturation represents the sum of all pi bonds and rings. The data confirms one pi bond from the carbonyl (C=O) of the acid and a second pi bond from the alkene (C=C). Therefore, the total DoU must be 2.\n\n**3. Evaluating the Candidate Formulas**\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options against these two critical requirements. The formula for the Degree of Unsaturation is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **A) C6H10O:**\n    *   Oxygen count: 1. Fails Requirement 1. It cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **B) C6H12O:**\n    *   Oxygen count: 1. Fails Requirement 1. It cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **C) C6H10O2:**\n    *   Oxygen count: 2. Passes Requirement 1.\n    *   DoU calculation: `6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2`. Passes Requirement 2. This is a perfect match for an unsaturated carboxylic acid with one C=C bond.\n\n*   **D) C6H12O2:**\n    *   Oxygen count: 2. Passes Requirement 1.\n    *   DoU calculation: `6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1`. Fails Requirement 2. A DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O of the carboxylic acid, implying the carbon chain is saturated. This contradicts the FTIR and NMR evidence for a C=C bond.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemical reasoning across all candidate answers is sound and leads to the correct molecular formula. The only formula that satisfies all the experimental data—having two oxygens and a degree of unsaturation of two—is **C6H10O2**.

This mass corresponds precisely to the **carboxyl cation, [COOH]⁺** (Carbon=12, Oxygen=16, Oxygen=16, Hydrogen=1; Total = 45). This strongly confirms the presence of the carboxylic acid group.\n\n**Step 2: Establish the Requirements for the Molecular Formula**\n\nBased on the unambiguous conclusions from Step 1, the correct molecular formula must satisfy two key requirements:\n\n1.  **It must contain two oxygen atoms (O₂) to form a carboxylic acid group.**\n2.  **It must be unsaturated with a degree of unsaturation (DoU) of at least 2.** The DoU (number of rings + pi bonds) must account for the C=O bond in the acid (1 DoU) and the C=C bond in the alkene chain (1 DoU). Therefore, the total DoU must be exactly 2.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Formulas Against the Requirements**\n\nLet's test the four given options against our two requirements. The formula for Degree of Unsaturation is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **A) C6H10O:**\n    *   **Oxygen Count:** Fails. It only has one oxygen, so it cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n*   **B) C6H10O2:**\n    *   **Oxygen Count:** Passes. It has two oxygen atoms.\n    *   **DoU Calculation:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Passes. The DoU of 2 perfectly matches the requirement for one C=O bond and one C=C bond. **This is a perfect match for all the evidence.**\n*   **C) C6H12O:**\n    *   **Oxygen Count:** Fails. It only has one oxygen, so it cannot be a carboxylic acid.\n*   **D) C6H12O2:**\n    *   **Oxygen Count:** Passes. It has two oxygen atoms.\n    *   **DoU Calculation:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Fails. A DoU of 1 can only account for the C=O bond, implying the rest of the molecule is saturated. This contradicts the clear FTIR and NMR evidence for a C=C bond.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nThe only chemical formula that satisfies all the conditions derived from the spectral data is **C6H10O2**. It has two oxygen atoms, allowing for a carboxylic acid, and a degree of unsaturation of 2, allowing for both the carbonyl and the alkene double bonds. The candidate answers, despite some clerical errors in selecting the final letter, unanimously support this scientific conclusion through their reasoning.\n\nThe correct formula C6H10O2 corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula by synthesizing the provided reasoning from other agents.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Spectroscopic Evidence**\nThere is a strong and correct consensus among all candidate answers regarding the interpretation of the spectral data.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The combination of a **very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** and a **strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** is definitively identified as a **carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH)**. The broad peak is the hydrogen-bonded O-H stretch, and the 1700 cm⁻¹ peak is the C=O carbonyl stretch.\n    *   The **strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is correctly assigned to a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, indicating the molecule is an alkene.\n    *   *Conclusion:* The unknown is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **1H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The presence of **\"vinyl-hydrogens\"** is correctly noted as explicit confirmation of the C=C double bond, supporting the FTIR analysis.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   The **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is unanimously and correctly identified as the carboxyl cation, **[COOH]⁺**. This is a classic fragmentation pattern that provides strong, independent confirmation of the carboxylic acid group (Mass = 12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45).\n\n**2. Synthesis and Logical Deduction**\nThe analysis leads to two critical requirements that the correct molecular formula must meet:\n\n*   **Requirement 1: It must contain two oxygen atoms.** A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contains two oxygen atoms. This requirement immediately eliminates the formulas C6H12O and C6H10O.\n*   **Requirement 2: It must have a Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of 2.** The DoU (also called double bond equivalent) is the sum of all pi bonds and rings in a molecule. Our analysis has identified two pi bonds:\n    1.  One C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid.\n    2.  One C=C double bond in the alkene chain.\n    Therefore, the total DoU must be 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n**3. Evaluation of the Remaining Options**\nWe are left to choose between **C6H10O2** and **C6H12O2**. We will calculate the DoU for each using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`\n\n*   **For C6H12O2:**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n    *   This DoU is insufficient. It only accounts for the C=O bond of the acid and implies the rest of the molecule is saturated, which contradicts the clear evidence for a C=C bond from FTIR and NMR.\n\n*   **For C6H10O2:**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n    *   This DoU is a perfect match. It accommodates both the C=O bond and the C=C bond, making it fully consistent with all the spectroscopic data.\n\n**4. Final Decision**\nThe scientific reasoning presented in all the candidate answers correctly converges on the conclusion that the chemical formula must be **C6H10O2**. Many of the candidate answers selected an incorrect final letter due to clerical errors in mapping their correct formula back to the original options list. Based on the initial question's options:\n\nA) C6H12O\nB) C6H12O2\nC) C6H10O\nD) C6H10O2\n\nThe correct formula **C6H10O2** corresponds to option **D**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on a thorough review of the provided spectroscopic data and the candidate answers.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Spectroscopic Data**\n\nThe first step is to interpret each piece of data to determine the functional groups present in the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic and definitive signature of the O-H stretch of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl region and represents a C=O double bond. Combined with the broad O-H peak, it confirms the **carboxylic acid** group.\n    *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (**C=C**), indicating the presence of an **alkene** functional group. The molecule is unsaturated.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **\"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\"**: This is explicit confirmation of a C=C double bond. Vinyl-hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of an alkene. This supports the conclusion from the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45**: This is a highly diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. The mass corresponds to the **carboxyl cation, [COOH]⁺**.\n        *   Calculation: Mass of Carbon (12) + 2 x Mass of Oxygen (16) + Mass of Hydrogen (1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45 amu.\n    *   This provides a third, independent piece of evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n\n### **Step 2: Synthesize the Evidence and Determine Requirements for the Formula**\n\nFrom the combined spectroscopic data, we can be highly confident about two key features of the molecule:\n1.  It contains a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**.\n2.  It contains an **alkene group (C=C)**.\n\nThese features place specific constraints on the possible molecular formula:\n*   **Constraint 1 (Oxygen Count):** A carboxylic acid contains two oxygen atoms. Therefore, the correct formula must be of the form CₓHᵧ**O₂**.\n*   **Constraint 2 (Degree of Unsaturation - DoU):** The DoU indicates the number of rings and pi bonds. Our molecule has one pi bond in the C=O group and one pi bond in the C=C group, for a total **required DoU of 2**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Formulas**\n\nLet's evaluate the options provided in the question based on these two constraints.\nThe options are:\nA) C6H12O2\nB) C6H12O\nC) C6H10O\nD) C6H10O2\n\n*   **Applying Constraint 1 (Oxygen Count):** The formula must have two oxygen atoms.\n    *   A) C6H12O2: Correct (2 oxygens)\n    *   B) C6H12O: Incorrect (1 oxygen) -> **Eliminate**\n    *   C) C6H10O: Incorrect (1 oxygen) -> **Eliminate**\n    *   D) C6H10O2: Correct (2 oxygens)\n\nWe are left with options A and D.\n\n*   **Applying Constraint 2 (Degree of Unsaturation):** The formula must have a DoU of 2. We use the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   For **A) C6H12O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU is incorrect. It can only account for the C=O bond of the acid, implying a saturated structure, which contradicts the FTIR and NMR data.\n    *   For **D) C6H10O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DoU of 2 is a perfect match. It accounts for both the C=O bond and the C=C bond.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only formula that is consistent with all pieces of spectroscopic evidence is **C6H10O2**. It has the two required oxygen atoms for a carboxylic acid and the correct degree of unsaturation (2) to accommodate both a carbonyl and an alkene double bond. According to the question's list of options, C6H10O2 is **option D**.\n\nIt is noteworthy that while the reasoning presented in nearly all the candidate answers correctly identifies C6H10O2 as the formula, many select an incorrect final letter due to working with a differently ordered list of options. The chemical analysis itself, however, is universally consistent and correct.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\n**Detailed Analysis of the Problem**\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the logic required to solve the problem, synthesizing the consistent reasoning found across all candidate answers.\n\n**1. Interpretation of Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **FTIR Analysis:**\n    *   **Broad Peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is the most telling feature. A \"very broad\" peak in this region (typically 2500-3300 cm⁻¹) is the classic signature for the O-H stretch of a **carboxylic acid** (-COOH). The extreme broadness is caused by strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **Strong Peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Combined with the broad O-H peak, it confirms the presence of a **carboxylic acid** functional group.\n    *   **Strong Peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (**C=C**), indicating the presence of an **alkene** functional group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The FTIR data provides unambiguous evidence that the compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **\"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\"**: This is an explicit confirmation of an alkene (C=C). Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a double bond. This corroborates the FTIR findings.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry Analysis:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45**: This is a highly diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. Its mass corresponds to the carboxyl cation, [COOH]⁺. (Calculation: 12 for Carbon + 16 for Oxygen + 16 for Oxygen + 1 for Hydrogen = 45 amu).\n\n**2. Synthesizing the Evidence to Constrain the Formula**\n\nFrom the combined spectral data, we have two non-negotiable facts about the unknown molecule:\n1.  It contains a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**.\n2.  It contains an **alkene group (C=C)**.\n\nThese facts allow us to evaluate the candidate formulas:\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The Number of Oxygen Atoms**\n    *   The presence of a carboxylic acid requires the molecule to contain exactly **two oxygen atoms**.\n    *   This immediately eliminates the options **C6H12O** and **C6H10O**.\n    *   We are left with two possibilities: **C6H10O2** and **C6H12O2**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation represents the total number of pi bonds and rings in a molecule.\n    *   Our molecule has one pi bond in the alkene's C=C and one pi bond in the acid's C=O.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule must have a total **DoU of 2**.\n    *   We can calculate the DoU for the remaining two options using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n        *   **For C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This is incorrect. A DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O of the carboxylic acid, implying the carbon chain is saturated. This contradicts the FTIR and NMR data.\n        *   **For C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This is correct. This DoU of 2 perfectly accommodates both the C=O and C=C double bonds.\n\n**3. Conclusion and Final Answer Selection**\n\n*   The only chemical formula that satisfies all the experimental evidence is **C6H10O2**. The analysis provided by all candidate agents, despite some clerical errors in the final letter choice, correctly reached this same conclusion.\n*   Now, we map this correct formula back to the specific options provided in the question:\n    A) C6H12O2\n    B) C6H12O\n    C) C6H10O\n    D) C6H10O2\n\n*   The formula C6H10O2 corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n**1. Analysis of the Spectroscopic Data**\n\nThe first step is to analyze what each piece of spectroscopic data indicates. The candidate answers show remarkable consensus on these interpretations.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   A **very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** combined with a **strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** is the definitive signature of a **carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH)**. The broad peak is the O-H stretch, significantly broadened by strong hydrogen bonding, and the 1700 cm⁻¹ peak is the C=O carbonyl stretch.\n    *   The **strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, which means the molecule is an alkene.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The observation of **\"vinyl-hydrogens\"** explicitly confirms the presence of hydrogens directly attached to the C=C double bond, corroborating the conclusion that the molecule is an alkene.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   The **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a highly diagnostic piece of data. This mass corresponds to the **carboxyl cation, [COOH]⁺** (Atomic masses: C=12, O=16, H=1 -> 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45). This strongly confirms the presence of the carboxylic acid group.\n\n**2. Synthesis of All Evidence and Structural Requirements**\n\nCombining all the data, we have conclusively determined that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This sets two hard constraints on the correct molecular formula:\n\n1.  **Number of Oxygen Atoms:** A carboxylic acid (-COOH) group contains **two oxygen atoms**. This requirement immediately eliminates formulas with only one oxygen atom.\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU (or Double Bond Equivalent) is the total number of rings and pi (π) bonds. Our compound has:\n    *   One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid), contributing 1 DoU.\n    *   One C=C double bond (from the alkene), contributing 1 DoU.\n    *   Therefore, the correct formula must have a total DoU of **2**.\n\n**3. Evaluating the Candidate Formulas**\n\nNow, let's evaluate the four options provided in the question against these two requirements. The options are:\n*   A) C6H12O2\n*   B) C6H10O2\n*   C) C6H10O\n*   D) C6H12O\n\n*   **Step 1: Check Oxygen Count.**\n    *   Options C) C6H10O and D) C6H12O have only one oxygen atom. They cannot be carboxylic acids and are therefore incorrect.\n    *   This leaves us with options **A) C6H12O2** and **B) C6H10O2**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Check Degree of Unsaturation.** We use the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   **For A) C6H12O2:**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n        A DoU of 1 can only account for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid. This formula represents a *saturated* carboxylic acid, which contradicts the FTIR and NMR data showing a C=C bond. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **For B) C6H10O2:**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n        A DoU of 2 perfectly matches the requirements for both the C=O bond and the C=C bond. This formula is fully consistent with all experimental data.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe only formula that satisfies all the spectral evidence is C6H10O2. It has the correct number of oxygen atoms for a carboxylic acid and the correct degree of unsaturation (2) to account for both the carbonyl and alkene double bonds.\n\nThe provided options were:\nA) C6H12O2\nB) C6H10O2\nC) C6H10O\nD) C6H12O\n\nThe correct formula is C6H10O2, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the candidate responses and the original question.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Spectroscopic Data**\n\nAll candidate answers show a strong consensus on interpreting the provided spectra. This shared reasoning is a reliable foundation for the correct answer.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   The combination of a **very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** (O-H stretch, broadened by H-bonding) and a **strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** (C=O carbonyl stretch) is a definitive signature for a **carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH)**.\n    *   The **strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, which means the molecule is an alkene.\n    *   *Conclusion from FTIR*: The unknown is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of **\"vinyl-hydrogens\"** explicitly confirms the presence of the C=C double bond (alkene), corroborating the FTIR data.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   The **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a classic and diagnostic piece of evidence for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the mass of the **carboxyl cation, [COOH]⁺** (Carbon=12 + 2xOxygen=32 + Hydrogen=1 = 45 amu).\n\n**2. Synthesis and Logical Deductions**\n\nCombining all the spectroscopic evidence, we have two critical requirements for the molecular formula:\n\n*   **Requirement 1: It must contain a carboxylic acid.** This means the formula must have **two oxygen atoms**.\n*   **Requirement 2: It must be unsaturated.** It contains one C=O double bond (in the acid) and one C=C double bond (in the alkene chain). Each double bond represents one degree of unsaturation. Therefore, the total **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)** for the molecule must be **2**.\n\n**3. Evaluation of the Molecular Formula Options**\n\nLet's evaluate the choices from the original question based on these two requirements.\n\nOriginal Options:\nA) C6H10O\nB) C6H12O\nC) C6H12O2\nD) C6H10O2\n\n*   **Check Requirement 1 (Oxygen Count):** The formula must contain O₂. This immediately eliminates **A) C6H10O** and **B) C6H12O**.\n\n*   **Check Requirement 2 (Degree of Unsaturation):** We are left with options C and D. We can calculate their DoU using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`. We are looking for a DoU of 2.\n    *   **For C) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O bond of the carboxylic acid, implying the carbon chain is saturated. This contradicts the FTIR and NMR evidence for a C=C bond. Therefore, option C is incorrect.\n    *   **For D) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DoU of 2 perfectly matches the evidence, accounting for one C=O bond and one C=C bond. Therefore, option D is correct.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe scientific reasoning presented in all candidate answers is sound and unanimously concludes that the molecule's formula must be C6H10O2. The only discrepancy among the candidates is the mapping of this correct formula to the final letter choice. By adhering strictly to the options provided in the original question, C6H10O2 corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **FTIR Data Interpretation**: All candidate answers correctly interpret the FTIR spectrum.\n    *   A very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ combined with a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is a definitive signature for a **carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH)**.\n    *   A strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicates a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, meaning the molecule is an alkene.\n    *   **Consensus**: The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Data Interpretation**: All candidates correctly interpret the ¹H NMR data.\n    *   The presence of \"vinyl-hydrogens\" explicitly confirms the existence of the C=C double bond (alkene), which supports the FTIR analysis.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Data Interpretation**: All candidates correctly interpret the Mass Spectrometry data.\n    *   The fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic indicator of a carboxylic acid, corresponding to the mass of the [COOH]⁺ fragment (Carbon=12 + Oxygen=16 + Oxygen=16 + Hydrogen=1 = 45).\n\n**Synthesizing the Evidence**\n\nThe combined, unanimous conclusion from the spectral analysis is that the unknown molecule must contain both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n**Evaluating the Formula Options**\n\nThis leads to two strict requirements for the molecular formula:\n\n1.  **Oxygen Count**: The molecule must contain **two oxygen atoms** to be a carboxylic acid. This immediately eliminates options with one oxygen atom: C6H12O (A) and C6H10O (C).\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**: The DoU represents the total number of rings and pi bonds. The molecule has one pi bond in the C=O of the acid and one pi bond in the C=C of the alkene, requiring a total **DoU of 2**. We must check the remaining options against this requirement using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   **For C6H12O2 (Option D)**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This is incorrect as it only accounts for the C=O bond, not the C=C bond.\n    *   **For C6H10O2 (Option B)**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This is a perfect match, accounting for both the C=O and C=C double bonds.\n\n**Careful Points & Final Decision**\n\n*   The scientific reasoning across all 15 candidate answers is unanimous and sound, concluding that the correct molecular formula is **C6H10O2**.\n*   The only point of failure in some answers is correctly mapping this formula back to the lettered choice provided in the original question.\n*   According to the original question's list, the formula C6H10O2 corresponds to option B.\n\nThe correct chemical formula that satisfies all spectroscopic evidence is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer by synthesizing the information from the candidate answers and performing a rigorous evaluation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data:** The first step is to interpret what each piece of evidence tells us about the unknown compound's structure.\n    *   **FTIR Spectrum**:\n        *   A **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** combined with a **strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** is the definitive signature of a **carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH)**. The broadness is caused by the O-H bond's hydrogen bonding, and the 1700 cm⁻¹ peak is the C=O carbonyl stretch.\n        *   A **strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, which means the molecule is an alkene.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum**:\n        *   The observation of **\"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\"** explicitly confirms the presence of hydrogens on a C=C double bond.

This mass corresponds precisely to the [COOH]⁺ fragment (atomic masses: C=12, O=16, H=1; Total = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45).\n    *   **Combined Conclusion**: The evidence from all three techniques points to one unambiguous conclusion: the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n\n2.  **Translate Structural Features into Formula Requirements:**\n    *   **Oxygen Count**: Because the compound is a carboxylic acid (-COOH), its molecular formula **must contain two oxygen atoms (O₂)**.\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**: The DoU represents the total number of pi bonds and rings in a molecule. The unknown has one pi bond from the C=O group and another from the C=C group. Therefore, the molecule must have a total DoU of **2**.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Candidate Formulas:**\n    Let's test the given options against these two requirements.\n    *   Options: A) C6H12O, B) C6H10O2, C) C6H12O2, D) C6H10O.\n    *   **Filtering by Oxygen Count**: We can immediately eliminate formulas with only one oxygen atom: A) C6H12O and D) C6H10O.\n    *   **Remaining Options**: We are left with B) C6H10O2 and C) C6H12O2.\n\n4.  **Final Check using Degree of Unsaturation:**\n    We will now use the DoU formula, `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`, to decide between the two remaining options. We are looking for a DoU of 2.\n    *   **For C) C6H12O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. A DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O double bond, implying the rest of the molecule is saturated. This contradicts the FTIR and NMR data, which show a C=C bond.\n    *   **For B) C6H10O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DoU of 2 perfectly matches the requirements for both the C=O and C=C double bonds.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n*   The **broadness** of the FTIR peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is crucial. A sharp O-H peak in this region would suggest an alcohol, but a very broad peak is a hallmark of a carboxylic acid.\n*   The m/z = 45 fragment is a powerful piece of confirmatory evidence for the -COOH group, solidifying the FTIR interpretation.\n*   It is most efficient to first filter the options by the non-negotiable atom count (two oxygens) before performing the DoU calculation.\n*   The final selection of the answer letter depends on correctly matching the derived formula (C6H10O2) to the provided list of options.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe only chemical formula that fits all the evidence is **C6H10O2**. According to the provided options, this corresponds to B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Spectroscopic Data (Consensus View)**\nAll 15 candidate answers show a remarkable and correct consensus on interpreting the spectroscopic data.\n*   **FTIR:** The combination of a very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ (O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid), a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ (C=O carbonyl stretch), and a strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ (C=C alkene stretch) definitively indicates the compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n*   **¹H NMR:** The mention of \"vinyl-hydrogens\" explicitly confirms the presence of the **alkene (C=C)** functional group, corroborating the FTIR analysis.\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:** The fragment peak at m/z = 45 is unanimously identified as the highly diagnostic **carboxyl cation [COOH]⁺**, providing a third, independent confirmation of the carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n**2. Synthesis of Chemical Requirements**\nBased on the unanimous interpretation of the spectra, the correct molecular formula must satisfy two non-negotiable criteria:\n1.  **It must contain two oxygen atoms** to form the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n2.  **It must have a Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of 2.** One degree comes from the C=O double bond in the acid, and the second degree comes from the C=C double bond of the alkene.\n\n**3. Evaluation of the Given Options**\nLet's evaluate the four choices against these two criteria. The provided options are:\nA) C6H10O2\nB) C6H12O2\nC) C6H12O\nD) C6H10O\n\n*   **Criterion 1: Must contain two oxygen atoms.** This immediately eliminates options C) C6H12O and D) C6H10O.\n*   **Criterion 2: Must have a Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of 2.** We use the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)` to check the remaining options.\n    *   **For A) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This perfectly matches the requirement for one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n    *   **For B) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU only accounts for the C=O bond, implying the molecule is a saturated carboxylic acid, which contradicts the clear evidence for an alkene.\n\n**4. Conclusion and Careful Points**\n*   The scientific reasoning presented in all candidate answers is sound and unanimously leads to the conclusion that the molecular formula is **C6H10O2**.\n*   The disagreement in the final letter choices (A, B, C, D) among the candidate answers stems from inconsistent labeling of the options in their individual responses, not from any error in chemical reasoning.\n*   Based on the options provided in the question prompt (A: C6H10O2, B: C6H12O2, etc.), the correct formula C6H10O2 corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
