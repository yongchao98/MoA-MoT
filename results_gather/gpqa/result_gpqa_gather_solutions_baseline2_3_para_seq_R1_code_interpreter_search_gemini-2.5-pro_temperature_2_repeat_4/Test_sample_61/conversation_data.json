To find the correct sequence of reagents, we must analyze the transformation from the starting material to the final product and then evaluate each proposed pathway.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material and Final Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`). This is an 8-carbon molecule containing a cyclohexane ring and a terminal alkyne.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n    *   Let's deconstruct the IUPAC name. The parent molecule is `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`), which is a 7-carbon aldehyde.\n    *   The substituent is `(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)`, which has the structure `-CH(OH)C₆H₁₁`.\n    *   The name indicates this substituent is attached at the C1 position of the parent cyclohexane ring, the same carbon that bears the aldehyde (`-CHO`) group. This name is chemically impossible as it would require five bonds to that carbon.\n    *   The most plausible interpretation is that the intended product is the **self-aldol addition product** of two molecules of **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**. This is a common pattern in complex synthesis problems. The product has 14 carbons and two cyclohexane rings, confirming a dimerization event.\n\n### **Step 2: Formulate the Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe synthesis can be logically divided into two main stages:\n1.  **Preparation of the Intermediate:** Convert ethynylcyclohexane (C₈) into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (C₇). This requires a C-C bond cleavage.\n2.  **Aldol Condensation:** Dimerize two molecules of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde using a base catalyst to form the final aldol product.\n\nFor Stage 1, a standard and controlled way to cleave a C-C bond and form an aldehyde is via reductive ozonolysis of an alkene. To set this up from the alkyne and avoid forming formaldehyde as a byproduct, a common strategy is to first alkylate the terminal alkyne, then partially reduce it to an alkene.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate Each Proposed Reagent Sequence**\n\nLet's examine each option against our proposed strategy.\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ H₂O; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   The crucial flaw is in **Step 3**. The ozonolysis workup with water (`H₂O`) is an **oxidative workup**. This would oxidize the cleaved fragments to carboxylic acids (`C₆H₁₁-COOH`), not the aldehyde (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`) needed for the subsequent aldol reaction. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. Ba(OH)₂**\n    *   **Step 1:** NaNH₂ (a strong base) deprotonates the terminal alkyne, and the resulting acetylide ion reacts with methyl chloride. This correctly forms an internal alkyne, 1-cyclohexylpropyne.\n    *   **Step 2:** `H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate` is Lindlar's catalyst. It correctly performs a partial hydrogenation of the alkyne to a *cis*-alkene.\n    *   **Step 3:** Ozonolysis (`O₃`) followed by a **reductive workup** with dimethyl sulfide (`(CH₃)₂S`) correctly cleaves the alkene to yield two aldehydes: **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** (the required intermediate) and acetaldehyde.\n    *   **Step 4:** Barium hydroxide (`Ba(OH)₂`) is a suitable base to catalyze the self-aldol condensation of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde to form the target product.\n    *   This entire sequence is chemically logical and sound.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH₂, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   The flaw is in **Step 1**. `NaNH₂` is a very strong base and will react with the acidic proton of methanol in an acid-base neutralization. This would prevent the intended alkylation reaction from occurring. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)₂; 3. H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**\n    *   The flaw is in **Step 2**. `H₂/Pd` without a \"poison\" (like CaCO₃) is a catalyst for **complete hydrogenation**. It would reduce the alkyne all the way to an unreactive alkane (propylcyclohexane), making it impossible to proceed to the target product. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only sequence that represents a chemically correct and logical pathway to synthesize the target molecule is Option B. It systematically prepares the required aldehyde intermediate and then uses a standard base catalyst to perform the final C-C bond-forming aldol reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Starting Material and Target Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. The structure is a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne (`-C≡CH`). Let's denote the cyclohexyl group as 'Cy', so the structure is `Cy-C≡CH`. It is an 8-carbon molecule.\n*   **Target Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let's break down this IUPAC name to determine the structure.\n    *   The parent molecule is `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` (`Cy-CHO`).\n    *   A substituent, `(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)` which has the structure `-CH(OH)Cy`, is attached to position `1-` of the parent ring. By definition, position 1 is the carbon atom to which the principal functional group (`-CHO`) is attached.\n    *   This means the target structure is the result of a **self-aldol addition** of two molecules of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The enolate of one molecule attacks the carbonyl of the second molecule. The product contains two cyclohexyl rings and a total of 14 carbons.\n\n### **2. Formulate the Overall Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe synthesis must be performed in two main stages:\n1.  **Synthesize the Key Intermediate:** The C8 starting material (`Cy-C≡CH`) must be converted into the C7 intermediate, `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` (`Cy-CHO`). This requires removing one carbon from the side chain while adding an oxygen. This is a classic application of ozonolysis.\n2.  **Perform the Aldol Reaction:** The synthesized `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` must undergo a base-catalyzed self-aldol addition to form the final C14 product.\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Reaction Sequence**\n\nWe will now systematically evaluate each option against this logical synthetic plan.\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. Ba(OH)₂**\n    *   **Step 1:** `NaNH₂, methyl chloride`. The strong base `NaNH₂` deprotonates the terminal alkyne. The resulting acetylide anion reacts with methyl chloride to form an internal alkyne, `Cy-C≡C-CH₃` (1-cyclohexylpropyne). This is a correct alkylation step that sets up a controlled cleavage.\n    *   **Step 2:** `H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`. This is Lindlar's catalyst, which correctly performs a partial, stereoselective reduction of the alkyne to a *cis*-alkene (`cis-Cy-CH=CH-CH₃`).\n    *   **Step 3:** `O₃/ (CH₃)₂S`. This is ozonolysis followed by a **reductive workup**. It correctly cleaves the alkene to yield two aldehydes: **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (`Cy-CHO`)** and acetaldehyde (`CH₃CHO`). This step successfully creates the required intermediate.\n    *   **Step 4:** `Ba(OH)₂`. This is a base that correctly catalyzes the aldol reaction. The self-condensation of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde will occur, forming the target product.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence represents a chemically sound and logical pathway to the target molecule.\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ H₂O; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   **Flaw:** Step 3, `O₃/H₂O`, is ozonolysis with an **oxidative workup**. This would cleave the alkene but produce carboxylic acids (`Cy-COOH`), not the aldehyde needed for the aldol reaction. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH₂, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   **Flaw:** Step 1 is chemically flawed. The strong base `NaNH₂` will be neutralized by the acidic proton of `methanol` in an acid-base reaction. This is an unproductive first step. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)₂; 4. ...**\n    *   **Flaw:** Step 2, `H₂/Pd`, uses a catalyst for **complete hydrogenation**. It will reduce the alkyne all the way to a saturated, unreactive alkane (`Cy-CH₂CH₂CH₃`), making subsequent steps impossible. This sequence is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, only option A outlines a chemically viable pathway.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\n**Analysis of the Synthesis Problem**\n\nThe task requires finding the correct sequence of reagents to convert **ethynylcyclohexane** into **1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material and Target Product**\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This is a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne (`-C≡CH`). Let's denote the cyclohexyl group as 'Cy'. The structure is `Cy-C≡CH`.\n*   **Target Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The name describes a complex structure that is the result of a dimerization reaction.\n    *   The parent molecule is `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` (`Cy-CHO`).\n    *   The overall structure is the product of a **self-aldol addition** reaction between two molecules of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. In this reaction, a base catalyst causes the alpha-carbon of one aldehyde molecule to attack the carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule.\n    *   This means the overall synthesis must first produce `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` and then induce this aldol reaction.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the Overall Synthetic Strategy**\nThe synthesis must proceed in two major stages:\n1.  **Preparation of the Aldehyde Intermediate:** Convert ethynylcyclohexane (`Cy-C≡CH`) into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (`Cy-CHO`). This requires transforming a 2-carbon side chain into a 1-carbon aldehyde group, implying a carbon-carbon bond cleavage. Ozonolysis is the classic method for this.\n2.  **Aldol Reaction:** Use a base catalyst to promote the self-condensation of the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde intermediate to form the final target product.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate Each Reagent Sequence**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on this two-stage strategy.\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; 3. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O**\n    *   **Flaw:** Step 2 uses `H2/Pd`. This catalyst performs **complete hydrogenation**, which would reduce the alkyne all the way to a saturated alkane (propylcyclohexane). An alkane is unreactive to the subsequent reagents, making this pathway a synthetic dead end. The ordering is also illogical.\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ H2O; 4. NH4OH**\n    *   **Flaw:** Step 3 is ozonolysis (`O3`) followed by a workup with `H2O`. This is an **oxidative workup**. It cleaves the alkene but oxidizes the resulting fragments to carboxylic acids, not the required aldehyde intermediate needed for the aldol reaction.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH**\n    *   **Flaw:** Step 1 is chemically incorrect. Sodium amide (`NaNH2`) is a very strong base. It will react with the acidic proton of the solvent, methanol (`CH3OH`), in an acid-base neutralization reaction, preventing it from effectively deprotonating the alkyne for the intended alkylation.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2**\n    *   **Step 1: Alkylation.** `NaNH2` (a strong base) deprotonates the terminal alkyne. The resulting acetylide ion reacts with `methyl chloride` to form an internal alkyne, `1-cyclohexylpropyne`. This is a correct first step.\n    *   **Step 2: Partial Reduction.** `H2/Pd-calcium carbonate` is Lindlar's catalyst. It correctly performs a partial reduction of the alkyne to a *cis*-alkene.\n    *   **Step 3: Reductive Ozonolysis.** Ozonolysis (`O3`) followed by a **reductive workup** with dimethyl sulfide (`(CH3)2S`) correctly cleaves the alkene to yield two aldehydes: **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** (the required intermediate) and acetaldehyde.\n    *   **Step 4: Aldol Reaction.** `Ba(OH)2` is a suitable base to catalyze the self-aldol addition of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, leading to the final target product.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is a chemically logical and correct pathway.\n\nFinal Conclusion: Only option C provides a chemically sound, step-by-step synthesis that correctly generates the necessary aldehyde intermediate and then uses a standard base-catalyzed reaction to form the final product.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct sequence of reagents.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Starting Material and the Target Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This is a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne group (`-C≡CH`).\n*   **Target Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let's analyze this IUPAC name to understand the final structure.\n    *   The parent molecule is `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`, which consists of a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group (`-CHO`) attached. By convention, the carbon on the ring bonded to the aldehyde is C1.\n    *   The substituent, `(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)`, which is a `-CH(OH)` group also bearing a cyclohexyl group, is attached at position 1.\n    *   This means the target structure has a cyclohexane ring where one carbon atom is attached to *both* an aldehyde group (`-CHO`) and a `(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)` group.\n    *   This structure is characteristic of an **aldol addition product**. It is formed from the self-condensation of two molecules of **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n### **Step 2: Formulate the Overall Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe synthesis must be broken down into two major parts:\n1.  **Formation of the key intermediate:** Convert ethynylcyclohexane (an 8-carbon molecule) into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (a 7-carbon molecule). This requires cleaving one carbon atom from the side chain and introducing an aldehyde functional group.\n2.  **Aldol Reaction:** Dimerize two molecules of the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde intermediate using a base catalyst to form the final C-C bond and the alcohol group.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence**\n\nWe must now evaluate each option to see which one correctly performs the two stages of our strategy.\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. Ba(OH)₂**\n    1.  **Alkylation:** `NaNH₂` is a strong base that deprotonates the terminal alkyne. The resulting nucleophile attacks methyl chloride to form an internal alkyne, `1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne`. This is a standard and correct first step.\n    2.  **Partial Reduction:** `H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate` is Lindlar's catalyst. It correctly reduces the alkyne to a *cis*-alkene, preparing it for ozonolysis.\n    3.  **Reductive Ozonolysis:** `O₃` followed by a dimethyl sulfide (`(CH₃)₂S`) workup is a reductive process that cleaves the double bond to yield aldehydes. This step successfully produces **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**, the required intermediate.\n    4.  **Aldol Condensation:** `Ba(OH)₂` is a suitable base to catalyze the aldol reaction, which will dimerize the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde intermediate to form the target product.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is chemically sound and follows the correct synthetic logic.\n\n*   **B) 1.

This would convert the alkene fragments into carboxylic acids, not the aldehydes required for the final aldol reaction.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Incorrect.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nOnly the sequence of reagents presented in option A provides a chemically logical and valid pathway. It correctly synthesizes the necessary aldehyde intermediate through a specific sequence of alkylation, partial reduction, and reductive ozonolysis, and then employs a base catalyst to achieve the final carbon-carbon bond formation via an aldol reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n**1. Deconstruction and Strategic Analysis**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`). This is a terminal alkyne with 8 carbon atoms.\n*   **Target Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This name describes a structure that is the result of a **self-aldol addition** reaction between two molecules of an intermediate: **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`)**. The target is a C14 molecule, reinforcing the need for a dimerization (aldol) step from a C7 precursor.\n*   **Overall Synthetic Strategy:**\n    1.  **Stage I: Intermediate Synthesis.** The first priority is to convert the 8-carbon starting material (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`) into the 7-carbon intermediate (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`). This requires a C-C bond cleavage.\n    2.  **Stage II: Aldol Condensation.** The second part involves treating the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde intermediate with a base to catalyze the aldol reaction, forming the final C14 product.\n\n**2. Detailed Evaluation of the Proposed Reagent Sequences**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in evaluating the pathway to the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde intermediate. A standard and controlled method involves alkylating the alkyne, partially reducing it to an alkene, and then cleaving the alkene with reductive ozonolysis.\n\nLet's assess each option against this logical strategy:\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH₂, methanol...**\n    *   **Flaw:** This sequence is incorrect from the first step. Sodium amide (`NaNH₂`) is a very strong base that would be neutralized by the acidic proton of methanol (`CH₃OH`). This acid-base reaction would prevent the intended modification of the alkyne.\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. Ba(OH)₂**\n    *   **Step 1:** Correct. Deprotonation with `NaNH₂` and reaction with `CH₃Cl` performs an alkylation, yielding 1-cyclohexylpropyne. This strategically sets up the subsequent cleavage to avoid the formation of highly reactive formaldehyde.\n    *   **Step 2:** Correct. `H₂/Pd-CaCO₃` is Lindlar's catalyst, which performs a partial reduction of the alkyne to a *cis*-alkene.\n    *   **Step 3:** Correct. `O₃/(CH₃)₂S` is a **reductive ozonolysis**. This reaction correctly cleaves the alkene to yield the required aldehyde intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (along with acetaldehyde).\n    *   **Step 4:** Correct. `Ba(OH)₂` is a suitable base to catalyze the self-aldol condensation of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde to form the target product.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This entire sequence is chemically sound and follows the most logical synthetic plan.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd...**\n    *   **Flaw:** Step 2 uses `H₂/Pd` without a \"poisoning\" agent like CaCO₃. This catalyst would cause **complete hydrogenation** of the alkyne all the way to a saturated, unreactive alkane (propylcyclohexane), making further steps impossible.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride; ... 3. O₃/ H₂O;...**\n    *   **Flaw:** Step 3 is an ozonolysis followed by a workup with `H₂O`. This constitutes an **oxidative workup**, which would convert the alkene fragments into carboxylic acids, not the aldehydes required for the subsequent aldol reaction.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nOnly the sequence presented in option B provides a chemically correct and logical pathway. It systematically transforms the starting material into the required intermediate using a standard set of reactions (alkylation, partial reduction, reductive ozonolysis) and then employs a suitable catalyst for the final C-C bond-forming aldol reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\n### Analysis of the Synthesis Problem\n\n1.  **Analyze Starting Material and Target Product:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`). This is a C8 terminal alkyne.\n    *   **Target Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This name describes an α-hydroxy aldehyde. This structure is the characteristic result of a **self-aldol addition** reaction between two molecules of a precursor aldehyde.\n    *   **The Key Intermediate:** To form the C14 target product, the C8 starting material must first be converted into the C7 intermediate, **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`).\n\n2.  **Outline the Synthetic Strategy:**\n    The overall process involves two main stages:\n    *   **Stage 1: Preparation of Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.** This involves transforming the `C≡CH` group into a `CHO` group, which requires a net loss of one carbon atom. A robust method is to first modify the alkyne and then cleave it with ozonolysis.\n    *   **Stage 2: Aldol Condensation.** The synthesized cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is then made to react with itself in a base-catalyzed aldol addition to form the final C14 product.\n\n### Evaluation of Each Reagent Sequence\n\nLet's examine each option to see if it correctly executes this two-stage strategy.\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. Ba(OH)₂**\n    1.  **Alkylation:** `NaNH₂` deprotonates the terminal alkyne, and the resulting acetylide anion attacks methyl chloride to form an internal alkyne, `1-cyclohexylpropyne`. This is a correct first step.\n    2.  **Partial Reduction:** `H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate` (Lindlar's catalyst) correctly reduces the internal alkyne to a *cis*-alkene.\n    3.  **Reductive Ozonolysis:** `O₃/(CH₃)₂S` cleaves the double bond, and the reductive workup correctly yields aldehydes: **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** (the key intermediate) and acetaldehyde.\n    4.  **Aldol Reaction:** `Ba(OH)₂` is a suitable base to catalyze the aldol addition of the intermediate to form the target product.\n    *   **Verdict:** This is a chemically sound and logical sequence.\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)₂; 4. H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**\n    *   The fatal flaw is in step 2. `H₂/Pd` is a catalyst for **complete hydrogenation**, which would reduce the alkyne all the way to an unreactive alkane. The synthesis cannot proceed.\n    *   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ H₂O; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   The fatal flaw is in step 3.

It employs a logical progression of alkylation, partial hydrogenation, reductive ozonolysis to form the key aldehyde intermediate, and finally, a base-catalyzed aldol reaction to yield the final product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct sequence of reagents.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Starting Material and Target Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. The structure is a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne group (`-C≡CH`). We can denote the cyclohexyl group as 'Cy', making the structure `Cy-C≡CH`. It is an 8-carbon molecule.\n*   **Target Product:** `1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`. This name, while complex, describes a very specific structure.\n    *   The parent molecule is `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` (`Cy-CHO`).\n    *   The substituent `(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)`, which has the structure `-CH(OH)Cy`, is attached at position C1 of the parent cyclohexane ring. C1 is the same carbon to which the `-CHO` group is attached.\n    *   This structure, an α-hydroxy aldehyde, is the characteristic product of a **self-aldol addition** reaction between two molecules of `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`. In this reaction, a base creates an enolate from one aldehyde molecule, which then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule.\n    *   This means the overall synthesis requires a dimerization step, which is consistent with the starting material having one cyclohexyl ring and the product having two.\n\n### **2. Formulate the Overall Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe synthesis can be broken down into two major stages:\n1.  **Preparation of the Aldehyde Intermediate:** Convert ethynylcyclohexane (`Cy-C≡CH`, C8) into `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` (`Cy-CHO`, C7). This requires removing one carbon atom from the side chain.\n2.  **Aldol Reaction:** Use a base catalyst to promote the self-aldol reaction of `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` to form the final 14-carbon product.\n\n### **3. Devise a Path for the Intermediate (Stage 1) and Evaluate the Options**\n\nTo go from `Cy-C≡CH` to `Cy-CHO`, we need to cleave a carbon-carbon bond. Oxidative cleavage via ozonolysis of an alkene is the most direct method.\n\n*   A refined strategy would be:\n    1.  **Alkylate the alkyne:** Deprotonate with `NaNH2` and add `CH3Cl`. This yields `Cy-C≡C-CH3`. This avoids forming highly reactive formaldehyde as a byproduct later.\n    2.  **Partially reduce the alkyne:** Use a poisoned catalyst like Lindlar's (`H2/Pd-CaCO3`) to get the cis-alkene, `cis-Cy-CH=CH-CH3`.\n    3.  **Cleave the alkene:** Use `O3` followed by a **reductive workup** (like `(CH3)2S`) to get `Cy-CHO` and `CH3CHO`.\n\nNow, we evaluate the given choices against this sound chemical strategy.\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH2, methanol...**: This sequence is flawed from the beginning. `NaNH2` is a strong base that will be neutralized by the acidic methanol, preventing the desired reaction with the alkyne.\n*   **B) 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; ... 3. O3/ H2O...**: This sequence fails at step 3. The use of `H2O` as a workup for ozonolysis constitutes an **oxidative workup**, which would produce carboxylic acids (`Cy-COOH`) instead of the required aldehyde (`Cy-CHO`).\n*   **C) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2**: This sequence perfectly matches the ideal strategy.\n    *   **Step 1:** Correctly alkylates the alkyne.\n    *   **Step 2:** Correctly performs a partial reduction to the alkene using Lindlar's catalyst.\n    *   **Step 3:** Correctly performs a reductive ozonolysis to yield the required intermediate, `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`.\n    *   **Step 4:** Correctly uses a base (`Ba(OH)2`) to catalyze the final aldol addition reaction.\n*   **D) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd...**: This sequence fails at step 2. Using `H2/Pd` without a poison will cause **complete hydrogenation** of the alkyne to a saturated, unreactive alkane (`propylcyclohexane`), making the subsequent steps impossible.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOnly the sequence of reagents provided in option C represents a chemically correct and logical pathway to synthesize the target molecule from the starting material.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material and Target Product**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`). This is an 8-carbon molecule containing a cyclohexane ring and a terminal alkyne.\n    *   **Target Product:** `1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`. As noted by the reasoning in multiple candidate answers, this IUPAC name is slightly problematic, but the structure it implies is clear. It is the product of a **self-aldol condensation** of two molecules of `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`). This final product is a 14-carbon molecule containing two cyclohexane rings.\n    *   **Goal:** The overall transformation requires two main stages: first, synthesizing the `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` intermediate, and second, inducing the aldol condensation.\n\n2.  **Devise a Strategy for Synthesizing the Intermediate**\n    *   To get from ethynylcyclohexane (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`, C8) to cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`, C7), a carbon-carbon bond must be broken, effectively removing one carbon atom from the side chain.\n    *   The standard way to achieve this specific cleavage is through a sequence of reactions starting with alkylation, followed by reduction and then ozonolysis.\n        *   **Step 1: Alkylation.** To control the products of ozonolysis (avoiding highly reactive formaldehyde), the terminal alkyne is first converted to an internal alkyne. Deprotonation with a strong base (`NaNH₂`) followed by reaction with an alkyl halide (like `CH₃Cl`) accomplishes this.\n        *   **Step 2: Partial Reduction.** The internal alkyne must be reduced to an alkene. Full reduction to an alkane must be avoided. A \"poisoned\" catalyst like Lindlar's catalyst (`H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`) is perfect for this, producing a *cis*-alkene.\n        *   **Step 3: Reductive Ozonolysis.** The alkene is cleaved at the double bond with ozone (`O₃`). To obtain the desired aldehyde product, a **reductive workup** is essential, using a reagent like dimethyl sulfide (`(CH₃)₂S`). An oxidative workup would yield an unwanted carboxylic acid. This step produces `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` and `acetaldehyde`.\n\n3.  **Final Reaction Step**\n    *   **Step 4: Aldol Condensation.** The `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` intermediate is treated with a base (e.g., `Ba(OH)₂`) to catalyze the self-aldol reaction, forming the final C14 target molecule.\n\n**Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nNow we can apply this ideal pathway to evaluate the specific choices provided.\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. Ba(OH)₂**\n    *   This sequence perfectly matches the logical, multi-step synthesis derived above. Each step uses the correct reagents for the required transformation: alkylation, partial reduction, reductive ozonolysis, and finally, base-catalyzed aldol condensation. **This pathway is chemically sound.**\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)₂; 4. H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**\n    *   **Careful Point:** The critical flaw is in Step 2. `H₂/Pd` without a poison is a catalyst for complete hydrogenation. It would reduce the alkyne all the way to a saturated, unreactive alkane (`propylcyclohexane`), making the subsequent steps impossible. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH₂, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   **Careful Point:** The flaw is in Step 1. `NaNH₂` is a very strong base. `Methanol` is a protic solvent that would act as an acid and neutralize the `NaNH₂` in a simple acid-base reaction, preventing the desired alkylation from occurring. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ H₂O; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   **Careful Point:** The flaw is in Step 3. The ozonolysis is followed by a workup with `H₂O`. This constitutes an **oxidative workup**, which would convert the cleaved fragments into carboxylic acids, not the required aldehyde intermediate needed for the aldol reaction. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAfter a thorough analysis of the required chemical transformations and potential pitfalls, only the sequence of reagents presented in Option A constitutes a valid and logical synthetic route to the target molecule.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the chemical transformation, here is the reasoning to determine the correct sequence of reagents.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material and the Target Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This molecule consists of a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne (`-C≡CH`). We can denote its structure as `C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`. It is an 8-carbon molecule.\n*   **Target Product:** `1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`.\n    *   Let's deconstruct the IUPAC name. The parent molecule is `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`, which is a cyclohexane ring with a `-CHO` group.\n    *   The final product has a complex substituent, `(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)`, attached at position 1 of the ring—the same carbon atom that holds the `-CHO` group.\n    *   This final product contains **two** cyclohexane rings and has the characteristic α-hydroxy aldehyde structure of an **aldol addition product**.\n    *   This structure can only be formed by the self-condensation of two molecules of the intermediate, **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`)**.\n\n### **Step 2: Formulate the Overall Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe synthesis must be performed in two distinct stages:\n1.  **Stage I: Preparation of the Aldehyde Intermediate.** Convert the 8-carbon starting material, ethynylcyclohexane, into the 7-carbon intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This requires a reaction that can cleave a specific carbon-carbon bond.\n2.  **Stage II: The Aldol Reaction.** Use a base to catalyze the self-addition reaction of the synthesized cyclohexanecarbaldehyde to form the final 14-carbon product.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence**\n\nWe must find the option that correctly performs both stages of this synthesis. A robust plan for Stage I would be: alkyne alkylation → partial reduction to an alkene → reductive ozonolysis to cleave the alkene into aldehydes.\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH₂, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   **Flaw:** The first step is chemically unsound for this synthesis.

NH₃; 3. O₃/ H₂O; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   **Flaw:** Step 3, ozonolysis followed by a water workup (`O₃/H₂O`), is an **oxidative workup**. This process would create carboxylic acids, not the aldehyde intermediate required for the subsequent aldol reaction.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)₂; 4. H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**\n    *   **Flaw:** Step 2 uses `H₂/Pd` without a poisoning agent. This will cause **complete hydrogenation**, reducing the alkyne all the way to a saturated, unreactive alkane. This makes subsequent steps impossible.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. Ba(OH)₂**\n    *   **Step 1:** Correct. The terminal alkyne is deprotonated by `NaNH₂` and alkylated with `methyl chloride` to form an internal alkyne, `1-cyclohexylpropyne`.\n    *   **Step 2:** Correct. `H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate` (Lindlar's catalyst) correctly performs a partial reduction, converting the alkyne into a *cis*-alkene.\n    *   **Step 3:** Correct. `O₃` followed by a reductive workup with dimethyl sulfide (`(CH₃)₂S`) cleaves the alkene to produce the key intermediate, **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**.\n    *   **Step 4:** Correct. Barium hydroxide (`Ba(OH)₂`) is a suitable base to catalyze the aldol addition of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, leading to the final target molecule.\n\nThis is the only sequence that represents a chemically valid and logical pathway.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Starting Material and the Target Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This molecule consists of a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne (`-C≡CH`). Let's denote the cyclohexyl group as 'Cy'. The structure is `Cy-C≡CH`. It is an 8-carbon molecule.\n*   **Target Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n    *   **Deconstruction of the Name:** The parent molecule is `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` (`Cy-CHO`), which is a 7-carbon molecule. The carbon of the cyclohexane ring to which the `-CHO` (carbaldehyde) group is attached is C1.\n    *   A substituent, `(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)`, is attached to this same C1 carbon. This substituent's structure is `-CH(OH)Cy`.\n    *   **Structure Confirmation:** The product contains two cyclohexyl rings and a total of 14 carbons. The structure, an α-hydroxy aldehyde, is characteristic of the product formed by a **self-aldol addition** of two molecules of the intermediate, **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**. In this reaction, a base creates an enolate at the α-carbon of one aldehyde molecule, which then attacks the carbonyl group of a second aldehyde molecule.\n\n### **2. Outline the Overall Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe synthesis must be performed in two distinct stages:\n*   **Stage 1: Synthesis of the Intermediate.** The 8-carbon starting material (`Cy-C≡CH`) must be converted into the 7-carbon intermediate (`Cy-CHO`). This requires a reaction that can cleave a specific carbon-carbon bond. Oxidative cleavage via ozonolysis is the standard method for this.\n*   **Stage 2: Dimerization.** The cyclohexanecarbaldehyde intermediate must undergo a base-catalyzed self-aldol reaction to form the final C14 product.\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Option Against the Strategy**\n\nLet's evaluate each sequence of reagents to see if it follows our established chemical strategy.\n\n*   **Option A) 1. NaNH₂, methanol...**\n    *   **Flaw:** The first step is chemically unsound for synthesis. Sodium amide (`NaNH₂`) is a very strong base and will be neutralized by the acidic proton of methanol (`CH₃OH`) in a simple acid-base reaction. It will not efficiently deprotonate the alkyne for the intended subsequent reaction.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. Ba(OH)₂**\n    *   **Step 1:** Correct. The strong base `NaNH₂` deprotonates the terminal alkyne, and the resulting acetylide anion reacts with `methyl chloride` to form an internal alkyne, `1-cyclohexylpropyne`. This strategically sets up the subsequent cleavage to avoid forming formaldehyde.\n    *   **Step 2:** Correct. `H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate` is Lindlar's catalyst, which performs a partial reduction (hydrogenation) of the alkyne to a *cis*-alkene.\n    *   **Step 3:** Correct. `O₃/(CH₃)₂S` is ozonolysis with a **reductive workup**. It correctly cleaves the alkene to yield the required intermediate, `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` (`Cy-CHO`), along with acetaldehyde.\n    *   **Step 4:** Correct. `Ba(OH)₂` is a suitable base to catalyze the self-aldol condensation of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde to form the target product.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a chemically logical and correct pathway.\n\n*   **Option C) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd...**\n    *   **Flaw:** Step 2 uses `H₂/Pd`, which is a catalyst for **complete hydrogenation**. It will reduce the alkyne all the way to an unreactive alkane (`propylcyclohexane`). The subsequent steps will not work on an alkane.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D) 1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ H₂O...**\n    *   **Flaw:** Step 3 is ozonolysis with a water (`H₂O`) workup. This constitutes an **oxidative workup**, which would convert the alkene fragments into carboxylic acids, not the aldehydes required for the final aldol reaction.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Incorrect.\n\nBased on the detailed chemical analysis, only the sequence in Option B correctly outlines the necessary transformations in a chemically sound manner.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct sequence of reagents.\n\n### **1.

In this reaction, a base creates an enolate from one aldehyde molecule, which then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule.\n\n### **2. Outline the Overall Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe synthesis must be performed in two distinct stages:\n1.  **Intermediate Synthesis:** Convert the 8-carbon starting material, ethynylcyclohexane, into the 7-carbon intermediate, `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`. This requires cleaving one carbon atom from the side chain and installing an aldehyde functional group. This is typically achieved via ozonolysis of an alkene.\n2.  **Final Condensation:** Use a base catalyst to induce the self-aldol condensation of the `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` intermediate to form the final C-C bond and the target molecule.\n\n### **3.

The structure is `Cy-C≡CH`.\n*   **Target Product:** `1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`.\n    *   The parent molecule is `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` (`Cy-CHO`).\n    *   The substituent is a `(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)` group (`-CH(OH)Cy`).\n    *   The position is at C1 of the parent cyclohexane ring, the same carbon that bears the `-CHO` group.\n    *   This structure, an α-hydroxy aldehyde, is the product of a **self-aldol condensation** of two molecules of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The α-hydrogen on C1 of one molecule is removed to form a nucleophilic enolate, which then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Overall Synthetic Strategy\nThe synthesis requires two major stages:\n1.  **Preparation of the Key Intermediate:** Convert ethynylcyclohexane (a C8 molecule) into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (a C7 molecule). This involves modifying and then cleaving the two-carbon side chain to a one-carbon aldehyde group.\n2.  **The Aldol Condensation:** Use a base catalyst to cause the self-condensation of two molecules of the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde intermediate to form the C14 target product.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Each Reaction Sequence\nLet's analyze each option based on this two-stage strategy.\n\n**A) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. Ba(OH)₂**\n1.  **Alkylation:** `NaNH₂` is a strong base that deprotonates the terminal alkyne. The resulting acetylide ion reacts with `methyl chloride` to form an internal alkyne, `1-cyclohexylpropyne` (`Cy-C≡C-CH₃`). This is a correct first step that sets up a controlled cleavage.\n2.  **Partial Hydrogenation:** `H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate` is Lindlar's catalyst. It correctly reduces the alkyne to a *cis*-alkene, preparing it for ozonolysis.\n3.  **Reductive Ozonolysis:** `O₃` followed by a reductive workup with dimethyl sulfide (`(CH₃)₂S`) correctly cleaves the double bond to form two aldehydes: `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` (the desired intermediate) and `acetaldehyde`.\n4.  **Aldol Condensation:** `Ba(OH)₂` is a suitable base to catalyze the aldol reaction. The self-condensation of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde will occur, forming the final target molecule.\n*   **Verdict:** This is a completely correct and chemically sound synthetic pathway.\n\n**B) 1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ H₂O; 4. NH₄OH**\n*   **Fatal Flaw:** Step 3 uses ozonolysis with a water (`H₂O`) workup. This constitutes an **oxidative workup**, which produces carboxylic acids, not the required aldehyde intermediate.\n*   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C) 1. NaNH₂, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. NH₄OH**\n*   **Fatal Flaw:** Step 1 is chemically invalid for the intended purpose. The strong base `NaNH₂` would be neutralized by the acidic proton of methanol in an acid-base reaction, rather than deprotonating the alkyne for alkylation.\n*   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)₂; 3. H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**\n*   **Fatal Flaw:** Step 2 uses `H₂/Pd` without a poison. This catalyst promotes **complete hydrogenation**, reducing the alkyne all the way to an unreactive alkane (propylcyclohexane), which is a synthetic dead end.\n*   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe only sequence that represents a valid chemical transformation is A. It correctly executes a four-step synthesis involving alkylation, partial hydrogenation, reductive ozonolysis, and a final base-catalyzed aldol condensation.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided answers and a first-principles review of the chemical transformations, here is a consolidated, step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the Synthetic Goal**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This molecule consists of a cyclohexane ring bonded to a terminal alkyne group (`-C≡CH`). Its structure is `C6H11-C≡CH`, and it contains 8 carbon atoms.\n*   **Target Product:** `1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`.\n    *   **Structure Interpretation:** This name describes a complex structure that is the result of a dimerization reaction. The parent molecule is `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` (`C6H11-CHO`). The substituent, `(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)`, has the structure `-CH(OH)C6H11`. This substituent is attached to the same carbon atom of the parent ring as the aldehyde group (`-CHO`).\n    *   **Key Reaction Type:** This final structure is the characteristic product of a **self-aldol addition** reaction between two molecules of `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`.\n\n### **2. Formulation of the Overall Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe synthesis must be broken down into two major parts, a strategy identified by all correct analyses:\n1.  **Synthesis of the Intermediate:** Convert the C8 starting material, ethynylcyclohexane, into the C7 key intermediate, `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`. This requires a reaction sequence that effectively cleaves one carbon from the side chain while installing an aldehyde functional group.\n2.  **Dimerization:** Use a base catalyst to promote the self-aldol addition of two `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` molecules to form the C14 target product.\n\n### **3. Step-by-Step Evaluation of Each Option**\n\nWe will now systematically evaluate each provided option against the established chemical strategy, identifying the key correct or flawed step in each sequence.\n\n**A) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2**\n*   **Step 1: Alkylation.** The strong base `NaNH2` deprotonates the terminal alkyne. The resulting acetylide anion attacks methyl chloride to form an internal alkyne, `1-cyclohexylpropyne`. This is a correct and well-designed first step. It strategically modifies the alkyne to prevent the formation of highly reactive formaldehyde in the cleavage step.\n*   **Step 2: Partial Reduction.** `H2/Pd-calcium carbonate` is Lindlar's catalyst, which correctly reduces the internal alkyne to a *cis*-alkene. This prepares the molecule for ozonolysis.\n*   **Step 3: Reductive Ozonolysis.** Ozonolysis (`O3`) followed by a reductive workup with dimethyl sulfide (`(CH3)2S`) correctly cleaves the double bond to produce aldehydes. The products are `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` (the required intermediate) and `acetaldehyde`.\n*   **Step 4: Aldol Reaction.** `Ba(OH)2` is a suitable base to catalyze the self-aldol reaction of `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`, forming the desired final product.\n*   **Conclusion:** This sequence is a chemically sound, logical, and complete pathway to the target molecule.\n\n**B) 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ H2O; 4. NH4OH**\n*   **Flaw:** The key flaw is in Step 3. The ozonolysis workup with `H2O` is an **oxidative workup**. This process would oxidize the cleavage fragments to carboxylic acids (`cyclohexanecarboxylic acid` and `propanoic acid`), not the required aldehyde intermediate needed for the final aldol reaction.\n*   **Conclusion:** This option is incorrect.\n\n**C) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; ...**\n*   **Flaw:** The fatal flaw is in Step 2. The catalyst `H2/Pd`, without a poisoning agent, performs **complete hydrogenation**. It would reduce the alkyne all the way to a saturated alkane (`propylcyclohexane`). This alkane is unreactive and cannot be converted to the target product.\n*   **Conclusion:** This option is incorrect.\n\n**D) 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH**\n*   **Flaw:** This sequence is flawed from Step 1. `NaNH2` is a very strong base, while `methanol` is an acid (a proton donor). They would simply react with each other in an acid-base neutralization, preventing the intended deprotonation of the alkyne.\n*   **Conclusion:** This option is incorrect.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe only reaction sequence that provides a valid chemical pathway from the starting material to the target product is **Option A**. It correctly prepares the aldehyde intermediate through a specific sequence of alkylation, partial hydrogenation, and reductive ozonolysis, and then correctly employs a base to induce the final aldol condensation.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "Here is a detailed, step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1.

It is an 8-carbon molecule.\n*   **Final Product**: The final product is **1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**.\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Structure Identification.** The IUPAC name indicates that the parent molecule is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (`Cy-CHO`). A substituent, `(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)` which has the structure `-CH(OH)Cy`, is attached to the C1 position of the parent ring. C1 is, by definition, the carbon bearing the primary functional group, the aldehyde (`-CHO`). This means the product is an α-hydroxy aldehyde, containing two cyclohexane rings for a total of 14 carbons.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Reaction Type.** This final structure is the characteristic product of a **self-aldol addition** reaction between two molecules of an intermediate, which must be **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n### **2.

This requires a C-C bond cleavage.\n*   **Stage 2: Dimerization via Aldol Reaction.** The synthesized cyclohexanecarbaldehyde intermediate must undergo a base-catalyzed self-aldol reaction to form the final 14-carbon product.\n\n### **3.

NH₄OH**\n*   **Flaw:** The flaw is in Step 1. **(Careful Point 5: Reagent Compatibility)** The strong base `NaNH₂` would be neutralized by the acidic proton of the solvent, `methanol`, in a simple acid-base reaction. This would prevent the desired deprotonation of the alkyne. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**D) 1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ H₂O; 4. NH₄OH**\n*   **Flaw:** The flaw is in Step 3.

This sequence is incorrect.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nAfter a thorough step-by-step analysis, only the sequence of reagents presented in **Option A** provides a valid and logical synthetic route to the target molecule.

To find the correct sequence of reagents, we must analyze the transformation from the starting material to the final product and then evaluate each proposed pathway.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material and Final Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`). This is an 8-carbon molecule containing a cyclohexane ring and a terminal alkyne.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n    *   Let's deconstruct the IUPAC name.

This name is chemically impossible as it would require five bonds to that carbon.\n    *   The most plausible interpretation is that the intended product is the **self-aldol addition product** of two molecules of **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**. This is a common pattern in complex synthesis problems. The product has 14 carbons and two cyclohexane rings, confirming a dimerization event.\n\n### **Step 2: Formulate the Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe synthesis can be logically divided into two main stages:\n1.  **Preparation of the Intermediate:** Convert ethynylcyclohexane (C₈) into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (C₇). This requires a C-C bond cleavage.\n2.  **Aldol Condensation:** Dimerize two molecules of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde using a base catalyst to form the final aldol product.\n\nFor Stage 1, a standard and controlled way to cleave a C-C bond and form an aldehyde is via reductive ozonolysis of an alkene. To set this up from the alkyne and avoid forming formaldehyde as a byproduct, a common strategy is to first alkylate the terminal alkyne, then partially reduce it to an alkene.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate Each Proposed Reagent Sequence**\n\nLet's examine each option against our proposed strategy.\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ H₂O; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   The crucial flaw is in **Step 3**. The ozonolysis workup with water (`H₂O`) is an **oxidative workup**.

Let's denote the cyclohexyl group as 'Cy', so the structure is `Cy-C≡CH`. It is an 8-carbon molecule.\n*   **Target Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let's break down this IUPAC name to determine the structure.\n    *   The parent molecule is `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` (`Cy-CHO`).\n    *   A substituent, `(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)` which has the structure `-CH(OH)Cy`, is attached to position `1-` of the parent ring. By definition, position 1 is the carbon atom to which the principal functional group (`-CHO`) is attached.\n    *   This means the target structure is the result of a **self-aldol addition** of two molecules of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

This is a correct alkylation step that sets up a controlled cleavage.\n    *   **Step 2:** `H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`.

The name describes a complex structure that is the result of a dimerization reaction.\n    *   The parent molecule is `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` (`Cy-CHO`).\n    *   The overall structure is the product of a **self-aldol addition** reaction between two molecules of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. In this reaction, a base catalyst causes the alpha-carbon of one aldehyde molecule to attack the carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule.\n    *   This means the overall synthesis must first produce `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` and then induce this aldol reaction.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the Overall Synthetic Strategy**\nThe synthesis must proceed in two major stages:\n1.  **Preparation of the Aldehyde Intermediate:** Convert ethynylcyclohexane (`Cy-C≡CH`) into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (`Cy-CHO`). This requires transforming a 2-carbon side chain into a 1-carbon aldehyde group, implying a carbon-carbon bond cleavage. Ozonolysis is the classic method for this.\n2.  **Aldol Reaction:** Use a base catalyst to promote the self-condensation of the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde intermediate to form the final target product.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate Each Reagent Sequence**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on this two-stage strategy.\n\n*   **A) 1.

It correctly performs a partial reduction of the alkyne to a *cis*-alkene.\n    *   **Step 3: Reductive Ozonolysis.** Ozonolysis (`O3`) followed by a **reductive workup** with dimethyl sulfide (`(CH3)2S`) correctly cleaves the alkene to yield two aldehydes: **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** (the required intermediate) and acetaldehyde.\n    *   **Step 4: Aldol Reaction.** `Ba(OH)2` is a suitable base to catalyze the self-aldol addition of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, leading to the final target product.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is a chemically logical and correct pathway.\n\nFinal Conclusion: Only option C provides a chemically sound, step-by-step synthesis that correctly generates the necessary aldehyde intermediate and then uses a standard base-catalyzed reaction to form the final product.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct sequence of reagents.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Starting Material and the Target Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This is a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne group (`-C≡CH`).\n*   **Target Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let's analyze this IUPAC name to understand the final structure.\n    *   The parent molecule is `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`, which consists of a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group (`-CHO`) attached. By convention, the carbon on the ring bonded to the aldehyde is C1.\n    *   The substituent, `(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)`, which is a `-CH(OH)` group also bearing a cyclohexyl group, is attached at position 1.\n    *   This means the target structure has a cyclohexane ring where one carbon atom is attached to *both* an aldehyde group (`-CHO`) and a `(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)` group.\n    *   This structure is characteristic of an **aldol addition product**. It is formed from the self-condensation of two molecules of **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n### **Step 2: Formulate the Overall Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe synthesis must be broken down into two major parts:\n1.  **Formation of the key intermediate:** Convert ethynylcyclohexane (an 8-carbon molecule) into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (a 7-carbon molecule). This requires cleaving one carbon atom from the side chain and introducing an aldehyde functional group.\n2.  **Aldol Reaction:** Dimerize two molecules of the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde intermediate using a base catalyst to form the final C-C bond and the alcohol group.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence**\n\nWe must now evaluate each option to see which one correctly performs the two stages of our strategy.\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. Ba(OH)₂**\n    1.  **Alkylation:** `NaNH₂` is a strong base that deprotonates the terminal alkyne. The resulting nucleophile attacks methyl chloride to form an internal alkyne, `1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne`. This is a standard and correct first step.\n    2.  **Partial Reduction:** `H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate` is Lindlar's catalyst. It correctly reduces the alkyne to a *cis*-alkene, preparing it for ozonolysis.\n    3.  **Reductive Ozonolysis:** `O₃` followed by a dimethyl sulfide (`(CH₃)₂S`) workup is a reductive process that cleaves the double bond to yield aldehydes. This step successfully produces **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**, the required intermediate.\n    4.  **Aldol Condensation:** `Ba(OH)₂` is a suitable base to catalyze the aldol reaction, which will dimerize the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde intermediate to form the target product.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is chemically sound and follows the correct synthetic logic.\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd; 3. ...**\n    *   The second step uses `H₂/Pd` without a poison. This catalyst causes **complete hydrogenation**, which would reduce the alkyne all the way to an unreactive alkane (`propylcyclohexane`). This pathway is a synthetic dead end.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH₂, methanol; 2. ...**\n    *   The first step is chemically flawed. The strong base `NaNH₂` would be neutralized by the acidic proton of `methanol` in a simple acid-base reaction. This would prevent the intended reaction with the alkyne.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ H₂O; 4. ...**\n    *   The third step, ozonolysis followed by a workup with `H₂O`, is an **oxidative workup**. This would convert the alkene fragments into carboxylic acids, not the aldehydes required for the final aldol reaction.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Incorrect.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nOnly the sequence of reagents presented in option A provides a chemically logical and valid pathway. It correctly synthesizes the necessary aldehyde intermediate through a specific sequence of alkylation, partial reduction, and reductive ozonolysis, and then employs a base catalyst to achieve the final carbon-carbon bond formation via an aldol reaction.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\n**1. Deconstruction and Strategic Analysis**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`). This is a terminal alkyne with 8 carbon atoms.\n*   **Target Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This name describes a structure that is the result of a **self-aldol addition** reaction between two molecules of an intermediate: **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`)**. The target is a C14 molecule, reinforcing the need for a dimerization (aldol) step from a C7 precursor.\n*   **Overall Synthetic Strategy:**\n    1.  **Stage I: Intermediate Synthesis.** The first priority is to convert the 8-carbon starting material (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`) into the 7-carbon intermediate (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`). This requires a C-C bond cleavage.\n    2.  **Stage II: Aldol Condensation.** The second part involves treating the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde intermediate with a base to catalyze the aldol reaction, forming the final C14 product.\n\n**2. Detailed Evaluation of the Proposed Reagent Sequences**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in evaluating the pathway to the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde intermediate. A standard and controlled method involves alkylating the alkyne, partially reducing it to an alkene, and then cleaving the alkene with reductive ozonolysis.\n\nLet's assess each option against this logical strategy:\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH₂, methanol...**\n    *   **Flaw:** This sequence is incorrect from the first step. Sodium amide (`NaNH₂`) is a very strong base that would be neutralized by the acidic proton of methanol (`CH₃OH`). This acid-base reaction would prevent the intended modification of the alkyne.\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. Ba(OH)₂**\n    *   **Step 1:** Correct. Deprotonation with `NaNH₂` and reaction with `CH₃Cl` performs an alkylation, yielding 1-cyclohexylpropyne. This strategically sets up the subsequent cleavage to avoid the formation of highly reactive formaldehyde.\n    *   **Step 2:** Correct. `H₂/Pd-CaCO₃` is Lindlar's catalyst, which performs a partial reduction of the alkyne to a *cis*-alkene.\n    *   **Step 3:** Correct. `O₃/(CH₃)₂S` is a **reductive ozonolysis**. This reaction correctly cleaves the alkene to yield the required aldehyde intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (along with acetaldehyde).\n    *   **Step 4:** Correct. `Ba(OH)₂` is a suitable base to catalyze the self-aldol condensation of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde to form the target product.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This entire sequence is chemically sound and follows the most logical synthetic plan.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd...**\n    *   **Flaw:** Step 2 uses `H₂/Pd` without a \"poisoning\" agent like CaCO₃. This catalyst would cause **complete hydrogenation** of the alkyne all the way to a saturated, unreactive alkane (propylcyclohexane), making further steps impossible.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride; ... 3. O₃/ H₂O;...**\n    *   **Flaw:** Step 3 is an ozonolysis followed by a workup with `H₂O`. This constitutes an **oxidative workup**, which would convert the alkene fragments into carboxylic acids, not the aldehydes required for the subsequent aldol reaction.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nOnly the sequence presented in option B provides a chemically correct and logical pathway. It systematically transforms the starting material into the required intermediate using a standard set of reactions (alkylation, partial reduction, reductive ozonolysis) and then employs a suitable catalyst for the final C-C bond-forming aldol reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\n### Analysis of the Synthesis Problem\n\n1.  **Analyze Starting Material and Target Product:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`). This is a C8 terminal alkyne.\n    *   **Target Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. This name describes an α-hydroxy aldehyde. This structure is the characteristic result of a **self-aldol addition** reaction between two molecules of a precursor aldehyde.\n    *   **The Key Intermediate:** To form the C14 target product, the C8 starting material must first be converted into the C7 intermediate, **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`).\n\n2.  **Outline the Synthetic Strategy:**\n    The overall process involves two main stages:\n    *   **Stage 1: Preparation of Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.** This involves transforming the `C≡CH` group into a `CHO` group, which requires a net loss of one carbon atom. A robust method is to first modify the alkyne and then cleave it with ozonolysis.\n    *   **Stage 2: Aldol Condensation.** The synthesized cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is then made to react with itself in a base-catalyzed aldol addition to form the final C14 product.\n\n### Evaluation of Each Reagent Sequence\n\nLet's examine each option to see if it correctly executes this two-stage strategy.\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. Ba(OH)₂**\n    1.  **Alkylation:** `NaNH₂` deprotonates the terminal alkyne, and the resulting acetylide anion attacks methyl chloride to form an internal alkyne, `1-cyclohexylpropyne`. This is a correct first step.\n    2.  **Partial Reduction:** `H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate` (Lindlar's catalyst) correctly reduces the internal alkyne to a *cis*-alkene.\n    3.  **Reductive Ozonolysis:** `O₃/(CH₃)₂S` cleaves the double bond, and the reductive workup correctly yields aldehydes: **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** (the key intermediate) and acetaldehyde.\n    4.  **Aldol Reaction:** `Ba(OH)₂` is a suitable base to catalyze the aldol addition of the intermediate to form the target product.\n    *   **Verdict:** This is a chemically sound and logical sequence.\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)₂; 4. H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**\n    *   The fatal flaw is in step 2. `H₂/Pd` is a catalyst for **complete hydrogenation**, which would reduce the alkyne all the way to an unreactive alkane. The synthesis cannot proceed.\n    *   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ H₂O; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   The fatal flaw is in step 3. The ozonolysis workup with `H₂O` is **oxidative**, which would produce carboxylic acids instead of the required aldehyde intermediate.\n    *   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH₂, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   The fatal flaw is in step 1. The strong base `NaNH₂` would be neutralized by the acidic solvent `methanol`, preventing the desired reaction from occurring.\n    *   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter analyzing all options, only the sequence presented in Option A is chemically correct for synthesizing the target molecule. It employs a logical progression of alkylation, partial hydrogenation, reductive ozonolysis to form the key aldehyde intermediate, and finally, a base-catalyzed aldol reaction to yield the final product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct sequence of reagents.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Starting Material and Target Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. The structure is a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne group (`-C≡CH`). We can denote the cyclohexyl group as 'Cy', making the structure `Cy-C≡CH`. It is an 8-carbon molecule.\n*   **Target Product:** `1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`. This name, while complex, describes a very specific structure.\n    *   The parent molecule is `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` (`Cy-CHO`).\n    *   The substituent `(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)`, which has the structure `-CH(OH)Cy`, is attached at position C1 of the parent cyclohexane ring. C1 is the same carbon to which the `-CHO` group is attached.\n    *   This structure, an α-hydroxy aldehyde, is the characteristic product of a **self-aldol addition** reaction between two molecules of `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`. In this reaction, a base creates an enolate from one aldehyde molecule, which then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule.\n    *   This means the overall synthesis requires a dimerization step, which is consistent with the starting material having one cyclohexyl ring and the product having two.\n\n### **2. Formulate the Overall Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe synthesis can be broken down into two major stages:\n1.  **Preparation of the Aldehyde Intermediate:** Convert ethynylcyclohexane (`Cy-C≡CH`, C8) into `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` (`Cy-CHO`, C7). This requires removing one carbon atom from the side chain.\n2.  **Aldol Reaction:** Use a base catalyst to promote the self-aldol reaction of `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` to form the final 14-carbon product.\n\n### **3. Devise a Path for the Intermediate (Stage 1) and Evaluate the Options**\n\nTo go from `Cy-C≡CH` to `Cy-CHO`, we need to cleave a carbon-carbon bond. Oxidative cleavage via ozonolysis of an alkene is the most direct method.\n\n*   A refined strategy would be:\n    1.  **Alkylate the alkyne:** Deprotonate with `NaNH2` and add `CH3Cl`. This yields `Cy-C≡C-CH3`. This avoids forming highly reactive formaldehyde as a byproduct later.\n    2.  **Partially reduce the alkyne:** Use a poisoned catalyst like Lindlar's (`H2/Pd-CaCO3`) to get the cis-alkene, `cis-Cy-CH=CH-CH3`.\n    3.  **Cleave the alkene:** Use `O3` followed by a **reductive workup** (like `(CH3)2S`) to get `Cy-CHO` and `CH3CHO`.\n\nNow, we evaluate the given choices against this sound chemical strategy.\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH2, methanol...**: This sequence is flawed from the beginning. `NaNH2` is a strong base that will be neutralized by the acidic methanol, preventing the desired reaction with the alkyne.\n*   **B) 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; ... 3. O3/ H2O...**: This sequence fails at step 3. The use of `H2O` as a workup for ozonolysis constitutes an **oxidative workup**, which would produce carboxylic acids (`Cy-COOH`) instead of the required aldehyde (`Cy-CHO`).\n*   **C) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2**: This sequence perfectly matches the ideal strategy.\n    *   **Step 1:** Correctly alkylates the alkyne.\n    *   **Step 2:** Correctly performs a partial reduction to the alkene using Lindlar's catalyst.\n    *   **Step 3:** Correctly performs a reductive ozonolysis to yield the required intermediate, `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`.\n    *   **Step 4:** Correctly uses a base (`Ba(OH)2`) to catalyze the final aldol addition reaction.\n*   **D) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd...**: This sequence fails at step 2. Using `H2/Pd` without a poison will cause **complete hydrogenation** of the alkyne to a saturated, unreactive alkane (`propylcyclohexane`), making the subsequent steps impossible.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOnly the sequence of reagents provided in option C represents a chemically correct and logical pathway to synthesize the target molecule from the starting material.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material and Target Product**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`). This is an 8-carbon molecule containing a cyclohexane ring and a terminal alkyne.\n    *   **Target Product:** `1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`. As noted by the reasoning in multiple candidate answers, this IUPAC name is slightly problematic, but the structure it implies is clear. It is the product of a **self-aldol condensation** of two molecules of `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`). This final product is a 14-carbon molecule containing two cyclohexane rings.\n    *   **Goal:** The overall transformation requires two main stages: first, synthesizing the `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` intermediate, and second, inducing the aldol condensation.\n\n2.  **Devise a Strategy for Synthesizing the Intermediate**\n    *   To get from ethynylcyclohexane (`C₆H₁₁-C≡CH`, C8) to cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`, C7), a carbon-carbon bond must be broken, effectively removing one carbon atom from the side chain.\n    *   The standard way to achieve this specific cleavage is through a sequence of reactions starting with alkylation, followed by reduction and then ozonolysis.\n        *   **Step 1: Alkylation.** To control the products of ozonolysis (avoiding highly reactive formaldehyde), the terminal alkyne is first converted to an internal alkyne. Deprotonation with a strong base (`NaNH₂`) followed by reaction with an alkyl halide (like `CH₃Cl`) accomplishes this.\n        *   **Step 2: Partial Reduction.** The internal alkyne must be reduced to an alkene. Full reduction to an alkane must be avoided. A \"poisoned\" catalyst like Lindlar's catalyst (`H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`) is perfect for this, producing a *cis*-alkene.\n        *   **Step 3: Reductive Ozonolysis.** The alkene is cleaved at the double bond with ozone (`O₃`). To obtain the desired aldehyde product, a **reductive workup** is essential, using a reagent like dimethyl sulfide (`(CH₃)₂S`). An oxidative workup would yield an unwanted carboxylic acid. This step produces `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` and `acetaldehyde`.\n\n3.  **Final Reaction Step**\n    *   **Step 4: Aldol Condensation.** The `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` intermediate is treated with a base (e.g., `Ba(OH)₂`) to catalyze the self-aldol reaction, forming the final C14 target molecule.\n\n**Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nNow we can apply this ideal pathway to evaluate the specific choices provided.\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. Ba(OH)₂**\n    *   This sequence perfectly matches the logical, multi-step synthesis derived above. Each step uses the correct reagents for the required transformation: alkylation, partial reduction, reductive ozonolysis, and finally, base-catalyzed aldol condensation. **This pathway is chemically sound.**\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)₂; 4. H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**\n    *   **Careful Point:** The critical flaw is in Step 2. `H₂/Pd` without a poison is a catalyst for complete hydrogenation. It would reduce the alkyne all the way to a saturated, unreactive alkane (`propylcyclohexane`), making the subsequent steps impossible. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH₂, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   **Careful Point:** The flaw is in Step 1. `NaNH₂` is a very strong base. `Methanol` is a protic solvent that would act as an acid and neutralize the `NaNH₂` in a simple acid-base reaction, preventing the desired alkylation from occurring. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ H₂O; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   **Careful Point:** The flaw is in Step 3. The ozonolysis is followed by a workup with `H₂O`. This constitutes an **oxidative workup**, which would convert the cleaved fragments into carboxylic acids, not the required aldehyde intermediate needed for the aldol reaction. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAfter a thorough analysis of the required chemical transformations and potential pitfalls, only the sequence of reagents presented in Option A constitutes a valid and logical synthetic route to the target molecule.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the chemical transformation, here is the reasoning to determine the correct sequence of reagents.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material and the Target Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane.

It is an 8-carbon molecule.\n*   **Target Product:** `1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`.\n    *   Let's deconstruct the IUPAC name. The parent molecule is `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`, which is a cyclohexane ring with a `-CHO` group.\n    *   The final product has a complex substituent, `(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)`, attached at position 1 of the ring—the same carbon atom that holds the `-CHO` group.\n    *   This final product contains **two** cyclohexane rings and has the characteristic α-hydroxy aldehyde structure of an **aldol addition product**.\n    *   This structure can only be formed by the self-condensation of two molecules of the intermediate, **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (`C₆H₁₁-CHO`)**.\n\n### **Step 2: Formulate the Overall Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe synthesis must be performed in two distinct stages:\n1.  **Stage I: Preparation of the Aldehyde Intermediate.** Convert the 8-carbon starting material, ethynylcyclohexane, into the 7-carbon intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

Analyze the Starting Material and the Target Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This molecule consists of a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne (`-C≡CH`). Let's denote the cyclohexyl group as 'Cy'. The structure is `Cy-C≡CH`. It is an 8-carbon molecule.\n*   **Target Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n    *   **Deconstruction of the Name:** The parent molecule is `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` (`Cy-CHO`), which is a 7-carbon molecule. The carbon of the cyclohexane ring to which the `-CHO` (carbaldehyde) group is attached is C1.\n    *   A substituent, `(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)`, is attached to this same C1 carbon. This substituent's structure is `-CH(OH)Cy`.\n    *   **Structure Confirmation:** The product contains two cyclohexyl rings and a total of 14 carbons. The structure, an α-hydroxy aldehyde, is characteristic of the product formed by a **self-aldol addition** of two molecules of the intermediate, **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**. In this reaction, a base creates an enolate at the α-carbon of one aldehyde molecule, which then attacks the carbonyl group of a second aldehyde molecule.\n\n### **2. Outline the Overall Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe synthesis must be performed in two distinct stages:\n*   **Stage 1: Synthesis of the Intermediate.** The 8-carbon starting material (`Cy-C≡CH`) must be converted into the 7-carbon intermediate (`Cy-CHO`). This requires a reaction that can cleave a specific carbon-carbon bond. Oxidative cleavage via ozonolysis is the standard method for this.\n*   **Stage 2: Dimerization.** The cyclohexanecarbaldehyde intermediate must undergo a base-catalyzed self-aldol reaction to form the final C14 product.\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Option Against the Strategy**\n\nLet's evaluate each sequence of reagents to see if it follows our established chemical strategy.\n\n*   **Option A) 1. NaNH₂, methanol...**\n    *   **Flaw:** The first step is chemically unsound for synthesis. Sodium amide (`NaNH₂`) is a very strong base and will be neutralized by the acidic proton of methanol (`CH₃OH`) in a simple acid-base reaction. It will not efficiently deprotonate the alkyne for the intended subsequent reaction.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. Ba(OH)₂**\n    *   **Step 1:** Correct. The strong base `NaNH₂` deprotonates the terminal alkyne, and the resulting acetylide anion reacts with `methyl chloride` to form an internal alkyne, `1-cyclohexylpropyne`. This strategically sets up the subsequent cleavage to avoid forming formaldehyde.\n    *   **Step 2:** Correct. `H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate` is Lindlar's catalyst, which performs a partial reduction (hydrogenation) of the alkyne to a *cis*-alkene.\n    *   **Step 3:** Correct. `O₃/(CH₃)₂S` is ozonolysis with a **reductive workup**. It correctly cleaves the alkene to yield the required intermediate, `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` (`Cy-CHO`), along with acetaldehyde.\n    *   **Step 4:** Correct. `Ba(OH)₂` is a suitable base to catalyze the self-aldol condensation of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde to form the target product.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a chemically logical and correct pathway.\n\n*   **Option C) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd...**\n    *   **Flaw:** Step 2 uses `H₂/Pd`, which is a catalyst for **complete hydrogenation**. It will reduce the alkyne all the way to an unreactive alkane (`propylcyclohexane`). The subsequent steps will not work on an alkane.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D) 1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ H₂O...**\n    *   **Flaw:** Step 3 is ozonolysis with a water (`H₂O`) workup. This constitutes an **oxidative workup**, which would convert the alkene fragments into carboxylic acids, not the aldehydes required for the final aldol reaction.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Incorrect.\n\nBased on the detailed chemical analysis, only the sequence in Option B correctly outlines the necessary transformations in a chemically sound manner.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct sequence of reagents.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Starting Material and Target Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This molecule consists of a cyclohexane ring bonded to a terminal alkyne (`-C≡CH`). It is an 8-carbon molecule.\n*   **Target Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n    *   **Deconstruction:** The parent molecule is `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` (a cyclohexane ring with a `-CHO` group). A complex substituent, `(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)`, which has the structure `-CH(OH)(C6H11)`, is attached to the same carbon as the `-CHO` group.\n    *   **Core Reaction:** This structure is the characteristic product of a **self-aldol addition** reaction between two molecules of `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`. In this reaction, a base creates an enolate from one aldehyde molecule, which then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule.\n\n### **2. Outline the Overall Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe synthesis must be performed in two distinct stages:\n1.  **Intermediate Synthesis:** Convert the 8-carbon starting material, ethynylcyclohexane, into the 7-carbon intermediate, `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`. This requires cleaving one carbon atom from the side chain and installing an aldehyde functional group. This is typically achieved via ozonolysis of an alkene.\n2.  **Final Condensation:** Use a base catalyst to induce the self-aldol condensation of the `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` intermediate to form the final C-C bond and the target molecule.\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Option Against the Strategy**\n\nLet's evaluate each proposed sequence step-by-step.\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH2, methanol...**\n    *   **Flaw:** The first step is chemically incorrect for the intended purpose. Sodium amide (`NaNH2`) is a very strong base that would react with the acidic proton of methanol (`CH3OH`) in a simple acid-base neutralization. It would not effectively deprotonate the alkyne to prepare it for further reaction.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd...**\n    *   **Flaw:** The second step uses `H2/Pd` without a \"poison\" like CaCO3. This catalyst performs **complete hydrogenation**, which would reduce the alkyne all the way to a saturated, unreactive alkane (propylcyclohexane). The necessary functional group for ozonolysis would be lost.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; ... 3. O3/ H2O...**\n    *   **Flaw:** The third step is ozonolysis (`O3`) followed by a workup with plain water (`H2O`). This constitutes an **oxidative workup**. The cleavage of the alkene would produce carboxylic acids, not the aldehyde intermediate required for the final aldol reaction.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2**\n    *   **Step 1:** Correct. `NaNH2` and `CH3Cl` perform an alkyne alkylation, converting the terminal alkyne into an internal one (`1-cyclohexylpropyne`).\n    *   **Step 2:** Correct. `H2/Pd-calcium carbonate` (Lindlar's catalyst) performs a partial hydrogenation, selectively reducing the alkyne to a *cis*-alkene.\n    *   **Step 3:** Correct. `O3/(CH3)2S` is an ozonolysis with a **reductive workup**. It cleaves the alkene to yield two aldehydes: `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` (the key intermediate) and `acetaldehyde`.\n    *   **Step 4:** Correct. `Ba(OH)2` is a suitable base to catalyze the aldol addition of `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` to form the final target molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence follows a chemically sound and logical pathway, successfully executing both stages of the required synthesis.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct sequence of reagents.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Starting Material and Target Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This molecule consists of a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne (`-C≡CH`). It is an 8-carbon molecule.\n*   **Target Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n    *   The parent molecule is `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`, which is a cyclohexane ring with a `-CHO` group. The carbon on the ring where the aldehyde group is attached is C1.\n    *   The substituent, `(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)`, has the structure `-CH(OH)C6H11`.\n    *   This substituent is located at the `1-` position, meaning it's attached to the same carbon (C1) as the `-CHO` group.\n    *   This structure, an α-hydroxy aldehyde, is the characteristic product of a **self-aldol addition** of two molecules of **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**. In this reaction, a base removes a proton from the α-carbon of one aldehyde molecule, which then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule.\n\n### **2. Outline the Overall Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe synthesis must be performed in two main stages:\n1.  **Preparation of the key intermediate:** Convert ethynylcyclohexane (`C6H11-C≡CH`) into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (`C6H11-CHO`). This transformation involves cleaving a carbon atom and introducing an aldehyde group.\n2.  **Dimerization:** Perform a base-catalyzed self-aldol reaction on the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde intermediate to form the final 14-carbon product.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Reagents for Each Step and Evaluate the Options**\n\nLet's evaluate each option to see if it follows this logical synthetic pathway.\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH**\n    *   **Step 1 is flawed.** Sodium amide (`NaNH2`) is a very strong base. Methanol is an acidic solvent in this context. They will react in an acid-base neutralization (`NaNH2 + CH3OH → NaOCH3 + NH3`), preventing the intended deprotonation of the alkyne. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ H2O; 4. NH4OH**\n    *   **Step 3 is flawed.** This is an ozonolysis reaction (`O3`) followed by a workup with water (`H2O`), which constitutes an **oxidative workup**. This process would oxidize the alkene fragments to carboxylic acids, not the aldehydes required for the subsequent aldol reaction. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; 4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O**\n    *   **Step 2 is flawed.** The catalyst `H2/Pd` causes **complete hydrogenation**, reducing the alkyne all the way to a saturated alkane (propylcyclohexane). An alkane is unreactive and cannot be used to form the aldehyde intermediate. The order of reagents is also nonsensical. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2**\n    *   **Step 1:** `NaNH2` (a strong base) correctly deprotonates the terminal alkyne, and the resulting acetylide anion attacks methyl chloride to form an internal alkyne, `1-cyclohexylpropyne`. This is a standard and correct alkylation.\n    *   **Step 2:** `H2/Pd-calcium carbonate` (Lindlar's catalyst) correctly performs a partial reduction, converting the alkyne into a *cis*-alkene.\n    *   **Step 3:** Ozonolysis (`O3`) followed by a **reductive workup** with dimethyl sulfide (`(CH3)2S`) correctly cleaves the alkene to yield two aldehydes: **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** (the required intermediate) and acetaldehyde.\n    *   **Step 4:** `Ba(OH)2` is a base that will correctly catalyze the self-aldol reaction of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde to form the final target product.\n    *   **This sequence is the only chemically sound and logical pathway.**\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct sequence of reagents.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Starting Material and Target Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. The structure is a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne (`-C≡CH`). Let's abbreviate the cyclohexyl group as 'Cy', so the structure is `Cy-C≡CH`. It is an 8-carbon molecule.\n*   **Target Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let's deconstruct this name:\n    *   The parent molecule is `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` (`Cy-CHO`).\n    *   A substituent, `(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)` which has the structure `-CH(OH)Cy`, is attached to position `1-` of the parent ring. By definition, C1 is the carbon atom of the ring that bears the main functional group (`-CHO`).\n    *   This structure describes an **α-hydroxy aldehyde**. It is the product of a **self-aldol condensation** of two molecules of `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`. One molecule forms an enolate at the α-carbon (C1 of the ring), which then attacks the carbonyl carbon of the second molecule.\n    *   The target is a 14-carbon molecule, confirming that a dimerization of a C7 intermediate is required.\n\n### **2. Outline the Overall Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe synthesis logically proceeds in two main stages:\n*   **Stage I:** Prepare the key intermediate, `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`, from the starting material, `ethynylcyclohexane`. This requires cleaving one carbon from the side chain and adding an oxygen.\n*   **Stage II:** Induce the self-aldol condensation of the intermediate using a base to form the final C-C bond and the target product.\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Proposed Sequence**\n\nWe must find the sequence of reagents that correctly carries out both stages of the synthesis.\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. Ba(OH)₂**\n    *   **Step 1 (Alkylation):** `NaNH₂` is a strong base that deprotonates the terminal alkyne. The resulting acetylide anion reacts with `CH₃Cl` to form an internal alkyne, `1-cyclohexylpropyne`. This is a standard and correct first step.\n    *   **Step 2 (Partial Reduction):** `H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate` is Lindlar's catalyst. It correctly reduces the internal alkyne to a *cis*-alkene, stopping the reaction before complete saturation.\n    *   **Step 3 (Reductive Ozonolysis):** Ozonolysis (`O₃`) followed by a reductive workup with dimethyl sulfide (`(CH₃)₂S`) cleaves the double bond and yields aldehydes. This step correctly produces `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` (the required intermediate) and acetaldehyde.\n    *   **Step 4 (Aldol Reaction):** `Ba(OH)₂` is a suitable base to catalyze the self-aldol condensation of `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is chemically logical and provides a complete, correct pathway to the target product.\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ H₂O; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   **Critical Flaw:** The ozonolysis workup with water (`H₂O`) in step 3 is **oxidative**. It would convert the cleaved fragments into carboxylic acids, not the aldehydes required for the aldol reaction.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH₂, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   **Critical Flaw:** The first step is flawed. `NaNH₂` is a very strong base and would be neutralized by the acidic proton of `methanol` in a simple acid-base reaction. It would not effectively deprotonate the alkyne for subsequent alkylation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)₂; 4. ...**\n    *   **Critical Flaw:** Step 2 uses `H₂/Pd` without a poison. This catalyst performs **complete hydrogenation**, which would reduce the alkyne all the way to a saturated, unreactive alkane (propylcyclohexane), making subsequent steps impossible.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Incorrect.\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, sequence A is the only one that describes a chemically correct route to the target molecule.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct sequence of reagents.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material and the Target Product\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. The structure is a cyclohexane ring attached to a terminal alkyne group (`-C≡CH`). Let's denote the cyclohexyl group as 'Cy'. The structure is `Cy-C≡CH`.\n*   **Target Product:** `1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`.\n    *   The parent molecule is `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` (`Cy-CHO`).\n    *   The substituent is a `(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)` group (`-CH(OH)Cy`).\n    *   The position is at C1 of the parent cyclohexane ring, the same carbon that bears the `-CHO` group.\n    *   This structure, an α-hydroxy aldehyde, is the product of a **self-aldol condensation** of two molecules of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The α-hydrogen on C1 of one molecule is removed to form a nucleophilic enolate, which then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Overall Synthetic Strategy\nThe synthesis requires two major stages:\n1.  **Preparation of the Key Intermediate:** Convert ethynylcyclohexane (a C8 molecule) into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (a C7 molecule). This involves modifying and then cleaving the two-carbon side chain to a one-carbon aldehyde group.\n2.  **The Aldol Condensation:** Use a base catalyst to cause the self-condensation of two molecules of the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde intermediate to form the C14 target product.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Each Reaction Sequence\nLet's analyze each option based on this two-stage strategy.\n\n**A) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. Ba(OH)₂**\n1.  **Alkylation:** `NaNH₂` is a strong base that deprotonates the terminal alkyne. The resulting acetylide ion reacts with `methyl chloride` to form an internal alkyne, `1-cyclohexylpropyne` (`Cy-C≡C-CH₃`). This is a correct first step that sets up a controlled cleavage.\n2.  **Partial Hydrogenation:** `H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate` is Lindlar's catalyst. It correctly reduces the alkyne to a *cis*-alkene, preparing it for ozonolysis.\n3.  **Reductive Ozonolysis:** `O₃` followed by a reductive workup with dimethyl sulfide (`(CH₃)₂S`) correctly cleaves the double bond to form two aldehydes: `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` (the desired intermediate) and `acetaldehyde`.\n4.  **Aldol Condensation:** `Ba(OH)₂` is a suitable base to catalyze the aldol reaction. The self-condensation of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde will occur, forming the final target molecule.\n*   **Verdict:** This is a completely correct and chemically sound synthetic pathway.\n\n**B) 1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ H₂O; 4. NH₄OH**\n*   **Fatal Flaw:** Step 3 uses ozonolysis with a water (`H₂O`) workup. This constitutes an **oxidative workup**, which produces carboxylic acids, not the required aldehyde intermediate.\n*   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C) 1. NaNH₂, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. NH₄OH**\n*   **Fatal Flaw:** Step 1 is chemically invalid for the intended purpose. The strong base `NaNH₂` would be neutralized by the acidic proton of methanol in an acid-base reaction, rather than deprotonating the alkyne for alkylation.\n*   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)₂; 3. H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**\n*   **Fatal Flaw:** Step 2 uses `H₂/Pd` without a poison. This catalyst promotes **complete hydrogenation**, reducing the alkyne all the way to an unreactive alkane (propylcyclohexane), which is a synthetic dead end.\n*   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe only sequence that represents a valid chemical transformation is A. It correctly executes a four-step synthesis involving alkylation, partial hydrogenation, reductive ozonolysis, and a final base-catalyzed aldol condensation.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided answers and a first-principles review of the chemical transformations, here is a consolidated, step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the Synthetic Goal**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. This molecule consists of a cyclohexane ring bonded to a terminal alkyne group (`-C≡CH`). Its structure is `C6H11-C≡CH`, and it contains 8 carbon atoms.\n*   **Target Product:** `1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`.\n    *   **Structure Interpretation:** This name describes a complex structure that is the result of a dimerization reaction. The parent molecule is `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` (`C6H11-CHO`). The substituent, `(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)`, has the structure `-CH(OH)C6H11`. This substituent is attached to the same carbon atom of the parent ring as the aldehyde group (`-CHO`).\n    *   **Key Reaction Type:** This final structure is the characteristic product of a **self-aldol addition** reaction between two molecules of `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`.\n\n### **2. Formulation of the Overall Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe synthesis must be broken down into two major parts, a strategy identified by all correct analyses:\n1.  **Synthesis of the Intermediate:** Convert the C8 starting material, ethynylcyclohexane, into the C7 key intermediate, `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`. This requires a reaction sequence that effectively cleaves one carbon from the side chain while installing an aldehyde functional group.\n2.  **Dimerization:** Use a base catalyst to promote the self-aldol addition of two `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` molecules to form the C14 target product.\n\n### **3. Step-by-Step Evaluation of Each Option**\n\nWe will now systematically evaluate each provided option against the established chemical strategy, identifying the key correct or flawed step in each sequence.\n\n**A) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2**\n*   **Step 1: Alkylation.** The strong base `NaNH2` deprotonates the terminal alkyne. The resulting acetylide anion attacks methyl chloride to form an internal alkyne, `1-cyclohexylpropyne`. This is a correct and well-designed first step. It strategically modifies the alkyne to prevent the formation of highly reactive formaldehyde in the cleavage step.\n*   **Step 2: Partial Reduction.** `H2/Pd-calcium carbonate` is Lindlar's catalyst, which correctly reduces the internal alkyne to a *cis*-alkene. This prepares the molecule for ozonolysis.\n*   **Step 3: Reductive Ozonolysis.** Ozonolysis (`O3`) followed by a reductive workup with dimethyl sulfide (`(CH3)2S`) correctly cleaves the double bond to produce aldehydes. The products are `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` (the required intermediate) and `acetaldehyde`.\n*   **Step 4: Aldol Reaction.** `Ba(OH)2` is a suitable base to catalyze the self-aldol reaction of `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`, forming the desired final product.\n*   **Conclusion:** This sequence is a chemically sound, logical, and complete pathway to the target molecule.\n\n**B) 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ H2O; 4. NH4OH**\n*   **Flaw:** The key flaw is in Step 3. The ozonolysis workup with `H2O` is an **oxidative workup**. This process would oxidize the cleavage fragments to carboxylic acids (`cyclohexanecarboxylic acid` and `propanoic acid`), not the required aldehyde intermediate needed for the final aldol reaction.\n*   **Conclusion:** This option is incorrect.\n\n**C) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; ...**\n*   **Flaw:** The fatal flaw is in Step 2. The catalyst `H2/Pd`, without a poisoning agent, performs **complete hydrogenation**. It would reduce the alkyne all the way to a saturated alkane (`propylcyclohexane`). This alkane is unreactive and cannot be converted to the target product.\n*   **Conclusion:** This option is incorrect.\n\n**D) 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH**\n*   **Flaw:** This sequence is flawed from Step 1. `NaNH2` is a very strong base, while `methanol` is an acid (a proton donor). They would simply react with each other in an acid-base neutralization, preventing the intended deprotonation of the alkyne.\n*   **Conclusion:** This option is incorrect.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe only reaction sequence that provides a valid chemical pathway from the starting material to the target product is **Option A**. It correctly prepares the aldehyde intermediate through a specific sequence of alkylation, partial hydrogenation, and reductive ozonolysis, and then correctly employs a base to induce the final aldol condensation.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
