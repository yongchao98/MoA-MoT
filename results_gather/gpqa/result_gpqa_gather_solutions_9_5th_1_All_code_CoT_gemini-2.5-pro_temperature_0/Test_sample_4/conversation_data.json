It can be parameterized by the angle $\\theta$ it makes with the positive z-axis:\n    *   $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$\n\n2.  **Construct the Operator $P_n$**: The operator for the spin component along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n    *   $P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n    *   Since the y-component of $\\vec{n}$ is zero ($n_y = 0$), the expression simplifies to:\n        $P_n = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_z \\cos\\theta$\n    *   Substituting the matrix forms of $P_x$ and $P_z$:\n        $P_n = \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\sin\\theta + \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\cos\\theta$\n    *   Combining the matrices gives the final operator:\n        $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n3.  **Set Up and Solve the Eigenvalue Equation**: We need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ that corresponds to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$. The eigenvalue equation is $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$.\n    *   $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   The constant factor $\\hbar/2$ cancels from both sides. The first row of the matrix equation gives the linear equation:\n        $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n    *   Solving for the ratio of the components $b/a$:\n        $b \\sin\\theta = a - a \\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n        $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\n4.  **Simplify and Normalize the Eigenvector**: The ratio is simplified using trigonometric half-angle identities: $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin\\theta = 2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)$.\n    *   $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n    *   This relationship implies the eigenvector is proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   To normalize the eigenvector, we must ensure its norm (length) is 1. The squared norm is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of its components:\n        Norm$^2 = (\\cos(\\theta/2))^2 + (\\sin(\\theta/2))^2 = \\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$.\n    *   Since the norm is already 1, the vector is normalized. The elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Unanimous Mathematical Result**: All 15 candidate answers correctly perform the mathematical derivation and arrive at the same result: the elements of the eigenvector are **$(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$**. This shows a strong consensus on the physics and math.\n2.  **Source of Confusion**: The discrepancies in the final letter choices (A, B, C, D) among the candidate answers are due to the agents working with different or scrambled lists of the multiple-choice options. The only valid procedure is to match the derived result to the specific list of options provided in the original question.\n3.  **Dimensionality of State Vectors**: A normalized state vector (eigenvector) in quantum mechanics is a dimensionless quantity. It represents a direction in an abstract Hilbert space. The physical units are carried by the eigenvalues (like energy or momentum). Any option containing Planck's constant, $\\hbar$, is dimensionally incorrect. This immediately eliminates options C and D.\n4.  **Correct Angular Dependence**: The calculation clearly shows the dependence is on the half-angle, $\\theta/2$, not the full angle $\\theta$. This is a characteristic feature of spin-1/2 systems. This eliminates option B.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe derived elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. We must compare this result to the specific options provided in the question:\n\n*   **A) (\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))** - **Correct.** This exactly matches the derived result.

This high level of consensus confirms the correctness of the physical and mathematical steps.\n2.  **Source of Discrepancy**: The wide variation in the final letter choice (A, B, C, D) among the candidate answers is unequivocally due to them being presented with scrambled or differently ordered lists of the multiple-choice options. The only valid procedure is to ignore their final letter choices and instead match the correct, unanimously derived mathematical result to the specific list of options provided in the question.\n3.  **Dimensionality of State Vectors**: A fundamental principle in quantum mechanics is that state vectors (eigenvectors) are dimensionless quantities representing a direction in Hilbert space. The physical units are carried by the operators and their eigenvalues. Options A and D include Planck's constant, $\\hbar$, which has units of action. Therefore, they are dimensionally incorrect and can be eliminated on first principles.\n4.  **Correct Angular Dependence**: The derivation clearly shows that the components of the eigenvector depend on the half-angle, $\\theta/2$. This is a characteristic feature of spin-1/2 systems (spinors). Option C depends on the full angle $\\theta$ and is therefore incorrect.\n5.  **Normalization**: The final vector must be normalized, meaning the sum of the squares of the absolute values of its components must equal 1. The derived result $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$ satisfies this condition, as $\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$. The factors in option A are also incorrect for normalization.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe derived elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.

The angular dependence is on $\\theta$, not the derived $\\theta/2$.\n*   D) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)$ - Incorrect.
