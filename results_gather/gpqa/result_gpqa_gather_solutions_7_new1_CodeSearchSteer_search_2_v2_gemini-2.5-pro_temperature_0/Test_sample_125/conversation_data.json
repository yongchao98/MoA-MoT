This is a chiral molecule with a single stereocenter at carbon C5, which has the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol using LAH. This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** Since the original molecule is chiral, the reduction creates two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have the same configuration at one stereocenter (C5) and a different configuration at the other (C3). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetric, achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols using excess NaBH₄. The product is pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** Because the starting material is achiral and the molecule is symmetric, three stereoisomers are formed:\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These are a pair of **enantiomers**, formed as a racemic mixture.\n    2.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This is a **meso compound** because it has an internal plane of symmetry and is achiral.\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in physical properties (like polarity). It can separate diastereomers but **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair will elute together as one peak, while the meso compound (which is a diastereomer of the pair) will elute separately. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different (constitutional isomers) and will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can separate all non-identical stereoisomers, including both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis:** The total mixture contains 5 unique stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Total Peaks:** Since a chiral column can resolve all five of these distinct stereoisomers, it will show **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows there will be **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC** and **5 peaks in chiral HPLC**. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule with a single stereocenter at carbon C5, which has the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol by LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride). This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected. The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S) because the hydride attack can occur from either face of the planar carbonyl group. This results in two products:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are **diastereomers** because they have two stereocenters, with one being identical (5S) and the other being different (3R vs. 3S).\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral due to a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols by excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride), forming pentane-2,4-diol. This creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material is achiral and symmetric, we must consider all possible stereoisomers:\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These are non-superimposable mirror images, forming a pair of **enantiomers**. They are produced in a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    2.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration is the same molecule.\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the enantiomeric pair. In total, Reaction II produces three distinct stereoisomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Count the Total Number of Unique Products**\n\nThe combined mixture from both reactions contains a total of 2 + 3 = **5 unique stereoisomers**.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the Number of Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase (achiral) HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   **From Reaction I:** The two products are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** The products are a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound. The enantiomers will co-elute as a single peak. The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the enantiomers, will be separated from them. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different (constitutional isomers) and will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 5: Predict the Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with all stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Analysis:** The mixture contains 5 unique stereoisomers. A chiral column is designed to resolve all of them.\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 1)\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 2)\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 3)\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 4)\n    *   meso-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 5)\n*   **Total Peaks:** **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis consistently shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to logically deduce the answer by breaking down the problem into its core components. I will analyze each reaction separately to determine the number and type of stereoisomers produced. Then, I will combine the products and predict how they will behave in two different types of HPLC, based on the fundamental principles of chromatographic separation for stereoisomers.\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction I:** Determine the products of the reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This involves identifying the new chiral center and the relationship between the resulting products (e.g., diastereomers).\n2.  **Analyze Reaction II:** Determine the products of the reduction of pentane-2,4-dione. This involves identifying the two new chiral centers and the resulting stereoisomers (e.g., enantiomers, meso compounds).\n3.  **Predict Normal-Phase HPLC Results:** Based on the combined product mixture, I will count the number of expected peaks on an achiral column, where diastereomers separate but enantiomers do not.\n4.  **Predict Chiral HPLC Results:** I will then count the number of expected peaks on a chiral column, which can separate all unique stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n5.  **Final Conclusion:** I will match the predicted peak counts to the given multiple-choice options to find the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_hplc_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function systematically analyzes a two-part chemistry problem to determine\n    the number of peaks in normal-phase and chiral HPLC chromatograms.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis of the problem:\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------------------\")\n\n    # --- Step 1: Analyze Reaction I ---\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I.\")\n    print(\"Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is reduced with LAH.\")\n    print(\"- The starting material has one chiral center at C5 with (S) configuration.\")\n    print(\"- The reduction of the ketone at C3 creates a new chiral center.\")\n    print(\"- The products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\")\n    print(\"- Since one center is the same and the other is different, these two products are diastereomers.\")\n    print(\"Result of Reaction I: 2 products (a pair of diastereomers).\")\n    products_rxn1 = 2\n    diastereomers_rxn1 = 1 # One pair\n\n    # --- Step 2: Analyze Reaction II ---\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II.\")\n    print(\"Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione is reduced with excess NaBH4.\")\n    print(\"- The starting material is achiral.\")\n    print(\"- The reduction of both ketones creates two new chiral centers (C2 and C4) in pentane-2,4-diol.\")\n    print(\"- Due to the molecule's symmetry, three unique stereoisomers are formed:\")\n    print(\"  1.

This is a chiral molecule with a single, defined stereocenter at carbon C5.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at C3 is reduced by LAH to a secondary alcohol. This reaction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material is already chiral, the reduction creates two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have two stereocenters.

This is a symmetric, achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced by excess NaBH₄ to form pentane-2,4-diol. This creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** Because the starting material is achiral and symmetric, three stereoisomers are formed:\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This is a pair of **enantiomers**, formed as a racemic (1:1) mixture.\n    2.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This is a **meso compound** because it has an internal plane of symmetry and is achiral.

This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected. The attack of the hydride ion on the planar carbonyl group at C3 can occur from two different faces, leading to the formation of two possible configurations at the new stereocenter: (R) and (S).\n*   **Products:** The reaction yields two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have one stereocenter in common (5S) and one that is different (3R vs. 3S).

This creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** Due to the symmetry of the molecule, three distinct stereoisomers are formed:\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n    2.  **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n    3.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso compound)**\n*   **Relationship:** The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images, making them a pair of **enantiomers**. The (2R, 4S) isomer is a **meso compound** because it is achiral despite having stereocenters. The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the enantiomeric pair. Reaction II produces **three** distinct compounds.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers, so they have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, has different physical properties, and will be separated from them. This gives **2 peaks** from the products of Reaction II.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇ ether-alcohols) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C₅ diols) and will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with all stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Analysis:** The combined mixture contains a total of five unique stereoisomers (two from Reaction I and three from Reaction II). A chiral column is designed to resolve all of them.\n    *   Peak 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Peak 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Peak 3: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Peak 4: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Peak 5: meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Total Peaks:** Each of the 5 unique stereoisomers will produce a separate peak. Therefore, there will be **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows there will be **5 peaks in chiral HPLC** and **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**.

This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule with a single stereocenter at carbon C5 in the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol by LAH. This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected. The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S). This results in two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are **diastereomers** because they have two stereocenters, with one being identical (5S) and the other being different (3R vs. 3S).\n*   **Conclusion:** Reaction I produces **two** distinct stereoisomeric products.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral due to a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups at C2 and C4 are reduced to secondary alcohols by excess NaBH₄. This creates two new stereocenters.\n*   **Products:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol. We must consider the stereoisomers:\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These are non-superimposable mirror images, forming a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the starting material is achiral, they are produced in a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    2.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image ((2S, 4R)). It is therefore an achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion:** Reaction II produces **three** distinct stereoisomeric products.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase (achiral) HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will be separated, yielding **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as **1 peak**.\n    *   The meso compound from Reaction II is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, has different physical properties, and will be separated, yielding a **second peak** for this reaction's products.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C7 ether-alcohols) and Reaction II (C5 diols) are structurally different and will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with all non-identical stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Analysis:** The total mixture contains five unique stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Total Peaks:** Since a chiral column can resolve all five of these distinct stereoisomers, it will produce **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis consistently shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule with a single stereocenter at the C5 position, which has the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol by LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride). This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material is already chiral, the formation of a new stereocenter results in two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have the same configuration at one stereocenter (C5) but differ at the other (C3). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Reaction I produces **two** distinct products.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral as it possesses a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols by excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride), forming pentane-2,4-diol. This creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** Due to the symmetry of the molecule, three stereoisomers are formed:\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These are non-superimposable mirror images, forming a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts with achiral materials, they are produced in a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    2.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry and is an achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Reaction II produces **three** distinct stereoisomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe total product mixture contains five unique stereoisomers: two from Reaction I and three from Reaction II.\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle:** An achiral column separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity. It can separate diastereomers but **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Count:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will be separated, yielding **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as **1 peak**.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, has different physical properties, and will elute separately, yielding **1 peak**.\n    *   Total peaks from Reaction II's products = 1 + 1 = **2 peaks**.\n*   **Total Normal-Phase Peaks:** The products from Reaction I are structurally different from those of Reaction II, so their peaks will not overlap. The total number of peaks is 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase)**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with all stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of **both diastereomers and enantiomers**.\n*   **Peak Count:**\n    *   The column will separate every unique stereoisomer in the mixture.\n    *   Since there are a total of **5** unique stereoisomers (two from Reaction I and three from Reaction II), the chiral HPLC will resolve all of them.\n*   **Total Chiral Peaks:** **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram.

This is a symmetric, achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced by excess NaBH₄ to form pentane-2,4-diol. This creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** Because the starting material is achiral and symmetric, three stereoisomers are formed:\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This is a pair of **enantiomers**, formed as a racemic (1:1) mixture.\n    2.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This is a **meso compound** because it has an internal plane of symmetry and is achiral.

It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers, so they have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The enantiomeric pair will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the pair, will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different (different molecular formulas and functional groups) and will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 5: Predict the number of peaks in Chiral HPLC**\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with all non-identical stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:**\n    *   The mixture contains 5 unique stereoisomers.\n    *   A chiral column is designed to resolve all of them.\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated -> **2 peaks**.\n    *   The three stereoisomers from Reaction II (the two enantiomers and the meso compound) will all be separated -> **3 peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe final analysis shows there will be **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC**.

Therefore, there will be **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows there will be **5 peaks in chiral HPLC** and **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule with a single stereocenter at carbon C5, which has the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol using LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride). This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material is already chiral, the formation of a new stereocenter results in two products. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected.\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are **diastereomers** because they have two stereocenters, with one being the same (5S) and the other being different (3R vs. 3S).\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetric, achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols using excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride). The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Products:** The reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. Due to the symmetry of the molecule, three distinct stereoisomers are formed:\n    1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    3.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (This is a **meso compound** as it has an internal plane of symmetry. The (2S, 4R) configuration is the same molecule).\n*   **Relationship:** The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are a pair of **enantiomers**. The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomeric products are formed (one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in physical properties (e.g., polarity). It can separate diastereomers but **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. This gives **1 peak**.\n    *   The meso compound from Reaction II is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, has different physical properties, and will be separated from them. This gives another **1 peak**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different (constitutional isomers) and will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 1 (from Reaction II enantiomers) + 1 (from Reaction II meso) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with all stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis:** The combined mixture contains a total of 5 unique stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   A chiral column is designed to resolve all of these distinct molecules.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Each of the 5 unique stereoisomers will produce its own peak. Therefore, there will be **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows there will be **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule with a single stereocenter at carbon C5, which has the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol using LAH (a strong reducing agent). This reaction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material is already chiral, the reduction of the ketone creates a new stereocenter, resulting in a pair of diastereomers. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected.\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetric, achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols using excess NaBH₄. The product is pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** Due to the symmetry of the molecule, three unique stereoisomers are formed:\n    *   A pair of enantiomers: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. Since the starting material is achiral, these are formed as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   A meso compound: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. This molecule is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase. It separates compounds based on differences in physical properties (like polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair will co-elute as a single peak, while the meso compound (which is a diastereomer of the pair) will elute separately. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C7 ether-alcohols) are structurally distinct from the products of Reaction II (C5 diols) and will have different retention times.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase that can differentiate between all non-identical stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis:** The total mixture contains 5 unique stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   A chiral column will resolve all five of these distinct compounds.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows there will be **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule with a single, defined stereocenter at the C5 position.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol by LAH. This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since the starting material is already chiral, the attack of the hydride on the planar carbonyl group results in the formation of two products. The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected. The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n*   **Products:** The two products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** These two molecules are **diastereomers** because they differ in configuration at one stereocenter (C3) but are the same at another (C5).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols by excess NaBH₄, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Because the starting material is achiral and symmetric, we must consider all possible stereoisomers of the product.\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are non-superimposable mirror images, forming a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts from an achiral precursor, they are formed in a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration describes the same meso compound.\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: a pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe total product mixture contains five unique stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle:** An achiral column separates compounds based on differences in physical properties (e.g., polarity). It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Analysis:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers and have different physical properties. They will be separated into **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as **1 peak**.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, has different physical properties, and will elute as a separate, **second peak**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I and Reaction II are structurally different and will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks (Normal-Phase):** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase)**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral column can differentiate between all non-identical stereoisomers, including both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Analysis:**\n    *   The mixture contains five unique stereoisomers.\n    *   A chiral column is designed to resolve all of them. Each of the five compounds will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n*   **Total Peaks (Chiral):** Each of the 5 stereoisomers will produce a distinct peak. Therefore, there will be **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram.

This is a chiral molecule with a single stereocenter at carbon C5 in the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol by LAH. This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected. The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S). This results in two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** These two products are **diastereomers** because they have two stereocenters, with one being identical (5S) and the other being different (3R vs. 3S).\n*   **Conclusion:** Reaction I produces **two** distinct stereoisomeric products.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral due to a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups at C2 and C4 are reduced to secondary alcohols by excess NaBH₄. This creates two new stereocenters.\n*   **Products:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol. We must consider the stereoisomers:\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These are non-superimposable mirror images, forming a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the starting material is achiral, they are produced in a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n    2.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry and is superimposable on its mirror image ((2S, 4R)). It is therefore an achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Conclusion:** Reaction II produces **three** distinct stereoisomeric products.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A normal-phase (achiral) HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will be separated, yielding **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as **1 peak**.\n    *   The meso compound from Reaction II is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, has different physical properties, and will be separated, yielding a **second peak** for this reaction's products.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C7 ether-alcohols) and Reaction II (C5 diols) are structurally different and will not co-elute.\n*   **Total Peaks:** 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with all non-identical stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Analysis:** The total mixture contains five unique stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Total Peaks:** Since a chiral column can resolve all five of these distinct stereoisomers, it will produce **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis consistently shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule with a single stereocenter at the C5 position, which has the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol by LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride). This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** Since the starting material is already chiral, the formation of a new stereocenter results in two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship:** These two products have the same configuration at one stereocenter (C5) but differ at the other (C3). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**. Reaction I produces **two** distinct products.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This molecule is achiral as it possesses a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols by excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride), forming pentane-2,4-diol. This creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products:** Due to the symmetry of the molecule, three stereoisomers are formed:\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These are non-superimposable mirror images, forming a pair of **enantiomers**.

Reaction II produces **three** distinct stereoisomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe total product mixture contains five unique stereoisomers: two from Reaction I and three from Reaction II.\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   **Principle:** An achiral column separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity. It can separate diastereomers but **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   **Peak Count:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I have different physical properties and will be separated, yielding **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as **1 peak**.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, has different physical properties, and will elute separately, yielding **1 peak**.\n    *   Total peaks from Reaction II's products = 1 + 1 = **2 peaks**.\n*   **Total Normal-Phase Peaks:** The products from Reaction I are structurally different from those of Reaction II, so their peaks will not overlap. The total number of peaks is 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase)**\n\n*   **Principle:** A chiral column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with all stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of **both diastereomers and enantiomers**.\n*   **Peak Count:**\n    *   The column will separate every unique stereoisomer in the mixture.\n    *   Since there are a total of **5** unique stereoisomers (two from Reaction I and three from Reaction II), the chiral HPLC will resolve all of them.\n*   **Total Chiral Peaks:** **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** chromatogram and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC** chromatogram.
