We can write the equation for each star:\n    *   For star_1 (temperature T_1): R_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n    *   For star_2 (temperature T_2): R_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n4.  **Incorporate the Problem's Condition:** The problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2.\" This translates to the mathematical relationship:\n    R_1 = 2 * R_2\n\n5.  **Combine and Simplify:** Substitute the Boltzmann expressions into the condition from Step 4:\n    (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * [ (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] ]\n\n    The term for the statistical weights, `(g_j / g_i)`, is an intrinsic property of the iron atom's energy levels and is the same for both stars. Therefore, it cancels from both sides of the equation:\n    exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n6.  **Solve for the Temperature Relationship:** To solve this exponential equation, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n\n    Using the logarithm properties `ln(e^x) = x` and `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`, the equation becomes:\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\n7.  **Isolate ln(2):** Rearrange the terms to solve for `ln(2)`:\n    ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)\n\n8.  **Factor and Find a Common Denominator:** Factor out the common term `(ΔE / k)` and combine the fractions:\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n9.  **Substitute the Given Numerical Values:** The problem provides the energy difference `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J`. The Boltzmann constant `k` is also approximately `1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K`. The problem is designed so that the ratio `ΔE / k` simplifies:\n    ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 1 K\n\n10. **Final Equation:** Substituting this value back into the derived expression gives the final relationship:\n    ln(2) = 1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n    ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n11. **Compare with Options:** This final equation matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Identify the Governing Physical Principle**\nThe problem describes the population of atomic energy levels in stellar photospheres, assuming they are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The correct physical law to apply is the Boltzmann equation.\n\n**2. The Boltzmann Equation**\nThe Boltzmann equation relates the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy states (`j` for the higher energy state and `i` for the lower) to the temperature `T`:\nN_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T)]\nWhere:\n*   `N_j / N_i` is the ratio of the populations of the two states, which represents the \"excitation\".\n*   `g_j / g_i` is the ratio of the statistical weights of the states, a constant for a given atomic transition.\n*   `ΔE = E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the states.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n**3. Apply the Equation to Both Stars**\nWe can write the equation for each star, using `R` to denote the excitation ratio `N_j / N_i`:\n*   For star 1 (temperature T_1): `R_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]`\n*   For star 2 (temperature T_2): `R_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]`\n\n**4. Use the Condition from the Problem**\nThe problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\". This translates to:\n`R_1 = 2 * R_2`\n\n**5. Combine and Simplify the Equations**\nSubstitute the Boltzmann expressions into the condition:\n`(g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * [ (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] ]`\n\nThe statistical weight ratio `(g_j / g_i)` is the same for both stars and cancels out:\n`exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]`\n\n**6. Solve for the Relationship Between Temperatures**\nTo handle the exponentials, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n`ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])`\n\nUsing the logarithm properties `ln(e^x) = x` and `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`:\n`-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])`\n`-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)`\n\nNow, rearrange the equation to isolate `ln(2)`:\n`ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)`\n\n**7. Factor and Combine Terms**\nFactor out the common term `ΔE / k` and find a common denominator for the temperature terms:\n`ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)`\n`ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n**8.

The problem provides:\n*   `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J`\n*   The Boltzmann constant `k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K`\n\nThe ratio is therefore:\n`ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K`\n\nThe problem is intentionally designed for this factor to simplify to 1.\n\n**9. Final Equation and Comparison**\nSubstituting this value back into the equation from step 7:\n`ln(2) = 1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n`ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\nThis derived equation must be compared to the given options:\nA) `ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]`\nB) `ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]`\nC) `ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]`\nD) `ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]`\n\nThe derived equation matches option B exactly.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\nThe problem requires us to find the relationship between the temperatures of two stars based on the relative excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The key to solving this is the Boltzmann equation, which is applicable under the stated assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n**Step 1: The Boltzmann Equation**\nThe Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (`N_j`) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state (`N_i`):\n\n`N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n\nwhere:\n*   `R = N_j / N_i` is the excitation ratio.\n*   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights of the energy levels.\n*   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the levels.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   `T` is the temperature.\n\n**Step 2: Applying the Equation to Each Star**\nWe can write the equation for each star, using `T_1` and `T_2` for their respective temperatures. The term `(g_j / g_i)` is a property of the iron atom's energy levels and is the same for both stars.\n\n*   For star 1: `R_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))`\n*   For star 2: `R_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n**Step 3: Using the Condition from the Problem**\nThe problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2.\" This translates to:\n\n`R_1 = 2 * R_2`\n\nSubstituting the Boltzmann expressions into this relationship gives:\n\n`(g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [ (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]`\n\n**Step 4: Solving the Equation**\nThe constant term `(g_j / g_i)` cancels from both sides:\n\n`exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\nTo solve for the temperatures, we take the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides:\n\n`ln(exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))) = ln(2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)))`\n\nUsing the logarithm properties `ln(e^x) = x` and `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`, we get:\n\n`-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)`\n\nRearranging the terms to isolate `ln(2)`:\n\n`ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1)`\n\nFactoring out the common term `(ΔE / k)` and finding a common denominator for the temperature terms:\n\n`ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)`\n`ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n**Step 5: Substituting the Numerical Values**\nThe problem provides the energy difference `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J`. The Boltzmann constant `k` is approximately `1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K`. The ratio is therefore:\n\n`ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 1 K`\n\nThe problem is designed so this pre-factor simplifies to 1. Substituting this back into our equation:\n\n`ln(2) = 1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\nThis gives the final relationship:\n\n`ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]`\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  **Interpreting \"Twice as Excited\":** This correctly translates to `R_1 = 2 * R_2`. A higher excitation ratio implies a higher temperature, so we should expect `T_1 > T_2`, making the term `(T_1 - T_2)` positive, which is consistent with `ln(2)` being positive.\n2.  **Algebraic Manipulation:** The key steps are taking the natural log of both sides and then carefully rearranging the equation to solve for `ln(2)`. A common mistake is to misplace a negative sign.\n3.  **The `ΔE/k` Factor:** Recognizing that the given values for `ΔE` and `k` are designed to make their ratio equal to 1 is crucial for simplifying the final expression to match the given options.\n4.  **Comparing with Options:** The final derived equation `ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]` must be carefully compared with each choice. It matches option D exactly. Many of the candidate answers performed the derivation correctly but failed at this final comparison step.\n\nBased on the rigorous derivation, the correct equation is the one presented in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
