The mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) generates the nitronium ion (NO₂⁺), the electrophile.\n*   **Directing Effect:** The methyl group (-CH₃) on toluene is an ortho-, para-directing group.\n*   **Product 1:** The reaction yields a mixture of ortho-nitrotoluene and para-nitrotoluene. Due to less steric hindrance, the para isomer is the major product. In a multi-step synthesis, it is standard to assume the major product is carried forward.\n*   **Conclusion:** Product 1 is **p-nitrotoluene** (4-nitrotoluene).\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄, forming product 2.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is an oxidation reaction. Product 1 (p-nitrotoluene) has a methyl group at a benzylic position.\n*   **Reagents:** Manganese dioxide (MnO₂) is an oxidizing agent. While strong oxidizing agents like KMnO₄ would typically oxidize a benzylic methyl group to a carboxylic acid, MnO₂ is often used for more controlled oxidations, such as converting benzylic alcohols to aldehydes. For benzylic methyl groups, it can also yield the aldehyde.\n*   **Contextual Clue:** The next reaction step involves acetone and base. If Product 2 were an aldehyde, it would undergo a very common and high-yield reaction called a Claisen-Schmidt condensation. If it were a carboxylic acid, the subsequent reaction is less straightforward. Therefore, the most logical structure for Product 2 is the aldehyde.\n*   **Conclusion:** Product 2 is **p-nitrobenzaldehyde** (4-nitrobenzaldehyde).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a base-catalyzed crossed aldol condensation, specifically a **Claisen-Schmidt condensation**.\n*   **Mechanism:** The base (NaOH) removes an acidic α-proton from acetone to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde (which has no α-protons and cannot self-condense). The resulting aldol addition product readily dehydrates (loses H₂O) to form a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n*   **Product 3:** The final product is the thermodynamically more stable trans (E) isomer.\n*   **Conclusion:** Product 3 is **(E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the molecular symmetry group of Product 3.**\n*   **Structure:** The molecule is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one. Its structure is `O₂N-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n*   **Planarity:** Due to the extensive π-conjugation system (nitro group, benzene ring, C=C double bond, C=O double bond), the main framework of the molecule is planar.\n*   **Symmetry Elements Analysis:**\n    *   **Identity (E):** All molecules have this.\n    *   **Proper Axis of Rotation (Cₙ):** There is no C₂ axis or any higher-order rotation axis. Rotating the molecule by 180° around any axis does not result in an identical structure because the two ends of the molecule (the nitro group and the acetyl group) are different.\n    *   **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** The molecule possesses a single plane of symmetry. This is the plane that contains the planar framework of the molecule (the benzene ring, nitro group, vinyl group, and carbonyl group). The methyl group can be oriented so that one of its hydrogens lies in this plane, with the other two reflected across it.\n    *   **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule does not have a center of inversion.\n*   **Point Group:** A molecule that possesses only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cs** point group.\n\n**Final Answer Selection:**\nThe molecular symmetry group of product 3 is Cs. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1.**\nThis reaction is the electrophilic nitration of toluene. The methyl group (-CH₃) on the benzene ring is an ortho-, para-directing group. This means it directs the incoming nitro group (-NO₂) to the positions adjacent (ortho) and opposite (para) to it. Due to steric hindrance, the para-substituted product is formed in a greater amount than the ortho-substituted product. In a multi-step synthesis, it is standard to assume the major product is carried forward to the next step.\n*   **Product 1 is p-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene).**\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄, forming product 2.**\nThis step is the oxidation of p-nitrotoluene. The reagents, manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄), act as an oxidizing agent. While very strong oxidizing agents can convert a benzylic methyl group to a carboxylic acid, the use of MnO₂ often results in a more controlled oxidation to the aldehyde. The chemical logic of the overall sequence supports this, as an aldehyde is required for the subsequent reaction.\n*   **Product 2 is p-nitrobenzaldehyde (4-nitrobenzaldehyde).**\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.**\nThis reaction is a base-catalyzed crossed aldol condensation, specifically known as a Claisen-Schmidt condensation. The base (NaOH) removes an acidic alpha-hydrogen from acetone to create a nucleophilic enolate ion. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde, which lacks alpha-hydrogens and thus cannot self-condense. The initial addition product readily undergoes dehydration (loses a water molecule) to form a highly stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone. The more stable trans (E) isomer is the major product.\n*   **Product 3 is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.**\n\n**Step 4: Determine the molecular symmetry group of Product 3.**\nTo find the molecular symmetry group (point group), we must identify the symmetry elements present in the final product, (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule has a p-nitrophenyl group attached to a trans-butenone chain: O₂N-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃.\n*   **Planarity:** The extensive system of conjugated double bonds (in the benzene ring, the C=C double bond, and the C=O bond) causes the main framework of the molecule to be planar to maximize stability.\n*   **Symmetry Elements:**\n    *   **Identity (E):** All molecules possess this element.\n    *   **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** The molecule has a single plane of symmetry, which is the plane that contains the planar framework of the molecule. The methyl group (-CH₃) can orient itself so that one hydrogen lies in this plane, with the other two located symmetrically above and below it.\n    *   **Axis of Rotation (Cₙ):** The molecule does not have any C₂ or higher-order axes of rotation. Rotating the molecule by 180° does not result in an identical structure because the nitro group (-NO₂) at one end is different from the acetyl group (-C(=O)CH₃) at the other.\n    *   **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule does not have a center of inversion.\n\nA molecule that possesses only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n\nComparing this conclusion to the given options:\nA) d2h - Incorrect.\nB) c3 - Incorrect.\nC) cs - Correct.\nD) c2h - Incorrect.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is the electrophilic nitration of toluene. The mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) generates the nitronium ion (NO₂⁺), which is the electrophile.\n*   **Directing Effect:** The methyl group (-CH₃) on toluene is an ortho, para-directing group.\n*   **Product 1:** The reaction yields a mixture of ortho-nitrotoluene and para-nitrotoluene. Due to steric hindrance, the para isomer is the major product. In a multi-step synthesis, we assume the major product is carried forward. Thus, **Product 1 is p-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene)**.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄, forming product 2.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is an oxidation reaction of p-nitrotoluene. The reagent MnO₂ is often used for the selective oxidation of benzylic alcohols to aldehydes. It can also oxidize activated benzylic methyl groups.\n*   **Analysis:** While a very strong oxidizing agent like KMnO₄ would oxidize the methyl group to a carboxylic acid, MnO₂ is milder and often stops at the aldehyde stage. More importantly, the next reaction step (treatment with acetone and base) is a classic reaction for an aldehyde (Claisen-Schmidt condensation). This strongly suggests that the oxidation produces an aldehyde.\n*   **Product 2:** The methyl group is oxidized to an aldehyde group. Thus, **Product 2 is p-nitrobenzaldehyde (4-nitrobenzaldehyde)**.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a base-catalyzed crossed aldol condensation, specifically a Claisen-Schmidt condensation.\n*   **Mechanism:** The base (NaOH) removes an acidic α-hydrogen from acetone to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde (which has no α-hydrogens and cannot self-condense). The resulting aldol addition product readily dehydrates (loses water) to form a highly stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n*   **Product 3:** The final product is **(E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one**. The trans (E) isomer is favored due to lower steric hindrance.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the molecular symmetry group of Product 3.**\n*   **Structure:** The molecule is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one. Its structure is `O₂N-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n*   **Planarity:** Due to the extensive π-conjugation (involving the nitro group, benzene ring, C=C double bond, and C=O double bond), the main framework of the molecule is planar.\n*   **Symmetry Elements Analysis:**\n    *   **Identity (E):** All molecules have this.\n    *   **Proper Axis of Rotation (Cₙ):** There is no C₂ or higher-order rotation axis.

This combination acts as an oxidizing agent for the benzylic methyl group.\n    *   To determine the product of this oxidation (aldehyde vs. carboxylic acid), we must consider the next step. The next step is a reaction with acetone and base. A reaction between an aldehyde, acetone, and base is a very common and well-known reaction (Claisen-Schmidt condensation). A reaction between a carboxylic acid, acetone, and base is less straightforward. Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that the oxidation stops at the aldehyde stage.\n    *   **Product 2 is p-nitrobenzaldehyde (4-nitrobenzaldehyde).**\n\n*   **Reaction 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.**\n    *   This is a base-catalyzed crossed aldol condensation, specifically a Claisen-Schmidt condensation.\n    *   The base (NaOH) deprotonates acetone to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   The enolate attacks the carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde (which has no α-hydrogens and cannot self-condense).\n    *   The resulting aldol addition product readily dehydrates (loses water) to form a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone.

The most chemically sound pathway leads to a product with Cs symmetry.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1.**\nThis reaction is the electrophilic nitration of toluene. The methyl group (-CH₃) is an ortho-, para-director, meaning it directs the incoming nitro group (-NO₂) to the positions ortho and para to itself. Due to steric hindrance, the para-substituted product is favored and is the major product. In a multi-step synthesis, it is standard to proceed with the major product.\n*   **Product 1 is p-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene).**\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄, forming product 2.**\nThis step is the oxidation of p-nitrotoluene. The combination of manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) acts as an oxidizing agent. While conditions can be varied to produce a carboxylic acid, a common and controlled oxidation of a benzylic methyl group, especially when the subsequent step is a condensation with a ketone, yields an aldehyde. This interpretation makes the overall reaction sequence a standard, logical synthesis.\n*   **Product 2 is p-nitrobenzaldehyde (4-nitrobenzaldehyde).**\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.**\nThis reaction is a base-catalyzed crossed aldol condensation, known as the Claisen-Schmidt condensation. The base (NaOH) removes an acidic alpha-hydrogen from acetone to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde, which lacks alpha-hydrogens and cannot self-condense. The initial aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration (loses a water molecule) to form a highly stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone. The trans (E) isomer is the more stable and major product.\n*   **Product 3 is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.**\n\n**Step 4: Determine the molecular symmetry group of Product 3.**\nTo find the molecular symmetry group (point group), we must identify the symmetry elements present in the final product, (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n*   **Structure:** The molecule has a p-nitrophenyl group linked to a trans-enone chain: O₂N-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃.\n*   **Planarity:** The extensive π-conjugated system (nitro group, benzene ring, C=C double bond, C=O double bond) forces the main framework of the molecule to be essentially planar to maximize orbital overlap.\n*   **Symmetry Elements:**\n    *   **Identity (E):** All molecules possess this element.\n    *   **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** The molecule has a single plane of symmetry, which is the plane containing the planar backbone of the molecule.

The methyl group (-CH₃) is an ortho-, para-directing group. Due to steric hindrance at the ortho position, the major product is the para-substituted isomer. Therefore, Product 1 is **p-nitrotoluene** (4-nitrotoluene).\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄, forming product 2.**\nThis step is the oxidation of p-nitrotoluene. The combination of manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) is an oxidizing agent. In the context of a multi-step synthesis, it is crucial to consider the subsequent reaction. The next step is a reaction with acetone and base, which strongly suggests a Claisen-Schmidt condensation. This reaction requires an aldehyde. Therefore, the methyl group of p-nitrotoluene is oxidized to an aldehyde group, not a carboxylic acid. Product 2 is **p-nitrobenzaldehyde** (4-nitrobenzaldehyde).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.**\nThis reaction is a base-catalyzed crossed aldol condensation, specifically a Claisen-Schmidt condensation. The base (NaOH) deprotonates acetone to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate attacks the carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde, which lacks α-hydrogens and cannot self-condense. The resulting intermediate readily dehydrates to form a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone. The thermodynamically more stable trans (E) isomer is the major product. Product 3 is **(E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the molecular symmetry group of Product 3.**\nThe final product is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one. Its structure is O₂N-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃.\n\nTo determine its molecular symmetry group, we must identify its symmetry elements:\n*   **Planarity:** The molecule has an extensive conjugated π-system (nitro group, benzene ring, C=C double bond, C=O double bond).

The mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) generates the nitronium ion (NO₂⁺), the electrophile.\n*   **Directing Effect:** The methyl group (-CH₃) on toluene is an ortho-, para-directing group.\n*   **Product 1:** The reaction yields a mixture of ortho-nitrotoluene and para-nitrotoluene. Due to less steric hindrance, the para isomer is the major product. In a multi-step synthesis, it is standard to assume the major product is carried forward.\n*   **Conclusion:** Product 1 is **p-nitrotoluene** (4-nitrotoluene).\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄, forming product 2.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is an oxidation reaction. Product 1 (p-nitrotoluene) has a methyl group at a benzylic position.\n*   **Reagents:** Manganese dioxide (MnO₂) is an oxidizing agent. While strong oxidizing agents like KMnO₄ would typically oxidize a benzylic methyl group to a carboxylic acid, MnO₂ is often used for more controlled oxidations, such as converting benzylic alcohols to aldehydes. For benzylic methyl groups, it can also yield the aldehyde.\n*   **Contextual Clue:** The next reaction step involves acetone and base. If Product 2 were an aldehyde, it would undergo a very common and high-yield reaction called a Claisen-Schmidt condensation. If it were a carboxylic acid, the subsequent reaction is less straightforward. Therefore, the most logical structure for Product 2 is the aldehyde.\n*   **Conclusion:** Product 2 is **p-nitrobenzaldehyde** (4-nitrobenzaldehyde).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a base-catalyzed crossed aldol condensation, specifically a **Claisen-Schmidt condensation**.\n*   **Mechanism:** The base (NaOH) removes an acidic α-proton from acetone to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde (which has no α-protons and cannot self-condense). The resulting aldol addition product readily dehydrates (loses H₂O) to form a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n*   **Product 3:** The final product is the thermodynamically more stable trans (E) isomer.\n*   **Conclusion:** Product 3 is **(E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the molecular symmetry group of Product 3.**\n*   **Structure:** The molecule is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one. Its structure is `O₂N-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n*   **Planarity:** Due to the extensive π-conjugation system (nitro group, benzene ring, C=C double bond, C=O double bond), the main framework of the molecule is planar.\n*   **Symmetry Elements Analysis:**\n    *   **Identity (E):** All molecules have this.\n    *   **Proper Axis of Rotation (Cₙ):** There is no C₂ axis or any higher-order rotation axis. Rotating the molecule by 180° around any axis does not result in an identical structure because the two ends of the molecule (the nitro group and the acetyl group) are different.\n    *   **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** The molecule possesses a single plane of symmetry. This is the plane that contains the planar framework of the molecule (the benzene ring, nitro group, vinyl group, and carbonyl group). The methyl group can be oriented so that one of its hydrogens lies in this plane, with the other two reflected across it.\n    *   **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule does not have a center of inversion.\n*   **Point Group:** A molecule that possesses only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cs** point group.\n\n**Final Answer Selection:**\nThe molecular symmetry group of product 3 is Cs. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1.**\nThis reaction is the electrophilic nitration of toluene. The methyl group (-CH₃) on the benzene ring is an ortho-, para-directing group. This means it directs the incoming nitro group (-NO₂) to the positions adjacent (ortho) and opposite (para) to it. Due to steric hindrance, the para-substituted product is formed in a greater amount than the ortho-substituted product. In a multi-step synthesis, it is standard to assume the major product is carried forward to the next step.\n*   **Product 1 is p-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene).**\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄, forming product 2.**\nThis step is the oxidation of p-nitrotoluene. The reagents, manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄), act as an oxidizing agent. While very strong oxidizing agents can convert a benzylic methyl group to a carboxylic acid, the use of MnO₂ often results in a more controlled oxidation to the aldehyde. The chemical logic of the overall sequence supports this, as an aldehyde is required for the subsequent reaction.\n*   **Product 2 is p-nitrobenzaldehyde (4-nitrobenzaldehyde).**\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.**\nThis reaction is a base-catalyzed crossed aldol condensation, specifically known as a Claisen-Schmidt condensation. The base (NaOH) removes an acidic alpha-hydrogen from acetone to create a nucleophilic enolate ion. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde, which lacks alpha-hydrogens and thus cannot self-condense. The initial addition product readily undergoes dehydration (loses a water molecule) to form a highly stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone. The more stable trans (E) isomer is the major product.\n*   **Product 3 is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.**\n\n**Step 4: Determine the molecular symmetry group of Product 3.**\nTo find the molecular symmetry group (point group), we must identify the symmetry elements present in the final product, (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule has a p-nitrophenyl group attached to a trans-butenone chain: O₂N-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃.\n*   **Planarity:** The extensive system of conjugated double bonds (in the benzene ring, the C=C double bond, and the C=O bond) causes the main framework of the molecule to be planar to maximize stability.\n*   **Symmetry Elements:**\n    *   **Identity (E):** All molecules possess this element.\n    *   **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** The molecule has a single plane of symmetry, which is the plane that contains the planar framework of the molecule. The methyl group (-CH₃) can orient itself so that one hydrogen lies in this plane, with the other two located symmetrically above and below it.\n    *   **Axis of Rotation (Cₙ):** The molecule does not have any C₂ or higher-order axes of rotation. Rotating the molecule by 180° does not result in an identical structure because the nitro group (-NO₂) at one end is different from the acetyl group (-C(=O)CH₃) at the other.\n    *   **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule does not have a center of inversion.\n\nA molecule that possesses only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n\nComparing this conclusion to the given options:\nA) d2h - Incorrect.\nB) c3 - Incorrect.\nC) cs - Correct.\nD) c2h - Incorrect.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is the electrophilic nitration of toluene. The mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) generates the nitronium ion (NO₂⁺), which is the electrophile.\n*   **Directing Effect:** The methyl group (-CH₃) on toluene is an ortho, para-directing group.\n*   **Product 1:** The reaction yields a mixture of ortho-nitrotoluene and para-nitrotoluene. Due to steric hindrance, the para isomer is the major product. In a multi-step synthesis, we assume the major product is carried forward. Thus, **Product 1 is p-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene)**.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄, forming product 2.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is an oxidation reaction of p-nitrotoluene. The reagent MnO₂ is often used for the selective oxidation of benzylic alcohols to aldehydes. It can also oxidize activated benzylic methyl groups.\n*   **Analysis:** While a very strong oxidizing agent like KMnO₄ would oxidize the methyl group to a carboxylic acid, MnO₂ is milder and often stops at the aldehyde stage. More importantly, the next reaction step (treatment with acetone and base) is a classic reaction for an aldehyde (Claisen-Schmidt condensation). This strongly suggests that the oxidation produces an aldehyde.\n*   **Product 2:** The methyl group is oxidized to an aldehyde group. Thus, **Product 2 is p-nitrobenzaldehyde (4-nitrobenzaldehyde)**.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a base-catalyzed crossed aldol condensation, specifically a Claisen-Schmidt condensation.\n*   **Mechanism:** The base (NaOH) removes an acidic α-hydrogen from acetone to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde (which has no α-hydrogens and cannot self-condense). The resulting aldol addition product readily dehydrates (loses water) to form a highly stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n*   **Product 3:** The final product is **(E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one**. The trans (E) isomer is favored due to lower steric hindrance.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the molecular symmetry group of Product 3.**\n*   **Structure:** The molecule is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one. Its structure is `O₂N-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n*   **Planarity:** Due to the extensive π-conjugation (involving the nitro group, benzene ring, C=C double bond, and C=O double bond), the main framework of the molecule is planar.\n*   **Symmetry Elements Analysis:**\n    *   **Identity (E):** All molecules have this.\n    *   **Proper Axis of Rotation (Cₙ):** There is no C₂ or higher-order rotation axis.

This combination acts as an oxidizing agent for the benzylic methyl group.\n    *   To determine the product of this oxidation (aldehyde vs. carboxylic acid), we must consider the next step. The next step is a reaction with acetone and base. A reaction between an aldehyde, acetone, and base is a very common and well-known reaction (Claisen-Schmidt condensation). A reaction between a carboxylic acid, acetone, and base is less straightforward. Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that the oxidation stops at the aldehyde stage.\n    *   **Product 2 is p-nitrobenzaldehyde (4-nitrobenzaldehyde).**\n\n*   **Reaction 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.**\n    *   This is a base-catalyzed crossed aldol condensation, specifically a Claisen-Schmidt condensation.\n    *   The base (NaOH) deprotonates acetone to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   The enolate attacks the carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde (which has no α-hydrogens and cannot self-condense).\n    *   The resulting aldol addition product readily dehydrates (loses water) to form a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone.

The methyl group (-CH₃) is an ortho-, para-director, meaning it directs the incoming nitro group (-NO₂) to the positions ortho and para to itself. Due to steric hindrance, the para-substituted product is favored and is the major product. In a multi-step synthesis, it is standard to proceed with the major product.\n*   **Product 1 is p-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene).**\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄, forming product 2.**\nThis step is the oxidation of p-nitrotoluene. The combination of manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) acts as an oxidizing agent. While conditions can be varied to produce a carboxylic acid, a common and controlled oxidation of a benzylic methyl group, especially when the subsequent step is a condensation with a ketone, yields an aldehyde. This interpretation makes the overall reaction sequence a standard, logical synthesis.\n*   **Product 2 is p-nitrobenzaldehyde (4-nitrobenzaldehyde).**\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.**\nThis reaction is a base-catalyzed crossed aldol condensation, known as the Claisen-Schmidt condensation. The base (NaOH) removes an acidic alpha-hydrogen from acetone to form a nucleophilic enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde, which lacks alpha-hydrogens and cannot self-condense. The initial aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration (loses a water molecule) to form a highly stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone.

The methyl group (-CH₃) is an ortho-, para-directing group. Due to steric hindrance at the ortho position, the major product is the para-substituted isomer. Therefore, Product 1 is **p-nitrotoluene** (4-nitrotoluene).\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄, forming product 2.**\nThis step is the oxidation of p-nitrotoluene. The combination of manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) is an oxidizing agent. In the context of a multi-step synthesis, it is crucial to consider the subsequent reaction. The next step is a reaction with acetone and base, which strongly suggests a Claisen-Schmidt condensation. This reaction requires an aldehyde. Therefore, the methyl group of p-nitrotoluene is oxidized to an aldehyde group, not a carboxylic acid. Product 2 is **p-nitrobenzaldehyde** (4-nitrobenzaldehyde).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.**\nThis reaction is a base-catalyzed crossed aldol condensation, specifically a Claisen-Schmidt condensation.
