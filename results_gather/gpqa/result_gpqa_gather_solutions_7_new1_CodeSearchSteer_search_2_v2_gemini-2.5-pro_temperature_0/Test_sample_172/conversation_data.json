Identify the Core Physical Principles**\n\nThe question asks for the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE) given the uncertainty in an electron's position (Δx). This problem is solved using two key concepts:\n\n*   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle (Position-Momentum):** This principle establishes the fundamental limit to the precision with which the position and momentum of a particle can be known simultaneously. For the minimum uncertainty, the relationship is:\n    Δx ⋅ Δp = ħ / 2\n    where Δp is the uncertainty in momentum and ħ is the reduced Planck constant (≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n\n*   **Energy-Momentum Uncertainty Relation:** The uncertainty in a particle's energy (ΔE) is related to the uncertainty in its momentum (Δp) by its velocity (v). This relationship is given by:\n    ΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp\n    This approximation is valid for both non-relativistic and relativistic particles, as the derivative of energy with respect to momentum (dE/dp) equals the particle's velocity, v.\n\n### **2.

First, rearrange the uncertainty principle to solve for the minimum uncertainty in momentum:\n    Δp = ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx)\n\n2.  Next, substitute this expression for Δp into the energy-momentum uncertainty relation:\n    ΔE = v ⋅ [ ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx) ]\n\nThis single formula allows us to calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy using the given values.\n\n### **3.

To connect the uncertainty in position (Δx) to the uncertainty in energy (ΔE), we need a two-step process.\n\n3.  **Step 1: Relate Position Uncertainty to Momentum Uncertainty.**\n    The position-momentum form of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states:\n    Δx ⋅ Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n    where:\n    *   Δp is the uncertainty in momentum.\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n\n    To find the *minimum* uncertainty, we use the equality:\n    Δp_min = ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx)\n\n4.  **Step 2: Relate Momentum Uncertainty to Energy Uncertainty.**\n    The uncertainty in energy (ΔE) can be related to the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) by considering how energy changes with momentum. For small uncertainties, this is given by:\n    ΔE ≈ |dE/dp| ⋅ Δp\n\n    The derivative `dE/dp` represents the group velocity of the particle's wave packet, which is equal to the particle's speed, `v`. This relationship `dE/dp = v` holds for both non-relativistic and relativistic particles. Therefore:\n    ΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp\n\n5.  **Combine the Principles and Formulate the Calculation:**\n    By substituting the expression for Δp_min from Step 3 into the equation from Step 4, we get a direct formula for the minimum uncertainty in energy:\n    ΔE_min = v ⋅ (ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx))\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    Now, we plug in the numerical values:\n    *   v = 2 × 10⁸ m/s\n    *   ħ ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   Δx = 1 × 10⁻¹⁰ m\n\n    ΔE_min = (2 × 10⁸ m/s) ⋅ [ (1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 ⋅ 1 × 10⁻¹⁰ m) ]\n\n    The factor of '2' in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n    ΔE_min = (10⁸ m/s) ⋅ [ (1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (1 × 10⁻¹⁰ m) ]\n    ΔE_min = 1.054 × 10⁸⁻³⁴⁺¹⁰ J\n    ΔE_min = 1.054 × 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options and Conclude:**\n    The calculated minimum uncertainty in energy is approximately **1.054 × 10⁻¹⁶ J**.\n    Let's compare this to the given options:\n    A) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\n    B) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\n    C) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\n    D) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\n\n    The calculated value is clearly on the order of 10⁻¹⁶ J, which matches option C.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Units:** Ensure all values are in SI units before calculation (nm to m).\n*   **Uncertainty Principle Form:** The more precise form `Δx ⋅ Δp ≥ ħ / 2` should be used for minimum uncertainty calculations. Using `ħ` instead of `ħ/2` is a common approximation but would yield a result twice as large (though still the same order of magnitude).\n*   **Energy-Momentum Relation:** The relation `ΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp` is crucial and valid even for relativistic speeds like the one given. Using a non-relativistic formula for kinetic energy would be incorrect.\n*   **Option Mapping:** The candidate answers sometimes have the options (A, B, C, D) in different orders. The final decision must be based on the numerical value and matched against the options provided in the original question prompt.\n\nThe consensus among the correct methods is that the uncertainty in energy is on the order of 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1.

There are two main ways to approach this, and both should yield the same result.\n\n**Method A: Position-Momentum to Energy-Momentum**\n1.  Start with the position-momentum uncertainty principle, which states that for minimum uncertainty:\n    Δx ⋅ Δp ≈ ħ / 2\n    where Δp is the uncertainty in momentum and ħ is the reduced Planck constant (≈ 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n\n2.  Relate the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) to the uncertainty in energy (ΔE). This relationship is given by:\n    ΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp\n    This is a general result where `v` is the particle's velocity, which holds for both classical and relativistic cases.\n\n**Method B: Energy-Time Uncertainty**\n1.  Start with the energy-time uncertainty principle:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≈ ħ / 2\n    where Δt is the uncertainty in time.\n\n2.  Estimate the uncertainty in time (Δt) as the time it takes for the electron to travel through the region of its positional uncertainty (Δx):\n    Δt ≈ Δx / v\n\n### Step 3: Perform the Calculation\nLet's use Method A, as it is the most common approach among the candidate answers.\n\n1.  **Combine the formulas from Method A:**\n    Substitute Δp = ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx) into the energy relation:\n    ΔE = v ⋅ (ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx))\n\n2.  **Plug in the numerical values (in SI units):**\n    *   v = 2 × 10⁸ m/s\n    *   ħ ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   Δx = 1 × 10⁻¹⁰ m\n\n    ΔE = (2 × 10⁸ m/s) ⋅ (1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 ⋅ 1 × 10⁻¹⁰ m)\n\n3.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    The factor of '2' in the numerator and denominator cancels out.\n    ΔE = (10⁸) ⋅ (1.054 × 10⁻³⁴) / (10⁻¹⁰) J\n    ΔE = 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴⁺⁸⁺¹⁰ J\n    ΔE = 1.054 × 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\nThe calculation yields a minimum energy uncertainty of approximately **1.054 × 10⁻¹⁶ J**.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Candidate Answers and Final Decision\n*   **Calculation Consistency:** Almost all candidate answers (14 out of 15) correctly perform this calculation and arrive at the same numerical result: ~1.05 × 10⁻¹⁶ J. This shows a very strong consensus on the physics and the calculation.\n*   **Method Consistency:** Many candidates correctly use both Method A and Method B, demonstrating the robustness of the result.\n*   **Option Discrepancy:** The final letter chosen by each candidate (e.g., <<<A>>>, <<<B>>>, <<<D>>>) varies. This is because the options provided within each candidate's text are scrambled differently. However, every single candidate correctly identifies the *value* ~10⁻¹⁶ J as the answer.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe physics and the calculation are straightforward and consistently lead to ΔE ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻¹⁶ J. We must match this result to the options provided in the original question:\n\n*   **A) ~10⁻¹⁶ J**\n*   B) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\n*   C) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\n*   D) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\n\nThe calculated value clearly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1.

Using `ħ` instead of `ħ/2` is a common approximation but would yield a result twice as large (though still the same order of magnitude).\n*   **Energy-Momentum Relation:** The relation `ΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp` is crucial and valid even for relativistic speeds like the one given. Using a non-relativistic formula for kinetic energy would be incorrect.\n*   **Option Mapping:** The candidate answers sometimes have the options (A, B, C, D) in different orders.

There are two main ways to approach this, and both should yield the same result.\n\n**Method A: Position-Momentum to Energy-Momentum**\n1.  Start with the position-momentum uncertainty principle, which states that for minimum uncertainty:\n    Δx ⋅ Δp ≈ ħ / 2\n    where Δp is the uncertainty in momentum and ħ is the reduced Planck constant (≈ 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n\n2.  Relate the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) to the uncertainty in energy (ΔE). This relationship is given by:\n    ΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp\n    This is a general result where `v` is the particle's velocity, which holds for both classical and relativistic cases.\n\n**Method B: Energy-Time Uncertainty**\n1.  Start with the energy-time uncertainty principle:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≈ ħ / 2\n    where Δt is the uncertainty in time.\n\n2.  Estimate the uncertainty in time (Δt) as the time it takes for the electron to travel through the region of its positional uncertainty (Δx):\n    Δt ≈ Δx / v\n\n### Step 3: Perform the Calculation\nLet's use Method A, as it is the most common approach among the candidate answers.\n\n1.  **Combine the formulas from Method A:**\n    Substitute Δp = ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx) into the energy relation:\n    ΔE = v ⋅ (ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx))\n\n2.  **Plug in the numerical values (in SI units):**\n    *   v = 2 × 10⁸ m/s\n    *   ħ ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   Δx = 1 × 10⁻¹⁰ m\n\n    ΔE = (2 × 10⁸ m/s) ⋅ (1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 ⋅ 1 × 10⁻¹⁰ m)\n\n3.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    The factor of '2' in the numerator and denominator cancels out.\n    ΔE = (10⁸) ⋅ (1.054 × 10⁻³⁴) / (10⁻¹⁰) J\n    ΔE = 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴⁺⁸⁺¹⁰ J\n    ΔE = 1.054 × 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\nThe calculation yields a minimum energy uncertainty of approximately **1.054 × 10⁻¹⁶ J**.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Candidate Answers and Final Decision\n*   **Calculation Consistency:** Almost all candidate answers (14 out of 15) correctly perform this calculation and arrive at the same numerical result: ~1.05 × 10⁻¹⁶ J. This shows a very strong consensus on the physics and the calculation.\n*   **Method Consistency:** Many candidates correctly use both Method A and Method B, demonstrating the robustness of the result.\n*   **Option Discrepancy:** The final letter chosen by each candidate (e.g., <<<A>>>, <<<B>>>, <<<D>>>) varies. This is because the options provided within each candidate's text are scrambled differently. However, every single candidate correctly identifies the *value* ~10⁻¹⁶ J as the answer.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe physics and the calculation are straightforward and consistently lead to ΔE ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻¹⁶ J. We must match this result to the options provided in the original question:\n\n*   **A) ~10⁻¹⁶ J**\n*   B) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\n*   C) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\n*   D) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\n\nThe calculated value clearly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1.
