Understand the System**\n\nWe have a solution containing cobalt(II) ions (Co²⁺) and thiocyanate ions (SCN⁻). These ions react to form a series of complexes:\n*   [Co(SCN)]⁺\n*   [Co(SCN)₂]\n*   [Co(SCN)₃]⁻\n*   [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\nThe total concentration of all cobalt-containing species, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free ion and all the complexes:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\n**2. Use the Stability Constants**\n\nThe overall stability constants (β) relate the concentration of each complex to the concentration of the free metal ion ([Co²⁺]) and the free ligand ([SCN⁻]):\n*   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]\n*   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²\n*   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³\n*   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴\n\n**3. Make a Simplifying Assumption**\n\nThe total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is ten times larger than the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M). This means the amount of thiocyanate that gets bound into complexes is relatively small compared to the total amount present. Therefore, we can approximate the concentration of free thiocyanate, [SCN⁻], as being equal to its total initial concentration.\nAssumption: [SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M\n\n**4. Calculate the Fraction of the Desired Complex**\n\nWe want to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]. This is the fraction of this complex (α₂) multiplied by 100.\n\nThe fraction α₂ is given by:\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\nNow, substitute the expressions from step 2 into the equation for c(Co):\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nNow substitute this and the expression for [[Co(SCN)₂]] into the formula for α₂:\nα₂ = (β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))\n\nThe [Co²⁺] term cancels out, leaving:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**5. Plug in the Values and Calculate**\n\nGiven values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, calculate each term in the denominator:\n*   1 = 1\n*   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n*   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nNow, sum these terms to get the denominator:\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThe numerator is the term for the complex we are interested in, [Co(SCN)₂]:\nNumerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4\n\nNow, calculate the fraction α₂:\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n**6. Convert to Percentage**\n\nTo get the percentage, multiply the fraction by 100:\nPercentage of [Co(SCN)₂] = 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], we first need to calculate its mole fraction among all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\nThe cobalt-containing species in the solution are Co²⁺, [Co(SCN)]⁺, [Co(SCN)₂], [Co(SCN)₃]⁻, and [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻. The total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of these species:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nThe formation of each complex is defined by its overall stability constant (β):\n*   [Co(SCN)]⁺ = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   [Co(SCN)₂] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nThe mole fraction (αₙ) of a specific complex, [Co(SCN)ₙ], is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration. For the dithiocyanato complex (n=2), the mole fraction (α₂) is:\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\nBy substituting the expressions for the concentrations of all species, we can derive a formula for the mole fraction that depends only on the ligand concentration ([SCN⁻]) and the stability constants:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThe problem states the following values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nNote that the total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M, is not required to calculate the percentage distribution of the species, assuming the provided [SCN⁻] is the equilibrium concentration.\n\nNow, we can calculate the terms in the denominator of the mole fraction equation:\n*   Term for Co²⁺: 1\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)]⁺: β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 × (0.1) = 0.9\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₂]: β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻: β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 63 × 0.001 = 0.063\n*   Term for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻: β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 16 × 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nThe sum of these terms (the denominator) is:\nSum = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThe numerator is the term for the dithiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)₂]:\nNumerator = 0.4\n\nNow, we calculate the mole fraction α₂:\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 × 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThus, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex in the solution is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the mole fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution. The mole fraction of a specific complex can be determined using the stability constants (β) and the concentration of the free ligand ([SCN⁻]).\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Define the species:** The cobalt-containing species in the solution are the free Co²⁺ ion and the complexes [Co(SCN)]⁺, [Co(SCN)₂], [Co(SCN)₃]⁻, and [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻.\n2.  **Formulate the mole fraction equation:** The fraction (α₂) of the [Co(SCN)₂] complex is given by the concentration of that complex divided by the total concentration of all cobalt species. This can be expressed in terms of the stability constants and the ligand concentration:\n    α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n3.  **Use the given values:** We are given the stability constants (β₁, β₂, β₃, β₄) and the thiocyanate concentration ([SCN⁻] = 0.1 M). The total cobalt concentration is not needed for this calculation as it cancels out.\n4.  **Calculate the result:** Substitute the given values into the formula to find the fraction α₂, and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given stability constants\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n\n# Given concentration of thiocyanate ligand [SCN-]\nscn_conc = 0.1  # M\n\n# The total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of all cobalt-containing species:\n# c(Co) = [Co2+] + [Co(SCN)+] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3-] + [Co(SCN)4]2-\n# Using stability constants, we can express each term relative to [Co2+]:\n# c(Co) = [Co2+] * (1 + beta1*[SCN-] + beta2*[SCN-]^2 + beta3*[SCN-]^3 + beta4*[SCN-]^4)\n\n# The concentration of the target complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II), is:\n# [Co(SCN)2] = beta2 * [Co2+] * [SCN-]^2\n\n# The percentage of [Co(SCN)2] is ([Co(SCN)2] / c(Co)) * 100.\n# The [Co2+] term cancels out, so we can calculate the fraction directly.\n\n# Calculate the denominator of the fraction (often denoted as Φ)\ndenominator = 1 + beta1 * scn_conc**1 + beta2 * scn_conc**2 + beta3 * scn_conc**3 + beta4 * scn_conc**4\n\n# Calculate the numerator term for the [Co(SCN)2] complex\nnumerator_CoSCN2 = beta2 * scn_conc**2\n\n# Calculate the fraction (alpha_2) of the [Co(SCN)2] complex\nalpha_2 = numerator_CoSCN2 / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha_2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"The calculated percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is: {percentage:.1f}%\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this result with the given options:\")\nprint(\"A) 42.3%\")\nprint(\"B) 38.1%\")\nprint(\"C) 25.6%\")\nprint(\"D) 16.9%\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value matches option D.\")\n\n<<<D>>>\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: \nErrors:   File \"<stdin>\", line 43\n    <<<D>>>\n    ^^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to calculate the percentage of the specific complex `[Co(SCN)₂]` relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Given Information and Species**\n*   Total cobalt concentration, `c(Co)` = 10⁻² M.\n*   Thiocyanate ligand concentration, `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M.\n*   Overall stability constants:\n    *   `β₁` = 9 for `[Co(SCN)]⁺`\n    *   `β₂` = 40 for `[Co(SCN)₂]`\n    *   `β₃` = 63 for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`\n    *   `β₄` = 16 for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n*   The cobalt-containing species in the solution are:\n    *   Free aquated ion: `Co²⁺`\n    *   Monothiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)]⁺`\n    *   Dithiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)₂]`\n    *   Trithiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`\n    *   Tetrathiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the Equations**\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\nThe concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]`, the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`, and the overall stability constants `βn`:\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Fraction of the Desired Complex**\nThe percentage of the `[Co(SCN)₂]` complex is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration, multiplied by 100.

The problem asks for the percentage of a specific complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to this total concentration.\n\nThe cobalt-containing species in the solution are:\n*   Free Co²⁺\n*   Monothiocyanato cobalt(II): [Co(SCN)]⁺\n*   Dithiocyanato cobalt(II): [Co(SCN)₂]\n*   Trithiocyanato cobalt(II): [Co(SCN)₃]⁻\n*   Tetrathiocyanato cobalt(II): [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\nThe formation of these complexes is described by overall stability constants (β):\n*   Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺       ; β₁ = [[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) = 9\n*   Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]     ; β₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) = 40\n*   Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻   ; β₃ = [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) = 63\n*   Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ ; β₄ = [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) = 16\n\n**2. Formulate the Expression for the Total Cobalt Concentration**\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\n**3. Express Each Complex Concentration in Terms of [Co²⁺]**\nUsing the stability constant expressions, we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration [Co²⁺] and the free ligand concentration [SCN⁻]:\n*   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\n**4. Substitute these Expressions into the Total Concentration Equation**\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nBy factoring out [Co²⁺], we get:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**5. Formulate the Expression for the Desired Percentage**\nThe percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration, multiplied by 100. This is also known as the distribution coefficient (α₂) expressed as a percentage.\n\nPercentage = ([[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)) * 100\n\nSubstitute the expressions from steps 3 and 4:\nPercentage = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))) * 100\n\nThe [Co²⁺] term cancels out from the numerator and denominator:\nPercentage = (β₂[SCN⁻]² / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)) * 100\n\n**Careful Point:** The problem gives c(Co) = 10⁻² M and [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M. We need to use the equilibrium concentration of the free ligand, [SCN⁻]. Since the total concentration of the ligand (0.1 M) is in large excess compared to the total metal ion concentration (0.01 M), we can approximate the free ligand concentration [SCN⁻] as being equal to its total concentration, 0.1 M. The total cobalt concentration c(Co) is not needed for the final calculation of the percentage.\n\n**6. Perform the Calculation**\nGiven values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of each term in the denominator's sum:\n*   Term 0 (for free Co²⁺): 1\n*   Term 1 (for [Co(SCN)]⁺): β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n*   Term 2 (for [Co(SCN)₂]): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   Term 3 (for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   Term 4 (for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nNow, calculate the sum in the denominator:\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThe numerator of our fraction is the term for the desired complex, [Co(SCN)₂]:\nNumerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4\n\nNow, calculate the fraction:\nFraction (α₂) = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nFinally, convert this fraction to a percentage:\nPercentage = 0.16916 * 100 = 16.916%\n\nThis value is very close to 16.9%.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe calculation shows that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nThe calculation has been performed correctly.\n\n### **Summary of Calculation**\n\n1.  **Goal:** Find the percentage of the `[Co(SCN)2]` species relative to the total cobalt concentration. This is represented by the distribution coefficient α₂.\n2.  **Formula:** The fraction α₂ is calculated using the formula:\n    `α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n3.  **Given Values:**\n    *   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n    *   β₁ = 9\n    *   β₂ = 40\n    *   β₃ = 63\n    *   β₄ = 16\n4.  **Substitution and Calculation:**\n    *   **Numerator:** `40 * (0.1)² = 0.4`\n    *   **Denominator:** `1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴) = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n    *   **Fraction (α₂):** `0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n5.  **Percentage:**\n    *   `0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThe code execution confirmed this result (`16.91618...%`). This value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nTo determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], we must first calculate the fraction of each cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\nThe relevant equilibria for the formation of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are:\nCo²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺, with an overall stability constant β₁ = 9\nCo²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂], with an overall stability constant β₂ = 40\nCo²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻, with an overall stability constant β₃ = 63\nCo²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻, with an overall stability constant β₄ = 16\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of all cobalt-containing species:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nThe fraction of any single species, for instance [Co(SCN)ₙ]²⁻ⁿ, is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration. This fraction, denoted as αₙ, can be calculated using the following general formula, which is a standard method for determining species distribution in complexation equilibria.\n\nαₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ(βᵢ[L]ⁱ))\n\nWhere:\n*   αₙ is the fraction of the complex with 'n' ligands.\n*   βₙ is the overall stability constant for that complex (note that β₀ is defined as 1).\n*   [L] is the concentration of the free ligand, which is [SCN⁻] in this case.\n\nGiven the concentrations c(Co) = 10⁻² M and [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M, and because the ligand concentration is significantly higher than the metal ion concentration, we can approximate the free ligand concentration [SCN⁻] to be equal to its total concentration, 0.1 M.\n\nWe are interested in the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)₂], which corresponds to n=2. The fraction α₂ is:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the denominator (D):\nD = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴)\nD = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001)\nD = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\nD = 2.3646\n\nNext, calculate the numerator for α₂:\nNumerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n\nNow, we can find the fraction α₂:\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage of [Co(SCN)₂] = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThus, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex in the solution is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nTo determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], we must first calculate its mole fraction relative to all cobalt-containing species in the solution.

Use stability constants to express concentrations:**\n\nThe overall stability constants (β) relate the concentration of each complex to the concentration of the free metal ion (`[Co^2+]`) and the free ligand (`[SCN^-]`).\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]^+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)3]^-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^3`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)4]^2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^4`\n\nSubstituting these into the equation for total cobalt concentration:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][SCN^-] + β2[Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 + β3[Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 + β4[Co^2+][SCN^-]^4`\n\nWe can factor out `[Co^2+]`:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4)`\n\n**3.

Since the ligand concentration is 10 times greater than the metal ion concentration, we can assume that the amount of ligand bound in complexes is small compared to the total amount of ligand. Therefore, the equilibrium concentration of the free ligand, `[SCN^-]`, is approximately equal to its initial total concentration.\n`[SCN^-] ≈ 0.1 M`\n\n**5.

This percentage is the fraction of this complex relative to the total cobalt concentration, multiplied by 100. Let's call this fraction α₂.\n`α₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)`\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for `[Co(SCN)₂]` and `c(Co)`:\n`α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\n**Careful Point:** The term `[Co²⁺]` appears in both the numerator and the denominator, so it cancels out. This means the fractional distribution of cobalt species depends only on the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`, not on the total cobalt concentration.\nThe simplified formula for the fraction is:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**Step 6: Substitute the given values and calculate**\nThe given values are:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, calculate each term in the expression:\n*   `β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9`\n*   `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   `β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n*   `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\nNow, calculate the denominator (the sum of all terms):\nDenominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nThe numerator is the term corresponding to the `Co(SCN)₂` complex:\nNumerator = `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4`\n\nFinally, calculate the fraction `α₂`:\n`α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n**Step 7: Convert the fraction to a percentage**\nPercentage of Co(SCN)₂ = `α₂ * 100%`\nPercentage = `0.16916 * 100% = 16.916%`\n\nThis value is approximately 16.9%.\n\n**Conclusion**\nComparing the calculated result with the given options:\nA) 42.3%\nB) 16.9%\nC) 25.6%\nD) 38.1%\n\nThe calculated percentage matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nThe user wants me to solve the problem and provide the final answer based on the reasoning and code execution.\n\n**1.

Code Execution Analysis:**\n* The Python script correctly implements the formula for `α2`.\n* It calculates the numerator: `40 * (0.1)^2 = 0.4`.\n* It calculates the denominator: `1 + 9*(0.1) + 40*(0.1)^2 + 63*(0.1)^3 + 16*(0.1)^4 = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`.\n* It divides the numerator by the denominator: `0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`.\n* It multiplies by 100 to get the percentage.\n* The code output is `16.916180326482287`.\n\n**3.

Identify the Species and Equilibria\n\nThe relevant cobalt-containing species in the solution are the free Co(II) ion and its complexes with thiocyanate (SCN⁻):\n*   Co²⁺ (free ion)\n*   [Co(SCN)]⁺\n*   [Co(SCN)₂]\n*   [Co(SCN)₃]⁻\n*   [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\nThe formation of these complexes is governed by their overall stability constants (β):\n*   **β₁ = 9** for Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺\n*   **β₂ = 40** for Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]\n*   **β₃ = 63** for Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻\n*   **β₄ = 16** for Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\n### 2. Formulate the Fraction of the Desired Species\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt species. The fraction of any single species, αₙ, can be expressed in terms of the free ligand concentration ([SCN⁻]) and the stability constants.\n\nThe fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (α₂) is given by the formula:\nα₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)\n\nThis can be expanded as:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThis type of calculation is standard for determining the distribution of species in a complex-ion equilibrium.\n\n### 3. Perform the Calculation\n\nWe are given the following values:\n*   Total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M (0.01 M)\n*   Total thiocyanate concentration, c(SCN⁻) = 0.1 M\n\nSince the thiocyanate concentration is ten times greater than the cobalt concentration, we can use the common and reasonable approximation that the free thiocyanate concentration at equilibrium is equal to its initial total concentration:\n[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M\n\nNow, we calculate each term in the formula for α₂:\n*   **Numerator**:\n    *   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4\n*   **Denominator**:\n    *   1 (representing free Co²⁺)\n    *   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 × 0.1 = 0.9\n    *   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 0.4\n    *   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 63 × 0.001 = 0.063\n    *   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 16 × 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nThe sum of the terms in the denominator is:\n1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nFinally, we calculate the fraction α₂:\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n### 4. Convert to Percentage\n\nTo find the percentage, we multiply the fraction by 100:\nPercentage of [Co(SCN)₂] = 0.16916 × 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nTo determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], in the solution, we need to calculate the mole fraction of this species relative to all cobalt-containing species. The formation of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes is governed by the following equilibria and their overall stability constants (β):\n\n*   Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺,       β₁ = 9\n*   Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂],     β₂ = 40\n*   Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻,    β₃ = 63\n*   Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻,   β₄ = 16\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co²⁺ ion and all its complexes:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nThe mole fraction (αₙ) of a specific complex, [Co(SCN)ₙ]²⁻ⁿ, is given by the formula:\nαₙ = (βₙ[SCN⁻]ⁿ) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nWe are asked to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, which corresponds to α₂.\n\nGiven:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, we calculate the denominator of the mole fraction equation:\nDenominator = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.1²) + (63 × 0.1³) + (16 × 0.1⁴)\nDenominator = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.01) + (63 × 0.001) + (16 × 0.0001)\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\nDenominator = 2.3646\n\nNext, we calculate the numerator for α₂:\nNumerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4\n\nNow, we can calculate the mole fraction α₂:\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage of [Co(SCN)₂] = 0.16916 × 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n### **1.

The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of the free ion and all its complexes:\n\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]^+] + [[Co(SCN)_2]] + [[Co(SCN)_3]^-] + [[Co(SCN)_4]^2-]`\n\n### **2. Use Stability Constants (β)**\n\nThe overall stability constants (`β_n`) relate the concentration of each complex to the free metal ion (`[Co^2+]`) and free ligand (`[SCN-]`) concentrations:\n\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]^+] = β_1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)_2]] = β_2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)_3]^-] = β_3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)_4]^2-] = β_4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4`\n\n### **3.

We are interested in the dithiocyanato complex, `[Co(SCN)_2]`, which corresponds to `α_2`.\n\nThe mole fraction `α_2` is given by:\n\n`α_2 = [[Co(SCN)_2]] / c(Co)`\n\nBy substituting the expressions from step 2 into the equation for `c(Co)` and then into the equation for `α_2`, we can derive a general formula for the mole fraction:\n\n`α_2 = (β_2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β_1[SCN-] + β_2[SCN-]^2 + β_3[SCN-]^3 + β_4[SCN-]^4)`\n\nNotice that the free cobalt concentration `[Co^2+]` cancels out, meaning the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)` is not needed for this calculation.\n\n### **4. Substitute the Given Values**\n\nWe are given:\n*   `[SCN-] = 0.1 M`\n*   `β_1 = 9`\n*   `β_2 = 40`\n*   `β_3 = 63`\n*   `β_4 = 16`\n\nLet's calculate the numerator and the denominator of the `α_2` formula.\n\n**Numerator:**\n`β_2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\n**Denominator:**\n*   Term 0 (for `Co^2+`): `1`\n*   Term 1 (for `[Co(SCN)]^+`): `β_1 * [SCN-] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n*   Term 2 (for `[Co(SCN)_2]`): `β_2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 0.4`\n*   Term 3 (for `[Co(SCN)_3]^-`): `β_3 * [SCN-]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 0.063`\n*   Term 4 (for `[Co(SCN)_4]^2-`): `β_4 * [SCN-]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 0.0016`\n\nSum of denominator terms = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n### **5. Final Calculation**\n\nNow, we can find the mole fraction `α_2`:\n\n`α_2 = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo get the percentage, multiply by 100:\n\n`Percentage = 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThis result matches the output from the provided Python code.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nThe problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\nFirst, let's define the species present in the solution.

    "Based on the analysis of the provided answers, there is a strong consensus on the calculation method and the final numerical result. The task is to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the correct method:\n\n**1. Formulation of the problem**\nThe percentage of a specific complex in an equilibrium mixture can be found by calculating its mole fraction (often denoted as α) and multiplying by 100. For a complex `[MLn]`, the mole fraction `αn` is given by the formula:\nαn = (βn * [L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ βi * [L]ⁱ)\nwhere βn is the overall stability constant for the complex `[MLn]`, and [L] is the concentration of the free ligand.\n\nFor the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex `[Co(SCN)₂]`, the formula is:\nα₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**2. Identification of given values and necessary assumptions**\n*   Ligand concentration [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   Stability constants: β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16\n*   **Careful Point 1: Ligand Concentration.** The total thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is ten times larger than the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M). Because the ligand is in large excess, it is a standard and valid assumption to approximate the concentration of free ligand at equilibrium, `[SCN⁻]`, as being equal to its total initial concentration (0.1 M).\n*   **Careful Point 2: Total Cobalt Concentration.** The formula for the mole fraction `α₂` shows that the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]` cancels out. Therefore, the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)` is not required to calculate the relative percentage of the complex.\n\n**3. Calculation**\nFirst, we calculate the individual terms for the denominator of the fraction:\n*   Term for free `Co²⁺` (i=0): 1\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)]⁺` (i=1): β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)₂]` (i=2): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻` (i=3): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   Term for `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻` (i=4): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nNext, we sum these terms to get the value of the denominator:\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThe numerator is the term for the complex we are interested in, `[Co(SCN)₂]`:\nNumerator = 0.4\n\nFinally, we calculate the fraction α₂:\nα₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n**4. Conversion to percentage**\nTo get the final answer, we convert the fraction to a percentage:\nPercentage = α₂ * 100% ≈ 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe calculation shows that approximately 16.9% of the total cobalt is present as the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"

The problem asks for the percentage of a specific complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to this total concentration.\n\nThe cobalt-containing species in the solution are:\n*   Free Co²⁺\n*   Monothiocyanato cobalt(II): [Co(SCN)]⁺\n*   Dithiocyanato cobalt(II): [Co(SCN)₂]\n*   Trithiocyanato cobalt(II): [Co(SCN)₃]⁻\n*   Tetrathiocyanato cobalt(II): [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\nThe formation of these complexes is described by overall stability constants (β):\n*   Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺       ; β₁ = [[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) = 9\n*   Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]     ; β₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) = 40\n*   Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻   ; β₃ = [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) = 63\n*   Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ ; β₄ = [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) = 16\n\n**2. Formulate the Expression for the Total Cobalt Concentration**\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\n**3. Express Each Complex Concentration in Terms of [Co²⁺]**\nUsing the stability constant expressions, we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration [Co²⁺] and the free ligand concentration [SCN⁻]:\n*   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\n**4. Substitute these Expressions into the Total Concentration Equation**\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nBy factoring out [Co²⁺], we get:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**5. Formulate the Expression for the Desired Percentage**\nThe percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration, multiplied by 100. This is also known as the distribution coefficient (α₂) expressed as a percentage.\n\nPercentage = ([[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)) * 100\n\nSubstitute the expressions from steps 3 and 4:\nPercentage = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))) * 100\n\nThe [Co²⁺] term cancels out from the numerator and denominator:\nPercentage = (β₂[SCN⁻]² / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)) * 100\n\n**Careful Point:** The problem gives c(Co) = 10⁻² M and [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M. We need to use the equilibrium concentration of the free ligand, [SCN⁻]. Since the total concentration of the ligand (0.1 M) is in large excess compared to the total metal ion concentration (0.01 M), we can approximate the free ligand concentration [SCN⁻] as being equal to its total concentration, 0.1 M. The total cobalt concentration c(Co) is not needed for the final calculation of the percentage.\n\n**6. Perform the Calculation**\nGiven values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of each term in the denominator's sum:\n*   Term 0 (for free Co²⁺): 1\n*   Term 1 (for [Co(SCN)]⁺): β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n*   Term 2 (for [Co(SCN)₂]): β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   Term 3 (for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻): β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   Term 4 (for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻): β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nNow, calculate the sum in the denominator:\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThe numerator of our fraction is the term for the desired complex, [Co(SCN)₂]:\nNumerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4\n\nNow, calculate the fraction:\nFraction (α₂) = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nFinally, convert this fraction to a percentage:\nPercentage = 0.16916 * 100 = 16.916%\n\nThis value is very close to 16.9%.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe calculation shows that the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nThe calculation has been performed correctly.\n\n### **Summary of Calculation**\n\n1.  **Goal:** Find the percentage of the `[Co(SCN)2]` species relative to the total cobalt concentration. This is represented by the distribution coefficient α₂.\n2.  **Formula:** The fraction α₂ is calculated using the formula:\n    `α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n3.  **Given Values:**\n    *   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n    *   β₁ = 9\n    *   β₂ = 40\n    *   β₃ = 63\n    *   β₄ = 16\n4.  **Substitution and Calculation:**\n    *   **Numerator:** `40 * (0.1)² = 0.4`\n    *   **Denominator:** `1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴) = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n    *   **Fraction (α₂):** `0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n5.  **Percentage:**\n    *   `0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThe code execution confirmed this result (`16.91618...%`). This value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nTo determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], we must first calculate the fraction of each cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\nThe relevant equilibria for the formation of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are:\nCo²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺, with an overall stability constant β₁ = 9\nCo²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂], with an overall stability constant β₂ = 40\nCo²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻, with an overall stability constant β₃ = 63\nCo²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻, with an overall stability constant β₄ = 16\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of all cobalt-containing species:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nThe fraction of any single species, for instance [Co(SCN)ₙ]²⁻ⁿ, is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration. This fraction, denoted as αₙ, can be calculated using the following general formula, which is a standard method for determining species distribution in complexation equilibria.\n\nαₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ(βᵢ[L]ⁱ))\n\nWhere:\n*   αₙ is the fraction of the complex with 'n' ligands.\n*   βₙ is the overall stability constant for that complex (note that β₀ is defined as 1).\n*   [L] is the concentration of the free ligand, which is [SCN⁻] in this case.\n\nGiven the concentrations c(Co) = 10⁻² M and [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M, and because the ligand concentration is significantly higher than the metal ion concentration, we can approximate the free ligand concentration [SCN⁻] to be equal to its total concentration, 0.1 M.\n\nWe are interested in the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)₂], which corresponds to n=2. The fraction α₂ is:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the denominator (D):\nD = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴)\nD = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001)\nD = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\nD = 2.3646\n\nNext, calculate the numerator for α₂:\nNumerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n\nNow, we can find the fraction α₂:\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage of [Co(SCN)₂] = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThus, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex in the solution is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nTo determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], we must first calculate its mole fraction relative to all cobalt-containing species in the solution.

Use stability constants to express concentrations:**\n\nThe overall stability constants (β) relate the concentration of each complex to the concentration of the free metal ion (`[Co^2+]`) and the free ligand (`[SCN^-]`).\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]^+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^2`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)3]^-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^3`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)4]^2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^4`\n\nSubstituting these into the equation for total cobalt concentration:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][SCN^-] + β2[Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 + β3[Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 + β4[Co^2+][SCN^-]^4`\n\nWe can factor out `[Co^2+]`:\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4)`\n\n**3.

Since the ligand concentration is 10 times greater than the metal ion concentration, we can assume that the amount of ligand bound in complexes is small compared to the total amount of ligand. Therefore, the equilibrium concentration of the free ligand, `[SCN^-]`, is approximately equal to its initial total concentration.\n`[SCN^-] ≈ 0.1 M`\n\n**5.

This percentage is the fraction of this complex relative to the total cobalt concentration, multiplied by 100. Let's call this fraction α₂.\n`α₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)`\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for `[Co(SCN)₂]` and `c(Co)`:\n`α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\n**Careful Point:** The term `[Co²⁺]` appears in both the numerator and the denominator, so it cancels out. This means the fractional distribution of cobalt species depends only on the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`, not on the total cobalt concentration.\nThe simplified formula for the fraction is:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**Step 6: Substitute the given values and calculate**\nThe given values are:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, calculate each term in the expression:\n*   `β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9`\n*   `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   `β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n*   `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\nNow, calculate the denominator (the sum of all terms):\nDenominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nThe numerator is the term corresponding to the `Co(SCN)₂` complex:\nNumerator = `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4`\n\nFinally, calculate the fraction `α₂`:\n`α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n**Step 7: Convert the fraction to a percentage**\nPercentage of Co(SCN)₂ = `α₂ * 100%`\nPercentage = `0.16916 * 100% = 16.916%`\n\nThis value is approximately 16.9%.\n\n**Conclusion**\nComparing the calculated result with the given options:\nA) 42.3%\nB) 16.9%\nC) 25.6%\nD) 38.1%\n\nThe calculated percentage matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nThe user wants me to solve the problem and provide the final answer based on the reasoning and code execution.\n\n**1.

Code Execution Analysis:**\n* The Python script correctly implements the formula for `α2`.\n* It calculates the numerator: `40 * (0.1)^2 = 0.4`.\n* It calculates the denominator: `1 + 9*(0.1) + 40*(0.1)^2 + 63*(0.1)^3 + 16*(0.1)^4 = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`.\n* It divides the numerator by the denominator: `0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`.\n* It multiplies by 100 to get the percentage.\n* The code output is `16.916180326482287`.\n\n**3.

Identify the Species and Equilibria\n\nThe relevant cobalt-containing species in the solution are the free Co(II) ion and its complexes with thiocyanate (SCN⁻):\n*   Co²⁺ (free ion)\n*   [Co(SCN)]⁺\n*   [Co(SCN)₂]\n*   [Co(SCN)₃]⁻\n*   [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\nThe formation of these complexes is governed by their overall stability constants (β):\n*   **β₁ = 9** for Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺\n*   **β₂ = 40** for Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]\n*   **β₃ = 63** for Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻\n*   **β₄ = 16** for Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\n### 2. Formulate the Fraction of the Desired Species\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt species. The fraction of any single species, αₙ, can be expressed in terms of the free ligand concentration ([SCN⁻]) and the stability constants.\n\nThe fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (α₂) is given by the formula:\nα₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)\n\nThis can be expanded as:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThis type of calculation is standard for determining the distribution of species in a complex-ion equilibrium.\n\n### 3. Perform the Calculation\n\nWe are given the following values:\n*   Total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M (0.01 M)\n*   Total thiocyanate concentration, c(SCN⁻) = 0.1 M\n\nSince the thiocyanate concentration is ten times greater than the cobalt concentration, we can use the common and reasonable approximation that the free thiocyanate concentration at equilibrium is equal to its initial total concentration:\n[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M\n\nNow, we calculate each term in the formula for α₂:\n*   **Numerator**:\n    *   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4\n*   **Denominator**:\n    *   1 (representing free Co²⁺)\n    *   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 × 0.1 = 0.9\n    *   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 0.4\n    *   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 63 × 0.001 = 0.063\n    *   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 16 × 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nThe sum of the terms in the denominator is:\n1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nFinally, we calculate the fraction α₂:\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n### 4. Convert to Percentage\n\nTo find the percentage, we multiply the fraction by 100:\nPercentage of [Co(SCN)₂] = 0.16916 × 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nTo determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], in the solution, we need to calculate the mole fraction of this species relative to all cobalt-containing species. The formation of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes is governed by the following equilibria and their overall stability constants (β):\n\n*   Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺,       β₁ = 9\n*   Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂],     β₂ = 40\n*   Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻,    β₃ = 63\n*   Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻,   β₄ = 16\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co²⁺ ion and all its complexes:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nThe mole fraction (αₙ) of a specific complex, [Co(SCN)ₙ]²⁻ⁿ, is given by the formula:\nαₙ = (βₙ[SCN⁻]ⁿ) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nWe are asked to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, which corresponds to α₂.\n\nGiven:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, we calculate the denominator of the mole fraction equation:\nDenominator = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.1²) + (63 × 0.1³) + (16 × 0.1⁴)\nDenominator = 1 + (9 × 0.1) + (40 × 0.01) + (63 × 0.001) + (16 × 0.0001)\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\nDenominator = 2.3646\n\nNext, we calculate the numerator for α₂:\nNumerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4\n\nNow, we can calculate the mole fraction α₂:\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage of [Co(SCN)₂] = 0.16916 × 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n### **1.

The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of the free ion and all its complexes:\n\n`c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]^+] + [[Co(SCN)_2]] + [[Co(SCN)_3]^-] + [[Co(SCN)_4]^2-]`\n\n### **2. Use Stability Constants (β)**\n\nThe overall stability constants (`β_n`) relate the concentration of each complex to the free metal ion (`[Co^2+]`) and free ligand (`[SCN-]`) concentrations:\n\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]^+] = β_1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)_2]] = β_2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)_3]^-] = β_3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)_4]^2-] = β_4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4`\n\n### **3.

We are interested in the dithiocyanato complex, `[Co(SCN)_2]`, which corresponds to `α_2`.\n\nThe mole fraction `α_2` is given by:\n\n`α_2 = [[Co(SCN)_2]] / c(Co)`\n\nBy substituting the expressions from step 2 into the equation for `c(Co)` and then into the equation for `α_2`, we can derive a general formula for the mole fraction:\n\n`α_2 = (β_2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β_1[SCN-] + β_2[SCN-]^2 + β_3[SCN-]^3 + β_4[SCN-]^4)`\n\nNotice that the free cobalt concentration `[Co^2+]` cancels out, meaning the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)` is not needed for this calculation.\n\n### **4. Substitute the Given Values**\n\nWe are given:\n*   `[SCN-] = 0.1 M`\n*   `β_1 = 9`\n*   `β_2 = 40`\n*   `β_3 = 63`\n*   `β_4 = 16`\n\nLet's calculate the numerator and the denominator of the `α_2` formula.\n\n**Numerator:**\n`β_2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\n**Denominator:**\n*   Term 0 (for `Co^2+`): `1`\n*   Term 1 (for `[Co(SCN)]^+`): `β_1 * [SCN-] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n*   Term 2 (for `[Co(SCN)_2]`): `β_2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 0.4`\n*   Term 3 (for `[Co(SCN)_3]^-`): `β_3 * [SCN-]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 0.063`\n*   Term 4 (for `[Co(SCN)_4]^2-`): `β_4 * [SCN-]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 0.0016`\n\nSum of denominator terms = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n### **5. Final Calculation**\n\nNow, we can find the mole fraction `α_2`:\n\n`α_2 = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo get the percentage, multiply by 100:\n\n`Percentage = 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThis result matches the output from the provided Python code.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nThe problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\nFirst, let's define the species present in the solution.
