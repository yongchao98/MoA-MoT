One of the α-hydrogens (on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) is replaced by a bromine atom. Since cyclohexanone is symmetrical, both α-positions are equivalent.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-Bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n*   **Reactant:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a strong base, with heat.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic example of the **Favorskii rearrangement**. An α-halo ketone with an abstractable proton on the other α-carbon undergoes a rearrangement upon treatment with a base.\n    1.  The hydroxide ion (OH-) removes a proton from the other α-carbon (C6), forming an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate attacks the carbon bearing the bromine (C2) in an intramolecular S_N2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion and forming a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one).\n    3.  The hydroxide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon of the cyclopropanone, opening the three-membered ring to form a more stable carbanion on a five-membered ring.\n    4.  Protonation during workup yields a carboxylic acid with a rearranged carbon skeleton. The six-membered ring contracts to a five-membered ring.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n    *(Note: An alternative E2 elimination to form cyclohex-2-en-1-one is less likely, especially given the next reaction step which is specific for carboxylic acids).*\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagent:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl). Pyridine acts as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)3)**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, a bulky and mild reducing agent.\n*   **Reaction:** This reagent is specifically used for the selective reduction of acid chlorides to aldehydes. It is not strong enough to reduce the resulting aldehyde further to an alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclopentane ring with a formyl group (-CHO) attached.\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO), the carbon it's attached to (C1), and the hydrogen on C1. This plane bisects the bond between C3 and C4 of the cyclopentane ring.\n\nLet's count the sets of chemically equivalent hydrogens based on this symmetry:\n\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton is unique. (1 type)\n2.  **The proton on C1 (the ring carbon attached to the CHO group):** This proton lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. (1 type)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 are diastereotopic (one is *cis* and one is *trans* to the aldehyde group). The same is true for C5. The two *cis* protons (one on C2, one on C5) are equivalent to each other. The two *trans* protons (one on C2, one on C5) are also equivalent to each other. But the *cis* set is not equivalent to the *trans* set. This gives two distinct types of hydrogens. (2 types)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** The plane of symmetry makes C3 and C4 equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 positions, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic, as are the two on C4. This results in one set of equivalent \"inner\" protons and one set of equivalent \"outer\" protons. These two sets are distinct from each other and from the protons on C2/C5. This gives another two distinct types of hydrogens. (2 types)\n\n**Total Count:**\n*   Type 1: Aldehyde H (1H)\n*   Type 2: C1-H (1H)\n*   Type 3: C2/C5 H (*cis*) (2H)\n*   Type 4: C2/C5 H (*trans*) (2H)\n*   Type 5: C3/C4 H (\"inner\") (2H)\n*   Type 6: C3/C4 H (\"outer\") (2H)\n\nSumming these up, there are **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in product 4.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is my step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction Sequence:** I will trace the chemical transformations step by step to identify the final product.\n    *   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1.** This is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. The bromine atom will add to the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the alpha-carbon). The product is 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n    *   **Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) + NaOH (heated) → Product 2.** This is a reaction of an alpha-halo ketone with a strong base. This set of reagents is characteristic of the **Favorskii rearrangement**. In this reaction, the six-membered ring contracts to a five-membered ring, forming a carboxylic acid derivative. The product is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n    *   **Step 3: Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) + Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and Pyridine → Product 3.** Thionyl chloride is a standard reagent for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. The product is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n    *   **Step 4: Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃) → Product 4.** This is a bulky, mild reducing agent specifically used to reduce acyl chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reaction at the aldehyde stage without further reduction to an alcohol. The final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of the Final Product (Product 4):** Based on the analysis, Product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. Its structure consists of a five-membered cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\n3.  **Count the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms:** Now, I will examine the structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde to count the number of unique hydrogen environments, considering the molecule's symmetry.\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO), the C-C bond connecting it to the ring, the carbon atom it's attached to (C1), and the C1-H bond.\n    *   Let's count the distinct types of hydrogens:\n        1.  **The aldehyde proton (H in -CHO):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n        2.  **The proton on C1:** This is the single proton on the ring carbon directly attached to the aldehyde group. It lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. (1 type)\n        3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** These are the carbons adjacent to C1. The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. However, on each of these carbons, there are two protons. These two protons are diastereotopic because C1 is a stereocenter. Therefore, they are chemically distinct from each other. This gives us two more types of hydrogens (one set of two equivalent protons, and another set of two equivalent protons). (2 types)\n        4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** These are the carbons beta to C1. The plane of symmetry also makes C3 and C4 equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 protons, the two protons on C3 (and C4) are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct from each other. This gives us another two types of hydrogens. (2 types)\n\n4.  **Sum the types:** Total distinct types = 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = 6.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1.

The reaction proceeds via an enol or enolate intermediate. One of the α-hydrogens (on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) is replaced by a bromine atom. Since cyclohexanone is symmetrical, both α-positions (C2 and C6) are equivalent.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n*   **Starting Material:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydroxide (a strong base) and heat.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic reaction of an α-halo ketone with a base. While elimination to form an α,β-unsaturated ketone is possible, the presence of an abstractable proton on the other α-carbon (the α'-position, C6) strongly favors a **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n    1.  The base (OH⁻) removes the acidic α'-proton from C6 to form an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate undergoes an intramolecular S_N2 reaction: the carbanion at C6 attacks C2, displacing the bromide ion (Br⁻) to form a strained bicyclic ketone intermediate (bicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-2-one).\n    3.  The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of this intermediate.\n    4.  The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, and the ring opens by cleaving the bond between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and the α'-carbon (C6). This relieves the strain of the three-membered ring and results in the formation of a five-membered ring with a carboxylate group.\n    5.  Upon acidic workup (which is implied before the next step), the carboxylate is protonated.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n    *   *Note:* If simple elimination had occurred, the product would be cyclohex-2-en-1-one. However, this compound would not react with thionyl chloride in the next step, making the Favorskii rearrangement the only logical pathway consistent with the entire reaction sequence.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n*   **Starting Material:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagents:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.\n*   **Reaction:** This is the standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Pyridine is a base used to neutralize the HCl gas produced during the reaction.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃)**\n*   **Starting Material:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a selective reduction. LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃ is a sterically hindered and less reactive hydride donor than LiAlH₄. It is known to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes, stopping at the aldehyde stage without further reduction to the primary alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. We can do this by analyzing the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclopentane ring with a formyl group (-CHO) attached.\n*   **Symmetry:** At room temperature, the cyclopentane ring undergoes rapid conformational changes (puckering). On the NMR time scale, this results in an effective plane of symmetry that passes through the C-CHO bond, the carbon it's attached to (C1), and the midpoint of the opposite C-C bond (the C3-C4 bond).\n*   **Counting Distinct Hydrogens:**\n    1.  **Aldehyde Hydrogen:** The hydrogen atom of the -CHO group is in a unique chemical environment. This is **1** type.\n    2.  **C1 Hydrogen:** The hydrogen atom on the carbon of the ring attached to the aldehyde group (C1) lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. This is a **2nd** type.\n    3.  **C2 and C5 Hydrogens:** The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. However, on each of these carbons, the two hydrogen atoms are diastereotopic (one is cis to the -CHO group, the other is trans). They are not chemically equivalent to each other. Therefore, the two hydrogens on C2/C5 constitute two different sets of equivalent protons. This gives **2** more types.\n    4.  **C3 and C4 Hydrogens:** The plane of symmetry also makes C3 and C4 equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 positions, the two hydrogens on each of these carbons are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent. This gives another **2** types.\n\n*   **Total Count:**\n    *   Type 1: Aldehyde-H (1H)\n    *   Type 2: C1-H (1H)\n    *   Type 3: C2-H & C5-H (cis) (2H total)\n    *   Type 4: C2-H & C5-H (trans) (2H total)\n    *   Type 5: C3-H & C4-H (one set) (2H total)\n    *   Type 6: C3-H & C4-H (the other set) (2H total)\n\nIn total, there are **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in product 4.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 4 and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2)**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone, a six-membered cyclic ketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Bromine (Br2).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the α-halogenation of a ketone. In this reaction, a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon) is replaced by a bromine atom. Since cyclohexanone is symmetric, both α-positions are equivalent.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n*   **Reactant:** 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a strong base, with heat.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents with an α-halo ketone that has protons on the other α-carbon (the C6 position) leads to a **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n    1.  The base (OH⁻) abstracts the most acidic proton, which is on the α-carbon not bearing the halogen (C6). This forms an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, where the carbanion attacks the carbon bearing the bromine (C2), displacing the bromide ion. This forms a bicyclic intermediate: bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one.\n    3.  The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of this strained bicyclic ketone.\n    4.  The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, and the cyclopropane ring opens. The ring opening occurs to form the more stable carbanion. Cleavage of the C1-C6 bond results in a carbanion on a five-membered ring, which is more stable than the alternative.\n    5.  Protonation upon workup yields a carboxylic acid with a rearranged carbon skeleton.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagent:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) is a standard reagent for converting carboxylic acids into acyl chlorides. Pyridine is a weak base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Reaction:** The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl).\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃)**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky, mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acyl chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to alcohols.\n*   **Reaction:** The acyl chloride is reduced to an aldehyde.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Symmetry:** At room temperature, the cyclopentane ring undergoes rapid conformational changes (ring flipping). On the NMR timescale, this results in an effective plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group, the carbon it is attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond of the ring.\n*   **Counting Distinct Hydrogens:** We can use this plane of symmetry to identify equivalent and non-equivalent hydrogens.\n    *   **H_aldehyde:** The single proton of the aldehyde group (-CHO) is in a unique chemical environment. This is **Set 1**.\n    *   **H1:** The single proton on the carbon atom C1 (the one bonded to the aldehyde group) is also unique. This is **Set 2**.\n    *   **H2 and H5:** The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to the protons on C5. However, the two protons on C2 itself are not equivalent. They are diastereotopic because of their fixed, different spatial relationships to the aldehyde group (one is \"cis\" and one is \"trans\" to it in any given conformation). Therefore, they represent two distinct sets of protons.\n        *   The two \"cis-like\" protons (one on C2, one on C5) are equivalent to each other. This is **Set 3**.\n        *   The two \"trans-like\" protons (one on C2, one on C5) are equivalent to each other. This is **Set 4**.\n    *   **H3 and H4:** Similarly, the plane of symmetry makes the protons on C3 equivalent to the protons on C4. The two protons on C3 are also diastereotopic.\n        *   The two \"cis-like\" protons (one on C3, one on C4) are equivalent. This is **Set 5**.\n        *   The two \"trans-like\" protons (one on C3, one on C4) are equivalent. This is **Set 6**.\n\nIn total, there are 6 sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n1.  Aldehyde H (1H)\n2.  C1-H (1H)\n3.  C2/C5 H's (2H)\n4.  C2/C5 H's (2H)\n5.  C3/C4 H's (2H)\n6.  C3/C4 H's (2H)\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in product 4.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe synthesis described proceeds through the following steps:\n\n1.  **Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂) forms 2-bromocyclohexanone (Product 1).** This is a standard alpha-halogenation of a ketone.\n2.  **2-bromocyclohexanone is heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH), forming a ring-contracted product (Product 2).** This reaction is a Favorskii rearrangement. In cyclic α-halo ketones, this rearrangement leads to a contraction of the ring. Thus, the six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to form cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n3.  **Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine, forming cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3).** This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride.\n4.  **Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(OtBu)₃H), forming cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde (Product 4).** This reagent is a mild reducing agent known for the selective reduction of acyl chlorides to aldehydes.\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde**. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\nCyclopentanecarboxaldehyde has a plane of symmetry that includes the aldehyde group (CHO), the carbon it's attached to (C1), and the hydrogen on C1. This plane bisects the rest of the five-membered ring. Due to this symmetry:\n\n*   The **aldehyde proton** is unique. (1)\n*   The **proton on C1** (the carbon attached to the aldehyde) is unique. (1)\n*   The two protons on the adjacent carbons (C2 and C5) are equivalent to each other. However, the two protons on C2 itself are diastereotopic (not equivalent). This gives **two distinct signals** for the C2/C5 positions.\n*   Similarly, the two protons on the next set of carbons (C3 and C4) are equivalent. The two protons on C3 are also diastereotopic. This results in another **two distinct signals** for the C3/C4 positions.\n\nCounting these up: 1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (C2/C5-H's) + 2 (C3/C4-H's) = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe search results confirm my revised reaction pathway.\n\n*   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine → 2-bromocyclohexanone (Product 1)**. This is a standard alpha-halogenation of a ketone.\n\n*   **Step 2: 2-bromocyclohexanone + heated NaOH → Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Product 2)**. The search results confirm that α-halo ketones, especially cyclic ones, undergo a Favorskii rearrangement in the presence of a base like NaOH to give a ring-contracted carboxylic acid. For 2-bromocyclohexanone, this yields cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Step 3: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid + Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) → Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3)**. This is a standard conversion of a carboxylic acid to an acid chloride.\n\n*   **Step 4: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(OtBu)₃H) → Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde (Product 4)**. The search results confirm that LiAl(OtBu)₃H is a specific, mild reducing agent used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reaction at the aldehyde stage without further reduction to the alcohol.\n\nTherefore, the final product (Product 4) is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\nNow, I will determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\nThe structure is a cyclopentane ring bonded to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\n1.  **Aldehyde Hydrogen**: The hydrogen atom of the aldehyde group (-CHO) is unique. (1 distinct H)\n2.  **Alpha Hydrogen**: The hydrogen atom on the carbon of the ring that is directly attached to the aldehyde group (C1) is also unique. (1 distinct H)\n3.  **Beta Hydrogens**: The hydrogens on the two carbons adjacent to C1 (let's call them C2 and C5) are equivalent to each other due to the molecule having a plane of symmetry that passes through the C1-CHO bond and the C3-C4 bond (assuming rapid conformational averaging). However, on each of these carbons (C2 and C5), the two hydrogens are diastereotopic because of the chiral center at C1. One hydrogen is *cis* to the aldehyde group and the other is *trans*. The two *cis* hydrogens (one on C2, one on C5) are chemically equivalent to each other. The two *trans* hydrogens (one on C2, one on C5) are also chemically equivalent to each other, but distinct from the *cis* hydrogens. This gives two more sets of distinct hydrogens. (2 distinct sets of H)\n4.  **Gamma Hydrogens**: The hydrogens on the remaining two carbons of the ring (C3 and C4) are also equivalent to each other by the same plane of symmetry. Similar to the beta hydrogens, the two hydrogens on C3 are diastereotopic, as are the two on C4. The two \"upper\" hydrogens are equivalent, and the two \"lower\" hydrogens are equivalent. This gives another two sets of distinct hydrogens. (2 distinct sets of H)\n\nTotaling these up:\n*   Set 1: Aldehyde H (1H)\n*   Set 2: Alpha H (1H)\n*   Set 3: Beta-cis H's (2H)\n*   Set 4: Beta-trans H's (2H)\n*   Set 5: Gamma-cis H's (2H)\n*   Set 6: Gamma-trans H's (2H)\n\nThere are a total of **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\nFinal check of the logic.\n- Reaction sequence confirmed by searches.\n- Final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n- Symmetry analysis of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde:\n    - H(aldehyde) - unique\n    - H(alpha) - unique\n    - H(beta) - 4 hydrogens, but in 2 sets of 2 due to diastereotopicity.\n    - H(gamma) - 4 hydrogens, but in 2 sets of 2 due to diastereotopicity.\n- Total = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6 distinct sets.\n\nThe reasoning is sound.\n\nThe reaction sequence is as follows:\n1.  Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine to form 2-bromocyclohexanone (Product 1).\n2.  Product 1 is heated with sodium hydroxide, undergoing a Favorskii rearrangement to form cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Product 2).\n3.  Product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine to form cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3).\n4.  Product 3 is treated with the mild reducing agent Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, which reduces the acid chloride to an aldehyde, forming cyclopentanecarbaldehyde (Product 4).\n\nThe final product, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde, has the following hydrogen environments:\n*   The single aldehyde proton.\n*   The single proton on the carbon to which the aldehyde is attached (the alpha-carbon).\n*   The four protons on the two beta-carbons. These are divided into two sets of two equivalent protons because of their diastereotopic relationship to the alpha-carbon.\n*   The four protons on the two gamma-carbons. These are also divided into two sets of two equivalent protons.\n\nIn total, there are 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6 chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\nFinal answer is 6. This matches option C.\n\nFinal answer is C.\nThe reaction sequence leads to the formation of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n1.  **Cyclohexanone + Br₂ → 2-Bromocyclohexanone (Product 1)**: This is an α-bromination of a ketone.\n2.  **2-Bromocyclohexanone + NaOH, heat → Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Product 2)**: This is a Favorskii rearrangement, a characteristic reaction of α-halo ketones with a base, resulting in ring contraction.\n3.  **Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid + SOCl₂/Pyridine → Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3)**: Thionyl chloride converts the carboxylic acid into an acid chloride.\n4.  **Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride + LiAl(OtBu)₃H → Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde (Product 4)**: Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a selective reducing agent that converts an acid chloride to an aldehyde.\n\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we analyze its structure:\n*   **H1**: The aldehyde proton (-CHO). This is a unique environment.\n*   **H2**: The proton on the carbon atom of the ring attached to the aldehyde group (Cα). This is also a unique environment.\n*   **H3 & H4**: The four protons on the two carbons adjacent to Cα (the β-carbons). Due to the chiral center at Cα, the two protons on each β-carbon are diastereotopic (not equivalent). However, due to a plane of symmetry in the time-averaged structure, the two β-carbons are equivalent. Therefore, the four β-protons are split into two sets of two equivalent protons.\n*   **H5 & H6**: The four protons on the two γ-carbons. Similar to the β-protons, these are split into two sets of two equivalent protons.\n\nCounting the distinct sets: 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (alpha) + 2 (beta sets) + 2 (gamma sets) = 6.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n### Reaction Analysis\n\n1.  **Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂):** This reaction is an α-halogenation of a ketone. Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine to form 2-bromocyclohexanone, which is **Product 1**.\n\n2.  **Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH):** When an α-halo ketone, like 2-bromocyclohexanone, is treated with a strong base such as NaOH, it undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the formation of a cyclopropanone intermediate, which then undergoes ring contraction. The six-membered ring of cyclohexanone contracts to a five-membered ring, forming cyclopentanecarboxylic acid as **Product 2**.\n\n3.  **Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Product 2) reacts with thionyl chloride in a standard conversion of a carboxylic acid to an acyl chloride. Pyridine is used to neutralize the HCl gas produced during the reaction. This yields cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride as **Product 3**.\n\n4.  **Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(OtBu)₃H):** This reagent is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce highly reactive acyl chlorides to aldehydes, and the reaction can be stopped at the aldehyde stage without further reduction to an alcohol. Therefore, cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3) is reduced to **Product 4**, which is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n### Analysis of Product 4\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must examine its structure and symmetry.\n\nThe structure consists of a cyclopentane ring bonded to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\n1.  **Aldehyde Hydrogen:** The single hydrogen atom of the aldehyde group (-CHO) is chemically unique. (1 type)\n2.  **C1 Hydrogen:** The hydrogen atom on the carbon of the ring directly attached to the aldehyde group (C1) is also unique. (1 type)\n3.  **C2 and C5 Hydrogens:** The cyclopentane ring has a plane of symmetry passing through C1 and the aldehyde group. This makes the hydrogens on C2 equivalent to the hydrogens on C5. However, on each of these carbons, the two hydrogens are diastereotopic (one is *cis* to the aldehyde group, and one is *trans*). Therefore, the two *cis* hydrogens (on C2 and C5) form one set, and the two *trans* hydrogens form another set. (2 types)\n4.  **C3 and C4 Hydrogens:** Similarly, the hydrogens on C3 are equivalent to the hydrogens on C4 due to the plane of symmetry. Again, the two hydrogens on each of these carbons are diastereotopic. This gives two more sets of equivalent hydrogens. (2 types)\n\nCounting the distinct types:\n*   1 aldehyde hydrogen\n*   1 hydrogen on C1\n*   2 types of hydrogens on C2/C5\n*   2 types of hydrogens on C3/C4\n\nIn total, there are 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2)**\n\nThis is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. In this reaction, one of the alpha-hydrogens (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) is replaced by a bromine atom. The product is an α-haloketone.\n\n*   **Reactant**: Cyclohexanone\n*   **Reagent**: Br2\n*   **Product 1**: 2-bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n\nProduct 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) is an α-haloketone. When treated with a strong base like sodium hydroxide, it can undergo two possible reactions: elimination or Favorskii rearrangement.\n\n*   **Possibility A (Elimination)**: The base removes a proton from C3, and bromide is eliminated from C2 to form an α,β-unsaturated ketone, cyclohex-2-en-1-one.\n*   **Possibility B (Favorskii Rearrangement)**: This is a characteristic reaction for α-haloketones that have a proton on the other alpha-carbon (the α'-position, C6). The base (OH-) removes a proton from C6 to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbon bearing the bromine (C2) in an intramolecular S_N2 reaction, forming a bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one (a cyclopropanone intermediate). The hydroxide then attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to the opening of the strained cyclopropanone ring. This results in ring contraction. The six-membered ring becomes a five-membered ring with a carboxylate group. After protonation (during workup), the product is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\nGiven the typical course of organic synthesis problems, the more unique and named reaction, the Favorskii rearrangement, is the intended pathway. We will proceed with this assumption and check if it leads to one of the given answers.\n\n*   **Reactant**: 2-bromocyclohexanone (Product 1)\n*   **Reagent**: NaOH, heat\n*   **Reaction**: Favorskii Rearrangement\n*   **Product 2**: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine**\n\nThis is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Thionyl chloride (SOCl2) is the reagent for this transformation, and pyridine is a weak base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n\n*   **Reactant**: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Product 2)\n*   **Reagent**: SOCl2, pyridine\n*   **Product 3**: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)3)**\n\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is well-known for the selective reduction of acid chlorides to aldehydes. It is not strong enough to reduce the aldehyde further to an alcohol.\n\n*   **Reactant**: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3)\n*   **Reagent**: LiAlH(O-t-Bu)3\n*   **Product 4**: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nNow we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. We can do this by analyzing the symmetry of the molecule.\n\nThe structure is a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\nLet's label the carbons:\n*   C1 is the ring carbon bonded to the -CHO group.\n*   C2 and C5 are the adjacent ring carbons.\n*   C3 and C4 are the remaining two ring carbons.\n\nThe molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C1 carbon, its attached hydrogen, the entire aldehyde group, and bisects the C3-C4 bond. This symmetry makes certain positions equivalent.\n\n1.  **Aldehydic Proton**: The single hydrogen in the -CHO group is in a unique chemical environment. This is **1** distinct type of hydrogen.\n2.  **Methine Proton**: The single hydrogen on C1 is also in a unique environment, situated on the symmetry plane. This is a **2nd** distinct type of hydrogen.\n3.  **Alpha Protons (on C2 and C5)**: The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. However, the two hydrogens on C2 are diastereotopic (one is *cis* to the aldehyde group, one is *trans*). They are not chemically equivalent to each other. The same applies to C5. The *cis* proton on C2 is equivalent to the *cis* proton on C5, and the *trans* proton on C2 is equivalent to the *trans* proton on C5. This gives us **2** more distinct types of hydrogens. (Total so far: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4)\n4.  **Beta Protons (on C3 and C4)**: The plane of symmetry also makes C3 and C4 equivalent. Similar to the alpha protons, the two hydrogens on C3 are diastereotopic and not equivalent to each other. The protons on C3 are equivalent to their corresponding partners on C4. This gives us another **2** distinct types of hydrogens. (Total: 4 + 2 = 6)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nCounting all the distinct sets of hydrogen atoms:\n*   Set 1: Aldehyde H (1H)\n*   Set 2: C1-H (1H)\n*   Set 3: C2-H & C5-H (*cis* to CHO) (2H)\n*   Set 4: C2-H & C5-H (*trans* to CHO) (2H)\n*   Set 5: C3-H & C4-H (one diastereotopic position) (2H)\n*   Set 6: C3-H & C4-H (the other diastereotopic position) (2H)\n\nThere are a total of **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2)**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone, a six-membered ring with a ketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Bromine (Br2).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. In the presence of an acid or base catalyst, one of the alpha-hydrogens (on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-Bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n*   **Reactant:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone, an alpha-haloketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a strong base, with heating.\n*   **Reaction:** These conditions are characteristic of the **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n    1.  A strong base (OH-) removes an acidic proton from the other alpha-carbon (C6), forming an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate performs an intramolecular S_N2 attack on the carbon bearing the bromine (C2), displacing the bromide ion. This forms a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one).\n    3.  The hydroxide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon of the strained cyclopropanone.\n    4.  The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, cleaving the bond between the carbonyl carbon and the more substituted alpha-carbon to form the more stable carbanion. In this case, the ring opens to form a carbanion on a five-membered ring.\n    5.  Protonation (during workup) of the resulting carboxylate gives a carboxylic acid. The six-membered ring has contracted to a five-membered ring.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n    *   *Alternative consideration:* An E2 elimination to form cyclohex-2-enone is also possible. However, the reagent in the next step (SOCl2) strongly suggests the product is a carboxylic acid, making the Favorskii rearrangement the correct pathway.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagent:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl2) with pyridine.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard and efficient method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl). Pyridine is a base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)3)**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)3).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a mild reducing agent. Unlike the more powerful LiAlH4 which would reduce an acyl chloride to a primary alcohol, LiAlH(OtBu)3 is sterically hindered and less reactive. It is selective for the reduction of acyl chlorides to aldehydes. The reaction stops at the aldehyde stage.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nNow we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. \"Chemically distinct\" means the hydrogens are in non-equivalent chemical environments. This corresponds to the number of signals one would expect to see in a high-resolution proton NMR spectrum (assuming no accidental equivalence).\n\nThe structure is a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\nLet's analyze the symmetry of the molecule. Due to rapid conformational changes (ring puckering) at room temperature, the molecule has an effective plane of symmetry on the NMR timescale. This plane passes through the aldehyde group, the carbon it's attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond of the ring.\n\nLet's label the hydrogens and determine their equivalence based on this symmetry:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (CHO):** This proton is unique. It is on the plane of symmetry. (1 type)\n2.  **The proton on C1:** This is the single proton on the carbon atom of the ring that is bonded to the aldehyde group. It is also on the plane of symmetry and is unique. (1 type)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 (a methylene group) are not equivalent to each other. They are **diastereotopic** because C1 is a prochiral center in the context of the ring. One proton is *cis* and the other is *trans* to the aldehyde group in any given conformation. They are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation. Therefore, they are chemically distinct. By symmetry, the protons on C5 are equivalent to their counterparts on C2. This gives us two sets of equivalent protons. (2 types)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** The plane of symmetry makes C3 and C4 equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 positions, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. By symmetry, the protons on C4 are equivalent to their counterparts on C3. This gives us another two sets of equivalent protons. (2 types)\n\n**Counting the distinct types of hydrogens:**\n*   Type 1: Aldehyde H (1 proton in this set)\n*   Type 2: C1-H (1 proton in this set)\n*   Type 3: One set of H's on C2/C5 (2 protons in this set)\n*   Type 4: The other set of H's on C2/C5 (2 protons in this set)\n*   Type 5: One set of H's on C3/C4 (2 protons in this set)\n*   Type 6: The other set of H's on C3/C4 (2 protons in this set)\n\nTotal number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis is a multi-step organic synthesis problem. Let's determine the structure of each product in the sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1**\nThis reaction is the α-halogenation of a ketone. A hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-carbon) is replaced by a bromine atom. Cyclohexanone is symmetrical, so the reaction yields a single major product.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 + Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH), heat → Product 2**\nThis is a classic **Favorskii rearrangement**. An α-halo ketone with an available proton on the other α-carbon (the α'-carbon) rearranges in the presence of a strong base to form a carboxylic acid derivative with a contracted ring.\n1.  The base (OH⁻) removes a proton from the α'-carbon (C6) to form an enolate.\n2.  The enolate performs an intramolecular S_N2 attack, displacing the bromide and forming a strained bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate.\n3.  The hydroxide attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to the opening of the strained ring to form a more stable carbanion on a five-membered ring.\n4.  Upon workup (implicit), the resulting carboxylate is protonated.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 + Thionyl Chloride (SOCl₂) and Pyridine → Product 3**\nThis is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl).\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃) → Product 4**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is selective for the reduction of acid chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reaction at that stage without further reduction to an alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nNow, we must determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. We need to analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO), the ring carbon it is attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond. Hydrogens that can be interchanged by this symmetry operation are chemically equivalent.\n\n1.  **Aldehyde Hydrogen:** The hydrogen atom of the aldehyde group (-C**H**O) is unique. This is **1 type**.\n2.  **C1 Hydrogen:** The single hydrogen on the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde group is also in a unique environment. This is a **2nd type**.\n3.  **C2 and C5 Hydrogens:** Due to the plane of symmetry, C2 and C5 are equivalent. However, the two hydrogens on C2 are not equivalent to each other (they are diastereotopic). One is *cis* to the aldehyde group, and one is *trans*. The *cis*-H on C2 is equivalent to the *cis*-H on C5, and the *trans*-H on C2 is equivalent to the *trans*-H on C5. This gives us **two more types** of hydrogens.\n4.  **C3 and C4 Hydrogens:** Similarly, C3 and C4 are equivalent. The two hydrogens on C3 are also diastereotopic. The two hydrogens on C3 and C4 that are closer to C1 are equivalent, and the two that are further away are equivalent. This gives us the final **two types** of hydrogens.\n\nIn total, we have:\n*   1 type (aldehyde H)\n*   1 type (C1 H)\n*   2 types (from C2/C5 hydrogens)\n*   2 types (from C3/C4 hydrogens)\n\nTotal = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2)**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone, a six-membered cyclic ketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Bromine (Br2).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the α-halogenation of a ketone. In this reaction, a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon) is replaced by a bromine atom.

The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) removes the acidic proton from the α'-carbon (C6) to form an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate then performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 attack on the carbon bearing the bromine (C2), displacing the bromide ion and forming a bicyclic ketone intermediate (bicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-2-one).\n    3.  The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of this strained intermediate.\n    4.  The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, breaking the bond between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and the α'-carbon (C6) to relieve the strain of the three-membered ring. This ring-opening step forms a carbanion.\n    5.  Protonation of the carbanion (upon acidic workup, which is implicit) yields a carboxylic acid with a contracted ring system.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid. The six-membered ring has contracted to a five-membered ring.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagent:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard and efficient method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride.

A key characteristic of LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃ is its ability to selectively reduce acyl chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the primary alcohol. This is a standard transformation taught in organic chemistry.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Final Analysis: Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)**\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\n```\n      O\n     //\n    C — H(a)\n    |\n   /C1\\ — H(b)\nH-C2--C5-H\n| |  | |\nH-C3--C4-H\n  \\----/\n```\n\nTo count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule.

This is **1 type**.\n3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** Due to the plane of symmetry, carbon C2 is equivalent to carbon C5. However, the two protons on C2 are not equivalent to each other. They are **diastereotopic** because of their spatial relationship to the substituent on the prochiral C1 carbon. The same applies to C5. Therefore, the protons on C2 and C5 give rise to **2 distinct types** of hydrogen signals.\n4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, the plane of symmetry makes carbon C3 equivalent to carbon C4.

To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to examine the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde is a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO). The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group, the C-H bond on the same carbon (C1), and bisects the bond between C3 and C4. Due to this symmetry, protons that can be reflected onto one another are chemically equivalent.\n\nLet's count the sets of non-equivalent protons:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n2.  **The proton on C1:** The proton on the carbon atom of the ring that is bonded to the aldehyde group is also unique. (1 type)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** These two carbons are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons on each of these carbons (one pointing \"up\" and one \"down\" relative to the ring) are diastereotopic, meaning they are not equivalent to each other. Therefore, they represent two distinct types of protons. (2 types)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** These two carbons are also equivalent by symmetry. Similar to the C2/C5 protons, the two protons on each of these carbons are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. (2 types)\n\nTallying these up: 1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (C2/C5-H's) + 2 (C3/C4-H's) = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\nTherefore, the ¹H NMR spectrum of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde would show 6 distinct signals.\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the number of its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine**\nThis reaction is the α-bromination of a ketone. One of the hydrogen atoms on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone.**\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide**\nWhen an α-halo ketone with an available proton on the other side of the carbonyl is treated with a strong base like sodium hydroxide, it undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the formation of a cyclopropanone intermediate, which then opens to form a ring-contracted carboxylic acid (or its salt). In this case, the six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to a five-membered ring.\n*   **Product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.**\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine**\nThis is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) is the chlorinating agent, and pyridine is a base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product 3 is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.**\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃) is a mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce highly reactive acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the alcohol.\n*   **Product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.**\n\n**Determining the Number of Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde (C₅H₉CHO). To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to analyze the molecule's symmetry. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO) and the C1 carbon of the ring to which it is attached.\n\nLet's count the unique proton environments:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n2.  **The proton on C1:** The hydrogen attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde group is also unique. (1 type)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** Due to the plane of symmetry, the protons on C2 are equivalent to the protons on C5. However, the two protons on C2 itself are not equivalent; they are diastereotopic. One is *cis* to the aldehyde group, and the other is *trans*. Therefore, these represent two distinct types of hydrogens. (2 types)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, the protons on C3 are equivalent to those on C4. The two protons on C3 are also diastereotopic. This gives another two distinct types of hydrogens. (2 types)\n\nTotaling these up: 1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (C2/C5-H's) + 2 (C3/C4-H's) = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\nTherefore, product 4 has 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the number of its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\nThis reaction is the α-bromination of a ketone. One of the hydrogen atoms on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-carbon) is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\nWhen an α-halo ketone, such as 2-bromocyclohexanone, is treated with a strong base like NaOH, it undergoes a ring-contracting rearrangement known as the Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction yields a carboxylic acid with a smaller ring.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\nThis is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl).\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃)**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild reducing agent specifically used to reduce highly reactive acyl chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to an alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n**Counting the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)**\n\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to examine the molecule's structure and symmetry.\n\nThe structure is a cyclopentane ring with a -CHO (aldehyde) group attached.\n\n1.  **Aldehyde Proton:** The hydrogen atom in the aldehyde group (-CHO) is in a unique chemical environment. This is one distinct type of hydrogen.\n2.  **Proton on C1:** The hydrogen atom on the carbon of the ring directly attached to the aldehyde group (C1) is also in a unique environment. This is a second distinct type of hydrogen.\n3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** The cyclopentane ring has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C1-CHO bond and the C3-C4 bond axis (assuming rapid conformational averaging). This symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to the protons on C5. However, on each of these carbons, the two protons are diastereotopic (one is \"cis\" to the aldehyde group, and one is \"trans\"). Therefore, the two cis protons (on C2 and C5) form one set of equivalent hydrogens, and the two trans protons form another set. This gives us two more distinct types of hydrogens.\n4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** The same plane of symmetry makes the protons on C3 equivalent to the protons on C4. Similar to the C2/C5 positions, the two protons on each of these carbons are diastereotopic. The two \"cis\" protons (on C3 and C4) are equivalent to each other, and the two \"trans\" protons are equivalent to each other. This adds another two distinct types of hydrogens.\n\nIn total, we have:\n*   Set 1: Aldehyde H (1H)\n*   Set 2: C1-H (1H)\n*   Set 3: C2/C5 \"cis\" H's (2H)\n*   Set 4: C2/C5 \"trans\" H's (2H)\n*   Set 5: C3/C4 \"cis\" H's (2H)\n*   Set 6: C3/C4 \"trans\" H's (2H)\n\nThis gives a total of **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclohexanone (a ketone) and bromine.\n*   **Reaction:** This is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. In this reaction, a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon) is replaced by a bromine atom. Cyclohexanone is symmetrical, so bromination at either α-carbon (C2 or C6) yields the same product.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n*   **Reactants:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone and a strong base (NaOH) with heat.\n*   **Reaction:** This substrate, an α-halo ketone with an available proton on the other α-carbon (α' position), undergoes a classic reaction called the **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n    1.  The base (OH⁻) removes the acidic proton from the α'-carbon (C6) to form an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate then performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 attack on the carbon bearing the bromine (C2), displacing the bromide ion and forming a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one).\n    3.  The hydroxide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon of this strained intermediate.\n    4.  The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, and the bicyclic ring opens to form a more stable, rearranged carboxylate. The ring contracts from a six-membered ring to a five-membered ring.\n    5.  After an acidic workup (which is implied to isolate the neutral product), the carboxylate is protonated.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid, thionyl chloride, and pyridine.\n*   **Reaction:** This is the standard procedure for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl). Pyridine is used as a base to neutralize the HCl gas produced as a byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃)**\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride and Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LTBA).\n*   **Reaction:** LTBA is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the primary alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. We can do this by examining the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclopentane ring with an aldehyde group (-CHO) attached to one of the carbons.\n    *   The molecule has a total of 10 hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Symmetry:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C-CHO bond, the ring carbon it's attached to (C1), and bisects the opposite C-C bond (the C3-C4 bond).\n\nLet's identify the unique proton environments based on this symmetry:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton is unique as it is the only one bonded to a carbonyl carbon. (1 type)\n2.  **The methine proton on C1:** This is the proton on the ring carbon to which the aldehyde group is attached. It is in the plane of symmetry and is unique. (1 type)\n3.  **The methylene protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. However, on each of these carbons, the two protons are diastereotopic (they are in different chemical environments relative to the rest of the molecule). Let's call them H_axial and H_equatorial (in a simplified model). The two axial protons (one on C2, one on C5) are equivalent to each other. The two equatorial protons (one on C2, one on C5) are also equivalent to each other. But the axial and equatorial protons are distinct. This gives two more types of protons. (2 types)\n4.  **The methylene protons on C3 and C4:** The plane of symmetry also makes C3 and C4 equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 protons, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic, and the same is true for C4. Therefore, the protons on C3 and C4 also give rise to two distinct chemical environments.

One of the hydrogen atoms on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group is replaced by a bromine atom. This yields **2-bromocyclohexanone** as Product 1.\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide**\n    When an α-halo ketone like 2-bromocyclohexanone is treated with a base such as sodium hydroxide, it undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the contraction of the six-membered ring into a five-membered ring, forming a carboxylic acid derivative. The product of this step, Product 2, is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine**\n    Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid reacts with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) in a standard procedure to convert a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. Pyridine is typically added to neutralize the HCl byproduct. This reaction forms **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride** as Product 3.\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride**\n    Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃) is a mild reducing agent specifically used to reduce highly reactive acyl chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to an alcohol. Therefore, cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride is reduced to **cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde**, which is the final product, Product 4.\n\n### Analysis of Product 4\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde**. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must examine the molecule's structure and symmetry.\n\nThe structure consists of a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO). Due to the puckered nature of the cyclopentane ring and the presence of the substituent, not all hydrogen atoms are equivalent.\n\nWe can categorize the hydrogen atoms as follows:\n1.  **The aldehyde hydrogen (CHO):** This hydrogen is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n2.  **The hydrogen on the carbon attached to the aldehyde group (C1):** This methine hydrogen is also unique. (1 type)\n3.  **The hydrogens on the carbons adjacent to C1 (C2 and C5):** These two carbons are equivalent due to a plane of symmetry. However, the two hydrogens on each of these carbons (a total of four) are diastereotopic. This means the hydrogen pointing in one direction relative to the ring is different from the hydrogen pointing in the other direction. This results in two distinct types of hydrogens at these positions. (2 types)\n4.  **The hydrogens on the carbons beta to C1 (C3 and C4):** Similar to the positions above, these two carbons are equivalent. The two hydrogens on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This gives another two distinct types of hydrogens. (2 types)\n\nCounting these up: 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (on C1) + 2 (on C2/C5) + 2 (on C3/C4) = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:** The user wants to know the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in a final product (Product 4) which is formed through a four-step chemical synthesis. I need to determine the structure of each intermediate product to correctly identify Product 4. Then, I must analyze the structure of Product 4 to count its unique hydrogen environments, which corresponds to the number of signals in a proton NMR spectrum. Finally, I need to present this logic and the answer in a Python code block.\n\n2.  **Step-by-Step Reaction Analysis:**\n    *   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1.**\n        *   This is a classic alpha-halogenation of a ketone. Cyclohexanone is symmetrical, so bromination occurs at one of the alpha-carbons (the carbons next to the C=O group).\n        *   Product 1 is **2-bromocyclohexanone**.\n\n    *   **Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) + NaOH (heat) → Product 2.**\n        *   This involves an α-halo ketone and a base. There are two main possibilities: E2 elimination or a Favorskii rearrangement.\n        *   *Path A (Elimination):* The base could remove the other alpha-proton (at C6) to form an enone (cyclohex-2-en-1-one). If we follow this path, the final product is 1,3-cyclohexadiene, which has 4 types of distinct hydrogens (this is not an option).\n        *   *Path B (Favorskii Rearrangement):* This is a very common reaction for α-halo ketones that have a proton on the other α-carbon. The base (OH⁻) removes the proton at C6. The resulting enolate attacks the carbon bearing the bromine in an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, forming a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate. The nucleophilic base (OH⁻) then attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the three-membered ring opens to form the most stable carbanion, resulting in ring contraction. The six-membered ring becomes a five-membered ring.\n        *   The product is a cyclopentane ring with a carboxylate group.\n        *   Product 2 is **sodium cyclopentanecarboxylate**. Given the options, this pathway is the intended one.\n\n    *   **Step 3: Product 2 (sodium cyclopentanecarboxylate) + Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) + Pyridine → Product 3.**\n        *   Thionyl chloride is a standard reagent for converting carboxylic acids (or their salts) into acid chlorides. Pyridine is used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n        *   Product 3 is **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n\n    *   **Step 4: Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(OtBu)₃H) → Product 4.**\n        *   LiAl(OtBu)₃H is a bulky, mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes without over-reducing them to alcohols.\n        *   Product 4 is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Final Product's Structure:**\n    *   The final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. Its structure is a five-membered cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n    *   Now, I need to count the \"chemically distinct\" hydrogen atoms. This means finding all hydrogens that are in a unique chemical environment. We can use symmetry to help.\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (C-H-O) and the carbon of the ring it's attached to (C1). This plane bisects the ring through the C3-C4 bond.\n    *   Let's count the unique proton environments:\n        1.  **The aldehyde proton (H-C=O):** This is in a unique environment. (1 type)\n        2.  **The proton on C1:** This is the single proton on the carbon connecting the ring to the aldehyde. It's also unique. (1 type)\n        3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** These are the carbons adjacent to C1. Due to the plane of symmetry, C2 is equivalent to C5. However, on each of these carbons, there are two protons. Since C1 is a stereocenter, the two protons on C2 (and C5) are diastereotopic, meaning they are not equivalent to each other. So, we have one set of \"cis\" protons (on C2 and C5) and one set of \"trans\" protons (on C2 and C5). This gives 2 more types of hydrogens.\n        4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** These are the remaining two carbons. They are also equivalent by symmetry. Like C2/C5, the two protons on each of these carbons are diastereotopic. This gives another 2 types of hydrogens.\n    *   **Total Count:** 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n4.  **Final Check:** The calculated number is 6. This matches option D. The logic is sound and follows standard organic chemistry principles. I am ready to write the code.

The base removes the other α-proton (from C6), and the resulting enolate attacks the carbon with the bromine (C2), forming a strained bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one (a cyclopropanone intermediate). The hydroxide then attacks the carbonyl, and the ring opens to form the most stable carbanion, which results in a ring contraction. The six-membered ring becomes a five-membered ring. After protonation (implicit in the workup), Product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 to Product 3.** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine. This is a standard reaction to convert a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Product 3 is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 to Product 4.** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃). This is a bulky, mild reducing agent that selectively reduces acid chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reaction at the aldehyde stage. Therefore, Product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n5.  **Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogens in Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde).** To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we analyze the symmetry of the molecule. At room temperature, the flexible cyclopentane ring undergoes rapid conformational changes (pseudorotation). This creates a time-averaged plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (-CHO) and the carbon it is attached to (C1).\n\n    *   This plane of symmetry makes C2 equivalent to C5, and C3 equivalent to C4.\n    *   Let's count the unique proton environments:\n        1.  The **aldehyde proton** is unique. (1 type)\n        2.  The **proton on C1** (the carbon attached to the aldehyde) is unique. (1 type)\n        3.  The protons on **C2 and C5** are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, on each of these carbons, the two protons are diastereotopic (one is cis to the aldehyde group, the other is trans). This results in two sets of equivalent protons for these four positions. (2 types)\n        4.  Similarly, the protons on **C3 and C4** are equivalent. The four protons on these two carbons also give rise to two distinct signals. (2 types)\n\n    *   Total number of distinct hydrogen atoms = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine**\nThis reaction is the α-bromination of a ketone. A bromine atom is added to the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide**\nWhen an α-halo ketone with available protons on the other side of the carbonyl is treated with a strong base like sodium hydroxide, it can undergo a Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the formation of a bicyclic intermediate (a cyclopropanone) which then opens up to form a ring-contracted carboxylic acid (after protonation). In this case, the six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to a five-membered ring.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine**\nThis is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl).\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O*t*-Bu)₃) is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce reactive acyl chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reaction at the aldehyde stage without further reduction to an alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n**Determining the Number of Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe structure is a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\n1.  **Aldehyde Proton:** The single proton of the aldehyde group (-CHO) is in a unique chemical environment. This is **one** type of hydrogen.\n2.  **Alpha-Proton:** The proton on the carbon atom of the ring to which the aldehyde group is attached (C1) is also unique. This is a **second** type of hydrogen.\n3.  **Beta-Protons:** The two carbon atoms adjacent to C1 (C2 and C5) are equivalent due to a plane of symmetry that bisects the molecule. However, the two protons on C2 are not equivalent to each other; they are diastereotopic because of the chiral center at C1. One proton is *cis* to the aldehyde group, and the other is *trans*. The same applies to the protons on C5. The *cis* proton on C2 is equivalent to the *cis* proton on C5, and the *trans* proton on C2 is equivalent to the *trans* proton on C5. This gives **two** more distinct types of hydrogens.\n4.  **Gamma-Protons:** The remaining two carbons (C3 and C4) are also equivalent due to the same plane of symmetry. Like the beta-protons, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic, as are the two on C4. This results in **two** additional distinct types of hydrogens.\n\nCounting them up:\n*   1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (alpha H) + 2 (beta H's) + 2 (gamma H's) = **6**\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions and the final determination of the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product.\n\n### Reaction Analysis\n\n*   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\n    This reaction is the α-halogenation of a ketone. One of the hydrogen atoms on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group is replaced by a bromine atom. This results in the formation of **2-bromocyclohexanone (Product 1)**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n    When an α-halo ketone, such as 2-bromocyclohexanone, is heated with a strong base like NaOH, it undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the formation of a cyclopropanone intermediate, which then opens up to form a ring-contracted carboxylic acid. In this case, the six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to a five-membered ring, yielding **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Product 2)**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n    This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the cyclopentanecarboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom, forming **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3)**. Pyridine is used to neutralize the HCl gas produced during the reaction.\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃)**\n    Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild reducing agent specifically used to reduce highly reactive acid chlorides to aldehydes, without further reduction to an alcohol. Therefore, it reduces cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride to **cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde (Product 4)**.\n\n### Analysis of Product 4\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde**. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to examine the molecule's structure and symmetry.\n\nThe structure of cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde (C₅H₉CHO) consists of a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO). The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group and the C-H bond of the carbon it's attached to (C1), bisecting the cyclopentane ring.\n\nDue to this plane of symmetry:\n*   The carbons C2 and C5 are equivalent.\n*   The carbons C3 and C4 are equivalent.\n\nNow let's count the sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms (protons that are in different electronic environments and would show separate signals in an NMR spectrum):\n\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton is unique.\n2.  **The proton on C1:** This proton is on the carbon attached to the aldehyde group. It lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique.\n3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** The two protons on C2 are not equivalent to each other; they are diastereotopic. One is *cis* to the aldehyde group and the other is *trans*. The same applies to C5. Because of the plane of symmetry, the two *cis* protons (one on C2, one on C5) are chemically equivalent to each other.\n4.  **Protons on C2 and C5 (continued):** Likewise, the two *trans* protons (one on C2, one on C5) are equivalent to each other, but they are in a different chemical environment than the *cis* protons. This gives a fourth distinct set of hydrogens.\n5.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** Similar to the C2/C5 positions, the protons on C3 and C4 are diastereotopic. The two *cis* protons (one on C3, one on C4) are equivalent to each other.\n6.  **Protons on C3 and C4 (continued):** The two *trans* protons (one on C3, one on C4) form the sixth and final set of chemically distinct hydrogens.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 6 chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nThe chemical synthesis proceeds through the following steps:\n\n1.  **Cyclohexanone treated with bromine:** This is an alpha-halogenation of a ketone, which forms 2-bromocyclohexanone (Product 1).\n2.  **Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone, an α-halo ketone, undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement in the presence of a strong base like NaOH. This reaction involves a ring contraction, yielding cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Product 2).\n3.  **Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid reacts with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) to form cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3). This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid to an acid chloride.\n4.  **Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃) is a mild reducing agent specifically used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes. Therefore, it reduces cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride to cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde (Product 4).\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde**. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's structure and symmetry.\n\nThe structure of cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde is a cyclopentane ring with a -CHO (aldehyde) group attached. The carbon atom of the ring that is attached to the aldehyde group (C1) is a chiral center. It is bonded to four different groups: the aldehyde group, a hydrogen atom, and two different paths around the ring (C2 and C5).\n\nBecause the molecule contains a chiral center, it lacks any plane of symmetry. In a molecule with no symmetry, all hydrogens that cannot be interchanged by bond rotation or rapid conformational changes are chemically distinct. Let's count them:\n\n*   **The aldehyde hydrogen (H-C=O):** This hydrogen is in a unique chemical environment. (1)\n*   **The hydrogen on C1:** This methine hydrogen is attached to the chiral center and is unique. (1)\n*   **The hydrogens on C2 and C5 (alpha-protons):** The two hydrogens on C2 are diastereotopic because of the adjacent chiral center. Similarly, the two hydrogens on C5 are diastereotopic. Furthermore, the C2 position and the C5 position are diastereotopic to each other. Thus, all four of these alpha-protons are chemically distinct. (4)\n*   **The hydrogens on C3 and C4 (beta-protons):** Due to the chirality at C1, the protons on C3 are also in a different chemical environment than those on C4. It is often assumed in introductory problems that the effect of a distant chiral center might become negligible, causing accidental equivalence. If we assume the four beta-protons become accidentally equivalent due to their distance from the chiral center, they would produce a single signal. (1)\n\nFollowing this reasoning, the total number of chemically distinct sets of hydrogens is 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1-H) + 4 (alpha-protons) + 1 (beta-protons) = 7.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of product 4 and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine (Br2) to form product 1.**\nThis reaction is the alpha-bromination of a ketone. In this process, one of the hydrogen atoms on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-carbon) is replaced by a bromine atom. Cyclohexanone is symmetrical, so bromination at either α-carbon (C2 or C6) yields the same product.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to form product 2.**\nProduct 1, an α-halo ketone, is treated with a strong base. There are two main possible reactions:\n1.  **Elimination:** The base removes a proton from the other α-carbon (C6), which is acidic, leading to an E2 elimination. This would form cyclohex-2-enone, an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n2.  **Favorskii Rearrangement:** This is a characteristic reaction of α-halo ketones with a base. The base removes a proton from the α-carbon that does not bear the halogen (C6). The resulting enolate undergoes an intramolecular S_N2 reaction, displacing the bromide to form a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one). The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to the opening of the strained cyclopropane ring. This rearrangement results in a ring contraction. The product, after protonation during workup, is a carboxylic acid with one fewer carbon in the ring.\n*   Starting with 2-bromocyclohexanone (a 6-membered ring), the Favorskii rearrangement yields **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid** (a 5-membered ring).\n\nGiven the context of multi-step synthesis problems, the Favorskii rearrangement is a more likely and specific reaction pathway than a simple elimination. As we will see, this pathway leads to one of the given answer choices.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine to form product 3.**\nThis is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl).\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)3) to form product 4.**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky and mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to alcohols.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Final Step: Determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4.**\nProduct 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. Its structure consists of a five-membered cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\nTo find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to analyze the molecule's symmetry. Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde has a plane of symmetry (C_s) that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO), the carbon it's attached to (C1), and the hydrogen atom on C1. This plane bisects the cyclopentane ring.\n\nLet's count the sets of equivalent protons based on this symmetry:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (H-C=O):** This proton is unique and lies on the plane of symmetry. This is one set.\n2.  **The proton on C1 (the carbon bearing the aldehyde group):** This proton is also unique and lies on the plane of symmetry. This is the second set.\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** These two carbons are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons on C2 are diastereotopic (they are in different chemical environments relative to the rest of the molecule). Let's call them H_A and H_B. Similarly, the protons on C5 are diastereotopic. By symmetry, H_A on C2 is equivalent to its counterpart on C5, and H_B on C2 is equivalent to its counterpart on C5. This gives us two more sets of distinct protons.\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** These two carbons are also equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. Similar to the C2/C5 case, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic, and they are different from the protons on C2/C5 because they are further from the aldehyde group. This gives us another two sets of distinct protons.\n\nIn summary, the distinct sets of hydrogen atoms are:\n*   Set 1: The single aldehyde proton (1H).\n*   Set 2: The single proton on C1 (1H).\n*   Set 3: Two protons, one on C2 and one on C5 (2H total).\n*   Set 4: Two protons, one on C2 and one on C5 (2H total).\n*   Set 5: Two protons, one on C3 and one on C4 (2H total).\n*   Set 6: Two protons, one on C3 and one on C4 (2H total).\n\nTherefore, there are a total of **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and count its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Br2 → Product 1**\nThis reaction is the alpha-bromination of a ketone. Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine (Br2) to replace one of the alpha-hydrogens with a bromine atom. Both alpha-positions are equivalent.\n*   **Product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone.**\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 + NaOH (heated) → Product 2**\nProduct 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) is an α-halo ketone. When treated with a strong base like sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and heated, it undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the formation of a cyclopropanone intermediate followed by ring-opening, resulting in a ring contraction.\n1.  The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) abstracts a proton from the other α-carbon (C6) to form an enolate.\n2.  The enolate undergoes an intramolecular S_N2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion to form a bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one intermediate.\n3.  The hydroxide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon of the strained cyclopropanone ring.\n4.  The intermediate collapses, and the ring opens to form a more stable carbanion, leading to the formation of a cyclopentanecarboxylate salt.\n5.  Upon acidic workup (implied), this gives the corresponding carboxylic acid.\n*   **Product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.**\nAn alternative elimination reaction to form cyclohex-2-en-1-one is less likely as the subsequent reaction with SOCl₂ strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid or alcohol, and the Favorskii rearrangement is a classic reaction for this type of substrate and conditions.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 + SOCl2, pyridine → Product 3**\nProduct 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine. This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride.\n*   R-COOH + SOCl₂ → R-COCl + SO₂ + HCl\n*   **Product 3 is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.**\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride → Product 4**\nProduct 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃). This is a sterically hindered and mild reducing agent. It is known for its selectivity in reducing acyl chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reduction at the aldehyde stage without proceeding to the primary alcohol (which would happen with a stronger reducing agent like LiAlH₄).\n*   R-COCl + LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃ → R-CHO\n*   **Product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.**\n\n**Step 5: Counting the chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in Product 4**\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe structure is a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\n```\n      H(a)\n      |\n      C=O\n      |\nH(b)-C(1)----C(2)-H(c,d)\n    |        |\nH(i,j)-C(5)----C(3)-H(e,f)\n      \\      /\n       C(4)\n       |\n      H(g,h)\n```\n\nAlthough the cyclopentane ring is not planar, it undergoes rapid conformational changes (pseudorotation) at room temperature. On the NMR timescale, the molecule behaves as if it has a plane of symmetry (a C_s plane). This plane passes through the aldehyde group (CHO), the carbon it's attached to (C1), and the hydrogen on C1 (H(b)). This plane bisects the C3-C4 bond.\n\nDue to this plane of symmetry:\n*   Carbon C2 is equivalent to Carbon C5.\n*   Carbon C3 is equivalent to Carbon C4.\n\nNow let's count the distinct types of hydrogen atoms:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (H(a))**: This proton is unique in its chemical environment. (1 signal)\n2.  **The proton on C1 (H(b))**: This proton is also unique, being the only one on this methine carbon. (1 signal)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5**: Let's consider the two protons on C2. They are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation and are in different spatial relationships to the rest of the molecule (e.g., one is 'cis' and one is 'trans' to the aldehyde group in the average structure). Thus, they are diastereotopic and chemically distinct. Because C2 and C5 are equivalent by symmetry, the 'cis' proton on C2 is equivalent to the 'cis' proton on C5, and the 'trans' proton on C2 is equivalent to the 'trans' proton on C5. Therefore, these four protons give rise to two distinct signals. (2 signals)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4**: Similarly, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. By symmetry, they are equivalent to their respective counterparts on C4. Therefore, these four protons also give rise to two distinct signals. (2 signals)\n\nTotal number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\nThese 6 distinct types of hydrogens correspond to 6 signals in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) 8 - This would be the answer if the product was cyclopentylmethanol.\nB) 7 - An unlikely number based on the molecule's symmetry.\nC) 10 - This is the total number of hydrogen atoms in the molecule, not the number of distinct types.\nD) 6 - This matches our analysis.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning for the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1**\nThis reaction is the α-bromination of a ketone. A hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon) is substituted with a bromine atom.

When an α-halo ketone with an available proton on the other α-carbon is treated with a strong base (like NaOH), it undergoes a ring contraction. The six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to form a five-membered ring derivative. After an acidic workup (which is implied in such sequences), the product is a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.**\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) + Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) / Pyridine → Product 3**\nThis is a standard method to convert a carboxylic acid into a more reactive acid chloride.

It is specifically used to selectively reduce highly reactive acid chlorides to aldehydes. It is not powerful enough to reduce the aldehyde further to an alcohol.\n*   **Product 4 is cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde.**\n\n**Analysis of Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde) for Chemically Distinct Hydrogens**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of sets of chemically non-equivalent hydrogen atoms in the final product. We do this by examining the molecule's symmetry.\n\n1.  **Structure:** Cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde has a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n2.  **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that runs through the aldehyde group (H-C=O), the C-C bond connecting the ring to the aldehyde, and bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n3.  **Counting Distinct Hydrogens:**\n    *   **The aldehyde hydrogen (-CHO):** This hydrogen is in a unique chemical environment. It lies on the plane of symmetry. This is **one** type.\n    *   **The hydrogen on C1:** The hydrogen on the ring carbon (C1) that is bonded to the aldehyde group is also unique and lies on the plane of symmetry. This is a **second** type.\n    *   **The hydrogens on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. However, the two hydrogens on C2 are diastereotopic (they are not equivalent to each other because C1 is a stereocenter). The same applies to C5. Therefore, the two \"upper\" hydrogens (on C2 and C5) form one equivalent set, and the two \"lower\" hydrogens form another equivalent set. This gives **two** more types of hydrogens.\n    *   **The hydrogens on C3 and C4:** Similarly, C3 and C4 are equivalent by symmetry. The two hydrogens on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This gives another **two** types of hydrogens.\n\n**Total Count:**\nSumming up the distinct types: 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (on C1) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the final product and determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclohexanone (a ketone) and Bromine (Br₂).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the α-bromination of a ketone. The bromine atom substitutes a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon). Cyclohexanone is symmetrical, so the two α-carbons (C2 and C6) are equivalent.\n*   **Product 1:** The product is 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 2-bromocyclohexanone (an α-halo ketone) and sodium hydroxide (a strong base), with heat.\n*   **Reaction:** When an α-halo ketone with available protons on the other α'-carbon is treated with a strong base, a Favorskii rearrangement is a very common outcome.\n    1.  The base (OH⁻) removes a proton from the α'-carbon (C6), forming an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate attacks the carbon bearing the bromine (C2) in an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion and forming a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one).\n    3.  The hydroxide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon of the strained cyclopropanone.\n    4.  The three-membered ring opens to relieve ring strain, leading to the formation of a more stable carbanion. This results in the contraction of the six-membered ring into a five-membered ring.\n    5.  Protonation of the resulting carboxylate yields a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Product 2:** The product is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n    *   *Alternative consideration:* An elimination reaction (E2) could also occur to form cyclohex-2-en-1-one. However, the subsequent reaction steps are characteristic for a carboxylic acid, making the Favorskii rearrangement the intended pathway.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid and thionyl chloride with pyridine.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard and highly efficient method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) is the chlorinating agent, and pyridine is a base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** The product is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(OtBu)₃H)**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride and Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride.\n*   **Reaction:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky, mild reducing agent specifically used for the selective reduction of acid chlorides to aldehydes. It is less reactive than LiAlH₄ and stops the reduction at the aldehyde stage without proceeding to the alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** The product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclopentane ring is attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (C=O and its H), the C1 carbon of the ring (the one attached to the aldehyde), and the H attached to C1. This plane bisects the C3-C4 bond of the ring.\n\nLet's count the unique hydrogen environments based on this symmetry:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n2.  **The proton on C1:** This proton is on the plane of symmetry and is unique. (1 type)\n3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** Due to the plane of symmetry, C2 and C5 are equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 (and C5) are not equivalent to each other. They are diastereotopic because one is \"cis\" and one is \"trans\" relative to the aldehyde group on the adjacent carbon. Therefore, the four protons on C2 and C5 constitute two distinct sets. (2 types)\n4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** Due to the plane of symmetry, C3 and C4 are equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 case, the two protons on C3 (and C4) are diastereotopic. Therefore, the four protons on C3 and C4 constitute two distinct sets. (2 types)\n\n**Total Count:**\n*   Aldehyde H: 1 type\n*   C1 H: 1 type\n*   C2/C5 Protons: 2 types\n*   C3/C4 Protons: 2 types\n*   Total = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe final answer is 6.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nThe synthesis of product 4 proceeds through the following four steps:\n\n*   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2)**\n    This reaction is the alpha-bromination of a ketone, which results in the formation of 2-bromocyclohexanone (product 1).\n\n*   **Step 2: 2-bromocyclohexanone heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n    When an α-halo ketone with available protons on the other side of the carbonyl group is treated with a strong base like NaOH, it undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves a ring contraction. In this case, 2-bromocyclohexanone rearranges to form cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (product 2).\n\n*   **Step 3: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine**\n    This is a standard procedure to convert a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Thionyl chloride is the chlorinating agent, and pyridine is used as a base. The product is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (product 3).\n\n*   **Step 4: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(OtBu)3H)**\n    Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky and mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce highly reactive acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to an alcohol. Therefore, cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride is reduced to cyclopentanecarbaldehyde (product 4).\n\n**Analysis of Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)**\n\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde (C5H9CHO) features a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO). The carbon atom of the ring bonded to the aldehyde group (C1) is a chiral center. This is because it is attached to four different groups:\n1.  A hydrogen atom\n2.  An aldehyde group (-CHO)\n3.  The C2-C3-C4 portion of the ring\n4.  The C5-C4-C3 portion of the ring\n\nThe presence of this single chiral center makes the entire molecule chiral and removes all elements of symmetry (like planes or axes of symmetry). In a molecule with no symmetry, all protons that cannot be interconverted by bond rotation or a symmetry operation are chemically distinct.\n\nLet's count the hydrogen atoms based on their unique chemical environments:\n*   **Aldehyde proton:** The single proton of the -CHO group is unique. (1 H)\n*   **Methine proton:** The proton on C1 (the chiral center) is in a unique environment. (1 H)\n*   **Ring protons:**\n    *   The two protons on C2 are adjacent to the chiral center, making them diastereotopic and thus chemically different from each other.\n    *   Similarly, the two protons on C5 are diastereotopic and non-equivalent. Because there is no symmetry to interconvert C2 and C5, the C2 protons are also different from the C5 protons.\n    *   The same logic applies to the protons on C3 and C4. The two protons on C3 are diastereotopic, as are the two on C4. C3 is adjacent to the non-equivalent C2, and C4 is adjacent to the non-equivalent C5, making the protons on C3 and C4 distinct from each other.\n\nCounting all the non-equivalent protons:\n*   1 aldehyde proton\n*   1 proton on C1\n*   2 distinct protons on C2\n*   2 distinct protons on C3\n*   2 distinct protons on C4\n*   2 distinct protons on C5\n\nTotal = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\n\nThis reaction is an alpha-halogenation of a ketone. In this process, a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an alpha-hydrogen) is replaced by a bromine atom. This results in the formation of **2-bromocyclohexanone (Product 1)**.\n\n**Step 2: 2-bromocyclohexanone heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n\nWhen an α-halo ketone with an available proton on its other α-carbon is treated with a strong base like NaOH, it undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement. This is a well-documented reaction that involves a ring contraction. The six-membered cyclohexanone ring contracts to form a five-membered ring derivative. The product is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Product 2)**.\n\n**Step 3: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n\nThis is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. The hydroxyl (-OH) group of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom. Pyridine is often used to neutralize the HCl byproduct. The resulting molecule is **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3)**.\n\n**Step 4: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(OtBu)₃H)**\n\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky, mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce reactive acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to an alcohol. Therefore, it reduces cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride to **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde (Product 4)**.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nTo determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde, we must examine its structure and symmetry.\n\nThe molecule consists of a five-membered cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO). There is a plane of symmetry that runs through the aldehyde group, the carbon it's attached to (C1), and the hydrogen on C1, bisecting the ring.\n\nDue to this symmetry:\n*   The **aldehyde hydrogen** is unique. (1 set)\n*   The **hydrogen on C1** (the carbon attached to the aldehyde) is unique. (2nd set)\n*   The carbons C2 and C5 are equivalent. However, the two hydrogens on C2 are diastereotopic (not equivalent) because of their spatial relationship to the rest of the molecule. The same is true for C5. By symmetry, the two \"upper\" hydrogens on C2 and C5 are equivalent to each other, and the two \"lower\" hydrogens are equivalent to each other. This gives two more sets of hydrogens. (3rd and 4th sets)\n*   The carbons C3 and C4 are equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 positions, the geminal hydrogens on C3 (and C4) are diastereotopic. The two \"upper\" hydrogens on C3 and C4 are equivalent, and the two \"lower\" hydrogens are equivalent. This provides the final two sets. (5th and 6th sets)\n\nCounting these sets, we have a total of **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\nThis reaction is the alpha-bromination of a ketone, which results in the substitution of a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group with a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\nWhen an α-halo ketone, such as 2-bromocyclohexanone, is treated with a strong base like NaOH, it undergoes a reaction known as the Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the formation of a bicyclic intermediate which then rearranges to form a ring-contracted carboxylic acid (after an acidic workup, which is implicit in such sequences). Therefore, the six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to a five-membered ring.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\nThis is a standard method to convert a carboxylic acid into a more reactive acid chloride. The thionyl chloride replaces the hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid with a chlorine atom.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃)**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce reactive acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to an alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n**Determining the Number of Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to analyze the molecule's structure and symmetry. Chemically distinct hydrogens will appear as separate signals in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nThe structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde is a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO). Due to the molecule's structure and the rapid conformational changes of the ring, we can identify the following sets of unique protons:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (1H):** This proton is attached to the carbonyl carbon and is in a unique chemical environment.\n2.  **The proton on C1 of the ring (1H):** This is the single hydrogen on the carbon atom to which the aldehyde group is attached. It is also in a unique environment.\n3.  **The alpha-protons (4H):** These are the four hydrogens on the two carbons adjacent to C1 (C2 and C5). Due to molecular symmetry, the two protons on C2 are equivalent to the two on C5. However, on each of these carbons, the two protons themselves are not equivalent (they are diastereotopic). This results in two distinct sets of protons.\n4.  **The beta-protons (4H):** These are the four hydrogens on the carbons further from the aldehyde group (C3 and C4). Similar to the alpha-protons, the protons on C3 are equivalent to those on C4. Within each of these CH₂ groups, the two protons are diastereotopic, creating two more distinct sets of protons.\n\nCounting these sets gives us the total number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms:\n*   1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (alpha-protons sets) + 2 (beta-protons sets) = **6**\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nThis problem requires us to follow a four-step reaction sequence and then determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product by analyzing its symmetry.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1**\nThis is the acid-catalyzed (often by trace HBr) alpha-halogenation of a ketone. Cyclohexanone is a symmetrical ketone, so bromination occurs at one of the equivalent alpha-carbons (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-Bromocyclohexanone) + NaOH/heat → Product 2**\nThis is a reaction of an α-halo ketone with a strong base (NaOH). The conditions are classic for a **Favorskii rearrangement**.\nIn this reaction, the base abstracts a proton from the other α-carbon (C6). The resulting enolate performs an intramolecular S_N2 reaction, displacing the bromide and forming a strained bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one). The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of this intermediate. The subsequent ring-opening of the cyclopropanone ring results in a ring contraction. The most stable product is formed, which is a cyclopentane ring with a carboxylic acid group (after neutralization/workup).\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*(Note: An E2 elimination to form cyclohex-2-en-1-one is also possible, but it does not react in a standard way with thionyl chloride in the next step. The Favorskii rearrangement is the most plausible pathway given the entire sequence.)*\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) + Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) / Pyridine → Product 3**\nThis is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Thionyl chloride is the chlorinating agent, and pyridine is a base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(OtBu)₃H) → Product 4**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a sterically hindered and mild reducing agent. Its most common and specific use in organic synthesis is the reduction of acid chlorides to aldehydes. It is not strong enough to reduce the aldehyde further to an alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nNow we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. We do this by analyzing the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe structure is a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO). Due to rapid conformational flipping (pseudorotation) at room temperature, the molecule has an effective plane of symmetry. This plane passes through the aldehyde group (CHO), the carbon of the ring it's attached to (C1), the hydrogen on C1, and it bisects the rest of the ring.\n\nLet's label the protons and identify the unique sets:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (CHO):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. (1 set)\n2.  **The proton on C1:** This is the only proton directly attached to the ring at the point of substitution (a methine proton). It is unique. (1 set)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. Each of these carbons has two protons. The two protons on C2 are diastereotopic (one is cis and one is trans to the aldehyde group, in a simplified view). They are not equivalent to each other. The same applies to C5. The cis-proton on C2 is equivalent to the cis-proton on C5, and the trans-proton on C2 is equivalent to the trans-proton on C5. Therefore, these four protons form two distinct sets. (2 sets)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** The plane of symmetry also makes C3 and C4 equivalent. Like C2/C5, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic, as are the two on C4. These four protons also form two distinct sets. These sets are different from the C2/C5 protons because they are further from the electron-withdrawing aldehyde group.

The product (1) is 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide.** When 2-bromocyclohexanone is treated with a strong base like sodium hydroxide, it undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the contraction of the six-membered ring to a five-membered ring, forming cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (after neutralization). Therefore, product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine.** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid reacts with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) to form an acyl chloride. This is a standard method for this conversion. The resulting product (3) is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride.** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride is an acid chloride. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O*t*-Bu)₃) is a mild reducing agent that selectively reduces acid chlorides to aldehydes. It is not strong enough to reduce the aldehyde further to an alcohol. Thus, the final product (4) is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n### Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's structure and symmetry. Chemically distinct hydrogens are those in different electronic environments, which give rise to separate signals in an ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nThe structure is a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\n1.  **The Aldehyde Proton:** The hydrogen atom of the aldehyde group (H-C=O) is in a unique chemical environment. This accounts for **one** type of hydrogen.\n2.  **The Ring Protons:** The carbon atom on the ring attached to the aldehyde group (C1) is a chiral center (it is attached to four different groups: the CHO group, an H atom, C2, and C5 of the ring). The presence of this chiral center means the molecule is asymmetric. In an achiral environment, all the other carbons in the ring (C2, C3, C4, C5) are chemically non-equivalent.\n    *   **Proton on C1:** The single hydrogen attached to C1 is unique. This is a **second** type of hydrogen.\n    *   **Protons on C2, C3, C4, and C5:** Since C1 is a stereocenter, the two protons on each of the adjacent methylene (CH₂) groups (C2 and C5) are diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically distinct from each other. Similarly, the protons on C3 and C4 are also diastereotopic. Because the entire ring is rendered asymmetric by the C1 stereocenter, none of the methylene groups are equivalent to each other.\n        *   Protons on C2: 2 distinct hydrogens.\n        *   Protons on C3: 2 distinct hydrogens.\n        *   Protons on C4: 2 distinct hydrogens.\n        *   Protons on C5: 2 distinct hydrogens.\n\nSumming these up:\n*   Aldehyde H: 1\n*   C1-H: 1\n*   C2-H₂: 2\n*   C3-H₂: 2\n*   C4-H₂: 2\n*   C5-H₂: 2\n\nTotal number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nTo determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4, we must first identify the structure of product 4 by following the reaction sequence.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Step 1: Cyclohexanone to Product 1.** Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine (Br₂) in an alpha-halogenation reaction. One hydrogen on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an alpha-carbon) is replaced by a bromine atom. This yields **2-bromocyclohexanone**.\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 to Product 2.** 2-bromocyclohexanone is heated with a strong base, sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This condition promotes a Favorskii rearrangement. The base removes the other alpha-proton, forming an enolate which then undergoes an intramolecular cyclization to form a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate. This strained intermediate is then attacked by hydroxide, leading to ring-opening and the formation of a carboxylate salt. After workup, the product is a cyclopentane ring with a carboxylic acid group. So, Product 2 is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 to Product 3.** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine. This is a standard method to convert a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. Product 3 is **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 to Product 4.** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃). This is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent that selectively reduces acyl chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the alcohol. Therefore, Product 4 is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n5.  **Final Analysis:** Now we must count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (-CHO) and the C1 carbon it's attached to.\n    *   **Hydrogen 1:** The aldehyde proton (-C**H**O) is in a unique chemical environment.\n    *   **Hydrogen 2:** The proton on C1 (the carbon attached to the aldehyde) is also unique as it lies on the plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Hydrogens 3 & 4:** The carbons C2 and C5 are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, because C1 is a stereocenter, the two hydrogens on C2 are diastereotopic (chemically non-equivalent). The same applies to C5. The \"cis\" protons on C2 and C5 are equivalent to each other, and the \"trans\" protons on C2 and C5 are equivalent to each other. This gives two more distinct sets of hydrogens.\n    *   **Hydrogens 5 & 6:** Similarly, carbons C3 and C4 are equivalent. The two hydrogens on C3 are also diastereotopic. The \"cis\" protons on C3 and C4 are equivalent, and the \"trans\" protons on C3 and C4 are equivalent. This gives another two distinct sets of hydrogens.\n    *   **Total Count:** 1 (aldehyde-H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (C2/C5-H sets) + 2 (C3/C4-H sets) = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in a final product\n# of a multi-step organic synthesis.\n\n# Step 1: Determine the structure of the final product, Product 4.\n# Reaction 1: Cyclohexanone + Br2 -> Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone)\n# Reaction 2: Product 1 + NaOH, heat -> Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid via Favorskii rearrangement)\n# Reaction 3: Product 2 + SOCl2 -> Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride)\n# Reaction 4: Product 3 + LiAlH(O-t-Bu)3 -> Product 4 (cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)\nfinal_product = \"cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\"\n\n# Step 2: Analyze the structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde to count chemically distinct hydrogens.\n# The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C1-CHO bond.\n# We count the unique hydrogen environments (sets of hydrogens that are not interchangeable by symmetry).\n\n# H on the aldehyde group (-CHO): This is one unique environment.\naldehyde_h = 1\n\n# H on the carbon attached to the aldehyde group (C1): This H lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique.\nc1_h = 1\n\n# H's on the carbons adjacent to C1 (C2 and C5).\n# C2 and C5 are equivalent by symmetry.\n# The two H's on C2 are diastereotopic because C1 is a stereocenter.

The enolate undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, where the carbanion attacks the carbon bearing the bromine, displacing the bromide ion and forming a strained bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one).\n        3.  The hydroxide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon of the cyclopropanone.\n        4.  The ring opens to relieve strain, typically breaking the bond that leads to a more stable carbanion. This results in the formation of a five-membered ring (cyclopentane) with a carboxylate group.\n*   **Product 2:** After an acidic workup (which is implied to neutralize the base and protonate the carboxylate), the product is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 was treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine, forming 3.**\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Product 2), thionyl chloride (SOCl₂), and pyridine.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride (or acid chloride).

The product is **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 was treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, forming product 4.**\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3) and Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a selective reduction. LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃ is a bulky and mild reducing agent. It is known to reduce reactive functional groups like acyl chlorides to aldehydes and stop at that stage, without further reduction to an alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** The acyl chloride is reduced to an aldehyde.

(1 type)\n    3.  **C2 and C5 Protons:** Due to the plane of symmetry, C2 is equivalent to C5. However, on each of these carbons, there are two geminal protons. These two protons are **diastereotopic**. They are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation and have different spatial relationships to the rest of the molecule (e.g., one is cis-like, the other trans-like to the bulky aldehyde group). Therefore, they are chemically distinct and would give separate NMR signals. Since C2 and C5 are equivalent, the four protons at these two positions account for **two** distinct types of hydrogen.\n    4.  **C3 and C4 Protons:** Similarly, C3 is equivalent to C4 by symmetry. The two geminal protons on C3 are diastereotopic to each other. The same applies to C4. Thus, the four protons at the C3 and C4 positions also account for **two** distinct types of hydrogen.\n\n*   **Total Count:**\n    *   Aldehyde H: 1 type\n    *   C1-H: 1 type\n    *   C2/C5 Protons: 2 types\n    *   C3/C4 Protons: 2 types\n    *   Total distinct hydrogen types = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in the final product, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the reaction sequence**\n\nThe problem describes a four-step synthesis starting from cyclohexanone. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product (Product 4), we must first determine the structure of Product 4 by identifying the product of each reaction step.\n\n*   **Step 1: cyclohexanone + bromine (Br₂) → Product 1**\n    *   This reaction is the alpha-bromination of a ketone. In this reaction, a bromine atom replaces a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon).\n    *   Cyclohexanone is symmetric, so bromination at either α-carbon (C2 or C6) yields the same product.\n    *   **Product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone.**\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) + sodium hydroxide (NaOH), heat → Product 2**\n    *   This step involves an α-halo ketone with a strong base (NaOH). There are two primary competing reaction pathways:\n        1.  **E2 Elimination:** The base abstracts a proton from the carbon beta to the bromine (C3) to form an α,β-unsaturated ketone, which would be cyclohex-2-enone.\n        2.  **Favorskii Rearrangement:** The base abstracts a proton from the other α-carbon (C6), which is more acidic. The resulting enolate undergoes an internal nucleophilic attack, displacing the bromide and forming a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate. This intermediate is then attacked by hydroxide and rearranges, leading to a ring contraction. The final product after acidic workup (implicit in this type of reaction) is a carboxylic acid.\n    *   For 2-bromocyclohexanone, the Favorskii rearrangement leads to **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n    *   **Which pathway is more likely?** The subsequent reaction steps provide a strong clue. Step 3 uses SOCl₂ and step 4 uses LiAlH(OtBu)₃. This specific sequence of reagents is classic for the conversion of a carboxylic acid to an aldehyde (Carboxylic Acid → Acyl Chloride → Aldehyde). This strongly suggests that Product 2 is a carboxylic acid, making the Favorskii rearrangement the intended pathway.\n    *   **Product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.**\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) + thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine → Product 3**\n    *   This is a standard conversion of a carboxylic acid to an acyl chloride. Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) replaces the -OH group of the carboxylic acid with a -Cl atom. Pyridine acts as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n    *   **Product 3 is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.**\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃) → Product 4**\n    *   Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky, mild reducing agent. Its most characteristic use is the reduction of acyl chlorides to aldehydes. It is less reactive than LiAlH₄ and will stop at the aldehyde stage without further reduction to the alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.**\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the structure of the final product (Product 4)**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. Its structure consists of a five-membered cyclopentane ring with an aldehyde group (-CHO) attached to one of the carbons.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms**\n\nTo find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to examine the symmetry of the cyclopentanecarbaldehyde molecule.\n\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry. This plane passes through the aldehyde group (H-C=O), the C-C bond connecting the aldehyde to the ring, the hydrogen atom on that ring carbon (C1), and it bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n*   **Consequences of Symmetry:** This symmetry plane makes pairs of atoms and groups equivalent.\n    *   The carbon C1 (attached to CHO) is unique.\n    *   Carbon C2 is equivalent to C5.\n    *   Carbon C3 is equivalent to C4.\n\n*   **Counting Distinct Hydrogens:**\n    1.  **Aldehyde Hydrogen (-CHO):** This hydrogen is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n    2.  **Hydrogen on C1:** The hydrogen atom attached to C1 (the same carbon as the aldehyde group) lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. (1 type)\n    3.  **Hydrogens on C2 and C5:** C2 and C5 are equivalent by symmetry. On any single one of these carbons (e.g., C2), the two hydrogen atoms are diastereotopic because of the chiral center at C1 (C1 is a prochiral center). This means they are not equivalent to each other. Let's call them H2-cis and H2-trans (relative to the aldehyde group). Due to the symmetry plane, H2-cis is equivalent to H5-cis, and H2-trans is equivalent to H5-trans. Therefore, these four hydrogens constitute two distinct sets. (2 types)\n    4.  **Hydrogens on C3 and C4:** C3 and C4 are equivalent by symmetry. Similar to the C2/C5 case, the two hydrogens on C3 are diastereotopic. This gives rise to two more distinct sets of hydrogens. (2 types)\n\n*   **Total Count:** Summing up the distinct types of hydrogen atoms:\n    *   1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in the final product, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nBased on the established reaction sequence, the final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. The detailed analysis of its structure and the chemical equivalence of its hydrogen atoms leads to the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-step reaction analysis:**\n1.  **Cyclohexanone + Bromine → Product 1 (2-Bromocyclohexanone):** This is the α-bromination of a ketone.\n2.  **Product 1 + NaOH (heated) → Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid):** Heating 2-bromocyclohexanone with a base like sodium hydroxide results in a Favorskii rearrangement, which is a ring-contraction reaction.\n3.  **Product 2 + Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine → Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride):** This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into its more reactive acid chloride derivative.\n4.  **Product 3 + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(OtBu)₃H) → Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde):** This specific, bulky hydride is a mild reducing agent used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the alcohol.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde):**\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\n1.  The hydrogen atom of the aldehyde group (–CHO) is in a unique chemical environment. (1 signal)\n2.  The hydrogen atom on the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde group (C1) is also unique. This carbon is a stereocenter as it is bonded to four different groups (H, CHO, C2 of the ring, and C5 of the ring). (1 signal)\n3.  The presence of this chiral center at C1 means the molecule has no plane of symmetry.\n4.  Consequently, the positions adjacent to the stereocenter, C2 and C5, are not equivalent (they are diastereotopic positions). The two hydrogens on C2 are diastereotopic to each other, giving two signals. The two hydrogens on C5 are also diastereotopic and are not equivalent to the C2 protons, yielding another two distinct signals.\n5.  Similarly, because C2 and C5 are non-equivalent, their neighbors (C3 and C4) are also in non-equivalent positions. The two hydrogens on C3 are diastereotopic (2 signals), and the two hydrogens on C4 are diastereotopic (2 signals).\n\nHowever, a common scenario in NMR spectroscopy is that the chemical shift difference becomes negligible for protons that are further away from the chiral center, due to rapid conformational averaging of the ring. A plausible interpretation, which leads to one of the multiple-choice answers, is as follows:\n\n*   **Aldehyde H:** 1 distinct signal.\n*   **C1-H:** 1 distinct signal.\n*   **C2-H₂ and C5-H₂:** The carbons C2 and C5 are adjacent to the stereocenter and are considered non-equivalent. The geminal protons on each of these carbons are diastereotopic. This results in 2 signals from C2 and 2 signals from C5, for a total of 4 signals from these four protons.\n*   **C3-H₂ and C4-H₂:** These carbons are further from the stereocenter. It is plausible that rapid ring puckering averages their environments, making them chemically equivalent. The four protons on these two carbons would thus give rise to only 2 distinct signals (as the geminal protons remain diastereotopic).\n\nSumming these up gives: 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1) + 2 (C2) + 2 (C5) + 2 (from C3/C4 combined) = 8 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the number of its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine**\nCyclohexanone reacts with bromine (Br₂) in an alpha-halogenation reaction. This places a bromine atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide**\nWhen an α-halo ketone, such as 2-bromocyclohexanone, is treated with a strong base like sodium hydroxide, it undergoes a classic reaction known as the Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the formation of a cyclopropanone intermediate, followed by nucleophilic attack by hydroxide and subsequent ring-opening, which results in a ring contraction. The six-membered cyclohexanone ring is converted into a five-membered cyclopentane ring with a carboxylic acid group.\n\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine**\nThis is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride.

The bulky tert-butoxy groups moderate the reactivity of the hydride reagent.\n\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n**Determining the Number of Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe cyclopentanecarbaldehyde molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO) and the C1 carbon it's attached to, bisecting the ring. This symmetry makes certain pairs of protons chemically equivalent.\n\n1.  **Aldehyde proton:** The single proton of the -CHO group is in a unique chemical environment. (1 distinct type)\n2.  **C1 proton:** The single proton on the carbon to which the aldehyde is attached (C1) is also unique. (1 distinct type)\n3.  **C2 and C5 protons:** The protons on C2 and C5 are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons on C2 itself are not equivalent (they are diastereotopic) because C1 is a stereocenter. This means the proton \"cis\" to the aldehyde group has a different chemical shift from the proton that is \"trans\". This gives two sets of equivalent protons: the two \"cis\" protons on C2/C5 are one type, and the two \"trans\" protons on C2/C5 are another type. (2 distinct types)\n4.  **C3 and C4 protons:** Similarly, the protons on C3 and C4 are equivalent to each other by symmetry. The two protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This results in two more distinct proton types: the two \"cis-like\" protons on C3/C4 and the two \"trans-like\" protons on C3/C4. (2 distinct types)\n\nCounting these up: 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1) + 2 (C2/C5) + 2 (C3/C4) = **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 4 and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone was treated with bromine, forming product 1.**\nThis reaction is the acid-catalyzed α-halogenation of a ketone. Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine (Br₂) to form 2-bromocyclohexanone as product 1.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 was heated with sodium hydroxide, forming product 2.**\nThe reaction of an α-halo ketone, like 2-bromocyclohexanone, with a base such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is known as the Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves a ring contraction. The six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to form a five-membered ring derivative. The product of this rearrangement is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid, which is product 2.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 was treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine, forming product 3.**\nCyclopentanecarboxylic acid (product 2) is a carboxylic acid. Its reaction with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. Therefore, product 3 is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 was treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, forming product 4.**\nProduct 3, cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride, is an acyl chloride. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃) is a mild reducing agent that selectively reduces reactive acyl chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to an alcohol. This means product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: How many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms?**\n\nProduct 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO) and the carbon of the ring it is attached to (C1). This plane bisects the bond between C3 and C4 of the cyclopentane ring.

In the presence of an acid or base catalyst, ketones undergo halogenation at the alpha-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n*   Cyclohexanone has two equivalent alpha-carbons, each with two hydrogen atoms. The reaction will substitute one of these hydrogens with a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone.**\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n\n*   2-bromocyclohexanone is an α-halo ketone. When treated with a strong base like NaOH, it can undergo two possible reactions: elimination or the Favorskii rearrangement.\n    *   **Elimination:** The base removes a proton from the other alpha-carbon (C6), leading to the formation of an α,β-unsaturated ketone, cyclohex-2-en-1-one.\n    *   **Favorskii Rearrangement:** This is a common reaction for α-halo ketones with base. The base abstracts a proton from the alpha-carbon without the halogen (C6), forming an enolate. This enolate then undergoes an intramolecular nucleophilic attack on the carbon bearing the bromine, forming a strained bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate. The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of this intermediate, leading to the opening of the three-membered ring. The more stable carbanion is formed by breaking the bond between the carbonyl carbon and the less substituted carbon of the original ring, resulting in a ring contraction.\n*   The product of the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-bromocyclohexanone is the salt of cyclopentanecarboxylic acid. After workup (which is implied in such problems), this gives the free acid.\n*   **Choosing between elimination and Favorskii:** The subsequent reaction steps are key. The reagents in steps 3 and 4 are standard for converting a carboxylic acid to an aldehyde. This makes the Favorskii rearrangement pathway the most chemically consistent one.\n*   **Product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.**\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine**\n\n*   This is the standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl). Pyridine is used as a base to neutralize the HCl gas produced as a byproduct.\n*   **Product 3 is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.**\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)3)**\n\n*   Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky and mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes. Unlike stronger reagents like LiAlH4, it is not reactive enough to reduce the resulting aldehyde further to an alcohol. This specific reagent choice strongly confirms that Product 3 was an acid chloride.\n*   **Product 4 is cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde.**\n\n**Counting the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde)**\n\nNow we need to determine the number of unique proton environments in cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde, which corresponds to the number of signals in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n1.  **Structure:** The molecule consists of a cyclopentane ring with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to one of the carbons.\n2.  **Symmetry:** At room temperature, the cyclopentane ring undergoes rapid pseudorotation. This results in a time-averaged structure that has a plane of symmetry (a Cₛ plane). This plane passes through the aldehyde group, the carbon it's attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n3.  **Analysis of Proton Equivalence:**\n    *   **Aldehyde Proton (H-C=O):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. **(1 distinct type)**\n    *   **Methine Proton (on C1):** The single proton on the carbon attached to the aldehyde group is also unique. **(1 distinct type)**\n    *   **Alpha-Protons (on C2 and C5):** The symmetry plane makes C2 equivalent to C5. On C2, the two protons are diastereotopic (they are not interchangeable by rotation or symmetry because C1 is a prochiral center). Let's call them H2a and H2b. Due to the symmetry plane, H2a is equivalent to H5a, and H2b is equivalent to H5b. Therefore, these four alpha-protons give rise to two distinct signals. **(2 distinct types)**\n    *   **Beta-Protons (on C3 and C4):** The symmetry plane makes C3 equivalent to C4. Similar to the alpha-protons, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic (H3c, H3d). H3c is equivalent to H4c, and H3d is equivalent to H4d. These four beta-protons also give rise to two distinct signals. **(2 distinct types)**\n\n4.  **Total Count:**\n    *   1 (aldehyde) + 1 (methine C1) + 2 (alpha-CH₂) + 2 (beta-CH₂) = **6**\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in the final product, cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde.\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nThis problem describes a four-step organic synthesis.

A bromine atom substitutes a hydrogen atom on one of the α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n    *   **Product 1 is 2-Bromocyclohexanone.**\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 (2-Bromocyclohexanone) + Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH), heat → Product 2**\n    *   This is the **Favorskii rearrangement**, a characteristic reaction of α-halo ketones with an abstractable proton on the other α-carbon. The reaction proceeds through a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate and results in the contraction of the ring. The six-membered ring becomes a five-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 2 is Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.**\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) + Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and Pyridine → Product 3**\n    *   This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl).\n    *   **Product 3 is Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.**\n\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride → Product 4**\n    *   Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃) is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce an acid chloride to an aldehyde without over-reducing it to an alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4 is Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.**\n\n**Analysis of the Final Product (Product 4)**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. We now need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in this molecule. We do this by looking for symmetry.\n\nThe molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (H-C=O), the ring carbon it is attached to (C1), the hydrogen on C1, and it bisects the C3-C4 bond of the ring. Hydrogens that can be interchanged by this symmetry operation are chemically equivalent.\n\nLet's label the positions and count the unique hydrogen environments:\n*   **H<sub>a</sub>:** The aldehyde proton. It is unique. (1 type)\n*   **H<sub>b</sub>:** The proton on C1 (the carbon attached to the aldehyde). It lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. (1 type)\n*   **H<sub>c</sub> / H<sub>d</sub>:** The protons on C2 and C5. These carbons are equivalent by symmetry. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are diastereotopic (one is cis to the aldehyde group, one is trans). The two cis protons (one on C2, one on C5) are equivalent to each other. The two trans protons are also equivalent to each other. This gives two distinct types of protons for these four positions. (2 types)\n*   **H<sub>e</sub> / H<sub>f</sub>:** The protons on C3 and C4. These carbons are equivalent by symmetry. Similar to the C2/C5 protons, the four protons on these two carbons give rise to two more distinct proton types. (2 types)\n\n**Total Count:**\nAdding them up: 1 (H<sub>a</sub>) + 1 (H<sub>b</sub>) + 2 (H<sub>c</sub>/H<sub>d</sub>) + 2 (H<sub>e</sub>/H<sub>f</sub>) = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\n**Step-by-step Chemical Synthesis:**\n\n1.  **Step 1:** Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine (Br₂). This is an acid- or base-catalyzed α-halogenation reaction. A bromine atom substitutes one of the hydrogen atoms on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n    *   Product 1 is **2-bromocyclohexanone**.\n\n2.  **Step 2:** Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) is heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a strong base. This set of reagents triggers a **Favorskii rearrangement**. This reaction is characteristic of α-halo ketones and involves the formation of a cyclopropanone intermediate, followed by ring-opening by the hydroxide nucleophile. The net result is a ring contraction. The six-membered ring becomes a five-membered ring.\n    *   Product 2 is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n\n3.  **Step 3:** Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine. This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into a more reactive acyl chloride.\n    *   Product 3 is **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n\n4.  **Step 4:** Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃). This is a sterically hindered, mild reducing agent that can selectively reduce an acyl chloride to an aldehyde without over-reducing it to an alcohol.\n    *   Product 4 is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n**Analysis of the Final Product (Product 4):**\n\nThe question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. This can be determined by examining the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde has a five-membered ring with a -CHO (aldehyde) group attached.\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that runs through the C-CHO bond and bisects the ring.\n*   **Counting Distinct Hydrogens:**\n    1.  The **aldehyde proton** (-CHO) is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n    2.  The **proton on the carbon bearing the aldehyde group** (C1) is also unique. (1 type)\n    3.  The protons on the carbons adjacent to C1 (let's call them C2 and C5). Due to the plane of symmetry, C2 and C5 are equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 are diastereotopic (not equivalent to each other), as are the two on C5. The \"upper\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"upper\" on C5, and the \"lower\" on C2 is equivalent to the \"lower\" on C5. This group of four hydrogens gives rise to **two** distinct types.\n    4.  The protons on the remaining carbons (C3 and C4). These carbons are also equivalent by symmetry. By the same logic as above, the four protons on these two carbons also separate into **two** distinct types.\n\n*   **Total Count:** Summing the distinct types gives: 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nThe reaction sequence and the final product have been determined through chemical principles, and this reasoning is well-supported by the search results.\n\n*   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone to Product 1**\n    *   Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine. This is an alpha-halogenation of a ketone, which will yield 2-bromocyclohexanone as Product 1.\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 to Product 2**\n    *   2-bromocyclohexanone is heated with sodium hydroxide. In cyclic α-halo ketones, this strongly suggests a Favorskii rearrangement, which involves a ring contraction. This reaction converts the six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone into a five-membered ring carboxylic acid.\n    *   Therefore, Product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 to Product 3**\n    *   Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂). This is a standard and efficient method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride.\n    *   Therefore, Product 3 is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 to Product 4**\n    *   Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃). This is a specific, bulky reducing agent used to reduce highly reactive acid chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reaction at the aldehyde stage without further reduction to an alcohol.\n    *   Therefore, Product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n*   **Analysis of Product 4: Chemically Distinct Hydrogens**\n    *   The final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO), the carbon it is attached to (C1), the hydrogen on C1, and bisects the C3-C4 bond of the cyclopentane ring.\n    *   Protons that can be interchanged by a symmetry operation (like reflection through this plane) or by rapid conformational changes are chemically equivalent. Protons that cannot be interchanged are chemically distinct.\n    *   Let's count the distinct sets of protons:\n        1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton is unique and lies on the plane of symmetry. (1 proton)\n        2.  **The proton on C1:** This proton is also unique and lies on the plane of symmetry. (1 proton)\n        3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes the C2 and C5 positions equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 (one \"above\" the ring, one \"below\") are not equivalent to each other; they are diastereotopic. The same applies to C5. Due to the symmetry plane, the \"top\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"top\" proton on C5, and the \"bottom\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"bottom\" proton on C5. This gives two distinct sets of protons for these positions. (2 sets of 2 protons each)\n        4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** The plane of symmetry also makes the C3 and C4 positions equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 positions, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. The symmetry plane makes the \"top\" protons on C3/C4 equivalent and the \"bottom\" protons on C3/C4 equivalent. This gives another two distinct sets of protons. (2 sets of 2 protons each)\n\n*   **Total Count:** Summing these up, we have 1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = 6 sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nThe user has provided a four-step chemical synthesis and is asking for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on the final product. To answer this question, each step of the reaction must be correctly identified.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine.** This is the α-bromination of a ketone. The product (1) is 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n\n2.  **Step 2: 2-bromocyclohexanone heated with sodium hydroxide.** This α-halo ketone undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement in the presence of a strong base like NaOH. This reaction involves a ring contraction. The six-membered cyclohexanone ring contracts to a five-membered ring, forming cyclopentanecarboxylic acid. Thus, product (2) is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.** This is a standard and well-known reaction to convert a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. The product (3) is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(O-t-Bu)₃H).** This is a mild reducing agent specifically used to reduce acyl chlorides to aldehydes, preventing over-reduction to an alcohol. Therefore, the final product (4) is cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde.\n\nThe final task is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde. The structure consists of a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\nWe can analyze the symmetry of the molecule to determine the equivalence of the hydrogen atoms:\n*   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group, the carbon it's attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond of the cyclopentane ring.\n*   **The aldehyde hydrogen (-CHO):** This hydrogen is unique and in a distinct chemical environment. This is the first set of hydrogen.\n*   **The hydrogen on C1:** The hydrogen atom on the carbon attached to the aldehyde group is also unique. This is the second set.\n*   **Hydrogens on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes the two CH₂ groups at positions 2 and 5 equivalent. However, within each CH₂ group, the two hydrogen atoms are diastereotopic because they are adjacent to a stereocenter (C1). This means the hydrogen *cis* to the aldehyde group is different from the one that is *trans*. Therefore, the *cis* hydrogens on C2 and C5 are equivalent to each other, and the *trans* hydrogens on C2 and C5 are equivalent to each other, giving two more distinct sets of hydrogens. These are the third and fourth sets.\n*   **Hydrogens on C3 and C4:** Similarly, the CH₂ groups at positions 3 and 4 are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. The two hydrogens on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This results in two additional sets of distinct hydrogens. These are the fifth and sixth sets.\n\nIn total, there are six sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nThe initial analysis of the reaction sequence needs to be revised based on the search results.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone was treated with bromine, forming product 1.**\nThis reaction is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. The product is 2-bromocyclohexanone. This step is correct.\n\n**Step 2: 2-bromocyclohexanone was heated with sodium hydroxide, forming product 2.**\nMy initial thought was an E2 elimination to form cyclohex-2-en-1-one. However, the search results point to a different, very important named reaction: the **Favorskii rearrangement**. When an α-halo ketone with acidic α'-protons is treated with a strong base (like NaOH), it undergoes a ring contraction. In this case, 2-bromocyclohexanone rearranges to form cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Mechanism of Favorskii Rearrangement:** The hydroxide ion abstracts a proton from the C6 position (the other α-carbon). The resulting enolate then undergoes intramolecular SN2 displacement of the bromide to form a bicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-2-one intermediate. The hydroxide then attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, opening the three-membered ring to form a stable cyclopentyl carbanion, which is then protonated during workup to yield cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\nTherefore, **Product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n\n**Step 3: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid was treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine, forming product 3.**\nThis is a standard conversion of a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Thionyl chloride (SOCl2) replaces the -OH group of the carboxylic acid with a -Cl. Pyridine is often used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n**Product 3 is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.**\n\n**Step 4: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride was treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)3), forming product 4.**\nThis is a selective reduction of an acid chloride. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky and less reactive reducing agent than LiAlH4. It is specifically used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the alcohol.\n**Product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.**\n\n**Final Step: Determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4 (cyclopentanecarbaldehyde).**\n\nThe structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde is a cyclopentane ring attached to a -CHO group. Let's analyze its symmetry.\n\n```\n      H (aldehyde)\n      |\n      C=O\n      |\n  H - C1 - H\n     /   \\\n(H2)C5   C2(H2)\n   |      |\n(H2)C4 - C3(H2)\n```\nThe molecule has a plane of symmetry (a C_s point group) that passes through the C=O bond, the C1 carbon, and bisects the C3-C4 bond. Due to this symmetry plane:\n\n*   The aldehydic hydrogen (on the C=O) is unique. **(Set 1)**\n*   The hydrogen on C1 is unique. **(Set 2)**\n*   The two hydrogens on C2 are equivalent to the two hydrogens on C5.\n*   The two hydrogens on C3 are equivalent to the two hydrogens on C4.\n\nNow we need to determine if the two hydrogens on each of these carbons are equivalent to each other.\n*   Let's look at the two hydrogens on C2 (and C5). One is cis to the aldehyde group, and one is trans. They are not interchangeable by the symmetry operation. They are diastereotopic. Thus, the two cis-hydrogens (on C2 and C5) form one set, and the two trans-hydrogens (on C2 and C5) form another set. **(Set 3 and Set 4)**\n*   Similarly, let's look at the hydrogens on C3 (and C4). One is cis to the aldehyde group, and one is trans. These are also diastereotopic. The two cis-hydrogens (on C3 and C4) form one set, and the two trans-hydrogens (on C3 and C4) form another set. **(Set 5 and Set 6)**\n\nIn total, there are 6 sets of chemically distinct hydrogens.\n\nLet's recount them:\n1.  H attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n2.  H attached to C1.\n3.  The two H's at C2 and the two H's at C5 are equivalent by symmetry. The two on C2 are diastereotopic (not equivalent). So we have the \"upper\" H's at C2/C5 as one set.\n4.  The \"lower\" H's at C2/C5 as a second set.\n5.  The two H's at C3 and the two H's at C4 are equivalent by symmetry. The two on C3 are diastereotopic. So we have the \"upper\" H's at C3/C4 as one set.\n6.  The \"lower\" H's at C3/C4 as a second set.\n\nThis gives a total of 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6 chemically distinct sets of hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe sets are:\n*   H_aldehyde\n*   H1\n*   {H2_cis, H5_cis}\n*   {H2_trans, H5_trans}\n*   {H3_cis, H4_cis}\n*   {H3_trans, H4_trans}\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\nFinal check of the logic. The Favorskii rearrangement is the key step. This leads to cyclopentanecarboxylic acid. Conversion to the acid chloride and then reduction to the aldehyde are standard textbook reactions. The symmetry analysis of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde reveals a single plane of symmetry, leading to 6 distinct types of protons. The answer appears to be 6.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product, followed by an analysis of its hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone was treated with bromine.**\n*   **Substrate:** Cyclohexanone\n*   **Reagent:** Bromine (Br₂)\n*   **Reaction:** This is the α-bromination of a ketone. One of the α-hydrogens on a carbon next to the carbonyl group is replaced by a bromine atom. Due to the symmetry of cyclohexanone, both α-positions are equivalent.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 was heated with sodium hydroxide.**\n*   **Substrate:** 2-bromocyclohexanone\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), heat.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic example of the **Favorskii rearrangement**. An α-halo ketone with a proton on the other α-carbon (the α'-position) rearranges to form a carboxylic acid with a ring contraction. The base (OH⁻) removes an α'-proton from C6, which leads to the formation of a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate. This strained intermediate is then attacked by hydroxide at the carbonyl carbon, followed by ring-opening to yield the most stable carbanion, which after protonation gives the final product.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid. (Note: Other reactions like SN2 or E2 are less likely. E2 would lead to a dead end in the next step, and the sequence of reagents strongly suggests the formation of a carboxylic acid).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 was treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine.**\n*   **Substrate:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n*   **Reagents:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard procedure to convert a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. SOCl₂ is the chlorinating agent, and pyridine is a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 was treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride.**\n*   **Substrate:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃ or LTBA).\n*   **Reaction:** LTBA is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is well-known for selectively reducing acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to alcohols.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. Now, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in this molecule. \"Chemically distinct\" means the hydrogens have different chemical environments and will produce separate signals in an ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nThe structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde is a five-membered ring with a formyl group (-CHO) attached. Let's label the carbons of the ring C1 to C5, with C1 being the carbon attached to the -CHO group.\n\n      H(a) (aldehyde proton)\n      |\n      C=O\n      |\n   C1-H(b) ------ C2H₂(c,d)\n  /           \\\nC5H₂(i,j)          C3H₂(e,f)\n  \\           /\n   ----C4H₂(g,h)----\n\nWe analyze the symmetry of the molecule. Assuming rapid ring flipping (pseudorotation) at room temperature, the molecule has a time-averaged plane of symmetry. This plane passes through the H-C=O group, the C1-H(b) bond, and bisects the C3-C4 bond.\n\nDue to this plane of symmetry:\n*   C2 is chemically equivalent to C5.\n*   C3 is chemically equivalent to C4.\n*   Protons on C2 are equivalent to the corresponding protons on C5.\n*   Protons on C3 are equivalent to the corresponding protons on C4.\n\nNow, let's count the sets of distinct protons:\n\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (H(a))**: This proton is unique. This is our **first** set.\n2.  **The proton on C1 (H(b))**: This methine proton is on the plane of symmetry and is unique. This is our **second** set.\n3.  **Protons on C2 and C5**: Let's consider the two protons on C2. Since C1 is a substituted carbon, the two protons on the adjacent C2 are **diastereotopic**. This means they are chemically non-equivalent and will give two different signals. The plane of symmetry makes the \"upper\" proton on C2 equivalent to the \"upper\" proton on C5, and the \"lower\" proton on C2 equivalent to the \"lower\" proton on C5. Therefore, the four protons on C2 and C5 give rise to two distinct sets. These are our **third** and **fourth** sets.\n4.  **Protons on C3 and C4**: Similar to the C2/C5 case, the two geminal protons on C3 are also diastereotopic due to the influence of the substituent at C1. The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C3 equivalent to their counterparts on C4. So, the four protons on C3 and C4 also give rise to two distinct sets. These are our **fifth** and **sixth** sets.\n\nIn total, we have 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6 sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe correct answer is 6.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nThe user has presented a four-step chemical synthesis problem and is asking for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on the final product.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n1.  **Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**: This is the α-bromination of a ketone. The bromine atom adds to the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group. The product, **Product 1**, is **2-bromocyclohexanone**.\n\n2.  **Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**: When an α-halo ketone like 2-bromocyclohexanone is heated with a strong base such as NaOH, it undergoes a classic reaction called the Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the contraction of the ring, converting the six-membered cyclohexanone ring into a five-membered cyclopentane ring with a carboxylic acid group. Thus, **Product 2** is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n\n3.  **Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**: This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl). Therefore, **Product 3** is **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n\n4.  **Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃)**: This reagent is a mild reducing agent specifically used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to an alcohol. It is less reactive than lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) due to the bulky tri-tert-butoxy groups. The reaction converts cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride into **Product 4**, which is **cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde**.\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product, **cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde** (C₆H₁₀O). Chemically distinct hydrogens are those in different electronic environments, which would give rise to separate signals in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nLet's analyze the structure of cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde:\n\n*   The molecule consists of a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group, the carbon atom it's attached to (C1), and the hydrogen on C1. This plane bisects the C3-C4 bond of the cyclopentane ring.\n*   We can count the sets of non-equivalent protons:\n    1.  The **aldehyde proton** (-CHO). This is in a unique chemical environment. (1 proton)\n    2.  The single **proton on C1**, the carbon atom of the ring bonded to the aldehyde group. This is also unique. (1 proton)\n    3.  The protons on **C2 and C5**. Due to the plane of symmetry, C2 and C5 are equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 (a methylene group) are diastereotopic because C1 is a chiral center (even in a racemic mixture). One proton is *cis* to the aldehyde group, and the other is *trans*. These two are not equivalent. The same applies to C5. Therefore, the two *cis* protons (on C2 and C5) form one set, and the two *trans* protons form another set. This gives us two distinct types of hydrogens. (4 protons total, in 2 sets)\n    4.  The protons on **C3 and C4**. These carbons are also equivalent due to the symmetry plane. Similar to C2 and C5, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. The two protons *cis* to the C1-CHO axis are equivalent to each other, and the two *trans* protons are also equivalent to each other. This adds another two distinct types of hydrogens. (4 protons total, in 2 sets)\n\nSumming these up, we have:\n1 (aldehyde) + 1 (on C1) + 2 (on C2/C5) + 2 (on C3/C4) = 6 chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nMy plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Trace the reaction sequence**: I will determine the structure of the product after each of the four chemical reactions.

Cyclohexanone has two equivalent α-carbons. The reaction involves the formation of an enol intermediate, which then attacks the bromine molecule.\n    *   The product is 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n    *   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) was heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH), forming product 2.**\n    *   An α-halo ketone with an abstractable proton on the other α-carbon, when treated with a strong base like NaOH, undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement.\n    *   The base (OH⁻) removes the acidic proton from the α-carbon not bearing the bromine (C6). This forms an enolate.\n    *   The enolate anion then performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 attack, displacing the bromide and forming a strained bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one intermediate (a cyclopropanone fused to a cyclohexane ring).\n    *   The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of the cyclopropanone. The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, leading to the cleavage of the three-membered ring. This results in a ring contraction.\n    *   The final product, after protonation (which would happen during a workup, or the next reagent SOCl₂ can react with the carboxylate salt), is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n    *   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) was treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine, forming 3.**\n    *   This is a standard procedure to convert a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) is the reagent, and pyridine is a weak base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n    *   The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl).\n    *   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) was treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃), forming product 4.**\n    *   Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky and mild reducing agent. It is known to selectively reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the corresponding alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. We need to determine the number of sets of chemically equivalent hydrogen atoms in this molecule.\n\nLet's label the carbons of the ring starting from the carbon attached to the aldehyde group as C1.\n\n```\n       H(a)\n       |\n    O==C\n       |\n    H(b)-C1\n      /  \\\n  H(c,d)-C2--C5-H(c,d)\n        |    |\n  H(e,f)-C3--C4-H(e,f)\n         \\  /\n```\n\n1.  **Symmetry:** Cyclopentane rings are not planar but undergo rapid puckering at room temperature. For NMR purposes, we consider the time-averaged structure, which possesses a plane of symmetry. This plane passes through the aldehyde group (CHO), the C1 carbon, the C1-H bond, and bisects the C3-C4 bond.\n\n2.  **Proton Environments:**\n    *   **H(a):** The aldehyde proton. It is in a unique chemical environment. This is **1 distinct type** of hydrogen.\n    *   **H(b):** The proton on C1 (a methine group, CH). It lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. This is **1 distinct type** of hydrogen.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 chemically equivalent. Each of these carbons is a methylene group (CH₂). The two protons on C2 are diastereotopic because C2 is adjacent to the prostereogenic center C1 (substituting one H would create a diastereomer relative to substituting the other H, because a second chiral center would be created at C1). Therefore, the two protons on C2 are chemically distinct from each other. The same applies to C5. By symmetry, the \"cis\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"cis\" proton on C5, and the \"trans\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"trans\" proton on C5. This gives **2 distinct types** of hydrogens for the C2/C5 positions.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C4:** The plane of symmetry also makes C3 and C4 chemically equivalent. Each is a methylene group (CH₂). The two protons on C3 are also diastereotopic. This can be confirmed with a substitution test: replacing one proton on C3 with a different group (e.g., Deuterium) creates two new chiral centers (at C1 and C3), and the resulting molecule is a diastereomer of the one formed by replacing the other proton on C3. Thus, the two protons on C3 are chemically distinct. By symmetry, these two distinct proton types are mirrored on C4. This gives another **2 distinct types** of hydrogens for the C3/C4 positions.\n\n3.  **Total Count:**\n    *   Aldehyde H: 1 type\n    *   C1-H: 1 type\n    *   C2/C5 protons: 2 types\n    *   C3/C4 protons: 2 types\n    *   Total number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\nFinal Answer is 6.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\n**Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction Sequence Step-by-Step**\n\n    *   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2).**\n        *   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone, a 6-membered ring ketone.\n        *   **Reagent:** Bromine (Br2).\n        *   **Reaction:** This is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. The reaction proceeds by forming an enol or enolate intermediate, which then attacks the bromine. This results in the substitution of one of the alpha-hydrogens (hydrogens on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) with a bromine atom.\n        *   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) is heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH).**\n        *   **Reactant:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n        *   **Reagent:** Sodium hydroxide (a strong base) and heat.\n        *   **Reaction:** There are two main possibilities for an α-haloketone with a strong base:\n            1.  **E2 Elimination:** The base abstracts a proton from the adjacent carbon (C3), leading to the formation of a double bond and elimination of bromide. This would yield cyclohex-2-enone.\n            2.  **Favorskii Rearrangement:** This is a classic reaction of α-haloketones that have a proton on the other alpha-carbon (the α' position, C6 in this case). The base (OH-) abstracts the acidic α' proton to form an enolate. The enolate then attacks the carbon bearing the halogen in an intramolecular SN2 fashion, displacing the bromide and forming a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate. The strong base then attacks the carbonyl carbon of this strained intermediate. The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, and the ring opens to form a more stable carbanion, leading to a ring contraction. In this case, the 6-membered ring contracts to a 5-membered ring carboxylic acid (after protonation/workup).\n        *   **Which path is correct?** We must look ahead to the next step. The reagent is thionyl chloride (SOCl2). SOCl2 is used to convert carboxylic acids into acid chlorides. It does not react with α,β-unsaturated ketones like cyclohex-2-enone. Therefore, the Favorskii rearrangement must be the correct pathway.\n        *   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Step 3: Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine.**\n        *   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n        *   **Reagent:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl2), a chlorinating agent, and pyridine, a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n        *   **Reaction:** This is a standard and efficient method for converting a carboxylic acid to an acyl chloride (acid chloride).\n        *   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Step 4: Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride.**\n        *   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n        *   **Reagent:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)3).\n        *   **Reaction:** This is a bulky and mild reducing agent. Unlike the powerful LiAlH4 which would reduce an acid chloride all the way to a primary alcohol, LiAlH(O-t-Bu)3 is selective and stops the reduction at the aldehyde stage. This is a common method for synthesizing aldehydes from acid chlorides.\n        *   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n         \n\n2.  **Determine the Number of Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\n    *   **Product 4 Structure:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. It consists of a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:** We need to count the number of unique proton environments, which corresponds to the number of signals expected in a 1H NMR spectrum. While the cyclopentane ring is not planar (it undergoes rapid pseudorotation between envelope and twist conformations), on the NMR timescale, the molecule has an effective plane of symmetry (a C_s plane). This plane passes through the aldehyde group (H-C=O), the carbon it's attached to (C1), and the hydrogen on C1. This plane bisects the rest of the ring, making C2 and C5 equivalent, and C3 and C4 equivalent.\n\n    *   **Counting the distinct protons:**\n        1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton is in a unique electronic environment. (1st distinct type)\n        2.  **The proton on C1:** This proton (on the carbon attached to the aldehyde) is also unique, as it lies on the plane of symmetry. (2nd distinct type)\n        3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** These two carbons are equivalent by symmetry. However, on each of these carbons, the two protons are not equivalent to each other. They are diastereotopic because one is 'cis' to the bulky aldehyde group and the other is 'trans'. Therefore, the 'cis' protons on C2 and C5 are equivalent to each other, and the 'trans' protons on C2 and C5 are equivalent to each other, but the 'cis' and 'trans' sets are distinct. This gives us two more types of protons. (3rd and 4th distinct types)\n        4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** These two carbons are also equivalent by symmetry. Similar to the C2/C5 case, the two protons on each of these carbons are diastereotopic. Their environment is different from the protons on C2/C5 because they are further from the aldehyde group. Again, the 'cis-like' protons on C3 and C4 are one set, and the 'trans-like' protons are another distinct set. This gives us two more types of protons.

In this reaction, a bromine atom replaces a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group. This results in the formation of **Product 1: 2-bromocyclohexanone**.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide**\nWhen 2-bromocyclohexanone is heated with a base like sodium hydroxide, it undergoes a classic ring-contraction reaction known as the Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the formation of a bicyclic intermediate which then opens to form a five-membered ring. The product is a carboxylate salt, which upon acidification (assumed in a standard workup) yields **Product 2: cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine**\nCyclopentanecarboxylic acid is a carboxylic acid. Treating a carboxylic acid with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) is a standard method to convert it into an acid chloride. Pyridine is typically used to neutralize the HCl byproduct. This reaction forms **Product 3: cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(OtBu)₃H) is a mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce highly reactive acid chlorides to aldehydes without continuing the reduction to a primary alcohol. Therefore, cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride is reduced to **Product 4: cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n**Determining the Number of Chemically Distinct Hydrogens**\n\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to analyze its structure and symmetry.\n\nThe structure consists of a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\n1.  **Aldehyde Proton:** The hydrogen atom in the -CHO group is in a unique chemical environment. (1 distinct type)\n2.  **C1 Proton:** The hydrogen atom on the carbon of the ring to which the aldehyde group is attached (C1) is also in a unique environment. (1 distinct type)\n3.  **C2/C5 Protons:** The cyclopentane ring has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C1-CHO bond. This symmetry makes the protons on carbon 2 (C2) equivalent to the protons on carbon 5 (C5). However, on each of these carbons, the two hydrogen atoms are not equivalent to each other. They are diastereotopic because one is cis (on the same side) and one is trans (on the opposite side) relative to the aldehyde group. Thus, the four protons on C2 and C5 represent two distinct sets of hydrogen atoms. (2 distinct types)\n4.  **C3/C4 Protons:** Similarly, the protons on carbon 3 (C3) are equivalent to the protons on carbon 4 (C4) due to the plane of symmetry. Like the C2/C5 protons, the two hydrogens on each of these carbons are diastereotopic. Therefore, the four protons on C3 and C4 represent another two distinct sets of hydrogen atoms. (2 distinct types)\n\nIn total, the number of chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms is the sum of all the unique sets: 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1) + 2 (C2/C5) + 2 (C3/C4) = 6.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nThe reaction sequence described is a multi-step organic synthesis. Here is a breakdown of each step to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\nThis reaction is the α-bromination of a ketone. A hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-carbon) is replaced by a bromine atom. This forms 2-bromocyclohexanone as product 1.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\nProduct 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) is an α-halo ketone. When treated with a strong base like sodium hydroxide and heated, it undergoes a classic ring-contraction reaction known as the Favorskii rearrangement. The six-membered cyclohexanone ring contracts to a five-membered ring, forming cyclopentanecarboxylic acid. Product 2 is therefore cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\nProduct 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) reacts with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) in a standard procedure to convert a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. The pyridine is a weak base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct. This reaction yields cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride as product 3.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃)**\nProduct 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) is an acid chloride. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky and mild reducing agent that is selective for the reduction of acid chlorides to aldehydes. It is less reactive than lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) and will not reduce the aldehyde further to an alcohol, allowing for the isolation of the aldehyde. This reaction forms cyclopentanecarbaldehyde as the final product (product 4).\n\n**Counting the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through:\n*   The aldehyde group (CHO).\n*   The carbon of the cyclopentane ring to which the aldehyde is attached (C1).\n*   The hydrogen atom on C1.\n\nThis plane of symmetry makes pairs of carbons and their attached hydrogens equivalent.\n1.  **Aldehydic proton (-CHO):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n2.  **Proton on C1:** The single hydrogen attached to the carbon bearing the aldehyde group is also unique. (1 type)\n3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** These two carbons are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are diastereotopic—meaning they are not chemically equivalent to each other. One proton is *cis* (on the same side) and one is *trans* (on the opposite side) relative to the aldehyde group. Thus, the two *cis* protons (on C2 and C5) are equivalent to each other, and the two *trans* protons (on C2 and C5) are equivalent to each other, creating two distinct types of protons from these four hydrogens. (2 types)\n4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, these two carbons are equivalent. The two protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This gives another two distinct types of protons. (2 types)\n\nTotal number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms = 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\n\nThis reaction is the alpha-bromination of a ketone. Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine to form an alpha-bromo ketone. Due to the symmetry of cyclohexanone, bromination occurs at either of the equivalent alpha-carbons (the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n\n*   **Product 1:** 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n\nThis reaction involves an alpha-halo ketone with a strong base, which are the classic conditions for a **Favorskii rearrangement**. The mechanism proceeds as follows:\n1.  A hydroxide ion (OH⁻) removes a proton from the other alpha-carbon (C6), which is the one not bearing the bromine atom, to form an enolate.\n2.  The enolate undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 attack on the carbon bearing the bromine (C2), displacing the bromide ion. This forms a strained bicyclic intermediate containing a cyclopropane ring, which is a derivative of cyclopropanone (specifically, bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one).\n3.  The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of the cyclopropanone intermediate.\n4.  The strained ring opens up to relieve ring strain, leading to a ring contraction. The cleavage occurs to form the more stable carbanion, which is then protonated. For a 2-halocyclohexanone, this process results in the formation of a cyclopentane ring with a carboxylic acid group.\n\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n\nThis is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride (or acid chloride). Thionyl chloride is the chlorinating agent, and pyridine is a base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃)**\n\nThis is a reduction reaction. LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃ is a bulky, mild reducing agent. Unlike the powerful LiAlH₄ which would reduce the acyl chloride all the way to an alcohol, LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃ is selective and stops the reduction at the aldehyde stage. This is a common and specific transformation.\n\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nThe final task is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. This is equivalent to determining the number of signals expected in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nThe structure is a five-membered ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\nTo determine the chemical equivalence of the hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry. At room temperature, the cyclopentane ring undergoes rapid conformational changes (pseudorotation). The time-averaged conformation possesses a plane of symmetry (it belongs to the Cₛ point group). This plane passes through:\n*   The aldehyde group (CHO).\n*   The carbon it is attached to (C1) and the hydrogen on that carbon.\n*   It bisects the bond between C3 and C4.\n\nThis plane of symmetry has the following consequences for the equivalence of atoms:\n*   Carbon C2 is equivalent to carbon C5.\n*   Carbon C3 is equivalent to carbon C4.\n\nNow, let's count the sets of chemically distinct (non-equivalent) hydrogen atoms:\n\n1.  **The aldehydic hydrogen (-CHO):** This hydrogen is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n2.  **The hydrogen on C1:** This hydrogen is on the plane of symmetry and is also in a unique environment, being attached to the carbon bonded to the aldehyde. (1 type)\n3.  **The hydrogens on C2 and C5:** C2 and C5 are equivalent. Each of these carbons has two hydrogens. Since C1 is a stereocenter (even in an achiral molecule, it creates a diastereotopic relationship for adjacent protons), the two hydrogens on C2 are diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically non-equivalent. The same applies to C5. By symmetry, the two non-equivalent hydrogens on C2 correspond to the two on C5. Thus, there are two distinct types of hydrogens on these carbons. (2 types)\n4.  **The hydrogens on C3 and C4:** C3 and C4 are equivalent. Similar to the case for C2/C5, the two hydrogens on C3 are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent. They are equivalent to their corresponding partners on C4. This gives another two distinct types of hydrogens.

The reaction proceeds via an enol or enolate intermediate, which attacks the bromine molecule. The result is the substitution of one of the α-hydrogens (hydrogens on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) with a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-Bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n\n*   **Reactant:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a strong base, with heat.\n*   **Reaction:** With an α-halo ketone and a strong base, the most characteristic reaction is the Favorskii rearrangement. The hydroxide ion removes a proton from the other α-carbon (C6), forming an enolate. This enolate undergoes an intramolecular S_N2 reaction, where the enolate attacks the carbon bearing the bromine, displacing the bromide ion and forming a bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one intermediate. The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of this strained bicyclic ketone, leading to the opening of the three-membered ring. The more stable carbanion is formed, which results in the contraction of the six-membered ring to a five-membered ring. After protonation during workup, the final product is a carboxylic acid.\n    *   An alternative reaction, E2 elimination, to form cyclohex-2-en-1-one is less likely to be the intended path because this product would not react with the reagents in the next step.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagent:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard and efficient method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride (or acid chloride). The hydroxyl (-OH) group of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine (-Cl) atom. Pyridine is used as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃)**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a mild and selective reducing agent. Unlike the much more reactive LiAlH₄, the bulky tert-butoxy groups on LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃ make it less reactive. It is particularly useful for the partial reduction of acyl chlorides to aldehydes. The reaction stops at the aldehyde stage and does not proceed to the primary alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)**\n\nNow we need to determine the number of unique hydrogen environments in the final product, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. In NMR spectroscopy, chemically non-equivalent hydrogens give rise to distinct signals.\n\nThe structure is a cyclopentane ring with an aldehyde group (-CHO) attached. Let's analyze its symmetry and hydrogen environments.\n\n1.  **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (C=O and H), the carbon atom it's attached to (C1), the hydrogen on C1, and bisects the C3-C4 bond of the ring.\n2.  **Consequences of Symmetry:**\n    *   The carbon C2 is chemically equivalent to C5.\n    *   The carbon C3 is chemically equivalent to C4.\n3.  **Counting the Distinct Hydrogen Atoms:**\n    *   **Aldehyde Hydrogen:** The single hydrogen attached to the carbonyl carbon (-C**H**O) is in a unique chemical environment. This is **1** distinct type of hydrogen.\n    *   **C1 Hydrogen:** The hydrogen on the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde group (C1) is also in a unique environment. This is a **2nd** distinct type of hydrogen.\n    *   **C2 and C5 Hydrogens:** Carbons C2 and C5 are equivalent. However, the two hydrogens on C2 are diastereotopic because C1 is a chiral center. This means they are chemically non-equivalent. Let's call them H2a and H2b. By symmetry, the hydrogens on C5 are equivalent to those on C2 (i.e., H5a is equivalent to H2a, and H5b is equivalent to H2b). Therefore, the four hydrogens on C2 and C5 give rise to **2** distinct signals.\n    *   **C3 and C4 Hydrogens:** Carbons C3 and C4 are also equivalent. Similar to C2, the two hydrogens on C3 are diastereotopic. Their chemical environments are different relative to the chiral center at C1. By symmetry, the hydrogens on C4 are equivalent to those on C3. Therefore, the four hydrogens on C3 and C4 also give rise to **2** distinct signals.\n\n**Total Count:**\nAdding up the distinct types of hydrogens:\n1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5-H's) + 2 (from C3/C4-H's) = **6**\n\nThus, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of a multi-step organic synthesis, followed by a structural analysis of the final product.\n\n**Step-by-step reaction analysis:**\n\n1.  **Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂) → Product 1:**\n    *   This reaction is an α-halogenation of a ketone. The bromine atom adds to one of the α-carbons (the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group). Since cyclohexanone is symmetric, the product is **2-bromocyclohexanone**.\n\n2.  **Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) → Product 2:**\n    *   This is the **Favorskii rearrangement**, a characteristic reaction of α-halo ketones with a strong base. The base abstracts a proton from the other α-carbon (the α'-carbon). This leads to an intramolecular cyclization and subsequent ring-opening, which results in a ring contraction. The six-membered ring of cyclohexanone becomes a five-membered ring.\n    *   The product is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid** (after protonation during workup).\n\n3.  **Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine → Product 3:**\n    *   This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. The hydroxyl group (-OH) is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl).\n    *   Product 3 is **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n\n4.  **Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃) → Product 4:**\n    *   Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild and sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the alcohol.\n    *   Product 4 is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)**\n\nThe final step is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. This is equivalent to determining the number of unique signals in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule consists of a five-membered cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (H-C=O), the ring carbon it is attached to (C1), the hydrogen on C1, and it bisects the C3-C4 bond of the ring.\n*   **Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogens:**\n    1.  **The aldehyde proton:** The hydrogen atom of the -CHO group is in a unique chemical environment.

A hydrogen on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-hydrogen) is replaced by a bromine atom. Since cyclohexanone is a symmetrical molecule, bromination at either alpha-position (C2 or C6) yields the same product.\n\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone\n*   **Reagent:** Br₂\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-Bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n\nThis is a classic example of a **Favorskii rearrangement**. An α-haloketone reacts with a strong base, causing a ring contraction. The six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone is converted into a five-membered ring containing a carboxylic acid functional group (after workup).\n\n*   **Mechanism Outline:** The base removes the other α-hydrogen (from C6), forming an enolate. The enolate attacks the carbon bearing the bromine, displacing it and forming a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate. The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to the opening of the strained three-membered ring to form the more stable five-membered ring carboxylate, which is then protonated.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n\nThis is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Thionyl chloride is the chlorinating agent, and pyridine acts as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (-COOH)\n*   **Reagent:** SOCl₂\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (-COCl)\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃)**\n\nThis reagent is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes. It is not powerful enough to reduce the aldehyde further to an alcohol.\n\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (-COCl)\n*   **Reagent:** LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde (-CHO)\n\n**Final Analysis: Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogens in Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)**\n\nTo find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the symmetry of the final molecule, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. We can visualize the molecule and identify which hydrogens are in unique chemical environments.\n\nThe structure is a five-membered cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\n1.  **Aldehyde Hydrogen:** The single hydrogen attached to the carbonyl carbon (`-CHO`) is in a unique chemical environment. This is **1** distinct type.\n2.  **C1-Hydrogen:** The hydrogen on the carbon of the ring that is attached to the aldehyde group (C1) is a unique methine proton. This is the **2nd** distinct type.\n3.  **C2 and C5 Hydrogens:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group and C1. This makes C2 equivalent to C5. However, C1 is a stereocenter (it's bonded to four different groups: H, CHO, C2, and C5). This means the two hydrogens on C2 are diastereotopic (not equivalent to each other). The same is true for the two hydrogens on C5. By symmetry, the \"upper\" hydrogens on C2 and C5 are equivalent, and the \"lower\" hydrogens on C2 and C5 are equivalent. This gives us two more distinct sets of hydrogens. These are the **3rd** and **4th** distinct types.\n4.  **C3 and C4 Hydrogens:** The plane of symmetry also makes C3 equivalent to C4. Similar to the C2/C5 case, the hydrogens on C3 are diastereotopic because of the stereocenter at C1, as are the hydrogens on C4. This creates another two sets of equivalent hydrogens. These are the **5th** and **6th** distinct types.\n\nIn total, there are **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nThe multi-step synthesis described involves the following transformations:\n\n1.  **Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂):** This is the α-bromination of a ketone, which produces 2-bromocyclohexanone as Product 1.\n2.  **Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH):** When an α-halo ketone like 2-bromocyclohexanone is treated with a strong base, it can undergo a Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves a ring contraction. In this case, 2-bromocyclohexanone rearranges to form cyclopentanecarboxylic acid, which is Product 2.\n3.  **Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine:** Thionyl chloride is a standard reagent used to convert carboxylic acids into acyl chlorides. Pyridine is typically used as a base to neutralize the HCl produced during the reaction. Therefore, cyclopentanecarboxylic acid is converted to cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3).\n4.  **Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃):** This reagent is a mild and sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used for the selective reduction of acyl chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reaction at the aldehyde stage without further reduction to an alcohol. Thus, cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride is reduced to cyclopentanecarbaldehyde, which is the final product, Product 4.\n\nThe final step is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. The structure consists of a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n*   The carbon atom of the ring that is attached to the aldehyde group (C1) is a stereocenter, as it is bonded to four different groups: the aldehyde group, a hydrogen atom, and two different paths around the ring. This makes the molecule chiral.\n*   In a chiral molecule, protons that cannot be interchanged by a rotational axis or a rapid conformational process are chemically distinct.\n*   The cyclopentane ring is not planar and undergoes rapid pseudorotation at room temperature. This rapid conformational change averages the environments of certain protons, creating an effective plane of symmetry on the NMR timescale.\n*   This time-averaged plane of symmetry passes through the aldehyde group, the C1 carbon, and the H attached to C1, bisecting the C3-C4 bond.\n\nBased on this effective symmetry, we can identify the sets of chemically distinct protons:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. (1 signal)\n2.  **The proton on C1:** This methine proton is also unique. (1 signal)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C5. However, because C2 is adjacent to the C1 stereocenter, the two geminal protons on C2 are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct from each other. The same applies to C5. Therefore, these four protons give rise to two distinct signals. (2 signals)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, the plane of symmetry renders the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C4. The two geminal protons on C3 are diastereotopic because they are in a chiral molecule. The same holds for C4. These four protons also give rise to two distinct signals. (2 signals)\n\nIn total, there are 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6 chemically distinct sets of hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n### **Reaction Analysis**\n\n*   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine.**\n    This is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. The bromine atom attaches to the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n    *   **Product 1: 2-Bromocyclohexanone.**\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide.**\n    When an α-halo ketone with an available acidic proton on the opposite side of the carbonyl is treated with a strong base like NaOH, it undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the formation of a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate, which then opens to form a ring-contracted carboxylic acid (after an acidic workup, which is implied). The six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to a five-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 2: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.**\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.**\n    Thionyl chloride is a standard reagent used to convert carboxylic acids into acyl chlorides. Pyridine is often used as a solvent and to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n    *   **Product 3: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.**\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(OtBu)₃H).**\n    Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild reducing agent that is specifically used to reduce reactive acyl chlorides to aldehydes. It is less reactive than lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) and allows the reaction to stop at the aldehyde stage without proceeding to the alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.**\n\n### **Analysis of Product 4**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to examine its structure and symmetry.\n\nThe molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO), the C-H bond on the carbon attached to the aldehyde (C1), and bisects the bond between C3 and C4 of the cyclopentane ring.\n\nLet's count the unique hydrogen environments:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (H-aldehyde):** This proton is bonded to the carbonyl carbon and is in a unique chemical environment.\n2.  **The proton on C1:** This proton (methine) is on the carbon where the aldehyde group is attached. It lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique.\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** Due to the plane of symmetry, C2 and C5 are equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 (a methylene group) are diastereotopic because of their different spatial relationships to the aldehyde group (one is *cis*, the other is *trans*). The *cis* proton on C2 is equivalent to the *cis* proton on C5, and the *trans* proton on C2 is equivalent to the *trans* proton on C5. This gives two distinct sets of protons.\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, C3 and C4 are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. The two protons on C3 are also diastereotopic. The proton closer to the aldehyde group is equivalent to its counterpart on C4, and the proton farther away is equivalent to its counterpart on C4. This results in two more distinct sets of protons.\n\nIn summary, there are six sets of chemically non-equivalent hydrogen atoms:\n*   Signal 1: Aldehydic H (1H)\n*   Signal 2: C1 methine H (1H)\n*   Signal 3: C2/C5 methylene H's (2H, one type)\n*   Signal 4: C2/C5 methylene H's (2H, second type)\n*   Signal 5: C3/C4 methylene H's (2H, one type)\n*   Signal 6: C3/C4 methylene H's (2H, second type)\n\nTherefore, there are **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

(2 types)\n\n**Total Count:**\n*   Type 1: Aldehyde H (1H)\n*   Type 2: C1-H (1H)\n*   Type 3: C2/C5 H (*cis*) (2H)\n*   Type 4: C2/C5 H (*trans*) (2H)\n*   Type 5: C3/C4 H (\"inner\") (2H)\n*   Type 6: C3/C4 H (\"outer\") (2H)\n\nSumming these up, there are **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in product 4.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is my step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction Sequence:** I will trace the chemical transformations step by step to identify the final product.\n    *   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1.** This is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. The bromine atom will add to the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the alpha-carbon). The product is 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n    *   **Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) + NaOH (heated) → Product 2.** This is a reaction of an alpha-halo ketone with a strong base. This set of reagents is characteristic of the **Favorskii rearrangement**. In this reaction, the six-membered ring contracts to a five-membered ring, forming a carboxylic acid derivative. The product is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n    *   **Step 3: Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) + Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and Pyridine → Product 3.** Thionyl chloride is a standard reagent for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. The product is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n    *   **Step 4: Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃) → Product 4.** This is a bulky, mild reducing agent specifically used to reduce acyl chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reaction at the aldehyde stage without further reduction to an alcohol. The final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of the Final Product (Product 4):** Based on the analysis, Product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. Its structure consists of a five-membered cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\n3.  **Count the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms:** Now, I will examine the structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde to count the number of unique hydrogen environments, considering the molecule's symmetry.\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO), the C-C bond connecting it to the ring, the carbon atom it's attached to (C1), and the C1-H bond.\n    *   Let's count the distinct types of hydrogens:\n        1.  **The aldehyde proton (H in -CHO):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n        2.  **The proton on C1:** This is the single proton on the ring carbon directly attached to the aldehyde group. It lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. (1 type)\n        3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** These are the carbons adjacent to C1. The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. However, on each of these carbons, there are two protons. These two protons are diastereotopic because C1 is a stereocenter. Therefore, they are chemically distinct from each other. This gives us two more types of hydrogens (one set of two equivalent protons, and another set of two equivalent protons). (2 types)\n        4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** These are the carbons beta to C1. The plane of symmetry also makes C3 and C4 equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 protons, the two protons on C3 (and C4) are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct from each other. This gives us another two types of hydrogens. (2 types)\n\n4.  **Sum the types:** Total distinct types = 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = 6.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1.

The reaction proceeds via an enol or enolate intermediate. One of the α-hydrogens (on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) is replaced by a bromine atom. Since cyclohexanone is symmetrical, both α-positions (C2 and C6) are equivalent.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n*   **Starting Material:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydroxide (a strong base) and heat.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic reaction of an α-halo ketone with a base. While elimination to form an α,β-unsaturated ketone is possible, the presence of an abstractable proton on the other α-carbon (the α'-position, C6) strongly favors a **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n    1.  The base (OH⁻) removes the acidic α'-proton from C6 to form an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate undergoes an intramolecular S_N2 reaction: the carbanion at C6 attacks C2, displacing the bromide ion (Br⁻) to form a strained bicyclic ketone intermediate (bicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-2-one).\n    3.  The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of this intermediate.\n    4.  The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, and the ring opens by cleaving the bond between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and the α'-carbon (C6). This relieves the strain of the three-membered ring and results in the formation of a five-membered ring with a carboxylate group.\n    5.  Upon acidic workup (which is implied before the next step), the carboxylate is protonated.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n    *   *Note:* If simple elimination had occurred, the product would be cyclohex-2-en-1-one. However, this compound would not react with thionyl chloride in the next step, making the Favorskii rearrangement the only logical pathway consistent with the entire reaction sequence.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n*   **Starting Material:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagents:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.\n*   **Reaction:** This is the standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Pyridine is a base used to neutralize the HCl gas produced during the reaction.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃)**\n*   **Starting Material:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a selective reduction. LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃ is a sterically hindered and less reactive hydride donor than LiAlH₄. It is known to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes, stopping at the aldehyde stage without further reduction to the primary alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. We can do this by analyzing the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclopentane ring with a formyl group (-CHO) attached.\n*   **Symmetry:** At room temperature, the cyclopentane ring undergoes rapid conformational changes (puckering). On the NMR time scale, this results in an effective plane of symmetry that passes through the C-CHO bond, the carbon it's attached to (C1), and the midpoint of the opposite C-C bond (the C3-C4 bond).\n*   **Counting Distinct Hydrogens:**\n    1.  **Aldehyde Hydrogen:** The hydrogen atom of the -CHO group is in a unique chemical environment. This is **1** type.\n    2.  **C1 Hydrogen:** The hydrogen atom on the carbon of the ring attached to the aldehyde group (C1) lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. This is a **2nd** type.\n    3.  **C2 and C5 Hydrogens:** The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. However, on each of these carbons, the two hydrogen atoms are diastereotopic (one is cis to the -CHO group, the other is trans). They are not chemically equivalent to each other. Therefore, the two hydrogens on C2/C5 constitute two different sets of equivalent protons. This gives **2** more types.\n    4.  **C3 and C4 Hydrogens:** The plane of symmetry also makes C3 and C4 equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 positions, the two hydrogens on each of these carbons are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent. This gives another **2** types.\n\n*   **Total Count:**\n    *   Type 1: Aldehyde-H (1H)\n    *   Type 2: C1-H (1H)\n    *   Type 3: C2-H & C5-H (cis) (2H total)\n    *   Type 4: C2-H & C5-H (trans) (2H total)\n    *   Type 5: C3-H & C4-H (one set) (2H total)\n    *   Type 6: C3-H & C4-H (the other set) (2H total)\n\nIn total, there are **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in product 4.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 4 and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2)**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone, a six-membered cyclic ketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Bromine (Br2).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the α-halogenation of a ketone. In this reaction, a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon) is replaced by a bromine atom. Since cyclohexanone is symmetric, both α-positions are equivalent.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n*   **Reactant:** 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a strong base, with heat.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents with an α-halo ketone that has protons on the other α-carbon (the C6 position) leads to a **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n    1.  The base (OH⁻) abstracts the most acidic proton, which is on the α-carbon not bearing the halogen (C6). This forms an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, where the carbanion attacks the carbon bearing the bromine (C2), displacing the bromide ion. This forms a bicyclic intermediate: bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one.\n    3.  The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of this strained bicyclic ketone.\n    4.  The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, and the cyclopropane ring opens. The ring opening occurs to form the more stable carbanion. Cleavage of the C1-C6 bond results in a carbanion on a five-membered ring, which is more stable than the alternative.\n    5.  Protonation upon workup yields a carboxylic acid with a rearranged carbon skeleton.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagent:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) is a standard reagent for converting carboxylic acids into acyl chlorides.

It is specifically used to reduce acyl chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to alcohols.\n*   **Reaction:** The acyl chloride is reduced to an aldehyde.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Symmetry:** At room temperature, the cyclopentane ring undergoes rapid conformational changes (ring flipping). On the NMR timescale, this results in an effective plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group, the carbon it is attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond of the ring.\n*   **Counting Distinct Hydrogens:** We can use this plane of symmetry to identify equivalent and non-equivalent hydrogens.\n    *   **H_aldehyde:** The single proton of the aldehyde group (-CHO) is in a unique chemical environment. This is **Set 1**.\n    *   **H1:** The single proton on the carbon atom C1 (the one bonded to the aldehyde group) is also unique. This is **Set 2**.\n    *   **H2 and H5:** The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to the protons on C5. However, the two protons on C2 itself are not equivalent. They are diastereotopic because of their fixed, different spatial relationships to the aldehyde group (one is \"cis\" and one is \"trans\" to it in any given conformation). Therefore, they represent two distinct sets of protons.\n        *   The two \"cis-like\" protons (one on C2, one on C5) are equivalent to each other.

The two protons on C3 are also diastereotopic.\n        *   The two \"cis-like\" protons (one on C3, one on C4) are equivalent. This is **Set 5**.\n        *   The two \"trans-like\" protons (one on C3, one on C4) are equivalent. This is **Set 6**.\n\nIn total, there are 6 sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n1.

In cyclic α-halo ketones, this rearrangement leads to a contraction of the ring. Thus, the six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to form cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n3.  **Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine, forming cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3).** This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride.\n4.  **Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(OtBu)₃H), forming cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde (Product 4).** This reagent is a mild reducing agent known for the selective reduction of acyl chlorides to aldehydes.\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde**. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\nCyclopentanecarboxaldehyde has a plane of symmetry that includes the aldehyde group (CHO), the carbon it's attached to (C1), and the hydrogen on C1.

This gives **two distinct signals** for the C2/C5 positions.\n*   Similarly, the two protons on the next set of carbons (C3 and C4) are equivalent. The two protons on C3 are also diastereotopic. This results in another **two distinct signals** for the C3/C4 positions.\n\nCounting these up: 1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (C2/C5-H's) + 2 (C3/C4-H's) = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe search results confirm my revised reaction pathway.\n\n*   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine → 2-bromocyclohexanone (Product 1)**.

(1 distinct H)\n3.  **Beta Hydrogens**: The hydrogens on the two carbons adjacent to C1 (let's call them C2 and C5) are equivalent to each other due to the molecule having a plane of symmetry that passes through the C1-CHO bond and the C3-C4 bond (assuming rapid conformational averaging). However, on each of these carbons (C2 and C5), the two hydrogens are diastereotopic because of the chiral center at C1. One hydrogen is *cis* to the aldehyde group and the other is *trans*. The two *cis* hydrogens (one on C2, one on C5) are chemically equivalent to each other. The two *trans* hydrogens (one on C2, one on C5) are also chemically equivalent to each other, but distinct from the *cis* hydrogens. This gives two more sets of distinct hydrogens.

Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine to form 2-bromocyclohexanone (Product 1).\n2.  Product 1 is heated with sodium hydroxide, undergoing a Favorskii rearrangement to form cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Product 2).\n3.  Product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine to form cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3).\n4.  Product 3 is treated with the mild reducing agent Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, which reduces the acid chloride to an aldehyde, forming cyclopentanecarbaldehyde (Product 4).\n\nThe final product, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde, has the following hydrogen environments:\n*   The single aldehyde proton.\n*   The single proton on the carbon to which the aldehyde is attached (the alpha-carbon).\n*   The four protons on the two beta-carbons.

To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we analyze its structure:\n*   **H1**: The aldehyde proton (-CHO). This is a unique environment.\n*   **H2**: The proton on the carbon atom of the ring attached to the aldehyde group (Cα). This is also a unique environment.\n*   **H3 & H4**: The four protons on the two carbons adjacent to Cα (the β-carbons). Due to the chiral center at Cα, the two protons on each β-carbon are diastereotopic (not equivalent). However, due to a plane of symmetry in the time-averaged structure, the two β-carbons are equivalent. Therefore, the four β-protons are split into two sets of two equivalent protons.\n*   **H5 & H6**: The four protons on the two γ-carbons. Similar to the β-protons, these are split into two sets of two equivalent protons.\n\nCounting the distinct sets: 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (alpha) + 2 (beta sets) + 2 (gamma sets) = 6.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n### Reaction Analysis\n\n1.  **Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂):** This reaction is an α-halogenation of a ketone. Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine to form 2-bromocyclohexanone, which is **Product 1**.\n\n2.  **Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH):** When an α-halo ketone, like 2-bromocyclohexanone, is treated with a strong base such as NaOH, it undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the formation of a cyclopropanone intermediate, which then undergoes ring contraction. The six-membered ring of cyclohexanone contracts to a five-membered ring, forming cyclopentanecarboxylic acid as **Product 2**.\n\n3.  **Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Product 2) reacts with thionyl chloride in a standard conversion of a carboxylic acid to an acyl chloride. Pyridine is used to neutralize the HCl gas produced during the reaction. This yields cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride as **Product 3**.\n\n4.  **Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(OtBu)₃H):** This reagent is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce highly reactive acyl chlorides to aldehydes, and the reaction can be stopped at the aldehyde stage without further reduction to an alcohol.

(1 type)\n3.  **C2 and C5 Hydrogens:** The cyclopentane ring has a plane of symmetry passing through C1 and the aldehyde group. This makes the hydrogens on C2 equivalent to the hydrogens on C5. However, on each of these carbons, the two hydrogens are diastereotopic (one is *cis* to the aldehyde group, and one is *trans*). Therefore, the two *cis* hydrogens (on C2 and C5) form one set, and the two *trans* hydrogens form another set. (2 types)\n4.  **C3 and C4 Hydrogens:** Similarly, the hydrogens on C3 are equivalent to the hydrogens on C4 due to the plane of symmetry. Again, the two hydrogens on each of these carbons are diastereotopic. This gives two more sets of equivalent hydrogens. (2 types)\n\nCounting the distinct types:\n*   1 aldehyde hydrogen\n*   1 hydrogen on C1\n*   2 types of hydrogens on C2/C5\n*   2 types of hydrogens on C3/C4\n\nIn total, there are 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2)**\n\nThis is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. In this reaction, one of the alpha-hydrogens (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) is replaced by a bromine atom. The product is an α-haloketone.\n\n*   **Reactant**: Cyclohexanone\n*   **Reagent**: Br2\n*   **Product 1**: 2-bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n\nProduct 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) is an α-haloketone. When treated with a strong base like sodium hydroxide, it can undergo two possible reactions: elimination or Favorskii rearrangement.\n\n*   **Possibility A (Elimination)**: The base removes a proton from C3, and bromide is eliminated from C2 to form an α,β-unsaturated ketone, cyclohex-2-en-1-one.\n*   **Possibility B (Favorskii Rearrangement)**: This is a characteristic reaction for α-haloketones that have a proton on the other alpha-carbon (the α'-position, C6). The base (OH-) removes a proton from C6 to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbon bearing the bromine (C2) in an intramolecular S_N2 reaction, forming a bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one (a cyclopropanone intermediate). The hydroxide then attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to the opening of the strained cyclopropanone ring. This results in ring contraction. The six-membered ring becomes a five-membered ring with a carboxylate group. After protonation (during workup), the product is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\nGiven the typical course of organic synthesis problems, the more unique and named reaction, the Favorskii rearrangement, is the intended pathway. We will proceed with this assumption and check if it leads to one of the given answers.\n\n*   **Reactant**: 2-bromocyclohexanone (Product 1)\n*   **Reagent**: NaOH, heat\n*   **Reaction**: Favorskii Rearrangement\n*   **Product 2**: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine**\n\nThis is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Thionyl chloride (SOCl2) is the reagent for this transformation, and pyridine is a weak base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n\n*   **Reactant**: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Product 2)\n*   **Reagent**: SOCl2, pyridine\n*   **Product 3**: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)3)**\n\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is well-known for the selective reduction of acid chlorides to aldehydes. It is not strong enough to reduce the aldehyde further to an alcohol.\n\n*   **Reactant**: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3)\n*   **Reagent**: LiAlH(O-t-Bu)3\n*   **Product 4**: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nNow we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. We can do this by analyzing the symmetry of the molecule.\n\nThe structure is a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\nLet's label the carbons:\n*   C1 is the ring carbon bonded to the -CHO group.\n*   C2 and C5 are the adjacent ring carbons.\n*   C3 and C4 are the remaining two ring carbons.\n\nThe molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C1 carbon, its attached hydrogen, the entire aldehyde group, and bisects the C3-C4 bond. This symmetry makes certain positions equivalent.\n\n1.  **Aldehydic Proton**: The single hydrogen in the -CHO group is in a unique chemical environment. This is **1** distinct type of hydrogen.\n2.  **Methine Proton**: The single hydrogen on C1 is also in a unique environment, situated on the symmetry plane. This is a **2nd** distinct type of hydrogen.\n3.  **Alpha Protons (on C2 and C5)**: The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. However, the two hydrogens on C2 are diastereotopic (one is *cis* to the aldehyde group, one is *trans*). They are not chemically equivalent to each other. The same applies to C5. The *cis* proton on C2 is equivalent to the *cis* proton on C5, and the *trans* proton on C2 is equivalent to the *trans* proton on C5. This gives us **2** more distinct types of hydrogens. (Total so far: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4)\n4.  **Beta Protons (on C3 and C4)**: The plane of symmetry also makes C3 and C4 equivalent. Similar to the alpha protons, the two hydrogens on C3 are diastereotopic and not equivalent to each other. The protons on C3 are equivalent to their corresponding partners on C4. This gives us another **2** distinct types of hydrogens. (Total: 4 + 2 = 6)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nCounting all the distinct sets of hydrogen atoms:\n*   Set 1: Aldehyde H (1H)\n*   Set 2: C1-H (1H)\n*   Set 3: C2-H & C5-H (*cis* to CHO) (2H)\n*   Set 4: C2-H & C5-H (*trans* to CHO) (2H)\n*   Set 5: C3-H & C4-H (one diastereotopic position) (2H)\n*   Set 6: C3-H & C4-H (the other diastereotopic position) (2H)\n\nThere are a total of **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2)**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone, a six-membered ring with a ketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Bromine (Br2).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. In the presence of an acid or base catalyst, one of the alpha-hydrogens (on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-Bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n*   **Reactant:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone, an alpha-haloketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a strong base, with heating.\n*   **Reaction:** These conditions are characteristic of the **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n    1.  A strong base (OH-) removes an acidic proton from the other alpha-carbon (C6), forming an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate performs an intramolecular S_N2 attack on the carbon bearing the bromine (C2), displacing the bromide ion. This forms a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one).\n    3.  The hydroxide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon of the strained cyclopropanone.\n    4.  The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, cleaving the bond between the carbonyl carbon and the more substituted alpha-carbon to form the more stable carbanion. In this case, the ring opens to form a carbanion on a five-membered ring.\n    5.  Protonation (during workup) of the resulting carboxylate gives a carboxylic acid. The six-membered ring has contracted to a five-membered ring.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n    *   *Alternative consideration:* An E2 elimination to form cyclohex-2-enone is also possible. However, the reagent in the next step (SOCl2) strongly suggests the product is a carboxylic acid, making the Favorskii rearrangement the correct pathway.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagent:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl2) with pyridine.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard and efficient method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl). Pyridine is a base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)3)**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)3).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a mild reducing agent. Unlike the more powerful LiAlH4 which would reduce an acyl chloride to a primary alcohol, LiAlH(OtBu)3 is sterically hindered and less reactive. It is selective for the reduction of acyl chlorides to aldehydes. The reaction stops at the aldehyde stage.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nNow we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. \"Chemically distinct\" means the hydrogens are in non-equivalent chemical environments. This corresponds to the number of signals one would expect to see in a high-resolution proton NMR spectrum (assuming no accidental equivalence).\n\nThe structure is a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\nLet's analyze the symmetry of the molecule. Due to rapid conformational changes (ring puckering) at room temperature, the molecule has an effective plane of symmetry on the NMR timescale. This plane passes through the aldehyde group, the carbon it's attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond of the ring.\n\nLet's label the hydrogens and determine their equivalence based on this symmetry:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (CHO):** This proton is unique. It is on the plane of symmetry. (1 type)\n2.  **The proton on C1:** This is the single proton on the carbon atom of the ring that is bonded to the aldehyde group. It is also on the plane of symmetry and is unique. (1 type)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 (a methylene group) are not equivalent to each other. They are **diastereotopic** because C1 is a prochiral center in the context of the ring. One proton is *cis* and the other is *trans* to the aldehyde group in any given conformation. They are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation. Therefore, they are chemically distinct. By symmetry, the protons on C5 are equivalent to their counterparts on C2. This gives us two sets of equivalent protons. (2 types)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** The plane of symmetry makes C3 and C4 equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 positions, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. By symmetry, the protons on C4 are equivalent to their counterparts on C3. This gives us another two sets of equivalent protons. (2 types)\n\n**Counting the distinct types of hydrogens:**\n*   Type 1: Aldehyde H (1 proton in this set)\n*   Type 2: C1-H (1 proton in this set)\n*   Type 3: One set of H's on C2/C5 (2 protons in this set)\n*   Type 4: The other set of H's on C2/C5 (2 protons in this set)\n*   Type 5: One set of H's on C3/C4 (2 protons in this set)\n*   Type 6: The other set of H's on C3/C4 (2 protons in this set)\n\nTotal number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis is a multi-step organic synthesis problem. Let's determine the structure of each product in the sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1**\nThis reaction is the α-halogenation of a ketone. A hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-carbon) is replaced by a bromine atom. Cyclohexanone is symmetrical, so the reaction yields a single major product.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 + Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH), heat → Product 2**\nThis is a classic **Favorskii rearrangement**. An α-halo ketone with an available proton on the other α-carbon (the α'-carbon) rearranges in the presence of a strong base to form a carboxylic acid derivative with a contracted ring.\n1.  The base (OH⁻) removes a proton from the α'-carbon (C6) to form an enolate.\n2.  The enolate performs an intramolecular S_N2 attack, displacing the bromide and forming a strained bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate.\n3.  The hydroxide attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to the opening of the strained ring to form a more stable carbanion on a five-membered ring.\n4.  Upon workup (implicit), the resulting carboxylate is protonated.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 + Thionyl Chloride (SOCl₂) and Pyridine → Product 3**\nThis is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl).\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃) → Product 4**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is selective for the reduction of acid chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reaction at that stage without further reduction to an alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nNow, we must determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. We need to analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO), the ring carbon it is attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond. Hydrogens that can be interchanged by this symmetry operation are chemically equivalent.\n\n1.  **Aldehyde Hydrogen:** The hydrogen atom of the aldehyde group (-C**H**O) is unique. This is **1 type**.\n2.  **C1 Hydrogen:** The single hydrogen on the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde group is also in a unique environment. This is a **2nd type**.\n3.  **C2 and C5 Hydrogens:** Due to the plane of symmetry, C2 and C5 are equivalent. However, the two hydrogens on C2 are not equivalent to each other (they are diastereotopic). One is *cis* to the aldehyde group, and one is *trans*. The *cis*-H on C2 is equivalent to the *cis*-H on C5, and the *trans*-H on C2 is equivalent to the *trans*-H on C5. This gives us **two more types** of hydrogens.\n4.  **C3 and C4 Hydrogens:** Similarly, C3 and C4 are equivalent. The two hydrogens on C3 are also diastereotopic. The two hydrogens on C3 and C4 that are closer to C1 are equivalent, and the two that are further away are equivalent. This gives us the final **two types** of hydrogens.\n\nIn total, we have:\n*   1 type (aldehyde H)\n*   1 type (C1 H)\n*   2 types (from C2/C5 hydrogens)\n*   2 types (from C3/C4 hydrogens)\n\nTotal = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2)**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone, a six-membered cyclic ketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Bromine (Br2).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the α-halogenation of a ketone. In this reaction, a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon) is replaced by a bromine atom.

The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) removes the acidic proton from the α'-carbon (C6) to form an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate then performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 attack on the carbon bearing the bromine (C2), displacing the bromide ion and forming a bicyclic ketone intermediate (bicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-2-one).\n    3.  The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of this strained intermediate.\n    4.  The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, breaking the bond between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and the α'-carbon (C6) to relieve the strain of the three-membered ring. This ring-opening step forms a carbanion.\n    5.  Protonation of the carbanion (upon acidic workup, which is implicit) yields a carboxylic acid with a contracted ring system.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid. The six-membered ring has contracted to a five-membered ring.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagent:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard and efficient method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. SOCl₂ is the chlorinating agent, and pyridine acts as a base to neutralize the HCl gas produced as a byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃)**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a bulky, mild reducing agent. A key characteristic of LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃ is its ability to selectively reduce acyl chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the primary alcohol. This is a standard transformation taught in organic chemistry.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Final Analysis: Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)**\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\n```\n      O\n     //\n    C — H(a)\n    |\n   /C1\\ — H(b)\nH-C2--C5-H\n| |  | |\nH-C3--C4-H\n  \\----/\n```\n\nTo count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule.

This is **1 type**.\n3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** Due to the plane of symmetry, carbon C2 is equivalent to carbon C5. However, the two protons on C2 are not equivalent to each other. They are **diastereotopic** because of their spatial relationship to the substituent on the prochiral C1 carbon. The same applies to C5. Therefore, the protons on C2 and C5 give rise to **2 distinct types** of hydrogen signals.\n4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, the plane of symmetry makes carbon C3 equivalent to carbon C4.

(1 type)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** These two carbons are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons on each of these carbons (one pointing \"up\" and one \"down\" relative to the ring) are diastereotopic, meaning they are not equivalent to each other. Therefore, they represent two distinct types of protons. (2 types)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** These two carbons are also equivalent by symmetry. Similar to the C2/C5 protons, the two protons on each of these carbons are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct.

This is one distinct type of hydrogen.\n2.  **Proton on C1:** The hydrogen atom on the carbon of the ring directly attached to the aldehyde group (C1) is also in a unique environment. This is a second distinct type of hydrogen.\n3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** The cyclopentane ring has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C1-CHO bond and the C3-C4 bond axis (assuming rapid conformational averaging). This symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to the protons on C5. However, on each of these carbons, the two protons are diastereotopic (one is \"cis\" to the aldehyde group, and one is \"trans\"). Therefore, the two cis protons (on C2 and C5) form one set of equivalent hydrogens, and the two trans protons form another set. This gives us two more distinct types of hydrogens.\n4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** The same plane of symmetry makes the protons on C3 equivalent to the protons on C4. Similar to the C2/C5 positions, the two protons on each of these carbons are diastereotopic. The two \"cis\" protons (on C3 and C4) are equivalent to each other, and the two \"trans\" protons are equivalent to each other. This adds another two distinct types of hydrogens.\n\nIn total, we have:\n*   Set 1: Aldehyde H (1H)\n*   Set 2: C1-H (1H)\n*   Set 3: C2/C5 \"cis\" H's (2H)\n*   Set 4: C2/C5 \"trans\" H's (2H)\n*   Set 5: C3/C4 \"cis\" H's (2H)\n*   Set 6: C3/C4 \"trans\" H's (2H)\n\nThis gives a total of **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclohexanone (a ketone) and bromine.\n*   **Reaction:** This is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. In this reaction, a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon) is replaced by a bromine atom. Cyclohexanone is symmetrical, so bromination at either α-carbon (C2 or C6) yields the same product.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n*   **Reactants:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone and a strong base (NaOH) with heat.\n*   **Reaction:** This substrate, an α-halo ketone with an available proton on the other α-carbon (α' position), undergoes a classic reaction called the **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n    1.  The base (OH⁻) removes the acidic proton from the α'-carbon (C6) to form an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate then performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 attack on the carbon bearing the bromine (C2), displacing the bromide ion and forming a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one).\n    3.  The hydroxide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon of this strained intermediate.\n    4.  The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, and the bicyclic ring opens to form a more stable, rearranged carboxylate. The ring contracts from a six-membered ring to a five-membered ring.\n    5.  After an acidic workup (which is implied to isolate the neutral product), the carboxylate is protonated.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid, thionyl chloride, and pyridine.\n*   **Reaction:** This is the standard procedure for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl). Pyridine is used as a base to neutralize the HCl gas produced as a byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃)**\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride and Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LTBA).\n*   **Reaction:** LTBA is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the primary alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. We can do this by examining the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclopentane ring with an aldehyde group (-CHO) attached to one of the carbons.\n    *   The molecule has a total of 10 hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Symmetry:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C-CHO bond, the ring carbon it's attached to (C1), and bisects the opposite C-C bond (the C3-C4 bond).\n\nLet's identify the unique proton environments based on this symmetry:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton is unique as it is the only one bonded to a carbonyl carbon. (1 type)\n2.  **The methine proton on C1:** This is the proton on the ring carbon to which the aldehyde group is attached. It is in the plane of symmetry and is unique. (1 type)\n3.  **The methylene protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. However, on each of these carbons, the two protons are diastereotopic (they are in different chemical environments relative to the rest of the molecule). Let's call them H_axial and H_equatorial (in a simplified model). The two axial protons (one on C2, one on C5) are equivalent to each other. The two equatorial protons (one on C2, one on C5) are also equivalent to each other. But the axial and equatorial protons are distinct. This gives two more types of protons. (2 types)\n4.  **The methylene protons on C3 and C4:** The plane of symmetry also makes C3 and C4 equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 protons, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic, and the same is true for C4. Therefore, the protons on C3 and C4 also give rise to two distinct chemical environments. (2 types)\n\n**Counting the distinct types:**\n*   Type 1: Aldehyde H (1 proton)\n*   Type 2: C1-H (1 proton)\n*   Type 3: C2-Hₐ and C5-Hₐ (2 protons)\n*   Type 4: C2-Hₑ and C5-Hₑ (2 protons)\n*   Type 5: C3-Hₐ and C4-Hₐ (2 protons)\n*   Type 6: C3-Hₑ and C4-Hₑ (2 protons)\n\nIn total, there are **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in product 4.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the number of its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n### Reaction Analysis\n\n*   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine**\n    This reaction is the α-bromination of a ketone. One of the hydrogen atoms on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group is replaced by a bromine atom. This yields **2-bromocyclohexanone** as Product 1.\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide**\n    When an α-halo ketone like 2-bromocyclohexanone is treated with a base such as sodium hydroxide, it undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the contraction of the six-membered ring into a five-membered ring, forming a carboxylic acid derivative. The product of this step, Product 2, is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine**\n    Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid reacts with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) in a standard procedure to convert a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. Pyridine is typically added to neutralize the HCl byproduct. This reaction forms **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride** as Product 3.\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride**\n    Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃) is a mild reducing agent specifically used to reduce highly reactive acyl chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to an alcohol. Therefore, cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride is reduced to **cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde**, which is the final product, Product 4.\n\n### Analysis of Product 4\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde**. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must examine the molecule's structure and symmetry.\n\nThe structure consists of a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO). Due to the puckered nature of the cyclopentane ring and the presence of the substituent, not all hydrogen atoms are equivalent.\n\nWe can categorize the hydrogen atoms as follows:\n1.  **The aldehyde hydrogen (CHO):** This hydrogen is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n2.  **The hydrogen on the carbon attached to the aldehyde group (C1):** This methine hydrogen is also unique. (1 type)\n3.  **The hydrogens on the carbons adjacent to C1 (C2 and C5):** These two carbons are equivalent due to a plane of symmetry. However, the two hydrogens on each of these carbons (a total of four) are diastereotopic. This means the hydrogen pointing in one direction relative to the ring is different from the hydrogen pointing in the other direction. This results in two distinct types of hydrogens at these positions. (2 types)\n4.  **The hydrogens on the carbons beta to C1 (C3 and C4):** Similar to the positions above, these two carbons are equivalent. The two hydrogens on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This gives another two distinct types of hydrogens. (2 types)\n\nCounting these up: 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (on C1) + 2 (on C2/C5) + 2 (on C3/C4) = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:** The user wants to know the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in a final product (Product 4) which is formed through a four-step chemical synthesis. I need to determine the structure of each intermediate product to correctly identify Product 4. Then, I must analyze the structure of Product 4 to count its unique hydrogen environments, which corresponds to the number of signals in a proton NMR spectrum. Finally, I need to present this logic and the answer in a Python code block.\n\n2.  **Step-by-Step Reaction Analysis:**\n    *   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1.**\n        *   This is a classic alpha-halogenation of a ketone. Cyclohexanone is symmetrical, so bromination occurs at one of the alpha-carbons (the carbons next to the C=O group).\n        *   Product 1 is **2-bromocyclohexanone**.\n\n    *   **Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) + NaOH (heat) → Product 2.**\n        *   This involves an α-halo ketone and a base. There are two main possibilities: E2 elimination or a Favorskii rearrangement.\n        *   *Path A (Elimination):* The base could remove the other alpha-proton (at C6) to form an enone (cyclohex-2-en-1-one). If we follow this path, the final product is 1,3-cyclohexadiene, which has 4 types of distinct hydrogens (this is not an option).\n        *   *Path B (Favorskii Rearrangement):* This is a very common reaction for α-halo ketones that have a proton on the other α-carbon. The base (OH⁻) removes the proton at C6. The resulting enolate attacks the carbon bearing the bromine in an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, forming a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate. The nucleophilic base (OH⁻) then attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the three-membered ring opens to form the most stable carbanion, resulting in ring contraction. The six-membered ring becomes a five-membered ring.\n        *   The product is a cyclopentane ring with a carboxylate group.\n        *   Product 2 is **sodium cyclopentanecarboxylate**. Given the options, this pathway is the intended one.\n\n    *   **Step 3: Product 2 (sodium cyclopentanecarboxylate) + Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) + Pyridine → Product 3.**\n        *   Thionyl chloride is a standard reagent for converting carboxylic acids (or their salts) into acid chlorides. Pyridine is used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n        *   Product 3 is **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n\n    *   **Step 4: Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(OtBu)₃H) → Product 4.**\n        *   LiAl(OtBu)₃H is a bulky, mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes without over-reducing them to alcohols.\n        *   Product 4 is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Final Product's Structure:**\n    *   The final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. Its structure is a five-membered cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n    *   Now, I need to count the \"chemically distinct\" hydrogen atoms. This means finding all hydrogens that are in a unique chemical environment. We can use symmetry to help.\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (C-H-O) and the carbon of the ring it's attached to (C1). This plane bisects the ring through the C3-C4 bond.\n    *   Let's count the unique proton environments:\n        1.  **The aldehyde proton (H-C=O):** This is in a unique environment. (1 type)\n        2.  **The proton on C1:** This is the single proton on the carbon connecting the ring to the aldehyde. It's also unique. (1 type)\n        3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** These are the carbons adjacent to C1. Due to the plane of symmetry, C2 is equivalent to C5. However, on each of these carbons, there are two protons. Since C1 is a stereocenter, the two protons on C2 (and C5) are diastereotopic, meaning they are not equivalent to each other. So, we have one set of \"cis\" protons (on C2 and C5) and one set of \"trans\" protons (on C2 and C5). This gives 2 more types of hydrogens.\n        4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** These are the remaining two carbons. They are also equivalent by symmetry. Like C2/C5, the two protons on each of these carbons are diastereotopic. This gives another 2 types of hydrogens.\n    *   **Total Count:** 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n4.  **Final Check:** The calculated number is 6. This matches option D. The logic is sound and follows standard organic chemistry principles. I am ready to write the code.

A hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-carbon) is replaced by a bromine atom. Since cyclohexanone is symmetrical, the reaction yields 2-bromocyclohexanone as Product 1.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 to Product 2.** 2-bromocyclohexanone is heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This is a classic Favorskii rearrangement. The base removes the other α-proton (from C6), and the resulting enolate attacks the carbon with the bromine (C2), forming a strained bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one (a cyclopropanone intermediate). The hydroxide then attacks the carbonyl, and the ring opens to form the most stable carbanion, which results in a ring contraction. The six-membered ring becomes a five-membered ring. After protonation (implicit in the workup), Product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 to Product 3.** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine. This is a standard reaction to convert a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride.

This is a bulky, mild reducing agent that selectively reduces acid chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reaction at the aldehyde stage. Therefore, Product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n5.  **Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogens in Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde).** To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we analyze the symmetry of the molecule. At room temperature, the flexible cyclopentane ring undergoes rapid conformational changes (pseudorotation). This creates a time-averaged plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (-CHO) and the carbon it is attached to (C1).\n\n    *   This plane of symmetry makes C2 equivalent to C5, and C3 equivalent to C4.\n    *   Let's count the unique proton environments:\n        1.

The protons on **C2 and C5** are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, on each of these carbons, the two protons are diastereotopic (one is cis to the aldehyde group, the other is trans). This results in two sets of equivalent protons for these four positions. (2 types)\n        4.  Similarly, the protons on **C3 and C4** are equivalent. The four protons on these two carbons also give rise to two distinct signals.

This reaction involves the formation of a bicyclic intermediate (a cyclopropanone) which then opens up to form a ring-contracted carboxylic acid (after protonation). In this case, the six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to a five-membered ring.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine**\nThis is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride.

To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe structure is a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\n1.  **Aldehyde Proton:** The single proton of the aldehyde group (-CHO) is in a unique chemical environment. This is **one** type of hydrogen.\n2.  **Alpha-Proton:** The proton on the carbon atom of the ring to which the aldehyde group is attached (C1) is also unique. This is a **second** type of hydrogen.\n3.  **Beta-Protons:** The two carbon atoms adjacent to C1 (C2 and C5) are equivalent due to a plane of symmetry that bisects the molecule. However, the two protons on C2 are not equivalent to each other; they are diastereotopic because of the chiral center at C1. One proton is *cis* to the aldehyde group, and the other is *trans*. The same applies to the protons on C5. The *cis* proton on C2 is equivalent to the *cis* proton on C5, and the *trans* proton on C2 is equivalent to the *trans* proton on C5. This gives **two** more distinct types of hydrogens.\n4.  **Gamma-Protons:** The remaining two carbons (C3 and C4) are also equivalent due to the same plane of symmetry. Like the beta-protons, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic, as are the two on C4. This results in **two** additional distinct types of hydrogens.\n\nCounting them up:\n*   1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (alpha H) + 2 (beta H's) + 2 (gamma H's) = **6**\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions and the final determination of the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product.\n\n### Reaction Analysis\n\n*   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\n    This reaction is the α-halogenation of a ketone. One of the hydrogen atoms on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group is replaced by a bromine atom. This results in the formation of **2-bromocyclohexanone (Product 1)**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n    When an α-halo ketone, such as 2-bromocyclohexanone, is heated with a strong base like NaOH, it undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the formation of a cyclopropanone intermediate, which then opens up to form a ring-contracted carboxylic acid. In this case, the six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to a five-membered ring, yielding **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Product 2)**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n    This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the cyclopentanecarboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom, forming **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3)**. Pyridine is used to neutralize the HCl gas produced during the reaction.\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃)**\n    Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild reducing agent specifically used to reduce highly reactive acid chlorides to aldehydes, without further reduction to an alcohol. Therefore, it reduces cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride to **cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde (Product 4)**.\n\n### Analysis of Product 4\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde**. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to examine the molecule's structure and symmetry.\n\nThe structure of cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde (C₅H₉CHO) consists of a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO). The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group and the C-H bond of the carbon it's attached to (C1), bisecting the cyclopentane ring.\n\nDue to this plane of symmetry:\n*   The carbons C2 and C5 are equivalent.\n*   The carbons C3 and C4 are equivalent.\n\nNow let's count the sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms (protons that are in different electronic environments and would show separate signals in an NMR spectrum):\n\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton is unique.\n2.  **The proton on C1:** This proton is on the carbon attached to the aldehyde group. It lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique.\n3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** The two protons on C2 are not equivalent to each other; they are diastereotopic. One is *cis* to the aldehyde group and the other is *trans*. The same applies to C5. Because of the plane of symmetry, the two *cis* protons (one on C2, one on C5) are chemically equivalent to each other.\n4.  **Protons on C2 and C5 (continued):** Likewise, the two *trans* protons (one on C2, one on C5) are equivalent to each other, but they are in a different chemical environment than the *cis* protons. This gives a fourth distinct set of hydrogens.\n5.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** Similar to the C2/C5 positions, the protons on C3 and C4 are diastereotopic. The two *cis* protons (one on C3, one on C4) are equivalent to each other.\n6.  **Protons on C3 and C4 (continued):** The two *trans* protons (one on C3, one on C4) form the sixth and final set of chemically distinct hydrogens.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 6 chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nThe chemical synthesis proceeds through the following steps:\n\n1.  **Cyclohexanone treated with bromine:** This is an alpha-halogenation of a ketone, which forms 2-bromocyclohexanone (Product 1).\n2.  **Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone, an α-halo ketone, undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement in the presence of a strong base like NaOH. This reaction involves a ring contraction, yielding cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Product 2).\n3.  **Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid reacts with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) to form cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3). This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid to an acid chloride.\n4.  **Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃) is a mild reducing agent specifically used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes. Therefore, it reduces cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride to cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde (Product 4).\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde**. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's structure and symmetry.\n\nThe structure of cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde is a cyclopentane ring with a -CHO (aldehyde) group attached. The carbon atom of the ring that is attached to the aldehyde group (C1) is a chiral center. It is bonded to four different groups: the aldehyde group, a hydrogen atom, and two different paths around the ring (C2 and C5).\n\nBecause the molecule contains a chiral center, it lacks any plane of symmetry. In a molecule with no symmetry, all hydrogens that cannot be interchanged by bond rotation or rapid conformational changes are chemically distinct. Let's count them:\n\n*   **The aldehyde hydrogen (H-C=O):** This hydrogen is in a unique chemical environment. (1)\n*   **The hydrogen on C1:** This methine hydrogen is attached to the chiral center and is unique. (1)\n*   **The hydrogens on C2 and C5 (alpha-protons):** The two hydrogens on C2 are diastereotopic because of the adjacent chiral center. Similarly, the two hydrogens on C5 are diastereotopic. Furthermore, the C2 position and the C5 position are diastereotopic to each other. Thus, all four of these alpha-protons are chemically distinct. (4)\n*   **The hydrogens on C3 and C4 (beta-protons):** Due to the chirality at C1, the protons on C3 are also in a different chemical environment than those on C4. It is often assumed in introductory problems that the effect of a distant chiral center might become negligible, causing accidental equivalence. If we assume the four beta-protons become accidentally equivalent due to their distance from the chiral center, they would produce a single signal. (1)\n\nFollowing this reasoning, the total number of chemically distinct sets of hydrogens is 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1-H) + 4 (alpha-protons) + 1 (beta-protons) = 7.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of product 4 and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine (Br2) to form product 1.**\nThis reaction is the alpha-bromination of a ketone. In this process, one of the hydrogen atoms on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-carbon) is replaced by a bromine atom. Cyclohexanone is symmetrical, so bromination at either α-carbon (C2 or C6) yields the same product.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to form product 2.**\nProduct 1, an α-halo ketone, is treated with a strong base. There are two main possible reactions:\n1.  **Elimination:** The base removes a proton from the other α-carbon (C6), which is acidic, leading to an E2 elimination. This would form cyclohex-2-enone, an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n2.  **Favorskii Rearrangement:** This is a characteristic reaction of α-halo ketones with a base. The base removes a proton from the α-carbon that does not bear the halogen (C6). The resulting enolate undergoes an intramolecular S_N2 reaction, displacing the bromide to form a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one). The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to the opening of the strained cyclopropane ring. This rearrangement results in a ring contraction. The product, after protonation during workup, is a carboxylic acid with one fewer carbon in the ring.\n*   Starting with 2-bromocyclohexanone (a 6-membered ring), the Favorskii rearrangement yields **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid** (a 5-membered ring).\n\nGiven the context of multi-step synthesis problems, the Favorskii rearrangement is a more likely and specific reaction pathway than a simple elimination. As we will see, this pathway leads to one of the given answer choices.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine to form product 3.**\nThis is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl).\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)3) to form product 4.**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky and mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to alcohols.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Final Step: Determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4.**\nProduct 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. Its structure consists of a five-membered cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\nTo find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to analyze the molecule's symmetry. Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde has a plane of symmetry (C_s) that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO), the carbon it's attached to (C1), and the hydrogen atom on C1. This plane bisects the cyclopentane ring.\n\nLet's count the sets of equivalent protons based on this symmetry:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (H-C=O):** This proton is unique and lies on the plane of symmetry. This is one set.\n2.  **The proton on C1 (the carbon bearing the aldehyde group):** This proton is also unique and lies on the plane of symmetry. This is the second set.\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** These two carbons are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons on C2 are diastereotopic (they are in different chemical environments relative to the rest of the molecule). Let's call them H_A and H_B. Similarly, the protons on C5 are diastereotopic. By symmetry, H_A on C2 is equivalent to its counterpart on C5, and H_B on C2 is equivalent to its counterpart on C5. This gives us two more sets of distinct protons.\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** These two carbons are also equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. Similar to the C2/C5 case, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic, and they are different from the protons on C2/C5 because they are further from the aldehyde group. This gives us another two sets of distinct protons.\n\nIn summary, the distinct sets of hydrogen atoms are:\n*   Set 1: The single aldehyde proton (1H).\n*   Set 2: The single proton on C1 (1H).\n*   Set 3: Two protons, one on C2 and one on C5 (2H total).\n*   Set 4: Two protons, one on C2 and one on C5 (2H total).\n*   Set 5: Two protons, one on C3 and one on C4 (2H total).\n*   Set 6: Two protons, one on C3 and one on C4 (2H total).\n\nTherefore, there are a total of **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and count its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Br2 → Product 1**\nThis reaction is the alpha-bromination of a ketone. Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine (Br2) to replace one of the alpha-hydrogens with a bromine atom. Both alpha-positions are equivalent.\n*   **Product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone.**\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 + NaOH (heated) → Product 2**\nProduct 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) is an α-halo ketone. When treated with a strong base like sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and heated, it undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the formation of a cyclopropanone intermediate followed by ring-opening, resulting in a ring contraction.\n1.  The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) abstracts a proton from the other α-carbon (C6) to form an enolate.\n2.  The enolate undergoes an intramolecular S_N2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion to form a bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one intermediate.\n3.  The hydroxide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon of the strained cyclopropanone ring.\n4.  The intermediate collapses, and the ring opens to form a more stable carbanion, leading to the formation of a cyclopentanecarboxylate salt.\n5.  Upon acidic workup (implied), this gives the corresponding carboxylic acid.\n*   **Product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.**\nAn alternative elimination reaction to form cyclohex-2-en-1-one is less likely as the subsequent reaction with SOCl₂ strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid or alcohol, and the Favorskii rearrangement is a classic reaction for this type of substrate and conditions.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 + SOCl2, pyridine → Product 3**\nProduct 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine. This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride.\n*   R-COOH + SOCl₂ → R-COCl + SO₂ + HCl\n*   **Product 3 is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.**\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride → Product 4**\nProduct 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃). This is a sterically hindered and mild reducing agent. It is known for its selectivity in reducing acyl chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reduction at the aldehyde stage without proceeding to the primary alcohol (which would happen with a stronger reducing agent like LiAlH₄).\n*   R-COCl + LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃ → R-CHO\n*   **Product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.**\n\n**Step 5: Counting the chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in Product 4**\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe structure is a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\n```\n      H(a)\n      |\n      C=O\n      |\nH(b)-C(1)----C(2)-H(c,d)\n    |        |\nH(i,j)-C(5)----C(3)-H(e,f)\n      \\      /\n       C(4)\n       |\n      H(g,h)\n```\n\nAlthough the cyclopentane ring is not planar, it undergoes rapid conformational changes (pseudorotation) at room temperature. On the NMR timescale, the molecule behaves as if it has a plane of symmetry (a C_s plane). This plane passes through the aldehyde group (CHO), the carbon it's attached to (C1), and the hydrogen on C1 (H(b)). This plane bisects the C3-C4 bond.\n\nDue to this plane of symmetry:\n*   Carbon C2 is equivalent to Carbon C5.\n*   Carbon C3 is equivalent to Carbon C4.\n\nNow let's count the distinct types of hydrogen atoms:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (H(a))**: This proton is unique in its chemical environment. (1 signal)\n2.  **The proton on C1 (H(b))**: This proton is also unique, being the only one on this methine carbon. (1 signal)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5**: Let's consider the two protons on C2. They are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation and are in different spatial relationships to the rest of the molecule (e.g., one is 'cis' and one is 'trans' to the aldehyde group in the average structure). Thus, they are diastereotopic and chemically distinct. Because C2 and C5 are equivalent by symmetry, the 'cis' proton on C2 is equivalent to the 'cis' proton on C5, and the 'trans' proton on C2 is equivalent to the 'trans' proton on C5. Therefore, these four protons give rise to two distinct signals. (2 signals)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4**: Similarly, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. By symmetry, they are equivalent to their respective counterparts on C4. Therefore, these four protons also give rise to two distinct signals. (2 signals)\n\nTotal number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\nThese 6 distinct types of hydrogens correspond to 6 signals in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA) 8 - This would be the answer if the product was cyclopentylmethanol.\nB) 7 - An unlikely number based on the molecule's symmetry.\nC) 10 - This is the total number of hydrogen atoms in the molecule, not the number of distinct types.\nD) 6 - This matches our analysis.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning for the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1**\nThis reaction is the α-bromination of a ketone. A hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon) is substituted with a bromine atom. Since cyclohexanone is symmetric, the reaction occurs at either of the equivalent α-positions.\n*   **Product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone.**\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) + NaOH, heat → Product 2**\nThis is a classic organic reaction known as the **Favorskii rearrangement**. When an α-halo ketone with an available proton on the other α-carbon is treated with a strong base (like NaOH), it undergoes a ring contraction. The six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to form a five-membered ring derivative. After an acidic workup (which is implied in such sequences), the product is a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.**\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) + Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) / Pyridine → Product 3**\nThis is a standard method to convert a carboxylic acid into a more reactive acid chloride. Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) replaces the -OH group with a -Cl atom. Pyridine acts as a base to neutralize the HCl gas that is formed as a byproduct.\n*   **Product 3 is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.**\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃) → Product 4**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky, mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to selectively reduce highly reactive acid chlorides to aldehydes. It is not powerful enough to reduce the aldehyde further to an alcohol.\n*   **Product 4 is cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde.**\n\n**Analysis of Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde) for Chemically Distinct Hydrogens**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of sets of chemically non-equivalent hydrogen atoms in the final product. We do this by examining the molecule's symmetry.\n\n1.  **Structure:** Cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde has a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n2.  **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that runs through the aldehyde group (H-C=O), the C-C bond connecting the ring to the aldehyde, and bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n3.  **Counting Distinct Hydrogens:**\n    *   **The aldehyde hydrogen (-CHO):** This hydrogen is in a unique chemical environment. It lies on the plane of symmetry. This is **one** type.\n    *   **The hydrogen on C1:** The hydrogen on the ring carbon (C1) that is bonded to the aldehyde group is also unique and lies on the plane of symmetry. This is a **second** type.\n    *   **The hydrogens on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. However, the two hydrogens on C2 are diastereotopic (they are not equivalent to each other because C1 is a stereocenter). The same applies to C5. Therefore, the two \"upper\" hydrogens (on C2 and C5) form one equivalent set, and the two \"lower\" hydrogens form another equivalent set. This gives **two** more types of hydrogens.\n    *   **The hydrogens on C3 and C4:** Similarly, C3 and C4 are equivalent by symmetry. The two hydrogens on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This gives another **two** types of hydrogens.\n\n**Total Count:**\nSumming up the distinct types: 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (on C1) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the final product and determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclohexanone (a ketone) and Bromine (Br₂).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the α-bromination of a ketone. The bromine atom substitutes a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon). Cyclohexanone is symmetrical, so the two α-carbons (C2 and C6) are equivalent.\n*   **Product 1:** The product is 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 2-bromocyclohexanone (an α-halo ketone) and sodium hydroxide (a strong base), with heat.\n*   **Reaction:** When an α-halo ketone with available protons on the other α'-carbon is treated with a strong base, a Favorskii rearrangement is a very common outcome.\n    1.  The base (OH⁻) removes a proton from the α'-carbon (C6), forming an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate attacks the carbon bearing the bromine (C2) in an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion and forming a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one).\n    3.  The hydroxide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon of the strained cyclopropanone.\n    4.  The three-membered ring opens to relieve ring strain, leading to the formation of a more stable carbanion. This results in the contraction of the six-membered ring into a five-membered ring.\n    5.  Protonation of the resulting carboxylate yields a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Product 2:** The product is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n    *   *Alternative consideration:* An elimination reaction (E2) could also occur to form cyclohex-2-en-1-one. However, the subsequent reaction steps are characteristic for a carboxylic acid, making the Favorskii rearrangement the intended pathway.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid and thionyl chloride with pyridine.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard and highly efficient method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) is the chlorinating agent, and pyridine is a base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** The product is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(OtBu)₃H)**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride and Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride.\n*   **Reaction:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky, mild reducing agent specifically used for the selective reduction of acid chlorides to aldehydes. It is less reactive than LiAlH₄ and stops the reduction at the aldehyde stage without proceeding to the alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** The product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclopentane ring is attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (C=O and its H), the C1 carbon of the ring (the one attached to the aldehyde), and the H attached to C1.

(1 type)\n2.  **The proton on C1:** This proton is on the plane of symmetry and is unique. (1 type)\n3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** Due to the plane of symmetry, C2 and C5 are equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 (and C5) are not equivalent to each other. They are diastereotopic because one is \"cis\" and one is \"trans\" relative to the aldehyde group on the adjacent carbon. Therefore, the four protons on C2 and C5 constitute two distinct sets. (2 types)\n4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** Due to the plane of symmetry, C3 and C4 are equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 case, the two protons on C3 (and C4) are diastereotopic. Therefore, the four protons on C3 and C4 constitute two distinct sets.

Thionyl chloride is the chlorinating agent, and pyridine is used as a base. The product is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (product 3).\n\n*   **Step 4: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(OtBu)3H)**\n    Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky and mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce highly reactive acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to an alcohol. Therefore, cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride is reduced to cyclopentanecarbaldehyde (product 4).\n\n**Analysis of Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)**\n\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde (C5H9CHO) features a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO). The carbon atom of the ring bonded to the aldehyde group (C1) is a chiral center. This is because it is attached to four different groups:\n1.  A hydrogen atom\n2.  An aldehyde group (-CHO)\n3.  The C2-C3-C4 portion of the ring\n4.  The C5-C4-C3 portion of the ring\n\nThe presence of this single chiral center makes the entire molecule chiral and removes all elements of symmetry (like planes or axes of symmetry). In a molecule with no symmetry, all protons that cannot be interconverted by bond rotation or a symmetry operation are chemically distinct.\n\nLet's count the hydrogen atoms based on their unique chemical environments:\n*   **Aldehyde proton:** The single proton of the -CHO group is unique.

Because there is no symmetry to interconvert C2 and C5, the C2 protons are also different from the C5 protons.\n    *   The same logic applies to the protons on C3 and C4. The two protons on C3 are diastereotopic, as are the two on C4.

In this process, a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an alpha-hydrogen) is replaced by a bromine atom. This results in the formation of **2-bromocyclohexanone (Product 1)**.\n\n**Step 2: 2-bromocyclohexanone heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n\nWhen an α-halo ketone with an available proton on its other α-carbon is treated with a strong base like NaOH, it undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement. This is a well-documented reaction that involves a ring contraction. The six-membered cyclohexanone ring contracts to form a five-membered ring derivative. The product is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Product 2)**.\n\n**Step 3: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n\nThis is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. The hydroxyl (-OH) group of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom. Pyridine is often used to neutralize the HCl byproduct. The resulting molecule is **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3)**.\n\n**Step 4: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(OtBu)₃H)**\n\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky, mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce reactive acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to an alcohol. Therefore, it reduces cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride to **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde (Product 4)**.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nTo determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde, we must examine its structure and symmetry.\n\nThe molecule consists of a five-membered cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO). There is a plane of symmetry that runs through the aldehyde group, the carbon it's attached to (C1), and the hydrogen on C1, bisecting the ring.\n\nDue to this symmetry:\n*   The **aldehyde hydrogen** is unique. (1 set)\n*   The **hydrogen on C1** (the carbon attached to the aldehyde) is unique. (2nd set)\n*   The carbons C2 and C5 are equivalent. However, the two hydrogens on C2 are diastereotopic (not equivalent) because of their spatial relationship to the rest of the molecule. The same is true for C5. By symmetry, the two \"upper\" hydrogens on C2 and C5 are equivalent to each other, and the two \"lower\" hydrogens are equivalent to each other. This gives two more sets of hydrogens. (3rd and 4th sets)\n*   The carbons C3 and C4 are equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 positions, the geminal hydrogens on C3 (and C4) are diastereotopic. The two \"upper\" hydrogens on C3 and C4 are equivalent, and the two \"lower\" hydrogens are equivalent. This provides the final two sets. (5th and 6th sets)\n\nCounting these sets, we have a total of **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\nThis reaction is the alpha-bromination of a ketone, which results in the substitution of a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group with a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\nWhen an α-halo ketone, such as 2-bromocyclohexanone, is treated with a strong base like NaOH, it undergoes a reaction known as the Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the formation of a bicyclic intermediate which then rearranges to form a ring-contracted carboxylic acid (after an acidic workup, which is implicit in such sequences). Therefore, the six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to a five-membered ring.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\nThis is a standard method to convert a carboxylic acid into a more reactive acid chloride. The thionyl chloride replaces the hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid with a chlorine atom.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃)**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce reactive acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to an alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n**Determining the Number of Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to analyze the molecule's structure and symmetry. Chemically distinct hydrogens will appear as separate signals in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nThe structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde is a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO). Due to the molecule's structure and the rapid conformational changes of the ring, we can identify the following sets of unique protons:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (1H):** This proton is attached to the carbonyl carbon and is in a unique chemical environment.\n2.  **The proton on C1 of the ring (1H):** This is the single hydrogen on the carbon atom to which the aldehyde group is attached. It is also in a unique environment.\n3.  **The alpha-protons (4H):** These are the four hydrogens on the two carbons adjacent to C1 (C2 and C5). Due to molecular symmetry, the two protons on C2 are equivalent to the two on C5. However, on each of these carbons, the two protons themselves are not equivalent (they are diastereotopic). This results in two distinct sets of protons.\n4.  **The beta-protons (4H):** These are the four hydrogens on the carbons further from the aldehyde group (C3 and C4). Similar to the alpha-protons, the protons on C3 are equivalent to those on C4. Within each of these CH₂ groups, the two protons are diastereotopic, creating two more distinct sets of protons.\n\nCounting these sets gives us the total number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms:\n*   1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (alpha-protons sets) + 2 (beta-protons sets) = **6**\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nThis problem requires us to follow a four-step reaction sequence and then determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product by analyzing its symmetry.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1**\nThis is the acid-catalyzed (often by trace HBr) alpha-halogenation of a ketone. Cyclohexanone is a symmetrical ketone, so bromination occurs at one of the equivalent alpha-carbons (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-Bromocyclohexanone) + NaOH/heat → Product 2**\nThis is a reaction of an α-halo ketone with a strong base (NaOH). The conditions are classic for a **Favorskii rearrangement**.\nIn this reaction, the base abstracts a proton from the other α-carbon (C6). The resulting enolate performs an intramolecular S_N2 reaction, displacing the bromide and forming a strained bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one). The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of this intermediate. The subsequent ring-opening of the cyclopropanone ring results in a ring contraction. The most stable product is formed, which is a cyclopentane ring with a carboxylic acid group (after neutralization/workup).\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*(Note: An E2 elimination to form cyclohex-2-en-1-one is also possible, but it does not react in a standard way with thionyl chloride in the next step. The Favorskii rearrangement is the most plausible pathway given the entire sequence.)*\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) + Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) / Pyridine → Product 3**\nThis is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Thionyl chloride is the chlorinating agent, and pyridine is a base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(OtBu)₃H) → Product 4**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a sterically hindered and mild reducing agent. Its most common and specific use in organic synthesis is the reduction of acid chlorides to aldehydes. It is not strong enough to reduce the aldehyde further to an alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nNow we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. We do this by analyzing the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe structure is a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO). Due to rapid conformational flipping (pseudorotation) at room temperature, the molecule has an effective plane of symmetry. This plane passes through the aldehyde group (CHO), the carbon of the ring it's attached to (C1), the hydrogen on C1, and it bisects the rest of the ring.\n\nLet's label the protons and identify the unique sets:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (CHO):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. (1 set)\n2.  **The proton on C1:** This is the only proton directly attached to the ring at the point of substitution (a methine proton). It is unique. (1 set)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. Each of these carbons has two protons. The two protons on C2 are diastereotopic (one is cis and one is trans to the aldehyde group, in a simplified view). They are not equivalent to each other. The same applies to C5. The cis-proton on C2 is equivalent to the cis-proton on C5, and the trans-proton on C2 is equivalent to the trans-proton on C5. Therefore, these four protons form two distinct sets. (2 sets)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** The plane of symmetry also makes C3 and C4 equivalent. Like C2/C5, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic, as are the two on C4. These four protons also form two distinct sets. These sets are different from the C2/C5 protons because they are further from the electron-withdrawing aldehyde group.

The product (1) is 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide.** When 2-bromocyclohexanone is treated with a strong base like sodium hydroxide, it undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the contraction of the six-membered ring to a five-membered ring, forming cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (after neutralization). Therefore, product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine.** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid reacts with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) to form an acyl chloride. This is a standard method for this conversion. The resulting product (3) is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride.** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride is an acid chloride. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O*t*-Bu)₃) is a mild reducing agent that selectively reduces acid chlorides to aldehydes. It is not strong enough to reduce the aldehyde further to an alcohol. Thus, the final product (4) is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n### Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's structure and symmetry. Chemically distinct hydrogens are those in different electronic environments, which give rise to separate signals in an ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nThe structure is a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\n1.  **The Aldehyde Proton:** The hydrogen atom of the aldehyde group (H-C=O) is in a unique chemical environment. This accounts for **one** type of hydrogen.\n2.  **The Ring Protons:** The carbon atom on the ring attached to the aldehyde group (C1) is a chiral center (it is attached to four different groups: the CHO group, an H atom, C2, and C5 of the ring). The presence of this chiral center means the molecule is asymmetric. In an achiral environment, all the other carbons in the ring (C2, C3, C4, C5) are chemically non-equivalent.\n    *   **Proton on C1:** The single hydrogen attached to C1 is unique. This is a **second** type of hydrogen.\n    *   **Protons on C2, C3, C4, and C5:** Since C1 is a stereocenter, the two protons on each of the adjacent methylene (CH₂) groups (C2 and C5) are diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically distinct from each other. Similarly, the protons on C3 and C4 are also diastereotopic. Because the entire ring is rendered asymmetric by the C1 stereocenter, none of the methylene groups are equivalent to each other.\n        *   Protons on C2: 2 distinct hydrogens.\n        *   Protons on C3: 2 distinct hydrogens.\n        *   Protons on C4: 2 distinct hydrogens.\n        *   Protons on C5: 2 distinct hydrogens.\n\nSumming these up:\n*   Aldehyde H: 1\n*   C1-H: 1\n*   C2-H₂: 2\n*   C3-H₂: 2\n*   C4-H₂: 2\n*   C5-H₂: 2\n\nTotal number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nTo determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4, we must first identify the structure of product 4 by following the reaction sequence.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Step 1: Cyclohexanone to Product 1.** Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine (Br₂) in an alpha-halogenation reaction. One hydrogen on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an alpha-carbon) is replaced by a bromine atom. This yields **2-bromocyclohexanone**.\n2.  **Step 2: Product 1 to Product 2.** 2-bromocyclohexanone is heated with a strong base, sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This condition promotes a Favorskii rearrangement. The base removes the other alpha-proton, forming an enolate which then undergoes an intramolecular cyclization to form a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate. This strained intermediate is then attacked by hydroxide, leading to ring-opening and the formation of a carboxylate salt. After workup, the product is a cyclopentane ring with a carboxylic acid group. So, Product 2 is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n3.  **Step 3: Product 2 to Product 3.** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine. This is a standard method to convert a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. Product 3 is **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n4.  **Step 4: Product 3 to Product 4.** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃). This is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent that selectively reduces acyl chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the alcohol. Therefore, Product 4 is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n5.  **Final Analysis:** Now we must count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (-CHO) and the C1 carbon it's attached to.\n    *   **Hydrogen 1:** The aldehyde proton (-C**H**O) is in a unique chemical environment.\n    *   **Hydrogen 2:** The proton on C1 (the carbon attached to the aldehyde) is also unique as it lies on the plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Hydrogens 3 & 4:** The carbons C2 and C5 are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, because C1 is a stereocenter, the two hydrogens on C2 are diastereotopic (chemically non-equivalent). The same applies to C5. The \"cis\" protons on C2 and C5 are equivalent to each other, and the \"trans\" protons on C2 and C5 are equivalent to each other. This gives two more distinct sets of hydrogens.\n    *   **Hydrogens 5 & 6:** Similarly, carbons C3 and C4 are equivalent. The two hydrogens on C3 are also diastereotopic. The \"cis\" protons on C3 and C4 are equivalent, and the \"trans\" protons on C3 and C4 are equivalent. This gives another two distinct sets of hydrogens.\n    *   **Total Count:** 1 (aldehyde-H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (C2/C5-H sets) + 2 (C3/C4-H sets) = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in a final product\n# of a multi-step organic synthesis.\n\n# Step 1: Determine the structure of the final product, Product 4.\n# Reaction 1: Cyclohexanone + Br2 -> Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone)\n# Reaction 2: Product 1 + NaOH, heat -> Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid via Favorskii rearrangement)\n# Reaction 3: Product 2 + SOCl2 -> Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride)\n# Reaction 4: Product 3 + LiAlH(O-t-Bu)3 -> Product 4 (cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)\nfinal_product = \"cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\"\n\n# Step 2: Analyze the structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde to count chemically distinct hydrogens.\n# The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C1-CHO bond.\n# We count the unique hydrogen environments (sets of hydrogens that are not interchangeable by symmetry).\n\n# H on the aldehyde group (-CHO): This is one unique environment.\naldehyde_h = 1\n\n# H on the carbon attached to the aldehyde group (C1): This H lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique.\nc1_h = 1\n\n# H's on the carbons adjacent to C1 (C2 and C5).\n# C2 and C5 are equivalent by symmetry.\n# The two H's on C2 are diastereotopic because C1 is a stereocenter.

The subsequent reaction steps confirm this pathway.\n    *   **Mechanism of Favorskii Rearrangement:**\n        1.  The base (OH⁻) removes an acidic proton from the other α-carbon (C6), forming an enolate.\n        2.  The enolate undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, where the carbanion attacks the carbon bearing the bromine, displacing the bromide ion and forming a strained bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one).\n        3.  The hydroxide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon of the cyclopropanone.\n        4.  The ring opens to relieve strain, typically breaking the bond that leads to a more stable carbanion. This results in the formation of a five-membered ring (cyclopentane) with a carboxylate group.\n*   **Product 2:** After an acidic workup (which is implied to neutralize the base and protonate the carboxylate), the product is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 was treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine, forming 3.**\n*   **Reactants:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Product 2), thionyl chloride (SOCl₂), and pyridine.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride (or acid chloride).

These two protons are **diastereotopic**. They are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation and have different spatial relationships to the rest of the molecule (e.g., one is cis-like, the other trans-like to the bulky aldehyde group). Therefore, they are chemically distinct and would give separate NMR signals. Since C2 and C5 are equivalent, the four protons at these two positions account for **two** distinct types of hydrogen.\n    4.  **C3 and C4 Protons:** Similarly, C3 is equivalent to C4 by symmetry. The two geminal protons on C3 are diastereotopic to each other. The same applies to C4.

To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product (Product 4), we must first determine the structure of Product 4 by identifying the product of each reaction step.\n\n*   **Step 1: cyclohexanone + bromine (Br₂) → Product 1**\n    *   This reaction is the alpha-bromination of a ketone. In this reaction, a bromine atom replaces a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon).\n    *   Cyclohexanone is symmetric, so bromination at either α-carbon (C2 or C6) yields the same product.\n    *   **Product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone.**\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) + sodium hydroxide (NaOH), heat → Product 2**\n    *   This step involves an α-halo ketone with a strong base (NaOH). There are two primary competing reaction pathways:\n        1.  **E2 Elimination:** The base abstracts a proton from the carbon beta to the bromine (C3) to form an α,β-unsaturated ketone, which would be cyclohex-2-enone.\n        2.  **Favorskii Rearrangement:** The base abstracts a proton from the other α-carbon (C6), which is more acidic. The resulting enolate undergoes an internal nucleophilic attack, displacing the bromide and forming a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate. This intermediate is then attacked by hydroxide and rearranges, leading to a ring contraction. The final product after acidic workup (implicit in this type of reaction) is a carboxylic acid.\n    *   For 2-bromocyclohexanone, the Favorskii rearrangement leads to **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n    *   **Which pathway is more likely?** The subsequent reaction steps provide a strong clue. Step 3 uses SOCl₂ and step 4 uses LiAlH(OtBu)₃. This specific sequence of reagents is classic for the conversion of a carboxylic acid to an aldehyde (Carboxylic Acid → Acyl Chloride → Aldehyde). This strongly suggests that Product 2 is a carboxylic acid, making the Favorskii rearrangement the intended pathway.\n    *   **Product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.**\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) + thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine → Product 3**\n    *   This is a standard conversion of a carboxylic acid to an acyl chloride. Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) replaces the -OH group of the carboxylic acid with a -Cl atom. Pyridine acts as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n    *   **Product 3 is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.**\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃) → Product 4**\n    *   Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky, mild reducing agent. Its most characteristic use is the reduction of acyl chlorides to aldehydes. It is less reactive than LiAlH₄ and will stop at the aldehyde stage without further reduction to the alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.**\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the structure of the final product (Product 4)**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. Its structure consists of a five-membered cyclopentane ring with an aldehyde group (-CHO) attached to one of the carbons.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms**\n\nTo find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to examine the symmetry of the cyclopentanecarbaldehyde molecule.\n\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry. This plane passes through the aldehyde group (H-C=O), the C-C bond connecting the aldehyde to the ring, the hydrogen atom on that ring carbon (C1), and it bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n*   **Consequences of Symmetry:** This symmetry plane makes pairs of atoms and groups equivalent.\n    *   The carbon C1 (attached to CHO) is unique.\n    *   Carbon C2 is equivalent to C5.\n    *   Carbon C3 is equivalent to C4.\n\n*   **Counting Distinct Hydrogens:**\n    1.  **Aldehyde Hydrogen (-CHO):** This hydrogen is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n    2.  **Hydrogen on C1:** The hydrogen atom attached to C1 (the same carbon as the aldehyde group) lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. (1 type)\n    3.  **Hydrogens on C2 and C5:** C2 and C5 are equivalent by symmetry. On any single one of these carbons (e.g., C2), the two hydrogen atoms are diastereotopic because of the chiral center at C1 (C1 is a prochiral center). This means they are not equivalent to each other. Let's call them H2-cis and H2-trans (relative to the aldehyde group). Due to the symmetry plane, H2-cis is equivalent to H5-cis, and H2-trans is equivalent to H5-trans. Therefore, these four hydrogens constitute two distinct sets. (2 types)\n    4.  **Hydrogens on C3 and C4:** C3 and C4 are equivalent by symmetry. Similar to the C2/C5 case, the two hydrogens on C3 are diastereotopic. This gives rise to two more distinct sets of hydrogens. (2 types)\n\n*   **Total Count:** Summing up the distinct types of hydrogen atoms:\n    *   1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in the final product, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nBased on the established reaction sequence, the final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. The detailed analysis of its structure and the chemical equivalence of its hydrogen atoms leads to the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-step reaction analysis:**\n1.  **Cyclohexanone + Bromine → Product 1 (2-Bromocyclohexanone):** This is the α-bromination of a ketone.\n2.  **Product 1 + NaOH (heated) → Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid):** Heating 2-bromocyclohexanone with a base like sodium hydroxide results in a Favorskii rearrangement, which is a ring-contraction reaction.\n3.  **Product 2 + Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine → Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride):** This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into its more reactive acid chloride derivative.\n4.  **Product 3 + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(OtBu)₃H) → Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde):** This specific, bulky hydride is a mild reducing agent used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the alcohol.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde):**\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\n1.  The hydrogen atom of the aldehyde group (–CHO) is in a unique chemical environment. (1 signal)\n2.  The hydrogen atom on the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde group (C1) is also unique. This carbon is a stereocenter as it is bonded to four different groups (H, CHO, C2 of the ring, and C5 of the ring). (1 signal)\n3.  The presence of this chiral center at C1 means the molecule has no plane of symmetry.\n4.  Consequently, the positions adjacent to the stereocenter, C2 and C5, are not equivalent (they are diastereotopic positions). The two hydrogens on C2 are diastereotopic to each other, giving two signals. The two hydrogens on C5 are also diastereotopic and are not equivalent to the C2 protons, yielding another two distinct signals.\n5.  Similarly, because C2 and C5 are non-equivalent, their neighbors (C3 and C4) are also in non-equivalent positions. The two hydrogens on C3 are diastereotopic (2 signals), and the two hydrogens on C4 are diastereotopic (2 signals).\n\nHowever, a common scenario in NMR spectroscopy is that the chemical shift difference becomes negligible for protons that are further away from the chiral center, due to rapid conformational averaging of the ring. A plausible interpretation, which leads to one of the multiple-choice answers, is as follows:\n\n*   **Aldehyde H:** 1 distinct signal.\n*   **C1-H:** 1 distinct signal.\n*   **C2-H₂ and C5-H₂:** The carbons C2 and C5 are adjacent to the stereocenter and are considered non-equivalent. The geminal protons on each of these carbons are diastereotopic. This results in 2 signals from C2 and 2 signals from C5, for a total of 4 signals from these four protons.\n*   **C3-H₂ and C4-H₂:** These carbons are further from the stereocenter. It is plausible that rapid ring puckering averages their environments, making them chemically equivalent. The four protons on these two carbons would thus give rise to only 2 distinct signals (as the geminal protons remain diastereotopic).\n\nSumming these up gives: 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1) + 2 (C2) + 2 (C5) + 2 (from C3/C4 combined) = 8 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the number of its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine**\nCyclohexanone reacts with bromine (Br₂) in an alpha-halogenation reaction. This places a bromine atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide**\nWhen an α-halo ketone, such as 2-bromocyclohexanone, is treated with a strong base like sodium hydroxide, it undergoes a classic reaction known as the Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the formation of a cyclopropanone intermediate, followed by nucleophilic attack by hydroxide and subsequent ring-opening, which results in a ring contraction. The six-membered cyclohexanone ring is converted into a five-membered cyclopentane ring with a carboxylic acid group.\n\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine**\nThis is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. The thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) chlorinates the carboxylic acid, with pyridine acting as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(Ot-Bu)₃) is a mild reducing agent specifically used to reduce highly reactive acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to an alcohol. The bulky tert-butoxy groups moderate the reactivity of the hydride reagent.\n\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n**Determining the Number of Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe cyclopentanecarbaldehyde molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO) and the C1 carbon it's attached to, bisecting the ring. This symmetry makes certain pairs of protons chemically equivalent.\n\n1.  **Aldehyde proton:** The single proton of the -CHO group is in a unique chemical environment. (1 distinct type)\n2.  **C1 proton:** The single proton on the carbon to which the aldehyde is attached (C1) is also unique. (1 distinct type)\n3.  **C2 and C5 protons:** The protons on C2 and C5 are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons on C2 itself are not equivalent (they are diastereotopic) because C1 is a stereocenter. This means the proton \"cis\" to the aldehyde group has a different chemical shift from the proton that is \"trans\". This gives two sets of equivalent protons: the two \"cis\" protons on C2/C5 are one type, and the two \"trans\" protons on C2/C5 are another type. (2 distinct types)\n4.  **C3 and C4 protons:** Similarly, the protons on C3 and C4 are equivalent to each other by symmetry. The two protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This results in two more distinct proton types: the two \"cis-like\" protons on C3/C4 and the two \"trans-like\" protons on C3/C4. (2 distinct types)\n\nCounting these up: 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1) + 2 (C2/C5) + 2 (C3/C4) = **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 4 and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone was treated with bromine, forming product 1.**\nThis reaction is the acid-catalyzed α-halogenation of a ketone. Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine (Br₂) to form 2-bromocyclohexanone as product 1.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 was heated with sodium hydroxide, forming product 2.**\nThe reaction of an α-halo ketone, like 2-bromocyclohexanone, with a base such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is known as the Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves a ring contraction. The six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to form a five-membered ring derivative. The product of this rearrangement is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid, which is product 2.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 was treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine, forming product 3.**\nCyclopentanecarboxylic acid (product 2) is a carboxylic acid. Its reaction with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. Therefore, product 3 is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 was treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, forming product 4.**\nProduct 3, cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride, is an acyl chloride. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃) is a mild reducing agent that selectively reduces reactive acyl chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to an alcohol. This means product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: How many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms?**\n\nProduct 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO) and the carbon of the ring it is attached to (C1). This plane bisects the bond between C3 and C4 of the cyclopentane ring. Due to this symmetry, we can identify the following sets of chemically non-equivalent hydrogens:\n*   **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This single proton is in a unique chemical environment. (1 signal)\n*   **The proton on C1:** The hydrogen attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde group is also unique. (1 signal)\n*   **The protons on C2 and C5:** These two carbons are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, on each of these carbons, the two protons are diastereotopic (not equivalent to each other). This results in two distinct signals for the four protons on C2 and C5. (2 signals)\n*   **The protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, these two carbons are equivalent. The two protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This gives another two distinct signals for the four protons on C3 and C4. (2 signals)\n\nCounting these up: 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1) + 2 (C2/C5) + 2 (C3/C4) = 6 chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\nTherefore, product 4 has 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone, a six-membered cyclic ketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Bromine (Br₂).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the α-halogenation of a ketone. The reaction involves the formation of an enol or enolate, which then attacks the bromine molecule. The bromine atom adds to the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group). Since both α-carbons in cyclohexanone are equivalent, only one product is formed.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n    \n     \n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-Bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n\n*   **Reactant:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a strong base, with heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents and substrate (an α-halo ketone with an available α'-proton) leads to a **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n    1.  The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) removes a proton from the other α-carbon (C6), forming an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 attack on the carbon bearing the bromine (C2), displacing the bromide ion. This forms a strained bicyclic intermediate, bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-7-one.\n    3.  The hydroxide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon of the intermediate.\n    4.  The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, leading to the cleavage of the cyclopropane ring. This bond cleavage occurs to form the more stable carbanion, resulting in a ring contraction.\n    5.  After an acidic workup (which is implicit), the resulting carboxylate is protonated.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n     \n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagent:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) is a standard reagent for converting carboxylic acids into acid chlorides.

Chemically distinct hydrogens have different chemical environments and will produce separate signals in an NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Structure:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde has a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Symmetry:** On the NMR time scale, due to rapid conformational changes (pseudorotation), the molecule has an effective plane of symmetry. This plane passes through the aldehyde group (C-H and C=O bonds), the ring carbon it's attached to (C1), and the opposite ring carbon (if we consider a flat projection, it would bisect the C3-C4 bond). This symmetry makes pairs of carbons and their attached hydrogens equivalent.\n    *   The plane of symmetry makes C2 equivalent to C5, and C3 equivalent to C4.\n*   **Counting the distinct hydrogens:**\n    1.  **Aldehyde H:** The single proton of the -CHO group is in a unique chemical environment.

The two 'trans'-like protons on C3 and C4 (2H total)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2)**\n\n*   Cyclohexanone is a ketone. In the presence of an acid or base catalyst, ketones undergo halogenation at the alpha-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n*   Cyclohexanone has two equivalent alpha-carbons, each with two hydrogen atoms. The reaction will substitute one of these hydrogens with a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone.**\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n\n*   2-bromocyclohexanone is an α-halo ketone. When treated with a strong base like NaOH, it can undergo two possible reactions: elimination or the Favorskii rearrangement.\n    *   **Elimination:** The base removes a proton from the other alpha-carbon (C6), leading to the formation of an α,β-unsaturated ketone, cyclohex-2-en-1-one.\n    *   **Favorskii Rearrangement:** This is a common reaction for α-halo ketones with base. The base abstracts a proton from the alpha-carbon without the halogen (C6), forming an enolate. This enolate then undergoes an intramolecular nucleophilic attack on the carbon bearing the bromine, forming a strained bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate. The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of this intermediate, leading to the opening of the three-membered ring. The more stable carbanion is formed by breaking the bond between the carbonyl carbon and the less substituted carbon of the original ring, resulting in a ring contraction.\n*   The product of the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-bromocyclohexanone is the salt of cyclopentanecarboxylic acid. After workup (which is implied in such problems), this gives the free acid.\n*   **Choosing between elimination and Favorskii:** The subsequent reaction steps are key. The reagents in steps 3 and 4 are standard for converting a carboxylic acid to an aldehyde. This makes the Favorskii rearrangement pathway the most chemically consistent one.\n*   **Product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.**\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine**\n\n*   This is the standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl). Pyridine is used as a base to neutralize the HCl gas produced as a byproduct.\n*   **Product 3 is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.**\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)3)**\n\n*   Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky and mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes. Unlike stronger reagents like LiAlH4, it is not reactive enough to reduce the resulting aldehyde further to an alcohol. This specific reagent choice strongly confirms that Product 3 was an acid chloride.\n*   **Product 4 is cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde.**\n\n**Counting the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde)**\n\nNow we need to determine the number of unique proton environments in cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde, which corresponds to the number of signals in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n1.  **Structure:** The molecule consists of a cyclopentane ring with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to one of the carbons.\n2.  **Symmetry:** At room temperature, the cyclopentane ring undergoes rapid pseudorotation. This results in a time-averaged structure that has a plane of symmetry (a Cₛ plane). This plane passes through the aldehyde group, the carbon it's attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond on the opposite side of the ring.\n3.  **Analysis of Proton Equivalence:**\n    *   **Aldehyde Proton (H-C=O):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. **(1 distinct type)**\n    *   **Methine Proton (on C1):** The single proton on the carbon attached to the aldehyde group is also unique. **(1 distinct type)**\n    *   **Alpha-Protons (on C2 and C5):** The symmetry plane makes C2 equivalent to C5. On C2, the two protons are diastereotopic (they are not interchangeable by rotation or symmetry because C1 is a prochiral center). Let's call them H2a and H2b. Due to the symmetry plane, H2a is equivalent to H5a, and H2b is equivalent to H5b. Therefore, these four alpha-protons give rise to two distinct signals. **(2 distinct types)**\n    *   **Beta-Protons (on C3 and C4):** The symmetry plane makes C3 equivalent to C4. Similar to the alpha-protons, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic (H3c, H3d). H3c is equivalent to H4c, and H3d is equivalent to H4d. These four beta-protons also give rise to two distinct signals. **(2 distinct types)**\n\n4.  **Total Count:**\n    *   1 (aldehyde) + 1 (methine C1) + 2 (alpha-CH₂) + 2 (beta-CH₂) = **6**\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in the final product, cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde.\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nThis problem describes a four-step organic synthesis.

The **aldehyde proton** (-CHO) is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n    2.  The **proton on the carbon bearing the aldehyde group** (C1) is also unique. (1 type)\n    3.  The protons on the carbons adjacent to C1 (let's call them C2 and C5). Due to the plane of symmetry, C2 and C5 are equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 are diastereotopic (not equivalent to each other), as are the two on C5. The \"upper\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"upper\" on C5, and the \"lower\" on C2 is equivalent to the \"lower\" on C5. This group of four hydrogens gives rise to **two** distinct types.\n    4.  The protons on the remaining carbons (C3 and C4). These carbons are also equivalent by symmetry. By the same logic as above, the four protons on these two carbons also separate into **two** distinct types.\n\n*   **Total Count:** Summing the distinct types gives: 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nThe reaction sequence and the final product have been determined through chemical principles, and this reasoning is well-supported by the search results.\n\n*   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone to Product 1**\n    *   Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine. This is an alpha-halogenation of a ketone, which will yield 2-bromocyclohexanone as Product 1.\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 to Product 2**\n    *   2-bromocyclohexanone is heated with sodium hydroxide. In cyclic α-halo ketones, this strongly suggests a Favorskii rearrangement, which involves a ring contraction. This reaction converts the six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone into a five-membered ring carboxylic acid.\n    *   Therefore, Product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 to Product 3**\n    *   Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂). This is a standard and efficient method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride.\n    *   Therefore, Product 3 is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 to Product 4**\n    *   Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃). This is a specific, bulky reducing agent used to reduce highly reactive acid chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reaction at the aldehyde stage without further reduction to an alcohol.\n    *   Therefore, Product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n*   **Analysis of Product 4: Chemically Distinct Hydrogens**\n    *   The final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO), the carbon it is attached to (C1), the hydrogen on C1, and bisects the C3-C4 bond of the cyclopentane ring.\n    *   Protons that can be interchanged by a symmetry operation (like reflection through this plane) or by rapid conformational changes are chemically equivalent. Protons that cannot be interchanged are chemically distinct.\n    *   Let's count the distinct sets of protons:\n        1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton is unique and lies on the plane of symmetry. (1 proton)\n        2.  **The proton on C1:** This proton is also unique and lies on the plane of symmetry. (1 proton)\n        3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes the C2 and C5 positions equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 (one \"above\" the ring, one \"below\") are not equivalent to each other; they are diastereotopic. The same applies to C5. Due to the symmetry plane, the \"top\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"top\" proton on C5, and the \"bottom\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"bottom\" proton on C5. This gives two distinct sets of protons for these positions. (2 sets of 2 protons each)\n        4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** The plane of symmetry also makes the C3 and C4 positions equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 positions, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. The symmetry plane makes the \"top\" protons on C3/C4 equivalent and the \"bottom\" protons on C3/C4 equivalent. This gives another two distinct sets of protons. (2 sets of 2 protons each)\n\n*   **Total Count:** Summing these up, we have 1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = 6 sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nThe user has provided a four-step chemical synthesis and is asking for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on the final product. To answer this question, each step of the reaction must be correctly identified.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine.** This is the α-bromination of a ketone. The product (1) is 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n\n2.  **Step 2: 2-bromocyclohexanone heated with sodium hydroxide.** This α-halo ketone undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement in the presence of a strong base like NaOH. This reaction involves a ring contraction. The six-membered cyclohexanone ring contracts to a five-membered ring, forming cyclopentanecarboxylic acid. Thus, product (2) is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.** This is a standard and well-known reaction to convert a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. The product (3) is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(O-t-Bu)₃H).** This is a mild reducing agent specifically used to reduce acyl chlorides to aldehydes, preventing over-reduction to an alcohol. Therefore, the final product (4) is cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde.\n\nThe final task is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde. The structure consists of a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\nWe can analyze the symmetry of the molecule to determine the equivalence of the hydrogen atoms:\n*   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group, the carbon it's attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond of the cyclopentane ring.\n*   **The aldehyde hydrogen (-CHO):** This hydrogen is unique and in a distinct chemical environment. This is the first set of hydrogen.\n*   **The hydrogen on C1:** The hydrogen atom on the carbon attached to the aldehyde group is also unique. This is the second set.\n*   **Hydrogens on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes the two CH₂ groups at positions 2 and 5 equivalent. However, within each CH₂ group, the two hydrogen atoms are diastereotopic because they are adjacent to a stereocenter (C1). This means the hydrogen *cis* to the aldehyde group is different from the one that is *trans*. Therefore, the *cis* hydrogens on C2 and C5 are equivalent to each other, and the *trans* hydrogens on C2 and C5 are equivalent to each other, giving two more distinct sets of hydrogens. These are the third and fourth sets.\n*   **Hydrogens on C3 and C4:** Similarly, the CH₂ groups at positions 3 and 4 are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. The two hydrogens on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This results in two additional sets of distinct hydrogens. These are the fifth and sixth sets.\n\nIn total, there are six sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nThe initial analysis of the reaction sequence needs to be revised based on the search results.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone was treated with bromine, forming product 1.**\nThis reaction is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. The product is 2-bromocyclohexanone. This step is correct.\n\n**Step 2: 2-bromocyclohexanone was heated with sodium hydroxide, forming product 2.**\nMy initial thought was an E2 elimination to form cyclohex-2-en-1-one. However, the search results point to a different, very important named reaction: the **Favorskii rearrangement**. When an α-halo ketone with acidic α'-protons is treated with a strong base (like NaOH), it undergoes a ring contraction. In this case, 2-bromocyclohexanone rearranges to form cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Mechanism of Favorskii Rearrangement:** The hydroxide ion abstracts a proton from the C6 position (the other α-carbon). The resulting enolate then undergoes intramolecular SN2 displacement of the bromide to form a bicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-2-one intermediate. The hydroxide then attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, opening the three-membered ring to form a stable cyclopentyl carbanion, which is then protonated during workup to yield cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\nTherefore, **Product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n\n**Step 3: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid was treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine, forming product 3.**\nThis is a standard conversion of a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Thionyl chloride (SOCl2) replaces the -OH group of the carboxylic acid with a -Cl. Pyridine is often used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n**Product 3 is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.**\n\n**Step 4: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride was treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)3), forming product 4.**\nThis is a selective reduction of an acid chloride. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky and less reactive reducing agent than LiAlH4. It is specifically used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the alcohol.\n**Product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.**\n\n**Final Step: Determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4 (cyclopentanecarbaldehyde).**\n\nThe structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde is a cyclopentane ring attached to a -CHO group. Let's analyze its symmetry.\n\n```\n      H (aldehyde)\n      |\n      C=O\n      |\n  H - C1 - H\n     /   \\\n(H2)C5   C2(H2)\n   |      |\n(H2)C4 - C3(H2)\n```\nThe molecule has a plane of symmetry (a C_s point group) that passes through the C=O bond, the C1 carbon, and bisects the C3-C4 bond. Due to this symmetry plane:\n\n*   The aldehydic hydrogen (on the C=O) is unique. **(Set 1)**\n*   The hydrogen on C1 is unique. **(Set 2)**\n*   The two hydrogens on C2 are equivalent to the two hydrogens on C5.\n*   The two hydrogens on C3 are equivalent to the two hydrogens on C4.\n\nNow we need to determine if the two hydrogens on each of these carbons are equivalent to each other.\n*   Let's look at the two hydrogens on C2 (and C5). One is cis to the aldehyde group, and one is trans. They are not interchangeable by the symmetry operation. They are diastereotopic. Thus, the two cis-hydrogens (on C2 and C5) form one set, and the two trans-hydrogens (on C2 and C5) form another set. **(Set 3 and Set 4)**\n*   Similarly, let's look at the hydrogens on C3 (and C4). One is cis to the aldehyde group, and one is trans. These are also diastereotopic. The two cis-hydrogens (on C3 and C4) form one set, and the two trans-hydrogens (on C3 and C4) form another set. **(Set 5 and Set 6)**\n\nIn total, there are 6 sets of chemically distinct hydrogens.\n\nLet's recount them:\n1.  H attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n2.  H attached to C1.\n3.  The two H's at C2 and the two H's at C5 are equivalent by symmetry. The two on C2 are diastereotopic (not equivalent). So we have the \"upper\" H's at C2/C5 as one set.\n4.  The \"lower\" H's at C2/C5 as a second set.\n5.  The two H's at C3 and the two H's at C4 are equivalent by symmetry. The two on C3 are diastereotopic. So we have the \"upper\" H's at C3/C4 as one set.\n6.  The \"lower\" H's at C3/C4 as a second set.\n\nThis gives a total of 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6 chemically distinct sets of hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe sets are:\n*   H_aldehyde\n*   H1\n*   {H2_cis, H5_cis}\n*   {H2_trans, H5_trans}\n*   {H3_cis, H4_cis}\n*   {H3_trans, H4_trans}\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\nFinal check of the logic. The Favorskii rearrangement is the key step. This leads to cyclopentanecarboxylic acid. Conversion to the acid chloride and then reduction to the aldehyde are standard textbook reactions. The symmetry analysis of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde reveals a single plane of symmetry, leading to 6 distinct types of protons. The answer appears to be 6.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product, followed by an analysis of its hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone was treated with bromine.**\n*   **Substrate:** Cyclohexanone\n*   **Reagent:** Bromine (Br₂)\n*   **Reaction:** This is the α-bromination of a ketone. One of the α-hydrogens on a carbon next to the carbonyl group is replaced by a bromine atom. Due to the symmetry of cyclohexanone, both α-positions are equivalent.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 was heated with sodium hydroxide.**\n*   **Substrate:** 2-bromocyclohexanone\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), heat.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic example of the **Favorskii rearrangement**. An α-halo ketone with a proton on the other α-carbon (the α'-position) rearranges to form a carboxylic acid with a ring contraction. The base (OH⁻) removes an α'-proton from C6, which leads to the formation of a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate. This strained intermediate is then attacked by hydroxide at the carbonyl carbon, followed by ring-opening to yield the most stable carbanion, which after protonation gives the final product.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid. (Note: Other reactions like SN2 or E2 are less likely. E2 would lead to a dead end in the next step, and the sequence of reagents strongly suggests the formation of a carboxylic acid).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 was treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine.**\n*   **Substrate:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n*   **Reagents:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard procedure to convert a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. SOCl₂ is the chlorinating agent, and pyridine is a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 was treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride.**\n*   **Substrate:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃ or LTBA).\n*   **Reaction:** LTBA is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is well-known for selectively reducing acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to alcohols.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. Now, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in this molecule. \"Chemically distinct\" means the hydrogens have different chemical environments and will produce separate signals in an ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nThe structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde is a five-membered ring with a formyl group (-CHO) attached. Let's label the carbons of the ring C1 to C5, with C1 being the carbon attached to the -CHO group.\n\n      H(a) (aldehyde proton)\n      |\n      C=O\n      |\n   C1-H(b) ------ C2H₂(c,d)\n  /           \\\nC5H₂(i,j)          C3H₂(e,f)\n  \\           /\n   ----C4H₂(g,h)----\n\nWe analyze the symmetry of the molecule. Assuming rapid ring flipping (pseudorotation) at room temperature, the molecule has a time-averaged plane of symmetry. This plane passes through the H-C=O group, the C1-H(b) bond, and bisects the C3-C4 bond.\n\nDue to this plane of symmetry:\n*   C2 is chemically equivalent to C5.\n*   C3 is chemically equivalent to C4.\n*   Protons on C2 are equivalent to the corresponding protons on C5.\n*   Protons on C3 are equivalent to the corresponding protons on C4.\n\nNow, let's count the sets of distinct protons:\n\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (H(a))**: This proton is unique. This is our **first** set.\n2.  **The proton on C1 (H(b))**: This methine proton is on the plane of symmetry and is unique. This is our **second** set.\n3.  **Protons on C2 and C5**: Let's consider the two protons on C2. Since C1 is a substituted carbon, the two protons on the adjacent C2 are **diastereotopic**. This means they are chemically non-equivalent and will give two different signals. The plane of symmetry makes the \"upper\" proton on C2 equivalent to the \"upper\" proton on C5, and the \"lower\" proton on C2 equivalent to the \"lower\" proton on C5. Therefore, the four protons on C2 and C5 give rise to two distinct sets. These are our **third** and **fourth** sets.\n4.  **Protons on C3 and C4**: Similar to the C2/C5 case, the two geminal protons on C3 are also diastereotopic due to the influence of the substituent at C1. The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C3 equivalent to their counterparts on C4. So, the four protons on C3 and C4 also give rise to two distinct sets. These are our **fifth** and **sixth** sets.\n\nIn total, we have 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6 sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe correct answer is 6.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nThe user has presented a four-step chemical synthesis problem and is asking for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on the final product.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n1.  **Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**: This is the α-bromination of a ketone. The bromine atom adds to the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group. The product, **Product 1**, is **2-bromocyclohexanone**.\n\n2.  **Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**: When an α-halo ketone like 2-bromocyclohexanone is heated with a strong base such as NaOH, it undergoes a classic reaction called the Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the contraction of the ring, converting the six-membered cyclohexanone ring into a five-membered cyclopentane ring with a carboxylic acid group. Thus, **Product 2** is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n\n3.  **Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**: This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl). Therefore, **Product 3** is **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n\n4.  **Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃)**: This reagent is a mild reducing agent specifically used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to an alcohol. It is less reactive than lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) due to the bulky tri-tert-butoxy groups. The reaction converts cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride into **Product 4**, which is **cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde**.\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product, **cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde** (C₆H₁₀O). Chemically distinct hydrogens are those in different electronic environments, which would give rise to separate signals in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nLet's analyze the structure of cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde:\n\n*   The molecule consists of a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group, the carbon atom it's attached to (C1), and the hydrogen on C1. This plane bisects the C3-C4 bond of the cyclopentane ring.\n*   We can count the sets of non-equivalent protons:\n    1.  The **aldehyde proton** (-CHO). This is in a unique chemical environment. (1 proton)\n    2.  The single **proton on C1**, the carbon atom of the ring bonded to the aldehyde group. This is also unique. (1 proton)\n    3.  The protons on **C2 and C5**. Due to the plane of symmetry, C2 and C5 are equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 (a methylene group) are diastereotopic because C1 is a chiral center (even in a racemic mixture). One proton is *cis* to the aldehyde group, and the other is *trans*. These two are not equivalent. The same applies to C5. Therefore, the two *cis* protons (on C2 and C5) form one set, and the two *trans* protons form another set. This gives us two distinct types of hydrogens. (4 protons total, in 2 sets)\n    4.  The protons on **C3 and C4**. These carbons are also equivalent due to the symmetry plane. Similar to C2 and C5, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. The two protons *cis* to the C1-CHO axis are equivalent to each other, and the two *trans* protons are also equivalent to each other. This adds another two distinct types of hydrogens. (4 protons total, in 2 sets)\n\nSumming these up, we have:\n1 (aldehyde) + 1 (on C1) + 2 (on C2/C5) + 2 (on C3/C4) = 6 chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nMy plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Trace the reaction sequence**: I will determine the structure of the product after each of the four chemical reactions. The key reactions are an alpha-bromination, a Favorskii rearrangement, the formation of an acid chloride, and a selective reduction to an aldehyde.\n2.  **Identify the final product**: After tracing the four steps, I will have the chemical structure of Product 4.\n3.  **Analyze molecular symmetry**: I will examine the structure of Product 4 to identify any symmetry elements, such as planes of symmetry.\n4.  **Count distinct hydrogens**: Based on the symmetry, I will count the number of sets of chemically equivalent hydrogen atoms.

It is known to selectively reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the corresponding alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. We need to determine the number of sets of chemically equivalent hydrogen atoms in this molecule.\n\nLet's label the carbons of the ring starting from the carbon attached to the aldehyde group as C1.\n\n```\n       H(a)\n       |\n    O==C\n       |\n    H(b)-C1\n      /  \\\n  H(c,d)-C2--C5-H(c,d)\n        |    |\n  H(e,f)-C3--C4-H(e,f)\n         \\  /\n```\n\n1.  **Symmetry:** Cyclopentane rings are not planar but undergo rapid puckering at room temperature. For NMR purposes, we consider the time-averaged structure, which possesses a plane of symmetry. This plane passes through the aldehyde group (CHO), the C1 carbon, the C1-H bond, and bisects the C3-C4 bond.\n\n2.  **Proton Environments:**\n    *   **H(a):** The aldehyde proton. It is in a unique chemical environment. This is **1 distinct type** of hydrogen.\n    *   **H(b):** The proton on C1 (a methine group, CH). It lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. This is **1 distinct type** of hydrogen.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 chemically equivalent. Each of these carbons is a methylene group (CH₂). The two protons on C2 are diastereotopic because C2 is adjacent to the prostereogenic center C1 (substituting one H would create a diastereomer relative to substituting the other H, because a second chiral center would be created at C1). Therefore, the two protons on C2 are chemically distinct from each other. The same applies to C5. By symmetry, the \"cis\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"cis\" proton on C5, and the \"trans\" proton on C2 is equivalent to the \"trans\" proton on C5. This gives **2 distinct types** of hydrogens for the C2/C5 positions.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C4:** The plane of symmetry also makes C3 and C4 chemically equivalent. Each is a methylene group (CH₂). The two protons on C3 are also diastereotopic. This can be confirmed with a substitution test: replacing one proton on C3 with a different group (e.g., Deuterium) creates two new chiral centers (at C1 and C3), and the resulting molecule is a diastereomer of the one formed by replacing the other proton on C3. Thus, the two protons on C3 are chemically distinct. By symmetry, these two distinct proton types are mirrored on C4. This gives another **2 distinct types** of hydrogens for the C3/C4 positions.\n\n3.  **Total Count:**\n    *   Aldehyde H: 1 type\n    *   C1-H: 1 type\n    *   C2/C5 protons: 2 types\n    *   C3/C4 protons: 2 types\n    *   Total number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\nFinal Answer is 6.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\n**Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction Sequence Step-by-Step**\n\n    *   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2).**\n        *   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone, a 6-membered ring ketone.\n        *   **Reagent:** Bromine (Br2).\n        *   **Reaction:** This is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. The reaction proceeds by forming an enol or enolate intermediate, which then attacks the bromine. This results in the substitution of one of the alpha-hydrogens (hydrogens on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) with a bromine atom.\n        *   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) is heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH).**\n        *   **Reactant:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n        *   **Reagent:** Sodium hydroxide (a strong base) and heat.\n        *   **Reaction:** There are two main possibilities for an α-haloketone with a strong base:\n            1.  **E2 Elimination:** The base abstracts a proton from the adjacent carbon (C3), leading to the formation of a double bond and elimination of bromide. This would yield cyclohex-2-enone.\n            2.  **Favorskii Rearrangement:** This is a classic reaction of α-haloketones that have a proton on the other alpha-carbon (the α' position, C6 in this case). The base (OH-) abstracts the acidic α' proton to form an enolate. The enolate then attacks the carbon bearing the halogen in an intramolecular SN2 fashion, displacing the bromide and forming a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate. The strong base then attacks the carbonyl carbon of this strained intermediate. The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, and the ring opens to form a more stable carbanion, leading to a ring contraction. In this case, the 6-membered ring contracts to a 5-membered ring carboxylic acid (after protonation/workup).\n        *   **Which path is correct?** We must look ahead to the next step. The reagent is thionyl chloride (SOCl2). SOCl2 is used to convert carboxylic acids into acid chlorides. It does not react with α,β-unsaturated ketones like cyclohex-2-enone. Therefore, the Favorskii rearrangement must be the correct pathway.\n        *   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Step 3: Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine.**\n        *   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n        *   **Reagent:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl2), a chlorinating agent, and pyridine, a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n        *   **Reaction:** This is a standard and efficient method for converting a carboxylic acid to an acyl chloride (acid chloride).\n        *   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Step 4: Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride.**\n        *   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n        *   **Reagent:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)3).\n        *   **Reaction:** This is a bulky and mild reducing agent. Unlike the powerful LiAlH4 which would reduce an acid chloride all the way to a primary alcohol, LiAlH(O-t-Bu)3 is selective and stops the reduction at the aldehyde stage. This is a common method for synthesizing aldehydes from acid chlorides.\n        *   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n         \n\n2.  **Determine the Number of Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\n    *   **Product 4 Structure:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. It consists of a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n    *   **Symmetry Analysis:** We need to count the number of unique proton environments, which corresponds to the number of signals expected in a 1H NMR spectrum. While the cyclopentane ring is not planar (it undergoes rapid pseudorotation between envelope and twist conformations), on the NMR timescale, the molecule has an effective plane of symmetry (a C_s plane). This plane passes through the aldehyde group (H-C=O), the carbon it's attached to (C1), and the hydrogen on C1. This plane bisects the rest of the ring, making C2 and C5 equivalent, and C3 and C4 equivalent.\n\n    *   **Counting the distinct protons:**\n        1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton is in a unique electronic environment. (1st distinct type)\n        2.  **The proton on C1:** This proton (on the carbon attached to the aldehyde) is also unique, as it lies on the plane of symmetry. (2nd distinct type)\n        3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** These two carbons are equivalent by symmetry. However, on each of these carbons, the two protons are not equivalent to each other. They are diastereotopic because one is 'cis' to the bulky aldehyde group and the other is 'trans'. Therefore, the 'cis' protons on C2 and C5 are equivalent to each other, and the 'trans' protons on C2 and C5 are equivalent to each other, but the 'cis' and 'trans' sets are distinct. This gives us two more types of protons. (3rd and 4th distinct types)\n        4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** These two carbons are also equivalent by symmetry. Similar to the C2/C5 case, the two protons on each of these carbons are diastereotopic. Their environment is different from the protons on C2/C5 because they are further from the aldehyde group. Again, the 'cis-like' protons on C3 and C4 are one set, and the 'trans-like' protons are another distinct set. This gives us two more types of protons.

In this reaction, a bromine atom replaces a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group. This results in the formation of **Product 1: 2-bromocyclohexanone**.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide**\nWhen 2-bromocyclohexanone is heated with a base like sodium hydroxide, it undergoes a classic ring-contraction reaction known as the Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the formation of a bicyclic intermediate which then opens to form a five-membered ring. The product is a carboxylate salt, which upon acidification (assumed in a standard workup) yields **Product 2: cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine**\nCyclopentanecarboxylic acid is a carboxylic acid. Treating a carboxylic acid with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) is a standard method to convert it into an acid chloride. Pyridine is typically used to neutralize the HCl byproduct. This reaction forms **Product 3: cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(OtBu)₃H) is a mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce highly reactive acid chlorides to aldehydes without continuing the reduction to a primary alcohol. Therefore, cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride is reduced to **Product 4: cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n**Determining the Number of Chemically Distinct Hydrogens**\n\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to analyze its structure and symmetry.\n\nThe structure consists of a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\n1.  **Aldehyde Proton:** The hydrogen atom in the -CHO group is in a unique chemical environment. (1 distinct type)\n2.  **C1 Proton:** The hydrogen atom on the carbon of the ring to which the aldehyde group is attached (C1) is also in a unique environment. (1 distinct type)\n3.  **C2/C5 Protons:** The cyclopentane ring has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C1-CHO bond. This symmetry makes the protons on carbon 2 (C2) equivalent to the protons on carbon 5 (C5). However, on each of these carbons, the two hydrogen atoms are not equivalent to each other. They are diastereotopic because one is cis (on the same side) and one is trans (on the opposite side) relative to the aldehyde group. Thus, the four protons on C2 and C5 represent two distinct sets of hydrogen atoms. (2 distinct types)\n4.  **C3/C4 Protons:** Similarly, the protons on carbon 3 (C3) are equivalent to the protons on carbon 4 (C4) due to the plane of symmetry. Like the C2/C5 protons, the two hydrogens on each of these carbons are diastereotopic. Therefore, the four protons on C3 and C4 represent another two distinct sets of hydrogen atoms. (2 distinct types)\n\nIn total, the number of chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms is the sum of all the unique sets: 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1) + 2 (C2/C5) + 2 (C3/C4) = 6.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nThe reaction sequence described is a multi-step organic synthesis. Here is a breakdown of each step to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\nThis reaction is the α-bromination of a ketone. A hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-carbon) is replaced by a bromine atom. This forms 2-bromocyclohexanone as product 1.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\nProduct 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) is an α-halo ketone. When treated with a strong base like sodium hydroxide and heated, it undergoes a classic ring-contraction reaction known as the Favorskii rearrangement. The six-membered cyclohexanone ring contracts to a five-membered ring, forming cyclopentanecarboxylic acid. Product 2 is therefore cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\nProduct 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) reacts with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) in a standard procedure to convert a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. The pyridine is a weak base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct. This reaction yields cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride as product 3.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃)**\nProduct 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) is an acid chloride. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky and mild reducing agent that is selective for the reduction of acid chlorides to aldehydes. It is less reactive than lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) and will not reduce the aldehyde further to an alcohol, allowing for the isolation of the aldehyde. This reaction forms cyclopentanecarbaldehyde as the final product (product 4).\n\n**Counting the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through:\n*   The aldehyde group (CHO).\n*   The carbon of the cyclopentane ring to which the aldehyde is attached (C1).\n*   The hydrogen atom on C1.\n\nThis plane of symmetry makes pairs of carbons and their attached hydrogens equivalent.\n1.  **Aldehydic proton (-CHO):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n2.  **Proton on C1:** The single hydrogen attached to the carbon bearing the aldehyde group is also unique. (1 type)\n3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** These two carbons are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are diastereotopic—meaning they are not chemically equivalent to each other. One proton is *cis* (on the same side) and one is *trans* (on the opposite side) relative to the aldehyde group. Thus, the two *cis* protons (on C2 and C5) are equivalent to each other, and the two *trans* protons (on C2 and C5) are equivalent to each other, creating two distinct types of protons from these four hydrogens. (2 types)\n4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, these two carbons are equivalent. The two protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This gives another two distinct types of protons. (2 types)\n\nTotal number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms = 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\n\nThis reaction is the alpha-bromination of a ketone. Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine to form an alpha-bromo ketone. Due to the symmetry of cyclohexanone, bromination occurs at either of the equivalent alpha-carbons (the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n\n*   **Product 1:** 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n\nThis reaction involves an alpha-halo ketone with a strong base, which are the classic conditions for a **Favorskii rearrangement**. The mechanism proceeds as follows:\n1.  A hydroxide ion (OH⁻) removes a proton from the other alpha-carbon (C6), which is the one not bearing the bromine atom, to form an enolate.\n2.  The enolate undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 attack on the carbon bearing the bromine (C2), displacing the bromide ion. This forms a strained bicyclic intermediate containing a cyclopropane ring, which is a derivative of cyclopropanone (specifically, bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one).\n3.  The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of the cyclopropanone intermediate.\n4.  The strained ring opens up to relieve ring strain, leading to a ring contraction. The cleavage occurs to form the more stable carbanion, which is then protonated. For a 2-halocyclohexanone, this process results in the formation of a cyclopentane ring with a carboxylic acid group.\n\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n\nThis is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride (or acid chloride). Thionyl chloride is the chlorinating agent, and pyridine is a base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃)**\n\nThis is a reduction reaction. LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃ is a bulky, mild reducing agent. Unlike the powerful LiAlH₄ which would reduce the acyl chloride all the way to an alcohol, LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃ is selective and stops the reduction at the aldehyde stage. This is a common and specific transformation.\n\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nThe final task is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. This is equivalent to determining the number of signals expected in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nThe structure is a five-membered ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\nTo determine the chemical equivalence of the hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry. At room temperature, the cyclopentane ring undergoes rapid conformational changes (pseudorotation). The time-averaged conformation possesses a plane of symmetry (it belongs to the Cₛ point group). This plane passes through:\n*   The aldehyde group (CHO).\n*   The carbon it is attached to (C1) and the hydrogen on that carbon.\n*   It bisects the bond between C3 and C4.\n\nThis plane of symmetry has the following consequences for the equivalence of atoms:\n*   Carbon C2 is equivalent to carbon C5.\n*   Carbon C3 is equivalent to carbon C4.\n\nNow, let's count the sets of chemically distinct (non-equivalent) hydrogen atoms:\n\n1.  **The aldehydic hydrogen (-CHO):** This hydrogen is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n2.  **The hydrogen on C1:** This hydrogen is on the plane of symmetry and is also in a unique environment, being attached to the carbon bonded to the aldehyde. (1 type)\n3.  **The hydrogens on C2 and C5:** C2 and C5 are equivalent. Each of these carbons has two hydrogens. Since C1 is a stereocenter (even in an achiral molecule, it creates a diastereotopic relationship for adjacent protons), the two hydrogens on C2 are diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically non-equivalent. The same applies to C5. By symmetry, the two non-equivalent hydrogens on C2 correspond to the two on C5. Thus, there are two distinct types of hydrogens on these carbons. (2 types)\n4.  **The hydrogens on C3 and C4:** C3 and C4 are equivalent. Similar to the case for C2/C5, the two hydrogens on C3 are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent. They are equivalent to their corresponding partners on C4. This gives another two distinct types of hydrogens. (2 types)\n\n**Total Count:**\nSumming up the different types of hydrogen atoms:\n1 (aldehyde) + 1 (on C1) + 2 (on C2/C5) + 2 (on C3/C4) = 6\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring containing a ketone functional group.\n*   **Reagent:** Bromine (Br₂).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the α-bromination of a ketone. The reaction proceeds via an enol or enolate intermediate, which attacks the bromine molecule. The result is the substitution of one of the α-hydrogens (hydrogens on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) with a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-Bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n\n*   **Reactant:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a strong base, with heat.\n*   **Reaction:** With an α-halo ketone and a strong base, the most characteristic reaction is the Favorskii rearrangement. The hydroxide ion removes a proton from the other α-carbon (C6), forming an enolate. This enolate undergoes an intramolecular S_N2 reaction, where the enolate attacks the carbon bearing the bromine, displacing the bromide ion and forming a bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one intermediate. The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of this strained bicyclic ketone, leading to the opening of the three-membered ring. The more stable carbanion is formed, which results in the contraction of the six-membered ring to a five-membered ring. After protonation during workup, the final product is a carboxylic acid.\n    *   An alternative reaction, E2 elimination, to form cyclohex-2-en-1-one is less likely to be the intended path because this product would not react with the reagents in the next step.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagent:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard and efficient method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride (or acid chloride).

Unlike the much more reactive LiAlH₄, the bulky tert-butoxy groups on LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃ make it less reactive. It is particularly useful for the partial reduction of acyl chlorides to aldehydes. The reaction stops at the aldehyde stage and does not proceed to the primary alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)**\n\nNow we need to determine the number of unique hydrogen environments in the final product, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. In NMR spectroscopy, chemically non-equivalent hydrogens give rise to distinct signals.\n\nThe structure is a cyclopentane ring with an aldehyde group (-CHO) attached.

By symmetry, the hydrogens on C5 are equivalent to those on C2 (i.e., H5a is equivalent to H2a, and H5b is equivalent to H2b). Therefore, the four hydrogens on C2 and C5 give rise to **2** distinct signals.\n    *   **C3 and C4 Hydrogens:** Carbons C3 and C4 are also equivalent.

(1 type)\n    3.  **The C2 and C5 protons:** Due to the plane of symmetry, the protons on C2 are equivalent to the protons on C5. However, the two protons on C2 itself are *not* equivalent to each other (they are diastereotopic). Thus, the four protons on C2 and C5 represent **two** distinct chemical environments. (2 types)\n    4.  **The C3 and C4 protons:** Similarly, the protons on C3 are equivalent to the protons on C4. The two protons on C3 are diastereotopic.

(2 types)\n\n**Total Count:**\nAdding up the types of distinct hydrogens: 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1) + 2 (C2/C5) + 2 (C3/C4) = **6**\n\nThere are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on it.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\n\nThis reaction is the acid-catalyzed α-bromination of a ketone. A hydrogen on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-hydrogen) is replaced by a bromine atom. Since cyclohexanone is a symmetrical molecule, bromination at either alpha-position (C2 or C6) yields the same product.\n\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone\n*   **Reagent:** Br₂\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-Bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n\nThis is a classic example of a **Favorskii rearrangement**. An α-haloketone reacts with a strong base, causing a ring contraction. The six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone is converted into a five-membered ring containing a carboxylic acid functional group (after workup).\n\n*   **Mechanism Outline:** The base removes the other α-hydrogen (from C6), forming an enolate. The enolate attacks the carbon bearing the bromine, displacing it and forming a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate. The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to the opening of the strained three-membered ring to form the more stable five-membered ring carboxylate, which is then protonated.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n\nThis is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Thionyl chloride is the chlorinating agent, and pyridine acts as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (-COOH)\n*   **Reagent:** SOCl₂\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (-COCl)\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃)**\n\nThis reagent is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes. It is not powerful enough to reduce the aldehyde further to an alcohol.\n\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (-COCl)\n*   **Reagent:** LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde (-CHO)\n\n**Final Analysis: Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogens in Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)**\n\nTo find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the symmetry of the final molecule, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. We can visualize the molecule and identify which hydrogens are in unique chemical environments.\n\nThe structure is a five-membered cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\n1.  **Aldehyde Hydrogen:** The single hydrogen attached to the carbonyl carbon (`-CHO`) is in a unique chemical environment. This is **1** distinct type.\n2.  **C1-Hydrogen:** The hydrogen on the carbon of the ring that is attached to the aldehyde group (C1) is a unique methine proton. This is the **2nd** distinct type.\n3.  **C2 and C5 Hydrogens:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group and C1. This makes C2 equivalent to C5. However, C1 is a stereocenter (it's bonded to four different groups: H, CHO, C2, and C5). This means the two hydrogens on C2 are diastereotopic (not equivalent to each other). The same is true for the two hydrogens on C5. By symmetry, the \"upper\" hydrogens on C2 and C5 are equivalent, and the \"lower\" hydrogens on C2 and C5 are equivalent. This gives us two more distinct sets of hydrogens. These are the **3rd** and **4th** distinct types.\n4.  **C3 and C4 Hydrogens:** The plane of symmetry also makes C3 equivalent to C4. Similar to the C2/C5 case, the hydrogens on C3 are diastereotopic because of the stereocenter at C1, as are the hydrogens on C4. This creates another two sets of equivalent hydrogens. These are the **5th** and **6th** distinct types.\n\nIn total, there are **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nThe multi-step synthesis described involves the following transformations:\n\n1.  **Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂):** This is the α-bromination of a ketone, which produces 2-bromocyclohexanone as Product 1.\n2.  **Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH):** When an α-halo ketone like 2-bromocyclohexanone is treated with a strong base, it can undergo a Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves a ring contraction. In this case, 2-bromocyclohexanone rearranges to form cyclopentanecarboxylic acid, which is Product 2.\n3.  **Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine:** Thionyl chloride is a standard reagent used to convert carboxylic acids into acyl chlorides. Pyridine is typically used as a base to neutralize the HCl produced during the reaction. Therefore, cyclopentanecarboxylic acid is converted to cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3).\n4.  **Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃):** This reagent is a mild and sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used for the selective reduction of acyl chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reaction at the aldehyde stage without further reduction to an alcohol. Thus, cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride is reduced to cyclopentanecarbaldehyde, which is the final product, Product 4.\n\nThe final step is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. The structure consists of a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n*   The carbon atom of the ring that is attached to the aldehyde group (C1) is a stereocenter, as it is bonded to four different groups: the aldehyde group, a hydrogen atom, and two different paths around the ring. This makes the molecule chiral.\n*   In a chiral molecule, protons that cannot be interchanged by a rotational axis or a rapid conformational process are chemically distinct.\n*   The cyclopentane ring is not planar and undergoes rapid pseudorotation at room temperature. This rapid conformational change averages the environments of certain protons, creating an effective plane of symmetry on the NMR timescale.\n*   This time-averaged plane of symmetry passes through the aldehyde group, the C1 carbon, and the H attached to C1, bisecting the C3-C4 bond.\n\nBased on this effective symmetry, we can identify the sets of chemically distinct protons:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. (1 signal)\n2.  **The proton on C1:** This methine proton is also unique. (1 signal)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C5. However, because C2 is adjacent to the C1 stereocenter, the two geminal protons on C2 are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct from each other. The same applies to C5. Therefore, these four protons give rise to two distinct signals. (2 signals)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, the plane of symmetry renders the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C4. The two geminal protons on C3 are diastereotopic because they are in a chiral molecule. The same holds for C4. These four protons also give rise to two distinct signals. (2 signals)\n\nIn total, there are 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6 chemically distinct sets of hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n### **Reaction Analysis**\n\n*   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine.**\n    This is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. The bromine atom attaches to the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n    *   **Product 1: 2-Bromocyclohexanone.**\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide.**\n    When an α-halo ketone with an available acidic proton on the opposite side of the carbonyl is treated with a strong base like NaOH, it undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the formation of a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate, which then opens to form a ring-contracted carboxylic acid (after an acidic workup, which is implied). The six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to a five-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 2: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.**\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.**\n    Thionyl chloride is a standard reagent used to convert carboxylic acids into acyl chlorides. Pyridine is often used as a solvent and to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n    *   **Product 3: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.**\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(OtBu)₃H).**\n    Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild reducing agent that is specifically used to reduce reactive acyl chlorides to aldehydes. It is less reactive than lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) and allows the reaction to stop at the aldehyde stage without proceeding to the alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.**\n\n### **Analysis of Product 4**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to examine its structure and symmetry.\n\nThe molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO), the C-H bond on the carbon attached to the aldehyde (C1), and bisects the bond between C3 and C4 of the cyclopentane ring.\n\nLet's count the unique hydrogen environments:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (H-aldehyde):** This proton is bonded to the carbonyl carbon and is in a unique chemical environment.\n2.  **The proton on C1:** This proton (methine) is on the carbon where the aldehyde group is attached. It lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique.\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** Due to the plane of symmetry, C2 and C5 are equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 (a methylene group) are diastereotopic because of their different spatial relationships to the aldehyde group (one is *cis*, the other is *trans*). The *cis* proton on C2 is equivalent to the *cis* proton on C5, and the *trans* proton on C2 is equivalent to the *trans* proton on C5. This gives two distinct sets of protons.\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, C3 and C4 are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. The two protons on C3 are also diastereotopic. The proton closer to the aldehyde group is equivalent to its counterpart on C4, and the proton farther away is equivalent to its counterpart on C4. This results in two more distinct sets of protons.\n\nIn summary, there are six sets of chemically non-equivalent hydrogen atoms:\n*   Signal 1: Aldehydic H (1H)\n*   Signal 2: C1 methine H (1H)\n*   Signal 3: C2/C5 methylene H's (2H, one type)\n*   Signal 4: C2/C5 methylene H's (2H, second type)\n*   Signal 5: C3/C4 methylene H's (2H, one type)\n*   Signal 6: C3/C4 methylene H's (2H, second type)\n\nTherefore, there are **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
