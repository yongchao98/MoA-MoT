    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial and final states.**\n    The system is initially in a coupled angular momentum state, described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   $l_1=1$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the first electron.\n    *   $l_2=1$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the second electron.\n    *   $l=2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the 2-electron system.\n    *   $m=-1$ is the total magnetic quantum number, representing the z-component of the total angular momentum ($L_z$).\n\n    A measurement of the individual orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ is performed. This means we are projecting the coupled state onto the uncoupled basis, which is represented by kets of the form $|l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Determine the target measurement outcome.**\n    The question asks for the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of the $L_z$ operator is $m_l \\hbar$.\n    *   For the first electron, $L_{1z}$ having an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ means its magnetic quantum number is $m_{l1} = -1$.\n    *   For the second electron, $L_{2z}$ having an eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ means its magnetic quantum number is $m_{l2} = -1$.\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for the probability of finding the system in the uncoupled state $|l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Apply the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.**\n    When coupling angular momenta, the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This is expressed by the fundamental selection rule:\n    $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$\n\n    This rule means that the coupled state $|l, m\\rangle$ is a linear combination (a superposition) of only those uncoupled states $|l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}\\rangle$ for which the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers equals the total magnetic quantum number.\n\n4.  **Check if the target state can be a component of the initial state.**\n    *   For the initial coupled state, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n    *   For the target uncoupled state, the individual magnetic quantum numbers are $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$.\n    *   Let's calculate the sum for the target state: $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\n5.  **Compare and conclude.**\n    The sum of the z-components for the target state is $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -2$.\n    The total z-component of the initial state is $m = -1$.\n    Since $-2 \\neq -1$, the selection rule $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$ is violated.\n\n    This means that the uncoupled state $|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$ is not a part of the superposition that forms the coupled state $|2, -1\\rangle$. The amplitude (or coefficient) of the state $|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$ in the expansion of $|2, -1\\rangle$ is zero. This coefficient is known as the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$.\n\n    The probability of measuring a particular state is the square of the magnitude of its amplitude. Since the amplitude is 0, the probability is $0^2 = 0$.\n\nIt is impossible to measure the system in a state where $m_{l1}=-1$ and $m_{l2}=-1$ if it started in a state with a total $m=-1$.\n\n<<<B>>>"
