    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. The general formula for a hydrocarbon is CxHy.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula: `%H = (mass of H) / (total mass) = (y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008)`. Using approximate atomic masses (H=1, C=12), we get:\n        `0.1428 = y / (12x + y)`\n        `0.1428 * (12x + y) = y`\n        `1.7136x = 0.8572y`\n        `y/x = 1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2`\n    *   This gives an empirical formula of CH2.\n    *   The problem states that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it's a product of hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen). The general formula for a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon (alkane) is CnH2n+2. The general formula for a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon (cycloalkane) is CnH2n.\n    *   The empirical formula CH2 matches the general formula for a cycloalkane, CnH2n.\n    *   Let's verify the mass fraction for CnH2n: `%H = 2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857`, which matches the given value of 14.28%.\n    *   So, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CnH2n.\n\n2.  **Determine the Carbon Skeleton**\n    *   Both mixture X and mixture Y, when hydrogenated, yield *only* Z. This means that all compounds in both mixtures have the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvents are cyclopentane (C5H10) and cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\n3.  **Identify Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Z is one of the components of Y.\n    *   The other component of Y must hydrogenate to Z under severe conditions and must not decolorize bromine water.\n    *   If Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), a C6 saturated compound, the other component could be an aromatic compound with a C6 ring skeleton, which is benzene (C6H6).\n    *   Let's check this hypothesis: Y = {cyclohexane, benzene}.\n        *   Both are liquids.\n        *   The mixture is equimolar.\n        *   Neither decolorizes bromine water (benzene only reacts with Br2 in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst).\n        *   Cyclohexane (Z) is a component.\n        *   Hydrogenation of the mixture: cyclohexane doesn't react; benzene (C6H6) is hydrogenated to cyclohexane (C6H12) under severe conditions. So the only product is Z.\n    *   This hypothesis fits all conditions perfectly. Therefore:\n        *   Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12)\n        *   Mixture Y = {Cyclohexane (C6H12), Benzene (C6H6)}\n\n4.  **Analyze the Reaction from X to Y**\n    *   Mixture X is treated with platinum when heated to form mixture Y. The reaction is described as a disproportionation.\n    *   The reactants are an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them X1 and X2.\n    *   The products are an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (Y1) and benzene (Y2).\n    *   The transformation from an equimolar reactant mixture to an equimolar product mixture suggests a 1:1 stoichiometric reaction:\n        `X1 + X2 → Y1 + Y2`\n    *   Since all compounds must have the C6 ring skeleton, let's represent X1 and X2 by their molecular formulas C6Hy1 and C6Hy2. The reaction is:\n        `C6H(y1) + C6H(y2) → C6H12 + C6H6`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\n    *   By the law of conservation of atoms, the number of hydrogen atoms must be the same on both sides of the reaction equation.\n    *   Total H atoms in reactants = y1 + y2\n    *   Total H atoms in products = 12 + 6 = 18\n    *   Therefore, `y1 + y2 = 18`.\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of the number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of X1 and one molecule of X2.\n    *   This sum is `y1 + y2`, which we have found to be 18.\n\n6.  **Consistency Check**\n    *   Does the nature of mixture X align with this conclusion?\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, meaning at least one component (X1 or X2) is unsaturated (contains C=C bonds). Since y1+y2=18 and both must have a C6 ring, they can't both be saturated (C6H12+C6H12 = 24) or aromatic (C6H6+C6H6=12). Therefore, the mixture must be unsaturated.\n    *   It's stated there are no conjugated bonds. The species could be cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). Let's check the H atom count: 10 + 8 = 18. This fits perfectly. In the reaction, the more unsaturated 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) is dehydrogenated to benzene (C6H6), and the less unsaturated cyclohexene (C6H10) is hydrogenated to cyclohexane (C6H12). This is a classic example of catalytic hydrogen transfer, which can be described as a disproportionation reaction in this context.\n\nThe logical steps are consistent and lead to a unique answer. The total number of hydrogen atoms is 18.\n\n<<<A>>>"
