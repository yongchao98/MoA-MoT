    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning and calculations to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem\n\nThe core of the problem is to compare two different phenomena that cause a star's brightness to dim:\n1.  **Rotational Modulation:** A star has cool, dark spots on one hemisphere. As the star rotates, this spotted hemisphere comes into view, causing the star's overall observed brightness to decrease. When the unspotted hemisphere is in view, the brightness is at its maximum. The difference between the maximum and minimum brightness is the \"amplitude\" of the signal.\n2.  **Exoplanet Transit:** A planet passes in front of its star from our perspective, blocking a small fraction of the starlight. This causes a dip in the star's light curve. The depth of this dip is determined by the ratio of the planet's size to the star's size.\n\nThe goal is to find the size of a hypothetical planet (`R_pl`) relative to its star (`R_star`) that would produce the same signal amplitude as the starspots.\n\n### 2. Modeling the Starspot Brightness Variation\n\nWe use the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the flux (energy radiated per unit area) of a black body is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (`Flux ∝ T⁴`).\n\n**Let's define the variables:**\n*   `T_eff`: Effective temperature of the star's photosphere = 6000 K\n*   `T_spot`: Temperature of the starspots = `T_eff` - 1000 K = 5000 K\n*   `f`: Filling factor of spots on one hemisphere = 20% = 0.20\n\n**Case 1: Maximum Brightness (F_max)**\nThis occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The entire visible disk of the star has a temperature of `T_eff`. We can normalize this maximum flux to 1 for simplicity.\n`F_max = 1`\n\n**Case 2: Minimum Brightness (F_min)**\nThis occurs when the hemisphere covered in spots fully faces the observer. The visible disk is a mix of hot photosphere and cooler spots.\n*   The fraction of the disk that is unspotted is `(1 - f)`. This part radiates at `T_eff`.\n*   The fraction of the disk that is spotted is `f`. This part radiates at `T_spot`.\n\nThe total flux in this state, relative to the maximum flux, is:\n`F_min = (1 - f) * (T_eff/T_eff)⁴ + f * (T_spot/T_eff)⁴`\n`F_min = (1 - f) + f * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴`\n\n**Calculating the Amplitude**\nThe amplitude of the brightness variation is the fractional drop in flux:\n`Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max = 1 - F_min`\n`Amplitude = 1 - [(1 - f) + f * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]`\n`Amplitude = 1 - 1 + f - f * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴`\n`Amplitude = f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴]`\n\n### 3. Modeling the Exoplanet Transit\n\nThe drop in brightness caused by a transiting planet (the \"transit depth\") is equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's disk area.\n*   Area of the planet's disk = `π * R_pl²`\n*   Area of the star's disk = `π * R_star²`\n\n`Transit Depth = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\n### 4. Equating the Signals and Solving\n\nThe problem states that the amplitude of the signal from the starspots is the same as the transit depth from the hypothetical planet.\n`Amplitude = Transit Depth`\n`f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴] = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\nNow, we can solve for the relative radius `R_pl / R_star`:\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt( f * [1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴] )`\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n*   `f = 0.2`\n*   `T_eff = 6000` K\n*   `T_spot = 5000` K\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.2 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴] )`\n\nThis calculation can be performed efficiently using a short Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the given parameters\nf = 0.20  # Spot filling factor\nT_eff = 6000.0  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\ndelta_T = 1000.0  # Temperature difference of the spots in Kelvin\nT_spot = T_eff - delta_T # Temperature of the spots\n\n# The amplitude of the brightness variation due to spots is given by:\n# Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\n# This amplitude must be equal to the transit depth of a hypothetical exoplanet, which is (R_pl / R_star)**2.\n# So, (R_pl / R_star)**2 = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\n\n# Calculate the term inside the square root\nterm = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\n\n# Calculate the relative radius R_pl / R_star\nrelative_radius = math.sqrt(term)\n\nprint(relative_radius)\n```\n<execute_output>\n0.3217897476834313\n</execute_output>\n\nThe calculation shows that the relative radius `R_pl / R_star` is approximately `0.32`. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem requires us to equate the dimming of a star caused by rotational modulation of starspots to the dimming caused by a hypothetical exoplanet transit.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the brightness drop due to starspots.\n\nThe flux (and thus brightness) emitted by a star per unit area is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, `F ∝ T⁴`, where `T` is the effective temperature.\n\n*   `T_eff`: Effective temperature of the unspotted photosphere = 6000 K\n*   `T_spot`: Temperature of the spots = `T_eff` - 1000 K = 5000 K\n*   `f`: Filling factor of spots on one hemisphere = 20% = 0.20\n\nWe need to compare the flux when the unspotted hemisphere is visible (maximum brightness, `F_max`) with the flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible (minimum brightness, `F_min`).\n\nLet's normalize the flux from the unspotted photosphere to 1. The flux from the cool spots will then be `(T_spot / T_eff)⁴` relative to the photosphere.\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (`F_max`):** When the clean hemisphere is in view, the total flux is proportional to the full area of the star's disk emitting at `T_eff`. We can normalize this to `F_max = 1`.\n\n*   **Minimum Flux (`F_min`):** When the spotted hemisphere is in view, 20% of its area (`f`) is covered by spots, and 80% (`1-f`) is the normal photosphere. The total flux is a weighted average of the two components:\n    `F_min = (1 - f) * (T_eff/T_eff)⁴ + f * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴`\n    `F_min = (1 - 0.2) + 0.2 * (5000 / 6000)⁴`\n    `F_min = 0.8 + 0.2 * (5/6)⁴`\n\nThe amplitude of the signal, or the fractional drop in brightness, is:\n`Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n`Amplitude = 1 - F_min`\n`Amplitude = 1 - [0.8 + 0.2 * (5/6)⁴]`\n`Amplitude = 0.2 - 0.2 * (5/6)⁴`\n`Amplitude = 0.2 * [1 - (5/6)⁴]`\n\n### Step 2: Model the brightness drop due to an exoplanet transit.\n\nWhen a planet transits a star, it blocks an amount of light proportional to its area relative to the star's area.\n*   `R_pl`: Radius of the planet\n*   `R_star`: Radius of the star\n\nThe transit depth (fractional drop in brightness) is given by:\n`Transit Depth = (Area of planet) / (Area of star) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\n### Step 3: Equate the two effects and solve for the relative radius.\n\nThe problem states that the amplitude from the spots is the same as the transit depth.\n`Amplitude = Transit Depth`\n`0.2 * [1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴] = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\nNow we solve for the relative radius, `R_pl / R_star`:\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.2 * [1 - (5/6)⁴] )`\n\nCalculating the value:\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.2 * [1 - 0.48225] )`\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.2 * 0.51775 )`\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt( 0.10355 )`\n`R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.32179`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.07\nB) ~0.32\nC) ~0.39\nD) ~0.11\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
