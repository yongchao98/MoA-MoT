    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible organic products:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen, D) at position 2.\n    *   **Reagent/Solvent:** Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base like NaNH2 proceeds through an **elimination-addition mechanism**, involving a highly reactive intermediate called **benzyne**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The amide ion (NH₂⁻) from NaNH₂ acts as a base and removes a proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine). In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions: C2 and C6.\n\n    *   **Path A: Abstraction of H from C6:** The amide ion can remove the hydrogen atom from C6. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion from C1 to form a benzyne intermediate.\n        *   Reactant: Br at C1, D at C2, H at C6.\n        *   The NH₂⁻ removes H from C6.\n        *   A triple bond forms between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 is unaffected in this step.\n        *   Intermediate 1: A benzyne with the triple bond between C1 and C6, and a deuterium atom at C2. This is **3-deutero-benzyne**.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Path B: Abstraction of D from C2:** The amide ion can also remove the deuterium atom from C2. Although the C-D bond is stronger than the C-H bond (a phenomenon known as the kinetic isotope effect), this reaction is still possible.\n        *   Reactant: Br at C1, D at C2.\n        *   The NH₂⁻ removes D from C2.\n        *   A triple bond forms between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is now gone from the ring (it becomes part of NH₂D).\n        *   Intermediate 2: A benzyne with the triple bond between C1 and C2, and only hydrogen atoms at the other positions. This is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n         \n\n    Since the question asks for all *possible* products, we must consider the outcomes from both benzyne intermediates, even if one is formed at a slower rate than the other.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The amide ion (NH₂⁻) now acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. This is followed by protonation of the resulting carbanion by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃) to give the final aniline product(s).\n\n    *   **Products from Intermediate 1 (3-deutero-benzyne):**\n        *   **Attack at C1:** The NH₂⁻ group adds to C1. This creates a carbanion at C6, which is then protonated by NH₃. The final product has an -NH₂ group at C1 and a deuterium (D) at C2. This is **aniline-2-d** (or *o*-deuteroaniline).\n        *   **Attack at C6:** The NH₂⁻ group adds to C6. This creates a carbanion at C1, which is protonated. The final product has an -NH₂ group at C6 and a D at C2. If we renumber the ring starting from the -NH₂ group as C1, the deuterium is at C3. This is **aniline-3-d** (or *m*-deuteroaniline).\n\n         \n\n    *   **Product from Intermediate 2 (Benzyne):**\n        *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** The NH₂⁻ group attacks either C1 or C2 of the symmetric benzyne triple bond. Protonation of the resulting carbanion yields a single product: aniline (with an -NH₂ group and no deuterium).\n        *   This gives **aniline**.\n\n         \n\n4.  **Conclusion**\n    By considering all possible pathways, we find three distinct organic products that can be formed:\n    1.  Aniline-2-d (from Path A)\n    2.  Aniline-3-d (from Path A)\n    3.  Aniline (from Path B)\n\n    Therefore, there are a total of **3** possible organic products.\n\n<<<C>>>"
