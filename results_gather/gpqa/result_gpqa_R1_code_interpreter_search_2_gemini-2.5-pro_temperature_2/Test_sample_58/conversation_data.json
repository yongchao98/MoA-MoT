    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning and calculations to determine the pH of the final solution.\n\n**1. Identify the components and their nature:**\n*   `CH3COOH`: Acetic acid, a weak acid.\n*   `HCl`: Hydrochloric acid, a strong acid. It will completely dissociate into H+ and Cl- ions.\n*   `Ba(OH)2`: Barium hydroxide, a strong base. It will completely dissociate into Ba2+ and 2 OH- ions.\n\n**2. Calculate the initial moles of acidic and basic species:**\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 M × 0.500 L = 0.050 mol\n\n*   **Moles of H+ (from strong acid HCl):**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Moles = 0.2 M × 0.400 L = 0.080 mol\n\n*   **Moles of OH- (from strong base Ba(OH)2):**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 M × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Since each mole of Ba(OH)2 provides 2 moles of OH-, the total moles of OH- are:\n    *   Moles of OH- = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol\n\n**3. Perform the neutralization reaction:**\nThe strong base (OH-) will react completely with any available acid. It will react with the strong acid (H+ from HCl) first, and then with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   **Total available H+ (from both strong and weak acids):**\n    *   Total moles of H+ = (moles from HCl) + (moles from CH3COOH)\n    *   Total moles of H+ = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = 0.130 mol\n\n*   **Compare total moles of base (OH-) with total moles of acid (H+):**\n    *   Moles of OH- = 0.180 mol\n    *   Moles of H+ = 0.130 mol\n    *   Since there are more moles of OH- than total moles of H+, the base is in excess, and the final solution will be basic.\n\n*   **Calculate the excess moles of OH-:**\n    *   Excess Moles of OH- = (Initial Moles OH-) - (Total Moles H+)\n    *   Excess Moles of OH- = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n**4. Calculate the concentration of the excess OH- ions:**\nFirst, we need the total volume of the mixed solution.\n\n*   **Total Volume:**\n    *   V_total = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L\n\n*   **Concentration of OH- ([OH-]):**\n    *   [OH-] = (Excess Moles of OH-) / (Total Volume)\n    *   [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n**5. Calculate pOH and then pH:**\nThe pH of the solution is determined by this concentration of excess strong base. The contribution of OH- from the conjugate base (CH3COO-) formed is negligible in the presence of a strong base.\n\n*   **Calculate pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH-]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<A>>>"
