    "This is a multi-step synthesis problem. Let's break it down step-by-step to identify the final product, Product 4.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone was treated with bromine (Br₂).**\nThis is the alpha-bromination of a ketone. Cyclohexanone will be brominated at the alpha-position (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group). The product is 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n*   **Product 1 = 2-bromocyclohexanone**\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) was heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH).**\nWhen an α-haloketone with available protons on the other α'-carbon is treated with a strong base like NaOH, two major reactions can occur:\n1.  **Dehydrohalogenation (Elimination):** Abstraction of a proton from the β-carbon (C3) leads to the formation of an α,β-unsaturated ketone, cyclohex-2-en-1-one.\n2.  **Favorskii Rearrangement:** Abstraction of a proton from the α'-carbon (C6) forms an enolate, which then undergoes intramolecular substitution to form a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate. This intermediate is then attacked by hydroxide and undergoes ring opening to yield a ring-contracted carboxylic acid. For 2-halocyclohexanones, this rearrangement is very common and leads to cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\nLet's evaluate the subsequent steps to determine which path is more plausible. Path 2 (Favorskii) involves forming a carboxylic acid, which reacts cleanly with thionyl chloride in the next step. Path 1 leads to an enone, whose reaction with thionyl chloride is less common. Furthermore, the overall sequence of reactions in the Favorskii path represents a classic series of named organic transformations. Therefore, we will proceed with the product from the Favorskii rearrangement.\n*   **Product 2 = Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) was treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.**\nThis is the standard procedure for converting a carboxylic acid (-COOH) into an acid chloride (-COCl). The thionyl chloride is the chlorinating agent, and pyridine is a base that neutralizes the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product 3 = Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) was treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃).**\nThis is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is well-known for selectively reducing acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the alcohol. This is a variation of the Rosenmund reduction.\n*   **Product 4 = Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\n**Final Task: Determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde).**\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms is 1 (on the aldehyde) + 9 (on the cyclopentyl ring) = 10.\nWe need to find the number of unique proton environments, which corresponds to the number of signals in an ¹H NMR spectrum. This depends on the molecule's symmetry.\n\nCyclopentane rings are not planar. They exist in rapidly interconverting puckered conformations, mainly the \"envelope\" (Cₛ symmetry) and \"half-chair\" (C₂ symmetry) forms. The observed NMR spectrum is a result of this conformational averaging.\n\nLet's analyze the symmetry of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde, assuming it adopts the C₂-symmetric half-chair conformation, which is a common conformer for monosubstituted cyclopentanes. In this conformation, the C₂ axis of symmetry passes through the carbon attached to the substituent (C1), the substituent itself, and bisects the opposite C-C bond (the C3-C4 bond).\n\n1.  **Aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton lies on the C₂ axis. It is unique. (1 signal)\n2.  **Proton on C1 of the ring:** This proton also lies on the C₂ axis. It is unique. (1 signal)\n3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** The C₂ axis makes the C2 position equivalent to the C5 position. The two protons on C2 (one \"pseudo-axial\", one \"pseudo-equatorial\") are diastereotopic and thus not equivalent to each other. The C₂ rotation maps the two protons on C2 to the corresponding two protons on C5. Therefore, there are two distinct sets of protons for these four positions. (2 signals)\n4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** The C₂ axis also makes the C3 position equivalent to the C4 position. Similar to the case above, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. These map onto the protons on C4. This gives another two distinct sets of protons. (2 signals)\n\nTotalling the number of signals: 1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5 H's) + 2 (from C3/C4 H's) = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe options provided are A) 7, B) 6, C) 10, D) 8. Our analysis leads to 6.\n\n*Alternative Pathway Check:*\nIf Step 2 had been elimination, Product 2 would be cyclohex-2-en-one. Subsequent steps are less standard, but a plausible (though contested) pathway could lead back to cyclohex-2-en-one as Product 4. Cyclohex-2-en-one (C₆H₈O) has 8 protons in total. Due to its chiral, non-planar conformation (C₁ symmetry), all 8 protons are chemically distinct. This would give 8 signals (Option D). However, the reaction sequence involving the Favorskii rearrangement is chemically more sound and elegant, making cyclopentanecarbaldehyde the more likely intended product.\n\nGiven the choices, and the sound chemical logic of the Favorskii pathway, the answer is 6.\n\n<<<B>>>"
