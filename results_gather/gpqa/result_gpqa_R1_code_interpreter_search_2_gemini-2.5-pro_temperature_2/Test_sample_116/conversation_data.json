    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Understand the core concept:** The question asks to identify which of the given compounds show *optical isomerism*. Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism where molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. A key requirement for a molecule to exhibit optical isomerism is that it must be **chiral**. A molecule is chiral if it lacks an internal plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n\n2.  **Analyze each compound individually for chirality:**\n\n    *   **Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n        *   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl compound. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single C-C bond. The positions ortho to this bond (positions 2, 6, 2', and 6') are all substituted.\n            *   Positions 2 and 2' have dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH₃).\n            *   Positions 6 and 6' have dinitro groups (-NO₂).\n        *   **Chirality Analysis:** In biphenyl systems, if the ortho positions have large, bulky groups, the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings is hindered due to steric strain. This phenomenon is called **atropisomerism**. The substituents (-COOCH₃ and -NO₂) are sufficiently bulky to prevent free rotation.\n        *   Because rotation is locked, the two phenyl rings cannot become coplanar. They exist in skewed conformations. We must then check for symmetry in this locked conformation. The substitution pattern (nitro group and carboxylate group on each ring) means the molecule does not have a plane of symmetry that can pass through the molecule.\n        *   The molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable, just like a left hand and a right hand.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral due to atropisomerism and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n        *   **Structure:** This is an ester, commonly known as methyl lactate. The chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃.\n        *   **Chirality Analysis:** The most common source of chirality in simple organic molecules is a **chiral center** (or asymmetric carbon atom) — a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n        *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group):\n            1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n            2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n            3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n            4.  -COOCH₃ (a methyl ester group)\n        *   Since all four groups attached to this carbon are different, it is a chiral center. A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, is therefore chiral, and exhibits optical isomerism (exists as two enantiomers, (R)- and (S)-methyl lactate).\n\n    *   **Compound 3: benzophenone**\n        *   **Structure:** The chemical formula is (C₆H₅)₂CO. It consists of a central carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings.\n        *   **Chirality Analysis:** The central carbon atom is sp² hybridized, as it's part of a double bond. It is only bonded to three groups (two phenyl rings and one oxygen), so it cannot be a chiral center. The molecule as a whole possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the O=C bond and reflects one phenyl ring onto the other.\n        *   Since the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it is **achiral**. Its mirror image is superimposable on the original molecule.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n        *   **Structure:** This is the *trans*-isomer of dimethyl butenedioate. The structure has a central C=C double bond.\n            ```\n                H       COOCH₃\n                 \\     /\n                  C = C\n                 /     \\\n            H₃COOC       H\n            ```\n        *   **Chirality Analysis:** This molecule is largely planar. It possesses several elements of symmetry. Most notably, it has a **center of inversion** (also called a center of symmetry) located at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. Any point on the molecule can be inverted through this center to find an identical point. It also has a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself if considered flat).\n        *   The presence of these symmetry elements means the molecule is **achiral**. While it has a stereoisomer (its *cis*-isomer, dimethyl maleate), this is an example of geometric isomerism, not optical isomerism.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **Final Summary and Answer Selection:**\n    *   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n    *   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n    *   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n    *   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\n    Therefore, only compounds 1 and 2 show optical isomerism. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
