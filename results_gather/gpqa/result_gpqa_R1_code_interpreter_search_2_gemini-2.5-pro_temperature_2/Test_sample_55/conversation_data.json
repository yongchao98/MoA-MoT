    "My thinking process to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **System:** Hydrogen (H) atom in the non-relativistic theory.\n    *   **Initial State:** $|i\\rangle = |n=3, l=0, m=0\\rangle$, which is the 3s state.\n    *   **Final State:** $|f\\rangle = |n=1, l=0, m=0\\rangle$, which is the 1s ground state.\n    *   **Process:** Decay via two consecutive electric dipole transitions.\n    *   **Goal:** Identify the allowed transition route(s) and the corresponding probability for one of these routes.\n\n2.  **Recall the Selection Rules for Electric Dipole (E1) Transitions:**\n    For a transition to be allowed, the quantum numbers must change according to the following rules:\n    *   Change in principal quantum number: $\\Delta n$ = any integer.\n    *   Change in orbital angular momentum quantum number: $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n    *   Change in magnetic quantum number: $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n\n3.  **Trace the Possible Decay Path:**\n    The decay is a two-step process, so it must proceed through an intermediate state, let's call it $|int\\rangle = |n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Step 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n        *   Applying the selection rules to the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$:\n        *   $\\Delta l = l' - l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1 \\implies l' = 1$. The intermediate state must be a p-orbital.\n        *   For a decay (spontaneous emission), the energy must decrease, so $n' < n$. Therefore, $n'$ can be 2 or 1. However, there is no $l=1$ state for $n=1$ (the 1p state doesn't exist). Thus, the intermediate state must have $n'=2$.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m' - m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1 \\implies m' = 0, 1, -1$.\n        *   So, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$. These are the three sublevels of the 2p orbital.\n\n    *   **Step 2: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n        *   Let's check if transitions from our possible intermediate states to the final state are allowed.\n        *   Initial states: $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ with $m' \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$.\n        *   Final state: $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m' = -m'$. For this to be $0, \\pm 1$, $m'$ must be $0, \\pm 1$. All our intermediate states satisfy this condition.\n        *   Therefore, all three routes are possible:\n            *   Route 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n            *   Route 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n            *   Route 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probabilities (Branching Ratios):**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific route. For a cascade decay, this is determined by the branching ratio of the first step, assuming the intermediate state has only one decay channel to the final state (which is true here, as the 2p state only decays to the 1s state).\n\n    The branching ratio for the transition $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$ depends on the partial decay rate for each final state $m'$. The decay rate is given by Fermi's Golden Rule and is proportional to the square of the transition dipole moment, summed over the final photon polarizations.\n\n    A key insight comes from the Wigner-Eckart theorem. The theorem separates the matrix element into a geometrical part (Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, dependent on $m, m'$) and a physical part (reduced matrix element, independent of $m, m'$).\n\n    The transition rate from an initial state $|n, l, m\\rangle$ to a final state $|n', l', m'\\rangle$ is proportional to:\n    $Rate \\propto \\sum_{q=0,\\pm1} |\\langle n',l',m' | T_q^1 | n,l,m \\rangle|^2$\n    where $T_q^1$ are the spherical tensor components of the dipole operator.\n\n    According to the Wigner-Eckart theorem:\n    $\\langle n',l',m' | T_q^1 | n,l,m \\rangle \\propto \\langle l,m; 1,q | l',m' \\rangle$ (a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient).\n\n    For our first step: $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ and $|f\\rangle = |2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n    $Rate(m') \\propto \\sum_{q=-1,0,1} |\\langle 0,0; 1,q | 1,m' \\rangle|^2$\n\n    The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle 0,0; 1,q | 1,m' \\rangle$ is non-zero only when $m'=q$, and its value is 1.\n    *   For $m'=0$: The sum is non-zero only for $q=0$. Rate(0) $\\propto |\\langle 0,0; 1,0 | 1,0 \\rangle|^2 = 1^2 = 1$.\n    *   For $m'=1$: The sum is non-zero only for $q=1$. Rate(1) $\\propto |\\langle 0,0; 1,1 | 1,1 \\rangle|^2 = 1^2 = 1$.\n    *   For $m'=-1$: The sum is non-zero only for $q=-1$. Rate(-1) $\\propto |\\langle 0,0; 1,-1 | 1,-1 \\rangle|^2 = 1^2 = 1$.\n\n    Physically, since the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (unpolarized) and the decay happens in free space (isotropic interaction), there is no preferred orientation for the final state. Therefore, the probabilities of decaying into each of the sublevels $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ must be equal.\n\n    Total Rate $\\propto 1 + 1 + 1 = 3$.\n    The probability (branching ratio) for decaying into a specific state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is:\n    $P(m') = \\frac{\\text{Rate}(m')}{\\text{Total Rate}} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n5.  **Finalizing the Answer:**\n    The probability of the cascade $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ is determined by the probability of the first step, which is $1/3$. The second step, $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$, happens with probability 1 since it's the only available decay channel for the 2p state.\n\n    Therefore, the probability for this specific route is $1/3$. Let's check the options:\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ - This matches our calculation.\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ - The probability is incorrect. It should also be $1/3$.\n    *   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ - The probability is incorrect. It should also be $1/3$.\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ - The probability is incorrect.\n\n    The only option that presents a valid route with the correct corresponding probability is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
