    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1.**\n\n*   **Reactants and Conditions:** The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, a C₁₀H₁₄Br₂ compound. It's heated with excess KOH at a very high temperature (240°C). Adamantane has a rigid tricyclic cage structure.\n*   **Reaction Analysis:** Reactions on bridgehead positions of adamantane are difficult. Simple elimination (E2) is forbidden by Bredt's rule. Simple substitution (SN2) is impossible due to backside attack being blocked. At high temperatures, carbocation formation (SN1/E1) followed by rearrangement is a common pathway for adamantane derivatives, often leading to thermodynamically more stable or kinetically favored rearranged skeletons. A known reaction under these harsh basic conditions is a Grob-type fragmentation or rearrangement of the carbon skeleton.\n*   **Product 1 Spectral Data Analysis:**\n    *   The total integration of the ¹H NMR spectrum (2H + 10H + 2H) is 14H. The starting material also has 14H. This suggests the reaction is a substitution/rearrangement, not an elimination that would reduce the proton count. The molecular formula for Product 1 is likely C₁₀H₁₄O, which results from the replacement of two Br atoms with one oxygen atom (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂ + 2OH⁻ → C₁₀H₁₄O + 2Br⁻ + H₂O). The degrees of unsaturation for C₁₀H₁₄O is (2*10 + 2 - 14)/2 = 4.\n    *   The IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a ketone (C=O) group, likely in a six-membered ring. This accounts for one degree of unsaturation.\n    *   The ¹H NMR signal at 4.79 ppm (2H) is characteristic of vinylic protons, specifically those of an exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂). This accounts for a second degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Since we have accounted for two degrees of unsaturation (one C=O, one C=C), the remaining two must correspond to a bicyclic structure. This confirms that one of the rings of the original tricyclic adamantane skeleton must have opened during the reaction.\n*   **Structure Proposal for Product 1:** Based on the above analysis, Product 1 is a bicyclic C₁₀ keto-alkene containing an exocyclic (=CH₂) group. A classic rearrangement product of adamantane is the bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane skeleton. Placing a ketone and an exocyclic methylene group on this C₉ framework to get a C₁₀ molecule leads to structures like 7-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one. This structure possesses a plane of symmetry which is consistent with the simple NMR spectrum provided (although some accidental equivalence would be needed to get only 3 signals). This is the most chemically plausible structure for Product 1.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide (Al(O-iPr)₃). This is the standard reagent for a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction.\n*   **Analysis:** The MPV reaction selectively reduces ketones and aldehydes to alcohols. The C=C double bond is unaffected.\n*   **Structure of Product 2:** The ketone group in Product 1 is reduced to a secondary alcohol. Therefore, Product 2 is **7-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**. It is a bicyclic C₁₀ hydroxy-alkene.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS). This is an ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup.\n*   **Analysis:** Ozonolysis cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds. The reductive workup (using DMS) converts the intermediate ozonide into ketones or aldehydes. Specifically, the exocyclic =CH₂ group will be cleaved to form a ketone (C=O) at the parent carbon and formaldehyde (H₂C=O), which is washed away. The alcohol group remains unchanged.\n*   **Structure of Product 3:** The =CH₂ group at the C7 position of Product 2 is converted into a ketone group. The carbon from the methylene group is lost. The resulting structure is **3-hydroxybicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-7-one**. This is a bicyclic C₉ hydroxy-ketone. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry passing through C3, C9, and C7, assuming it adopts a symmetric twin-chair conformation.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of Product 3.**\n\n*   **Question:** What is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding the exchangeable OH proton)?\n*   **Identifying the Most Deshielded Proton:**\n    *   Protons alpha to the ketone (C=O) at C7 (i.e., protons at C6 and C8) typically have a chemical shift of δ ≈ 2.2-2.6 ppm.\n    *   The proton on the carbon bearing the alcohol group (-CHOH) at C3 (the carbinol proton, H3) is significantly more deshielded due to the electronegativity of the oxygen atom. Its chemical shift is typically δ ≈ 3.5-4.5 ppm.\n    *   Other protons (bridgehead, other CH₂) are further upfield.\n    *   Therefore, the **H3 proton** is the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton.\n*   **Determining the Coupling Pattern (Splitting) of H3:**\n    *   To find the splitting pattern of H3, we must look at its neighboring protons (protons on adjacent carbons, C2 and C4).\n    *   In the stable twin-chair conformation, the large OH group will occupy an equatorial position, forcing the H3 proton into an axial position (H3ₐₓ).\n    *   H3 is coupled to the four protons on C2 and C4. Due to the molecular symmetry, the two protons on C2 are equivalent to the two on C4. Let's consider the coupling of H3 to H2ₐₓ and H2ₑq. The same applies to H4.\n    *   So, H3 is coupled to two equivalent axial protons (H2ₐₓ and H4ₐₓ) and two equivalent equatorial protons (H2ₑq and H4ₑq).\n    *   The magnitude of the coupling constant (J) depends on the dihedral angle (Karplus relationship).\n        *   The coupling between adjacent axial protons (H3ₐₓ and H2ₐₓ/H4ₐₓ) has a dihedral angle of ~180°, resulting in a **large** coupling constant (J_ax-ax ≈ 10-13 Hz).\n        *   The coupling between an axial and an adjacent equatorial proton (H3ₐₓ and H2ₑq/H4ₑq) has a dihedral angle of ~60°, resulting in a **small** coupling constant (J_ax-eq ≈ 2-5 Hz).\n    *   Since H3 is coupled to two sets of equivalent protons with two different coupling constants, its signal will be split into a **triplet of triplets**. The large J_ax-ax coupling splits the signal into a triplet, and each line of that triplet is further split into a smaller triplet by the small J_ax-eq coupling.\n\nThe correct coupling pattern is a triplet of triplets.\n\n<<<C>>>"
