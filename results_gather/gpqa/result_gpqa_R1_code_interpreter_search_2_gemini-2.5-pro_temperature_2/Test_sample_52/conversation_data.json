    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structural Information:**\n    *   The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means we start with a benzene ring (C6H6) and replace two hydrogen atoms with two substituent groups. The core of the molecule is therefore a C6H4 group.\n    *   The FTIR spectrum shows an \"ester group\". An ester functional group has the structure R-COO-R', which contains one C=O double bond and the -COO- linkage. The formula for the ester atoms is CO2.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Six total signals:** This indicates a molecule with a moderate degree of symmetry and six chemically distinct types of protons.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons (C6H4). If these 4 protons give only two signals, it strongly suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most commonly para (1,4-disubstitution). In a para-substituted ring with two different substituents, the four protons form two chemically equivalent pairs, leading to two signals (typically two doublets).\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a critical constraint. The final structure cannot contain any methylene (-CH2-) groups.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** There are two distinct methyl (-CH3) groups in the molecule.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet (d) and one doublet of quartets (dq)):** This splitting pattern is highly characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) attached to another group with no adjacent protons (like the aromatic ring).\n        *   Let the structure be Ring-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n        *   Proton H(b) is adjacent to one proton H(a) (which will split it into a doublet) and three protons of the -CH3 group (which will split it into a quartet). The combination gives a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n        *   Proton H(a) is adjacent only to proton H(b) (which will split it into a **doublet (d)**).\n        *   This pattern perfectly matches the description. So, one of the substituents on the ring is a propenyl group, **-C3H5**. This group also accounts for one of the two -CH3 signals.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Pieces and Determine the Second Substituent:**\n    *   We have the C6H4 ring and a -C3H5 (propenyl) substituent.\n    *   The compound is an ester and has a second -CH3 group. The simplest way to form an ester substituent containing a methyl group and no -CH2- group is either a methyl carboxylate group (**-COOCH3**) or an acetate group (**-OCOCH3**).\n    *   Let's find the formula for this second substituent. Both -COOCH3 and -OCOCH3 have the same chemical formula: **C2H3O2**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Chemical Formula:**\n    *   Now we sum the atomic composition of all the identified parts of the molecule:\n        *   Aromatic ring: C6H4\n        *   Propenyl group: C3H5\n        *   Ester/Methyl group: C2H3O2\n    *   **Total Carbons (C):** 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n    *   **Total Hydrogens (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n    *   **Total Oxygens (O):** 2\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Verify with Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The DoU for a formula CxHyOz is calculated as: DoU = x - (y/2) + 1.\n    *   For C11H12O2: DoU = 11 - (12/2) + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = 6.\n    *   The DoU from the proposed structure is: 4 (for the benzene ring) + 1 (for the vinyl C=C double bond) + 1 (for the ester C=O double bond) = 6.\n    *   The DoU calculation is consistent, confirming the formula C11H12O2 is plausible for the described structure.\n\n6.  **Evaluate Other Options:**\n    *   **A) C11H14O2:** DoU = 5. The extra two hydrogens would likely come from saturating the vinyl double bond, which would create -CH2- groups and eliminate the vinyl signals. This is incorrect.\n    *   **C) C12H12O2:** DoU = 7. This would require an additional double bond or ring compared to our proposed structure, which is not supported by the NMR data.\n    *   **D) C12H14O2:** DoU = 6. This formula has the same DoU as our answer, but contains an additional C and 2H atoms (a CH2 unit). A plausible structure for this formula, such as ethyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate, would contain a -CH2- group, which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data. Other isomers of C12H14O2 without -CH2- groups do not match the specific vinyl proton signals.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that perfectly matches all the provided spectral data is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
