    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the quantum mechanics problem.\n\n### 1. Normalize the Initial State\n\nThe given state is `|α⟩`, which is proportional to `(1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩`.\nLet's write this as `|α⟩ = N * [(1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩]`, where `N` is the normalization constant.\nIn vector notation, with `|up⟩ = (1, 0)` and `|down⟩ = (0, 1)`, the state vector is `(N(1+i), N(2-i))`.\n\nFor the state to be normalized, its inner product with itself, `⟨α|α⟩`, must be equal to 1.\n`⟨α|α⟩ = |N|^2 * [ (1-i)⟨up| + (2+i)⟨down| ] * [ (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩ ]`\nUsing the orthogonality of the basis states (`⟨up|up⟩ = ⟨down|down⟩ = 1` and `⟨up|down⟩ = ⟨down|up⟩ = 0`), the inner product simplifies to:\n`⟨α|α⟩ = |N|^2 * [ (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i) ] = 1`\n`|N|^2 * [ (1² - i²) + (2² - i²) ] = 1`\n`|N|^2 * [ (1 - (-1)) + (4 - (-1)) ] = 1`\n`|N|^2 * [ 2 + 5 ] = 1`\n`7 * |N|^2 = 1`\n`|N|^2 = 1/7`, so we can choose the real, positive constant `N = 1/√7`.\n\nThe normalized state is:\n`|α⟩ = (1/√7) * [(1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩]`\nIn vector form: `|α⟩ = (1/√7) * [1+i, 2-i]`\n\n### 2. Define the Operator A and Find its Eigenstates and Eigenvalues\n\nThe problem defines the operator `A` by its matrix elements `Aij`, where `Aij = ħ/2` if `i ≠ j`, and `0` otherwise. For a 2-level system (|up⟩, |down⟩), this gives a 2x2 matrix:\n`A = [[A11, A12], [A21, A22]] = [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]] = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\nThis operator is proportional to the Pauli-X matrix (`σx`).\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`:\n`det([[ -λ, ħ/2 ], [ ħ/2, -λ ]]) = (-λ)(-λ) - (ħ/2)(ħ/2) = λ² - (ħ/2)² = 0`\nThis gives two eigenvalues:\n`λ₁ = +ħ/2`\n`λ₂ = -ħ/2`\n\nNow, we find the corresponding eigenvectors:\n*   For `λ₁ = +ħ/2`:\n    `[[ -ħ/2, ħ/2 ], [ ħ/2, -ħ/2 ]] * [[x], [y]] = 0`\n    This gives the equation `-x + y = 0`, or `x = y`. The unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, 1]`.\n    Normalizing it gives the first eigenstate: `|v₁⟩ = (1/√2) * (|up⟩ + |down⟩)`.\n\n*   For `λ₂ = -ħ/2`:\n    `[[ ħ/2, ħ/2 ], [ ħ/2, ħ/2 ]] * [[x], [y]] = 0`\n    This gives the equation `x + y = 0`, or `x = -y`. The unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, -1]`.\n    Normalizing it gives the second eigenstate: `|v₂⟩ = (1/√2) * (|up⟩ - |down⟩)`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Measurement Probabilities\n\nThe probability `P(v)` of measuring the system in a state `|v⟩` is given by `P(v) = |⟨v|α⟩|²`.\n\n*   **Probability of measuring λ₁ = +ħ/2 (i.e., being in state |v₁⟩):**\n    `P(v₁) = |⟨v₁|α⟩|²`\n    `⟨v₁|α⟩ = [ (1/√2) * (⟨up| + ⟨down|) ] * [ (1/√7) * ((1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩) ]`\n    `⟨v₁|α⟩ = (1/√14) * [ (1+i) + (2-i) ]`\n    `⟨v₁|α⟩ = 3 / √14`\n    `P(v₁) = (3 / √14)² = 9/14`\n\n*   **Probability of measuring λ₂ = -ħ/2 (i.e., being in state |v₂⟩):**\n    `P(v₂) = |⟨v₂|α⟩|²`\n    `⟨v₂|α⟩ = [ (1/√2) * (⟨up| - ⟨down|) ] * [ (1/√7) * ((1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩) ]`\n    `⟨v₂|α⟩ = (1/√14) * [ (1+i) - (2-i) ]`\n    `⟨v₂|α⟩ = (1/√14) * [ -1 + 2i ]`\n    `P(v₂) = |(-1 + 2i) / √14|² = ((-1)² + 2²) / 14 = (1 + 4) / 14 = 5/14`\n\nLet's convert these fractions to decimals:\n`P(v₁) = 9/14 ≈ 0.6428`\n`P(v₂) = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571`\nSo, the probabilities are approximately **0.64** and **0.36**.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Average (Expectation) Value of A\n\nThe average or expectation value of an operator `A` is given by `⟨A⟩ = ⟨α|A|α⟩`.\n\n`A|α⟩ = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * (1/√7) * [[1+i], [2-i]]`\n`A|α⟩ = (ħ / (2√7)) * [[2-i], [1+i]]`\n\nNow, we compute `⟨α|A|α⟩`:\n`⟨A⟩ = [ (1/√7) * [1-i, 2+i] ] * [ (ħ / (2√7)) * [[2-i], [1+i]] ]`\n`⟨A⟩ = (ħ / (√7 * 2√7)) * [ (1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i) ]`\n`⟨A⟩ = (ħ / 14) * [ (2 - i - 2i + i²) + (2 + 2i + i + i²) ]`\n`⟨A⟩ = (ħ / 14) * [ (2 - 3i - 1) + (2 + 3i - 1) ]`\n`⟨A⟩ = (ħ / 14) * [ (1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i) ]`\n`⟨A⟩ = (ħ / 14) * 2 = ħ / 7`\n\nAlternatively, the expectation value can be calculated as the sum of the eigenvalues weighted by their respective probabilities:\n`⟨A⟩ = P(v₁)λ₁ + P(v₂)λ₂`\n`⟨A⟩ = (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2)`\n`⟨A⟩ = (ħ/28) * (9 - 5) = 4ħ / 28 = ħ / 7`\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value is `ħ/7`. This matches the values given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
