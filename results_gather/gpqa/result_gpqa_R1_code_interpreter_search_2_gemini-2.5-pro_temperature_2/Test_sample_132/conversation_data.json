    "This problem requires us to calculate the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in a buffer solution.\n\n**1. Understand the chemical system:**\n*   The solution is prepared by dissolving potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4·2H2O) in water.\n*   KH2PO4 dissociates completely into K+ and H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate ion).\n*   Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates completely into 2Na+, HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate ion), and 2H2O.\n*   The key species are the conjugate acid-base pair H2PO4- and HPO4^2-. They form a buffer solution.\n\n**2. Identify the relevant equilibria:**\nPhosphoric acid (H3PO4) is a triprotic acid with three dissociation steps:\n*   H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4-  (Ka1 = 7.5 x 10^-3)\n*   H2PO4- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2 x 10^-8)\n*   HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-  (Ka3 = 1.8 x 10^-12)\n\nThe solution contains significant amounts of H2PO4- and HPO4^2-, so the pH is primarily determined by the second equilibrium (Ka2). The concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) is determined by the third equilibrium (Ka3).\n\n**3. Calculate the initial concentrations of the buffer components:**\n*   Volume of solution = 200.00 cm3 = 0.200 L\n*   Moles of KH2PO4 = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n*   Initial concentration of H2PO4- = [H2PO4-] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n*   Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n*   Initial concentration of HPO4^2- = [HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**4. Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] using the Ka2 equilibrium:**\nThe equilibrium expression for the second dissociation is:\nKa2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [H+]. Since Ka2 is small, we can assume the equilibrium concentrations of the buffer components are approximately equal to their initial concentrations.\n[H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\n[H+] = (6.2 x 10^-8) * (0.03674 M) / (0.02809 M)\n[H+] ≈ 8.11 x 10^-8 M\n\n**5. Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-] using the Ka3 equilibrium:**\nThe equilibrium expression for the third dissociation is:\nKa3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-].\n[PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\n\nWe use the initial concentration of [HPO4^2-] and the calculated [H+]. The amount of HPO4^2- that dissociates is negligible because Ka3 is extremely small.\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8 x 10^-12) * (0.02809 M) / (8.11 x 10^-8 M)\n[PO4^3-] ≈ 6.23 x 10^-7 M\n\nThis value is closest to option C.\n\nLet's perform the calculation using a python script for precision.\n```python\n# Constants provided in the problem\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # in g\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # in g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # in g\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99  # in g/mol\nvolume_L = 0.200  # in L\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate initial molar concentrations of the buffer components\nconc_H2PO4 = (mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4) / volume_L\nconc_HPO4 = (mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O) / volume_L\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] using the buffer equilibrium\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-] => [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\nH_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4 / conc_HPO4)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO4^3-]\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-] => [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\nconc_PO4 = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4 / H_plus_conc)\n\n# Print the final result in scientific notation matching the options\nprint(f\"{conc_PO4:.2e} M\")\n```\n\nThe computed concentration of PO4^3- is approximately 6.24 x 10^-7 M. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 3.97x10^-7 M\nB) 5.48x10^-7 M\nC) 6.24x10^-7 M\nD) 2.81x10^-7 M\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The initial step is to determine the molar concentrations of the two salts dissolved in the solution.\n\n1.  **Calculate moles of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O:**\n    *   Moles of KH2PO4 = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial molar concentrations:**\n    *   The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 0.200 L.\n    *   Initial concentration of H2PO4⁻ (from KH2PO4) = Moles of KH2PO4 / Volume (L)\n    *   Initial concentration of HPO4²⁻ (from Na2HPO4·2H2O) = Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O / Volume (L)\n\n3.  **Identify the relevant equilibria:**\n    *   The solution contains a mixture of a weak acid (H2PO4⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO4²⁻). This is a buffer solution. The pH is primarily governed by the second dissociation constant of phosphoric acid, Ka2.\n    *   H2PO4⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO4²⁻       (Ka2 = 6.2 x 10⁻⁸)\n\n4.  **Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺]:**\n    *   Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation or the Ka2 expression, we can find the [H⁺].\n    *   Ka2 = [H⁺][HPO4²⁻] / [H2PO4⁻]\n    *   Rearranging for [H⁺]: [H⁺] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4⁻] / [HPO4²⁻])\n    *   We can use the initial concentrations of the acid and base as they will not change significantly.\n\n5.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion [PO4³⁻] concentration:**\n    *   The orthophosphate ion is formed from the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion, HPO4²⁻. This equilibrium is governed by Ka3.\n    *   HPO4²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO4³⁻        (Ka3 = 1.8 x 10⁻¹²)\n    *   From the Ka3 expression: Ka3 = [H⁺][PO4³⁻] / [HPO4²⁻]\n    *   We can rearrange this equation to solve for [PO4³⁻]:\n    *   [PO4³⁻] = Ka3 * [HPO4²⁻] / [H⁺]\n\nThe python code executed the these steps precisely:\n*   It first calculated the initial concentrations of H2PO4⁻ (`conc_H2PO4`) and HPO4²⁻ (`conc_HPO4`).\n*   Then, it used these concentrations and Ka2 to find the hydrogen ion concentration (`H_plus_conc`).\n*   Finally, it used the calculated `H_plus_conc`, the concentration of HPO4²⁻, and Ka3 to determine the final concentration of PO4³⁻.\n\nThe code's output was `6.24e-07 M`, which is 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M. This result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
