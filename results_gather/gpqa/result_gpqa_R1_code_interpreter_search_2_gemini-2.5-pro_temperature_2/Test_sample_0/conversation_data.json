    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the User's Question:**\n    *   The question involves two quantum states.\n    *   Each state has a specific energy (E1, E2) and a finite lifetime (τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s, τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s).\n    *   The goal is to find an energy difference, |E1 - E2|, that is large enough to \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" these two energy levels.\n    *   Four options for the energy difference are provided in electron-volts (eV).\n\n2.  **Identify the Core Physics Principle:**\n    *   Finite lifetimes of quantum states are directly related to an uncertainty or \"spread\" in their energy. This is a direct application of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, specifically the time-energy uncertainty relation.\n    *   The principle states: ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   For an unstable state with a lifetime τ, the uncertainty in its energy (ΔE), also known as its natural linewidth, can be approximated as: ΔE ≈ ħ/τ.\n\n3.  **Formulate a Strategy:**\n    *   To resolve two energy levels, the separation between them (|E1 - E2|) must be greater than the \"blurriness\" or energy spread of the levels.\n    *   A common criterion for resolving two spectral lines (which correspond to transitions between energy levels) is that their energy separation must be at least the sum of their individual energy widths (ΔE1 + ΔE2). This ensures that the peaks are distinct and not completely merged into one.\n    *   So, the condition is: |E1 - E2| ≥ ΔE1 + ΔE2.\n    *   The plan is:\n        a. Calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for the first state (ΔE1) using its lifetime τ1.\n        b. Calculate the energy uncertainty for the second state (ΔE2) using its lifetime τ2.\n        c. Sum these uncertainties (ΔE1 + ΔE2) to find the minimum required energy separation for them to be resolvable.\n        d. Compare this minimum required separation with the given options (A, B, C, D) to find which one satisfies the condition.\n\n4.  **Gather Necessary Constants:**\n    *   Lifetime of state 1 (τ1): 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Lifetime of state 2 (τ2): 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Reduced Planck's constant (ħ): We need this in units of eV·s to get the energy in eV directly. A quick search or memory recall gives ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n5.  **Execute the Calculation (Step-by-Step):**\n\n    *   **Step a: Calculate ΔE1**\n        *   ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1\n        *   ΔE1 ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n        *   ΔE1 ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   **Step b: Calculate ΔE2**\n        *   ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2\n        *   ΔE2 ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s)\n        *   ΔE2 ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n    *   **Step c: Calculate the minimum required separation**\n        *   Minimum |E1 - E2| ≈ ΔE1 + ΔE2\n        *   Minimum |E1 - E2| ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV)\n        *   To add these, let's put them in the same power of 10: (6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 × 10⁻⁷ eV)\n        *   Minimum |E1 - E2| ≈ (6.582 + 0.6582) × 10⁻⁷ eV\n        *   Minimum |E1 - E2| ≈ 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   This means the energy difference between the levels must be greater than approximately 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV to be clearly resolved.\n\n6.  **Compare with Options (Step d):**\n    *   The calculated minimum separation is ~7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   Let's examine the options:\n        *   A) 10⁻⁸ eV. This is less than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV. (Not resolvable)\n        *   B) 10⁻¹¹ eV. This is much less than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV. (Not resolvable)\n        *   C) 10⁻⁹ eV. This is less than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV. (Not resolvable)\n        *   D) 10⁻⁴ eV. This is much greater than 7.24 × 10⁻⁷ eV. (Clearly resolvable)\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   Only option D provides an energy separation that is significantly larger than the combined energy uncertainty of the two states. Therefore, with an energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV, the two levels can be clearly distinguished.\n\nThis detailed reasoning confirms that D is the correct answer. I am confident in this conclusion and do not need to use external tools.\n\n<<<D>>>"
