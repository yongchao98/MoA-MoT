    "*   **Analysis of the First Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction starts with butan-2-one, a ketone.\n    *   The reagent is NaCN, which provides the cyanide ion (CN⁻), a strong nucleophile.\n    *   The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which is a cyanohydrin.\n    *   The mechanism of cyanohydrin formation involves the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion on the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the ketone. This forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.\n    *   To obtain the final stable hydroxyl (-OH) group in the cyanohydrin, this negatively charged alkoxide intermediate must be protonated.\n    *   A source of protons is needed for this step. H₃O⁺ (hydronium ion), which represents an acidic aqueous medium (e.g., from HCl or H₂SO₄), is a suitable proton source to complete the reaction.\n    *   Therefore, reagent A must be H₃O⁺.\n    *   Reaction:\n        1.  CH₃C(=O)CH₂CH₃ + CN⁻ → CH₃C(O⁻)(CN)CH₂CH₃\n        2.  CH₃C(O⁻)(CN)CH₂CH₃ + H₃O⁺ → CH₃C(OH)(CN)CH₂CH₃ + H₂O\n\n*   **Analysis of the Second Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction starts with 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, an α-hydroxy nitrile.\n    *   The product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid, an α-hydroxy carboxylic acid.\n    *   This transformation involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   This reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile.\n    *   Nitrile hydrolysis requires water (which is indicated as a reactant) and is typically catalyzed by a strong acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄) or a strong base (like NaOH), often with heating. The reaction proceeds through an amide intermediate.\n    *   Looking at the options for reagent B, HCl is a strong acid and a common catalyst for this transformation. CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is a weak acid and is generally not effective enough to drive the hydrolysis to completion.\n    *   Therefore, reagent B is most suitably HCl.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Reagent A is H₃O⁺.\n    *   Reagent B is HCl.\n    *   This combination matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
