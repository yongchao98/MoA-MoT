    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of peaks in the chromatograms.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This molecule is chiral, with a single stereocenter at carbon 5 having the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of a ketone with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH). LAH reduces the carbonyl group (C=O) at carbon 3 to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The ketone at C3 is prochiral. The attack of the hydride ion (from LAH) can occur from two different faces (the *re* face or the *si* face). This reaction creates a new stereocenter at carbon 3. Since the starting molecule already contains a stereocenter at C5, the two possible products will have configurations (3R, 5S) and (3S, 5S). These two molecules are diastereomers of each other.\n*   **Product of Reaction I:** A mixture of two diastereomers: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Idealized Scenario Assumption:** In stereoselective reactions presented in textbook problems, it is common to assume 100% selectivity to yield a single product. Substrate-controlled reductions like this one are diastereoselective. Let's assume the reaction is perfectly selective and produces only **one diastereomer**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of a diketone with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH4). Excess NaBH4 ensures that both ketone groups are reduced to hydroxyl groups, yielding pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. The possible products are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and a meso compound (2R, 4S), which is identical to (2S, 4R). So, a non-selective reduction would produce three stereoisomers: a racemic pair of enantiomers [(2R,4R) and (2S,4S)] and the meso compound.\n*   **Idealized Scenario Assumption:** The reduction of Î²-dicarbonyls can be selective. In the absence of chelating metal ions (as with NaBH4), the reaction often favors the formation of the *anti*-diol via a non-chelation controlled pathway (Felkin-Anh model). The *anti*-diol is the racemic pair {(2R,4R), (2S,4S)}. The *syn*-diol is the meso compound. Let's assume the reaction is perfectly selective for the *anti* product, thus forming **only the racemic pair** of (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. No meso compound is formed.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture**\n\n*   Based on the idealized assumptions in Steps 1 and 2, the final mixture contains:\n    1.  One diastereomer from Reaction I (e.g., (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol). Let's call this compound **A**.\n    2.  The racemic pair from Reaction II: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. Let's call these enantiomers **B+** and **B-**.\n*   The total number of unique chemical compounds in the mixture is **three**. Note that compound A is a diastereomer of compounds B+ and B-.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity.\n*   It is an achiral technique, meaning it **cannot** separate enantiomers.\n*   It **can** separate diastereomers.\n*   In our 3-component mixture {A, B+, B-}:\n    *   B+ and B- are enantiomers, so they will not be separated and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   A is a diastereomer of B+ and B-. It has different physical properties and will be separated from the {B+, B-} pair.\n*   Therefore, the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the number of peaks in chiral HPLC**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase and **can** separate enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers.\n*   In our 3-component mixture {A, B+, B-}:\n    *   The enantiomers B+ and B- will be separated into two distinct peaks.\n    *   Compound A, being a diastereomer of B+ and B-, will also be separated and will have its own unique retention time.\n*   Therefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **3 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 2 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<D>>>"
