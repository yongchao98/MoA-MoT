    "*   **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Analyze the IR Spectrum of the Starting Material (Compound X):**\n    *   The broad absorption between 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n    *   The strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The absorptions at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n    *   Conclusion from IR: Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Compound X:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This very deshielded, broad singlet corresponds to the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The doublet at 8.0 ppm is downfield, suggesting these protons are ortho to a strong electron-withdrawing group (the -COOH). The doublet at 7.2 ppm is upfield, suggesting these protons are ortho to an electron-donating group (an alkyl group).\n    *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:** Now, let's determine the structure of the alkyl group attached to the benzene ring from the remaining signals.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to a methylene group (-CH₂-). Based on the other signals, it must be between the terminal methyl group (from the 0.9 ppm triplet) and the methine group.\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton. This proton is attached to the benzene ring (making it a benzylic proton, hence the downfield shift) and is adjacent to both a methyl group and a methylene group.\n    *   **Assembling the Alkyl Group:** Let's put the pieces together.\n        *   We have `CH₃-CH₂-` (from the signals at 0.9 ppm and 1.7 ppm).\n        *   We have a `CH₃-CH-` unit (from the signals at 1.4 ppm and 2.9 ppm).\n        *   Connecting these parts, the methine (-CH-) must be attached to the benzene ring, the other methyl group, and the ethyl group. This gives the structure: `(benzene ring)-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)`. This is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n3.  **Identify Compound X:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, Compound X is a benzene ring substituted at positions 1 and 4 with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a sec-butyl group.\n    *   The structure is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. (This matches option C, but that is the reactant, not the product).\n\n4.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    *   Compound X reacts with **red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI)**.\n    *   This combination (HI/Red P) is a very powerful reducing agent.\n    *   It is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The reaction is: R-COOH + 6HI → R-CH₃ + 3H₂O + 3I₂. The red phosphorus is used to regenerate HI from the I₂ formed.\n    *   Other parts of the molecule, like the stable aromatic ring and the alkyl (sec-butyl) group, are unaffected by this reagent.\n\n5.  **Determine the Final Product:**\n    *   The reaction starts with 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n    *   The -COOH group is reduced to a -CH₃ group.\n    *   The final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n6.  **Match with the Given Options:**\n    *   A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches our deduced product.\n    *   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure.\n    *   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material (Compound X), not the final product.\n    *   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - The alkyl group is sec-butyl, not isobutyl.\n\nTherefore, the correct final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
