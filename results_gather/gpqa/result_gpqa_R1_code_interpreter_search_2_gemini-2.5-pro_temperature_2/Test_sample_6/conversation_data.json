    "This problem asks for the threshold energy of a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) that can annihilate with a low-energy Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon to produce an electron-positron pair ($e^{-}e^{+}$). The reaction is $\\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^{-} + e^{+}$.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Physics Principle:** The core principle is the conservation of four-momentum in a relativistic particle interaction. We are looking for the minimum energy (threshold energy) of the high-energy gamma-ray for this reaction to be possible.\n\n2.  **Set up the Four-Momentum Conservation:**\n    Let the four-momenta be:\n    *   $P_1 = (E_1, \\vec{p}_1)$ for the high-energy gamma-ray.\n    *   $P_2 = (E_2, \\vec{p}_2)$ for the CMB photon.\n    *   $P_{e^-}$ and $P_{e^+}$ for the electron and positron.\n\n    The conservation of four-momentum states:\n    $P_1 + P_2 = P_{e^-} + P_{e^+}$\n\n3.  **Use Invariant Mass:** A powerful technique in relativity is to use the square of the total four-momentum, which is a Lorentz invariant (the same in all inertial frames).\n    $(P_1 + P_2)^2 = (P_{e^-} + P_{e^+})^2$\n\n4.  **Analyze the Left-Hand Side (Initial State):**\n    $(P_1 + P_2)^2 = P_1^2 + P_2^2 + 2 P_1 \\cdot P_2$\n    *   For photons, the rest mass is zero, so their four-momentum squared is zero: $P_1^2 = m_{\\gamma}^2 c^4 = 0$ and $P_2^2 = m_{\\gamma}^2 c^4 = 0$.\n    *   The dot product is $P_1 \\cdot P_2 = E_1 E_2 - \\vec{p}_1 \\cdot \\vec{p}_2 = E_1 E_2 - |\\vec{p}_1||\\vec{p}_2|\\cos\\theta$.\n    *   Since photons have $E=|\\vec{p}|c$ (or $E=p$ in natural units), this becomes $E_1 E_2 (1 - \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the directions of the two photons.\n    *   So, the left side is $2E_1 E_2 (1 - \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Right-Hand Side (Final State) at Threshold:**\n    *   The threshold energy is the minimum energy required for the reaction. This occurs when the final products (electron and positron) are created with the minimum possible kinetic energy in the center-of-mass (CM) frame, meaning they are created at rest.\n    *   In the CM frame, the total energy is the sum of the rest energies of the electron and positron: $E_{CM, tot} = m_e c^2 + m_e c^2 = 2m_e c^2$.\n    *   The squared invariant mass of the final system is $(P_{e^-} + P_{e^+})^2 = (E_{CM, tot}/c^2)^2 = (2m_e)^2$. (in natural units $c=1$). In any frame, this invariant value is $(2m_e c^2)^2$.\n\n6.  **Equate and Solve for the Threshold Energy ($E_{1,th}$):**\n    $2E_{1,th} E_2 (1 - \\cos\\theta) = (2m_e c^2)^2 = 4(m_e c^2)^2$\n    $E_{1,th} = \\frac{2(m_e c^2)^2}{E_2 (1 - \\cos\\theta)}$\n\n7.  **Determine the Condition for the Absolute Minimum Threshold:**\n    To find the lowest possible threshold energy for $E_1$, we need to maximize the denominator, specifically the term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$. This term is maximum when $\\cos\\theta = -1$, which corresponds to a head-on collision ($\\theta = \\pi$ or 180 degrees).\n    *   For a head-on collision, $(1 - \\cos\\pi) = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n    *   Substituting this into the equation for $E_{1,th}$:\n      $E_{1,th} = \\frac{4(m_e c^2)^2}{2E_2(2)} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_2}$\n\n8.  **Plug in the Given Values:**\n    *   Average energy of a CMB photon, $E_2 = E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.\n    *   Rest energy of an electron, $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n\n9.  **Calculate the Result:**\n    To ensure accuracy, we can use a small Python script for the calculation.\n\n    ```python\n    # Physical constants in electron-volts (eV)\n    # Rest energy of an electron (m_e * c^2)\n    m_e_eV = 0.511 * 1e6\n    # Energy of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon\n    E_cmb_eV = 1e-3\n\n    # Calculate the threshold energy of the high-energy gamma-ray in eV\n    # Formula for head-on collision: E_th = (m_e*c^2)^2 / E_cmb\n    E_th_eV = (m_e_eV**2) / E_cmb_eV\n\n    # Convert the threshold energy from eV to Giga-electron-volts (GeV)\n    # 1 GeV = 1e9 eV\n    E_th_GeV = E_th_eV / 1e9\n\n    # Print the result in the format of the given options (X.X * 1e5 GeV)\n    # This involves dividing by 1e5 to get the coefficient\n    print(f\"{E_th_GeV / 1e5:.1f}*1e5 GeV\")\n    ```\n\n    **Execution Output:**\n    ```\n    2.6*1e5 GeV\n    ```\n\nThe calculation yields a threshold energy of approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$. Gamma-rays with energy at or above this threshold will have a high probability of interacting with CMB photons, significantly limiting their propagation distance (and thus, their lifetime) in the universe.\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
