    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Experimental Data to Identify Products and Quantities**\n\nThe problem describes the thermal decomposition of a mixture of two salts, A and B, and the subsequent analysis of the gaseous products. Let's break down the information from each step:\n\n*   **Heating:** An equimolar mixture of A and B (7.20 g) is heated and decomposes completely into a mixture of gases. This implies that no solid residue is left.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds directly to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. The fact that its weight did not change means that no acidic gases were produced in the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of the tube is equal to the mass of oxygen that reacted. The mass increase is 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O atom ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   The mass gain is entirely due to oxygen atoms. So, moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Since oxygen exists as O₂ gas, the number of moles of O₂ gas is half the moles of O atoms.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a gas C remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert to the reagents used (Mg(ClO₄)₂, Ca(OH)₂, hot Cu). The most common inert gas produced from the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts is nitrogen (N₂).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C (N₂) = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\nSo, the decomposition of the salt mixture produced:\n*   0.2 mol H₂O\n*   0.025 mol O₂\n*   0.1 mol N₂\n\n### **2. Deduce the Identity of Salts A and B**\n\nThe products (H₂O, N₂, O₂) are composed of Hydrogen (H), Nitrogen (N), and Oxygen (O) atoms. Since the decomposition produced only gases, the original salts A and B must also be composed of these elements and decompose without leaving a solid residue. This strongly suggests that A and B are ammonium salts.\n\nLet's consider the decomposition of common ammonium salts:\n1.  **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n2.  **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** This salt has multiple decomposition pathways. A plausible one that fits the products is: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g). We can write this on a per-mole basis: NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂(g) + 0.5O₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nLet's hypothesize that the mixture consists of Salt A = **NH₄NO₃** and Salt B = **NH₄NO₂**.\n\n### **3. Verify the Hypothesis with Stoichiometry**\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let `x` be the number of moles of salt A (NH₄NO₃) and also the number of moles of salt B (NH₄NO₂).\n\n*   **Moles of H₂O produced:**\n    *   From `x` mol of NH₄NO₃: `x` mol * 2 = 2x mol H₂O\n    *   From `x` mol of NH₄NO₂: `x` mol * 2 = 2x mol H₂O\n    *   Total moles of H₂O = 2x + 2x = 4x.\n    *   From our data, moles of H₂O = 0.2 mol. So, 4x = 0.2  ⇒  **x = 0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Moles of O₂ produced:**\n    *   From `x` mol of NH₄NO₃: `x` mol * 0.5 = 0.5x mol O₂\n    *   From `x` mol of NH₄NO₂: 0 mol O₂\n    *   Total moles of O₂ = 0.5x.\n    *   From our data, moles of O₂ = 0.025 mol. So, 0.5x = 0.025  ⇒  **x = 0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Moles of N₂ produced:**\n    *   From `x` mol of NH₄NO₃: `x` mol * 1 = x mol N₂\n    *   From `x` mol of NH₄NO₂: `x` mol * 1 = x mol N₂\n    *   Total moles of N₂ = x + x = 2x.\n    *   From our data, moles of N₂ = 0.1 mol. So, 2x = 0.1  ⇒  **x = 0.05 mol**.\n\nAll three calculations yield the same value for `x = 0.05` mol. This confirms our hypothesis is consistent. So, the mixture contained 0.05 moles of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 moles of NH₄NO₂.\n\n### **4. Verify the Initial Mass**\n\nLet's check if the total mass of our proposed mixture matches the given mass of 7.20 g.\n```python\n# Molar masses\nM_NH4NO3 = 14.01 * 2 + 1.01 * 4 + 16.00 * 3\nM_NH4NO2 = 14.01 * 2 + 1.01 * 4 + 16.00 * 2\n\n# Moles of each salt\nmoles = 0.05\n\n# Total mass calculation\ntotal_mass = moles * M_NH4NO3 + moles * M_NH4NO2\nprint(f\"Molar mass of NH4NO3: {M_NH4NO3}\")\nprint(f\"Molar mass of NH4NO2: {M_NH4NO2}\")\nprint(f\"Total mass: {total_mass}\")\n```\nMolar mass of NH4NO3: 80.06\nMolar mass of NH4NO2: 64.06\nTotal mass: 7.206\n\nThe calculated total mass is 7.206 g, which is in excellent agreement with the given mass of 7.20 g.\n\n### **5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final question is to find the total number of atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 3 Oxygen atoms.\n    *   Total atoms in NH₄NO₃ = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms.\n    *   Total atoms in NH₄NO₂ = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B)**\n    *   Total = 9 + 8 = 17 atoms.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",

The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O = 1.01 * 2 + 16.00 = 18.02 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) tests for acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were produced.\n\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form CuO (2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO). The mass increase of the tube is due to the oxygen atoms reacting. The mass increase is 0.80 g.\n        *   This mass increase is the mass of oxygen atoms. Molar mass of O = 16.00 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   Since oxygen gas is diatomic (O₂), the moles of O₂ gas are half the moles of O atoms.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n    *   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** 2.24 L of a gas remains at STP. This gas must be inert to all the previous reagents (H₂O absorber, base, hot Cu). The most likely candidate from a decomposition of common salts is nitrogen gas (N₂).\n        *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C (N₂) = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\n    *   **Summary of products:** The decomposition yielded 0.2 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.1 mol N₂.\n\n2.  **Deduce the Composition of the Salts:**\n    *   The products consist of only Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen atoms.\n    *   Since the salts decompose completely into gases, they cannot contain metal cations. This strongly suggests they are ammonium salts.\n    *   Let's hypothesize the salts are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂), as their decompositions produce the observed gases.\n        *   **NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O**\n        *   **2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O** which can be written per mole as **NH₄NO₃ → N₂ + 0.5O₂ + 2H₂O**\n\n3.  **Verify the Hypothesis using Stoichiometry:**\n    *   The problem states the mixture of salts A and B is **equimolar**. Let `x` be the number of moles of each salt.\n    *   Let A = NH₄NO₃ and B = NH₄NO₂.\n\n    *   **Check Moles of N₂:**\n        *   From `x` mol of NH₄NO₃: `x` mol N₂\n        *   From `x` mol of NH₄NO₂: `x` mol N₂\n        *   Total N₂ = x + x = 2x.\n        *   We found 0.1 mol of N₂, so 2x = 0.1 mol ⇒ **x = 0.05 mol**.\n\n    *   **Check Moles of O₂:**\n        *   From `x` mol of NH₄NO₃: 0.5x mol O₂\n        *   From `x` mol of NH₄NO₂: 0 mol O₂\n        *   Total O₂ = 0.5x.\n        *   We found 0.025 mol of O₂, so 0.5x = 0.025 mol ⇒ **x = 0.05 mol**.\n\n    *   **Check Moles of H₂O:**\n        *   From `x` mol of NH₄NO₃: 2x mol H₂O\n        *   From `x` mol of NH₄NO₂: 2x mol H₂O\n        *   Total H₂O = 2x + 2x = 4x.\n        *   We found 0.2 mol of H₂O, so 4x = 0.2 mol ⇒ **x = 0.05 mol**.\n\n    *   All calculations consistently give x = 0.05 mol. This confirms our hypothesis. The mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂.\n\n4.  **Verify the Initial Mass:**\n    *   Let's check if the mass of 0.05 mol of each salt equals the given total mass of 7.20 g.\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = (2 * 14.01) + (4 * 1.01) + (3 * 16.00) = 80.06 g/mol.\n    *   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = (2 * 14.01) + (4 * 1.01) + (2 * 16.00) = 64.06 g/mol.\n    *   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 80.06 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 64.06 g/mol)\n    *   Total mass = 4.003 g + 3.203 g = 7.206 g.\n    *   This is an excellent match with the given 7.20 g. The hypothesis is correct. Salts A and B are NH₄NO₃ and NH₄NO₂.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each.\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 N + 4 H + 3 O = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 N + 4 H + 2 O = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Total atoms** = (atoms in A) + (atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17 atoms**.\n\nThis result corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
