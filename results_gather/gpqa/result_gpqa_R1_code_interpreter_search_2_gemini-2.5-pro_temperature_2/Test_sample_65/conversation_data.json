    "**Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Question:** The user wants to know which fundamental symmetries *must* be respected by *all* operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). The key words here are \"must\" and \"all,\" implying we are looking for the foundational assumptions of the theory's construction, not accidental or approximate symmetries.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct SMEFT:** SMEFT is a framework that extends the Standard Model (SM). It does so by adding higher-dimensional operators to the SM Lagrangian (`L_SMEFT = L_SM + Σ_i (c_i / Λ^(d-4)) O_i`). These operators (`O_i`) are built from the SM fields and respect the SM's gauge symmetries (SU(3)_c x SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y). The framework is designed to parameterize the low-energy effects of unknown new physics from a high energy scale (Λ) without making specific assumptions about what that new physics is.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Symmetry Option:**\n\n    *   **1. Lorentz Symmetry:** This is the symmetry of special relativity, stating that the laws of physics are invariant under rotations and boosts. Quantum Field Theory (QFT), the mathematical framework for the SM and SMEFT, is fundamentally built on this principle. Fields are classified by their transformation properties under the Lorentz group (e.g., scalars, spinors, vectors). Lagrangians are constructed to be Lorentz scalars. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry is a bedrock assumption of SMEFT, and all operators must respect it.\n\n    *   **2. Poincaré Symmetry:** This is the full symmetry of spacetime in special relativity. It includes Lorentz symmetry (rotations and boosts) plus spacetime translations (invariance with respect to changes in position and time). Just like Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry is a foundational assumption of QFT. Invariance under translations leads to the conservation of energy and momentum. Any local QFT Lagrangian, including the one for SMEFT, is constructed to be Poincaré invariant. Therefore, all operators must respect Poincaré symmetry. Note: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry, so if a theory is Poincaré-invariant, it is automatically Lorentz-invariant.\n\n    *   **3. CP Symmetry:** This is the combination of Charge Conjugation (C) and Parity (P). The Standard Model itself is known to violate CP symmetry through a complex phase in the CKM matrix of the quark sector. This violation is essential for explaining the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe (though the SM's amount is insufficient). Since the SM already violates CP, an effective field theory built upon it cannot assume CP is a fundamental symmetry. In fact, one of the main goals of SMEFT is to provide a systematic way to parameterize *new* sources of CP violation that might arise from physics beyond the SM. Many dimension-6 operators in the SMEFT Lagrangian explicitly violate CP symmetry. Therefore, CP symmetry is *not* a required symmetry for all SMEFT operators.\n\n    *   **4. CPT Symmetry:** This is the combination of Charge Conjugation, Parity, and Time Reversal (T). The **CPT Theorem** is a fundamental result in QFT. It states that any QFT that is (a) Lorentz-invariant, (b) local, and (c) has a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be CPT-invariant. The standard construction of SMEFT adheres to all these principles. Consequently, all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry. A CPT-violating operator would imply a breakdown of Lorentz invariance or locality, which would be a far more radical departure from our current understanding of physics than simply adding new particles or interactions.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Results:**\n    *   Lorentz Symmetry (1): **Must** be respected.\n    *   Poincaré Symmetry (2): **Must** be respected.\n    *   CP Symmetry (3): **Must NOT** be respected; it is known to be violated.\n    *   CPT Symmetry (4): **Must** be respected, due to the CPT theorem.\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options:** We are looking for the set of symmetries that must be respected. This is {1, 2, 4}.\n    *   A) 1, 3, 4: Incorrect because it includes CP (3).\n    *   B) 1, 2: Incomplete, as it omits the fundamental CPT symmetry (4).\n    *   C) 1, 2, 4: Correct. It includes the foundational spacetime symmetries (Lorentz and Poincaré) and the symmetry guaranteed by the CPT theorem.\n    *   D) 3, 4: Incorrect because it includes CP (3) and omits the spacetime symmetries (1, 2).\n\n<<<C>>>"
