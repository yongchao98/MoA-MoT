    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Physics of Radioactive Decay**\n\nRadioactive decay is a stochastic process that follows an exponential distribution. The key characteristic of this process is that it is **memoryless**. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval does not depend on how long it has already existed without decaying. The past history of the atom is irrelevant to its future behavior.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Mathematical Model**\n\nThe probability, `P`, that an atom will decay within a certain time, `t`, is given by the formula:\n`P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\nwhere:\n*   `λ` (lambda) is the decay constant, a positive number that characterizes the decay rate of the atom.\n*   `e` is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.718).\n\nThe probability that an atom *survives* past time `t` is:\n`S(t) = 1 - P(t) = e^(-λt)`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Decay Constant (λ)**\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32). We can use this information to find the decay constant `λ`.\n\n`P(100) = 0.32`\n`0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)`\n\nNow, we solve for `λ`:\n`e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32`\n`e^(-100λ) = 0.68`\n\nTo isolate `λ`, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n`ln(e^(-100λ)) = ln(0.68)`\n`-100λ = ln(0.68)`\n`λ = -ln(0.68) / 100`\n\nWe can now compute the value of `λ`.\n```python\nimport math\n\nlambda_constant = -math.log(0.68) / 100\nprint(f\"The decay constant λ is: {lambda_constant}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\nThe decay constant λ is: 0.003856624855393223\n</execute_result>\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Required Probability**\n\nWe need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\n\nBecause the process is memoryless, the fact that the atom has survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant. The question simplifies to: \"What is the probability that a new atom of this type will decay within a 150-minute period?\"\n\nSo, we need to calculate `P(150)` using the `λ` we found in the previous step.\n`P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n\nSubstitute the expression for `λ`:\n`P(150) = 1 - e^((-ln(0.68) / 100) * 150)`\n`P(150) = 1 - e^(1.5 * ln(0.68))`\nUsing the logarithm property `a * ln(b) = ln(b^a)`:\n`P(150) = 1 - e^(ln(0.68^1.5))`\nSince `e^ln(x) = x`:\n`P(150) = 1 - 0.68^1.5`\n\nNow, we compute this value.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We can calculate the final probability directly from the value of lambda found before.\nlambda_constant = 0.003856624855393223\ntime_interval = 150\nprobability_of_decay = 1 - math.exp(-lambda_constant * time_interval)\n\n# Or we can use the more direct mathematical expression\n# probability_of_decay = 1 - (0.68**1.5)\n\nprint(f\"The probability of decay in 150 minutes is: {probability_of_decay}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\nThe probability of decay in 150 minutes is: 0.43936852391062066\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculated probability is approximately 0.4394.\n\n**Step 5: Select the Closest Answer**\n\nThe calculated probability is 43.94%.

    "This problem is about the conditional probability of radioactive decay, which is modeled by an exponential distribution. The crucial property of this model is its **memorylessness**.\n\n**1. The Memoryless Property**\n\nRadioactive decay is a random process. The probability that an unstable nucleus will decay in a given time interval is constant and independent of its past history. This means the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes has no effect on its probability of decaying in the future. The atom doesn't \"age\" or get \"closer\" to decaying. Therefore, the problem simplifies to finding the probability that a new atom will decay within a 150-minute interval.\n\n**2.

    "This problem requires understanding the \"memoryless\" property of exponential decay, which governs radioactive processes. Here is the detailed reasoning:\n\n**1. The \"Memoryless\" Property of Radioactive Decay**\n\nRadioactive decay is a random process. The probability that an atom will decay in a future time interval is completely independent of how long it has already existed. The atom does not \"age\". Therefore, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes has no impact on its future decay probability.\n\nThis means the question, \"What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes, given it has survived for 50 minutes?\", simplifies to the much more direct question, \"What is the probability a new atom of this type will decay in 150 minutes?\".\n\n**2. Finding the Decay Constant (λ)**\n\nThe probability that an atom decays within a time `t`, denoted `P(t)`, is given by the formula:\n`P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\nwhere `λ` is the decay constant specific to the atom.\n\nWe are given that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n`P(100) = 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for `λ`:\n`e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32`\n`e^(-100λ) = 0.68`\n\nTo isolate `λ`, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n`-100λ = ln(0.68)`\n`λ = -ln(0.68) / 100`\n\n**3. Calculating the Probability for the Next 150 Minutes**\n\nUsing the memoryless property, we now calculate the probability of decay over a 150-minute interval using the `λ` we just found.\n`P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n\nSubstitute the expression for `λ`:\n`P(150) = 1 - exp( (-ln(0.68) / 100) * 150 )`\n`P(150) = 1 - exp( 1.5 * ln(0.68) )`\n\nUsing the logarithm power rule, `a * ln(b) = ln(b^a)`:\n`P(150) = 1 - exp( ln(0.68^1.5) )`\n\nSince the exponential function `exp()` and the natural logarithm `ln()` are inverse functions (`exp(ln(x)) = x`), this simplifies to:\n`P(150) = 1 - (0.68 ^ 1.5)`\n\n**4.
