    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the relationship between the number of stars per unit distance (`dN/dr`) and the distance (`r`).\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:** We are given the relationship between the number of stars per unit parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) and the parallax (`plx`):\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵`\n\n3.  **Recall the Fundamental Relationship:** The key is to relate parallax (`plx`) and distance (`r`). In astronomy, parallax is defined as the inverse of the distance.\n    `plx = 1/r`\n\n4.  **Formulate a Plan (Change of Variables):** We need to transform the given expression from being in terms of parallax to being in terms of distance. We can use the chain rule from calculus to relate the derivatives:\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n5.  **Execute the Plan:**\n    *   **Step 1: Find the derivative `d(plx)/dr`**.\n        Since `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`, we can differentiate it with respect to `r`:\n        `d(plx)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n\n    *   **Step 2: Express `dN/d(plx)` in terms of `r`**.\n        We are given `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵`.\n        Substitute `plx = 1/r`:\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1 / (1/r)⁵ = r⁵`\n\n    *   **Step 3: Combine the parts using the chain rule.**\n        `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n        Substitute the proportionalities we found:\n        `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (-1/r²)`\n        `dN/dr ∝ -r^(5-2)`\n        `dN/dr ∝ -r³`\n\n6.  **Interpret the Result:**\n    The question asks *how* the number of stars changes with distance. This refers to the proportionality, not the sign. The negative sign simply arises because parallax and distance are inversely related (as one increases, the other decreases). The physical quantity, which is the number of stars within a given distance shell `dr`, must be positive. We are interested in the magnitude of this relationship.\n\n    Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r³`.\n\n    `dN/dr ~ r³`\n\n7.  **Final Check:** The answer `r³` corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
