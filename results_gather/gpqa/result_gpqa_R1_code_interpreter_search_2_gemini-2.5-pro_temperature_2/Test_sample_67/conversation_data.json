    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Initial State:**\n    The problem states that a spin-1/2 particle has its magnetic moment `μ` aligned with a magnetic field in the `+Z` direction. The magnetic moment operator `μ` is proportional to the spin operator `S`, specifically `μ_vec = γ * S_vec`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. The z-component of the moment is `μz = γ * Sz`.\n    The Hamiltonian for the initial setup is `H_initial = -μ_vec · B_vec = -γ * Sz * B`.\n    For the magnetic moment to be \"aligned\" with the field, the spin must be in the lowest energy eigenstate. The eigenvalues of `Sz` are `+ħ/2` (spin up, `|+z>`) and `-ħ/2` (spin down, `|-z>`). The corresponding energies are `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_down = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n    Assuming `γ` and `B` are positive, `E_up` is the lower energy state. Therefore, the initial state of the particle at time `t=0` is the spin-up state along the z-axis:\n    `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`\n    In the standard basis where `|+z> = [1, 0]^T` and `|-z> = [0, 1]^T`, the initial state vector is `[1, 0]^T`.\n\n2.  **Define the New Hamiltonian:**\n    At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the `+Y` direction, so `B_vec = B * y_hat`. The new Hamiltonian `H` that governs the time evolution for `t > 0` is:\n    `H = -μ_vec · B_vec = -γ * (S_vec · B * y_hat) = -γ * B * Sy`\n    We need the matrix representation of the `Sy` operator in the `Sz` basis:\n    `Sy = (ħ/2) * σ_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n    So, the Hamiltonian is:\n    `H = -γ * B * (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n\n3.  **Time Evolution of the State (Method 1: Schrödinger Picture):**\n    The state of the system at time `t` evolves according to the Schrödinger equation: `|ψ(t)> = U(t) |ψ(0)>`, where `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ)` is the time evolution operator.\n    `U(t) = exp(-i * [-γB(ħ/2) * σ_y] * t / ħ) = exp(i * (γBt/2) * σ_y)`\n    Using the identity `exp(i * θ * σ_k) = cos(θ) * I + i * sin(θ) * σ_k` where `σ_k` is a Pauli matrix and `I` is the identity matrix.\n    Here, `θ = γBt/2` and `σ_k = σ_y`. Let `ω = γB`. So `θ = ωt/2`.\n    `U(t) = cos(ωt/2) * I + i * sin(ωt/2) * σ_y`\n    `U(t) = cos(ωt/2) * [[1, 0], [0, 1]] + i * sin(ωt/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n    `U(t) = [[cos(ωt/2), 0], [0, cos(ωt/2)]] + [[0, sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), 0]]`\n    `U(t) = [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]]`\n    Now, we find the state `|ψ(t)>`:\n    `|ψ(t)> = U(t) |ψ(0)> = [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]] * [1, 0]^T`\n    `|ψ(t)> = [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)]^T = cos(ωt/2) |+z> - sin(ωt/2) |-z>`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value:**\n    We need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μz>(t) = <ψ(t)| μz |ψ(t)> = γ * <ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)>`.\n    First, let's find `<Sz>(t)`. The `Sz` operator is `Sz = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n    `<Sz>(t) = <ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)> = [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)] * (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)]^T`\n    `<Sz>(t) = (ħ/2) * [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)] * [cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)]^T`\n    `<Sz>(t) = (ħ/2) * (cos^2(ωt/2) - sin^2(ωt/2))`\n    Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos^2(θ) - sin^2(θ)`, we get:\n    `<Sz>(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`\n    Therefore, the average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n    `<μz>(t) = γ * <Sz>(t) = γ * (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`\n\n5.  **Determine the Oscillation Frequency:**\n    The expression for `<μz>(t)` is a cosine function of time, `cos(ωt)`. The angular frequency of this oscillation is `ω`.\n    From our definition, `ω = γB`.\n    The options are given in terms of `γB`, which represents an angular frequency. Therefore, the oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n**Method 2: Energy Eigenstates**\nA quicker way to see this is to note that the system oscillates between the superposed energy eigenstates.\n1.  The new Hamiltonian is `H = -γB * Sy`. Its eigenstates are the eigenstates of `Sy`, which are `|+y>` and `|-y>`. Their energies are `E_+ = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_- = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n2.  The initial state `|+z>` can be written as a superposition of these new energy eigenstates:\n    `|+z> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`\n3.  The two components, `|+y>` and `|-y>`, evolve in time with different phase factors `exp(-iE_± t/ħ)`.\n4.  The interference between these two components causes observables (like `Sz`) to oscillate. The frequency of this oscillation (quantum beats) is determined by the difference in energy:\n    `ω = ΔE / ħ = |E_+ - E_-| / ħ`\n    `ω = |(-γBħ/2) - (γBħ/2)| / ħ = |-γBħ| / ħ = γB`\nThis confirms the result. The oscillation frequency is `γB`. This is often called the Larmor frequency.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nB) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nC) gamma*B/2\nD) gamma*B\n\nThe calculated frequency matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
