    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the core problem.** The task is to design a *molecular diagnostic kit* for *quick detection* of a *retrovirus*. This requires understanding the nature of retroviruses and the principles of molecular diagnostics.\n\n*   **Step 2: Define \"retrovirus\".** A retrovirus is a type of virus that has RNA as its genetic material. A key feature is the enzyme reverse transcriptase, which transcribes the viral RNA into DNA (specifically, complementary DNA or cDNA) after entering a host cell. This cDNA is then integrated into the host's genome. Examples include HIV.\n\n*   **Step 3: Define \"molecular diagnostic kit\".** This implies detecting the genetic material (RNA or DNA) of the pathogen itself, rather than the host's immune response (like antibodies). Common molecular techniques include PCR, RT-PCR, sequencing, etc.\n\n*   **Step 4: Define \"quick detection\".** This favors methods that provide rapid results, which is crucial during an outbreak. Techniques like real-time PCR are faster than traditional PCR followed by gel electrophoresis or sequencing.\n\n*   **Step 5: Evaluate the given options based on the analysis.**\n\n    *   **A) Identify virus by symptoms, then design a nested PCR kit.** Identifying a virus based solely on symptoms is unreliable for designing a specific molecular test, as different viruses can cause similar symptoms. Nested PCR is sensitive but also has a higher risk of contamination and is more time-consuming than real-time PCR. This is not the optimal approach.\n\n    *   **B) Identify virus by cDNA sequencing, then develop a real-time PCR kit.** This is a very strong option.\n        *   **Identification:** Since it's a retrovirus (RNA genome), you must first convert its RNA to cDNA using reverse transcriptase. Then, you sequence this cDNA to get the precise genetic code. This is the correct first step to identify the virus's unique genetic sequences.\n        *   **Kit Development:** Based on the unique sequences identified, you can design highly specific primers and probes for a real-time PCR (often called RT-qPCR for this application, as it includes the Reverse Transcription step). Real-time PCR is rapid, highly sensitive, specific, and quantitative, making it the gold standard for \"quick and accurate diagnosis\" in modern molecular virology.\n\n    *   **C) Identify virus by DNA sequencing, then develop a PCR kit.** This is incorrect. A retrovirus has an RNA genome. You cannot directly perform DNA sequencing on its native genetic material. You must perform reverse transcription first (as described in B). This option misses a critical step.\n\n    *   **D) Identify IgG antibodies, then develop an ELISA kit.** This describes a serological test, not a molecular test. It detects the host's immune response (antibodies), not the virus itself. Furthermore, IgG antibodies typically rise later in an infection, making them unsuitable for *quick* diagnosis of an acute case. An IgM ELISA would be better for acute infection, but it's still not a *molecular* diagnostic kit. Therefore, this option fails on multiple counts.\n\n*   **Step 6: Conclude the best option.** Option B provides the most scientifically accurate and technologically advanced pathway. It correctly identifies the need for cDNA sequencing for a retrovirus and proposes using a real-time PCR kit, which is the standard for rapid, sensitive, and specific molecular detection of viral pathogens.\n\n<<<B>>>"
