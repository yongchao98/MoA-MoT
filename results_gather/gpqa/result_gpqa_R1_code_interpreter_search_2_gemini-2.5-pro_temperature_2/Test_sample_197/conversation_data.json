    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species:**\n    The solution contains free cobalt ions (Co²⁺) and thiocyanate ions (SCN⁻). They react to form a series of complexes:\n    *   `[Co(SCN)]⁺` (mono-thiocyanato)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₂]` (di-thiocyanato)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻` (tri-thiocyanato)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻` (tetra-thiocyanato)\n\n2.  **Define the total concentration of cobalt:**\n    The total concentration of all cobalt-containing species, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of the free ion and all its complexes:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n3.  **Use the overall stability constants (β):**\n    The concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]`, the free thiocyanate ion concentration `[SCN⁻]`, and the overall stability constants (βn):\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n4.  **Express the total cobalt concentration in terms of `[Co²⁺]` and `[SCN⁻]`:**\n    Substitute the expressions from step 3 into the equation from step 2:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n    Factor out `[Co²⁺]`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the fraction of the target complex:**\n    We want to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`. The fraction (α₂) of this complex is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration:\n    `α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n    Substitute the expressions for `[[Co(SCN)₂]]` and `c(Co)`:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n    The `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, leaving an expression that depends only on the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]` and the stability constants:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n6.  **Approximate the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`:**\n    The total cobalt concentration (`c(Co) = 10⁻² M = 0.01 M`) is significantly lower than the total thiocyanate concentration (`[SCN⁻]total = 0.1 M`). This indicates that the amount of `SCN⁻` that binds to cobalt is small compared to the total amount available. Therefore, we can approximate the concentration of free thiocyanate ions `[SCN⁻]` as being equal to its initial total concentration.\n    `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`\n\n7.  **Calculate the numerical value:**\n    Now, we plug the given values into the equation for `α₂`.\n    *   `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`\n    *   `β₁ = 9`\n    *   `β₂ = 40`\n    *   `β₃ = 63`\n    *   `β₄ = 16`\n\n    To simplify the calculation, let's calculate each term in the denominator (let's call it D):\n    `D = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴)`\n    `D = 1 + 0.9 + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001)`\n    `D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016`\n    `D = 2.3646`\n\n    Now calculate the numerator (N), which is the term for the target complex:\n    `N = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * 0.1² = 0.4`\n\n    The fraction `α₂` is `N / D`:\n    `α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n8.  **Convert the fraction to a percentage:**\n    Percentage of `[Co(SCN)₂]` = `α₂ * 100%`\n    Percentage = `0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\nFor verification, we can use a python script to perform the calculation precisely.\n```python\n# Given values\nb1 = 9\nb2 = 40\nb3 = 63\nb4 = 16\nscn_conc = 0.1\n\n# The denominator of the fraction formula\n# It represents the sum of the relative concentrations of all cobalt species\n# The terms are for Co(2+), [Co(SCN)]+, [Co(SCN)2], [Co(SCN)3]-, and [Co(SCN)4]2-\ndenominator = 1 + b1*scn_conc**1 + b2*scn_conc**2 + b3*scn_conc**3 + b4*scn_conc**4\n\n# The numerator is the term corresponding to the dithiocyanato complex [Co(SCN)2]\nnumerator = b2*scn_conc**2\n\n# The fraction of the [Co(SCN)2] complex\nfraction_CoSCN2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage_CoSCN2 = fraction_CoSCN2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage_CoSCN2)\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, in a solution with a total cobalt concentration `c(Co)` of `10⁻² M` and a thiocyanate concentration `[SCN⁻]` of `0.1 M`. The overall stability constants (β) are given for the formation of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes.\n\n**1. Understand the System**\n\nIn the solution, an equilibrium exists between the free Co(II) ion and its complexes with thiocyanate (SCN⁻):\n*   Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺       (β₁)\n*   Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]      (β₂)\n*   Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻     (β₃)\n*   Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻    (β₄)\n\n**2. Formulate the Distribution Coefficient (α)**\n\nThe fraction (αn) of any given complex `[Co(SCN)n]` is its concentration divided by the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species, `c(Co)`.\n\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\nUsing the definitions of the overall stability constants:\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴`\n\nSubstituting these into the `c(Co)` equation gives:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nThe fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, which is α₂, is:\n`α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` terms cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**3. Approximate the Free Ligand Concentration**\n\nThe total cobalt concentration `c(Co) = 0.01 M` is much smaller than the total thiocyanate concentration `[SCN⁻]total = 0.1 M`. This means that even if all the cobalt formed the `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻` complex (the one using the most ligand), it would only consume `4 * 0.01 = 0.04 M` of SCN⁻. Since this is less than half the total SCN⁻ available, we can approximate the free SCN⁻ concentration as being equal to its initial total concentration: `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`. This is a common and valid simplification in such problems.\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into the equation for `α₂`:\n*   `[SCN⁻] = 0.1`\n*   `β₁ = 9`\n*   `β₂ = 40` (This is for the complex we are interested in)\n*   `β₃ = 63`\n*   `β₄ = 16`\n\nLet's calculate the denominator `D`:\n`D = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴)`\n`D = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001)`\n`D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016`\n`D = 2.3646`\n\nNow, calculate the numerator `N`, which is the term for `[Co(SCN)₂]`:\n`N = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\nThe fraction `α₂` is:\n`α₂ = N / D = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo get the percentage, multiply the fraction by 100:\nPercentage = `0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThis value matches option B. The calculation from the executed code confirms this result (`16.916...%`).\n\n<<<B>>>"
