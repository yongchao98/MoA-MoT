    "The user is asking to identify a biological process based on an experimental scenario. Let's break down the clues:\n\n1.  **Antigen Administration:** Rotavirus capsid proteins are delivered orally. This mimics a natural infection route for an intestinal pathogen.\n2.  **Location:** The action is observed in Peyer's patches. Peyer's patches are a type of gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), which function as secondary lymphoid organs, monitoring the intestinal contents for pathogens.\n3.  **Cell Population:** The focus is on a \"proliferating cell population\". This indicates an active immune response, where specific lymphocytes that recognize the antigen are selected and clonally expanded. In the context of Peyer's patches, this points towards B cells proliferating in germinal centers.\n4.  **Genetic Analysis:** Sequencing of the \"variable heavy chain gene\" from these proliferating cells shows \"high variability\". The variable region of an antibody's heavy chain is responsible for binding to the antigen.\n\nNow let's evaluate the options:\n\n*   **A) Somatic hypermutation:** This process occurs in activated B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). It intentionally introduces point mutations into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). The goal is to generate B cells that produce antibodies with higher affinity for the antigen. This process directly leads to \"high variability\" in the \"variable heavy chain gene\" of a \"proliferating cell population\" in a secondary lymphoid organ following antigen exposure. This fits the description perfectly.\n*   **B) Class switching recombination:** This process also occurs in activated B cells in germinal centers. However, it changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain, not the variable region. This switches the antibody class (e.g., from IgM to IgA, which is very common in the gut), but does not increase the variability of the antigen-binding site (the variable region).\n*   **C) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system. It involves a cascade of plasma proteins that helps clear pathogens. It does not involve genetic changes in lymphocytes.\n*   **D) V(D)J recombination:** This is the initial gene rearrangement process that creates the primary diversity of B and T cell receptors. Critically, this happens in *primary* lymphoid organs (bone marrow for B cells) during the development of naive lymphocytes, *before* they encounter any antigen. The process described in the question is happening in a *secondary* lymphoid organ in response to an antigen.\n\nThe key observation is the new, high variability generated in the variable heavy chain gene within a proliferating population in a Peyer's patch. This is the definition of somatic hypermutation, which fine-tunes the antibody response to an antigen.\n\n<<<A>>>"
