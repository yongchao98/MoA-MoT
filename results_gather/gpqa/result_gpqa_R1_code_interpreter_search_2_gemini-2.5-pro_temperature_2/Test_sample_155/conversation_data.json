    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of peaks observed in each HPLC chromatogram.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene, which is achiral.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs an epoxidation. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond. A *syn*-addition to a *trans*-alkene results in a racemic mixture of *trans*-epoxides. In this case, it produces a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reagent causes acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. This is an S_N2-type reaction where water acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite the C-O bond. This results in *anti*-addition of the two hydroxyl (-OH) groups.\n\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step process (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) is equivalent to a net *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 1:** We are performing an *anti*-addition on a *trans*-alkene. A well-established rule in stereochemistry states:\n    *   **Trans-alkene + Anti-addition → Meso compound**\n\n    Therefore, Reaction 1 produces a single, achiral, meso product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (which can be named (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol; note that (4S,5R) represents the same meso molecule).\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene, which is also achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** The same reagents are used, resulting in a net *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 2:** We are performing an *anti*-addition on a *cis*-alkene. The stereochemical rule for this case is:\n    *   **Cis-alkene + Anti-addition → Racemic mixture of enantiomers**\n\n    Therefore, Reaction 2 produces a pair of enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**. This is a racemic mixture.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's examine the stereochemical relationships:\n*   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are **enantiomers** of each other.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n**1. Standard (Achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n*   An achiral HPLC column cannot distinguish between enantiomers. Enantiomers have identical physical properties (like polarity) in an achiral environment and will have the same retention time. Therefore, the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers will elute together as a single peak.\n*   An achiral column *can* distinguish between diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and will have different retention times. The meso-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will elute at a different time.\n*   **Conclusion for standard HPLC:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**. One peak for the meso-diol, and one peak for the co-eluting racemic mixture.\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC:**\n*   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment. This allows it to distinguish between enantiomers. The (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and will be separated, eluting as two distinct peaks.\n*   The meso-diol is a diastereomer of the other two compounds and will also have a unique interaction with the stationary phase, eluting as its own separate peak.\n*   **Conclusion for chiral HPLC:** The chromatogram will resolve all three stereoisomers, showing **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<A>>>"
