    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Spectroscopic Data:**\n    *   **¹H NMR:** The key observation is \"two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton\" with \"roughly equal integrals.\" In NMR spectroscopy, each unique proton (or set of equivalent protons) gives rise to a single signal (which might be split by spin-spin coupling, but that's been ruled out). Seeing two distinct signals for what should be a single proton indicates that this proton exists in two different chemical environments. The equal integrals mean these two environments are populated in a roughly 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **LC-MS:**\n        *   **LC (Liquid Chromatography):** The sample separates into two distinct peaks. Chromatography separates compounds based on their physical properties (like polarity, size, etc.). Two peaks mean there are two different chemical species in the sample that can be separated under these conditions.\n        *   **MS (Mass Spectrometry):** Both peaks give the *same mass spectrum*, which matches the expected molecule. This tells us that the two chemical species are isomers—they have the same chemical formula and thus the same molecular weight. It also rules out the presence of impurities with different masses, like precursors or byproducts from side reactions.\n        *   **Elevated Temperature:** The fact that the peaks are still resolved at elevated temperature indicates a significant energy barrier to interconversion between the two species.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Options Based on the Data:**\n\n    *   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would almost certainly have a different molecular weight. The MS data shows both peaks have the *same mass* as the final product. This option is inconsistent with the MS results.\n\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   **Definition:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. A common example in peptide chemistry is the formation of an L-D peptide alongside the desired L-L peptide due to racemization during synthesis. Another example is *cis-trans* isomerism around an amide bond (these isomers are also diastereomers called rotamers or atropisomers).\n        *   **NMR Compatibility:** Diastereomers have different 3D shapes and therefore protons within them exist in different chemical environments. This would lead to separate signals in the NMR spectrum, which matches the observation of two peaks for the alpha-proton.\n        *   **LC-MS Compatibility:** Because they have different physical properties (shape, polarity, etc.), diastereomers can be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography. Since they are isomers, they have the same molecular weight and would give the same mass spectrum. This perfectly matches all the LC-MS observations.\n\n    *   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This describes a potential synthetic error. If this error leads to racemization of an amino acid, the product is a mixture of diastereomers (as in option B). So, B is the *description of the mixture*, while C is a possible *cause* of that mixture. However, \"double coupling\" could also mean other side reactions (e.g., diacylation) that would produce a compound with a different mass, which is inconsistent with the MS data. Because B is a direct and accurate description of a state that explains all the data, it is a better answer than C, which is a specific and potentially inaccurate explanation of the cause.\n\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   **Definition:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images.\n        *   **NMR Compatibility:** In a standard, achiral NMR environment, enantiomers are indistinguishable. They have identical chemical and physical properties and produce identical NMR spectra. You would only see one peak, not two.\n        *   **LC-MS Compatibility:** On a standard (achiral) LC column, enantiomers co-elute and cannot be separated. You would see a single LC peak.\n        *   This option is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The only explanation that fits all the pieces of evidence (two NMR signals, two separable LC peaks, and identical mass for both) is that the compound exists as a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n<<<B>>>"
