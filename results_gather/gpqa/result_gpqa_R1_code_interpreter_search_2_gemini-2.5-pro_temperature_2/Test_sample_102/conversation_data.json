    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent is benzene.\n*   It has three substituents:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   The substituents are arranged in a 1,3,5 pattern, meaning they are all *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), existing substituents on the benzene ring direct incoming groups to specific positions.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Weakly deactivating and an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\nThe final 1,3,5 substitution pattern suggests that the synthetic route must carefully control the regiochemistry at each step.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence**\n\nLet's analyze each option step-by-step.\n\n**Option A:**\n*   **i) Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** This reaction forms acetophenone. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director. This is a good first step.\n    *   Product: Acetophenone.\n*   **ii) Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ (Bromination):** The acetyl group on acetophenone directs the incoming electrophile (Br⁺) to the *meta* position.\n    *   Product: 3-bromoacetophenone.\n*   **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ (Nitration):** Now the ring has two substituents: -COCH₃ (at C1, *meta*-directing) and -Br (at C3, *ortho, para*-directing).\n    *   The -COCH₃ group strongly directs the incoming nitro group to the *meta* position (C5).\n    *   The -Br group directs to its *ortho* (C2, C4) and *para* (C6) positions.\n    *   When directing effects conflict, the position that is least deactivated is typically favored. The strong deactivating effect of the acetyl group disfavors substitution at its ortho/para positions (C2, C4, C6). Therefore, the nitronium ion (NO₂⁺) is primarily directed to C5, which is *meta* to the acetyl group. This leads to the desired product.\n    *   Product: 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Steps iv) to vii):** These steps involve reduction of the nitro group, another nitration, diazotization, and deamination. These reactions are performed *after* the target molecule has already been formed in step (iii). Furthermore, step (v) (nitration of an aniline derivative) is chemically problematic and would not proceed cleanly. These final steps appear to be superfluous or incorrect.\n\nDespite the flawed final steps, the initial three steps (i, ii, iii) constitute a viable and common synthesis for the target molecule.\n\n**Option B:**\n*   **i) Benzene + HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Forms nitrobenzene.\n*   **ii) Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl:** Reduces nitrobenzene to aniline.\n*   **iii) Aniline + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** This reaction fails. The amino group (-NH₂) of aniline is a Lewis base and reacts irreversibly with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃). This forms a complex that strongly deactivates the ring, preventing the Friedel-Crafts reaction. This option is chemically incorrect at this step.\n\n**Option C:**\n*   **i) Benzene + Br₂/FeBr₃:** Forms bromobenzene.\n*   **ii) Bromobenzene + HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of bromobenzene. Since -Br is an *ortho, para*-director, this step yields a mixture of o-bromonitrobenzene and p-bromonitrobenzene (the major product). This does not create the desired *meta* relationship between the bromo and nitro groups.\n*   **iii) ... + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** The product from step (ii) (e.g., p-bromonitrobenzene) has two deactivating groups on the ring. Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on strongly deactivated rings. This step would fail. This option is chemically incorrect.\n\n**Option D:**\n*   **i) to iv):** Benzene is converted to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, then to a diazonium salt, and finally back to benzene via deamination (reaction with H₃PO₂). These first four steps are circular and result in no net change.\n*   **v) to vii):** Starting again from benzene, the sequence is bromination -> acylation -> nitration. This would produce 1-(4-bromo...) or 1-(2-bromo...) isomers, not the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. This option is incorrect.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nComparing the options:\n*   Options B and C contain chemically infeasible Friedel-Crafts reaction steps.\n*   Option D involves a pointless circular synthesis followed by a sequence that leads to the wrong isomer.\n*   Option A contains a correct and logical three-step synthesis (i, ii, iii) to produce the target molecule. Although the subsequent steps (iv-vii) are chemically nonsensical in this context, the core synthetic route presented in the first part of option A is the only viable one among the choices. In multiple-choice questions of this nature, one must select the best possible option, even if it has flaws. The sequence in A(i-iii) represents the most direct and high-yield pathway to the desired product among the given choices.\n\nTherefore, sequence A is the correct answer as it outlines the proper order of reactions to achieve the desired substitution pattern.\n\n<<<A>>>"
