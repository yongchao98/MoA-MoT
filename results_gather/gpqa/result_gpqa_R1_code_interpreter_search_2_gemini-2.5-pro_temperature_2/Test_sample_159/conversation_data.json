    "An N-sided polygon with a constant apothem 'a' approaches a circle as the number of sides N becomes infinitely large. The apothem 'a' of the polygon becomes the radius of the circle.\n\nTherefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture of radius 'a'. This diffraction pattern is known as the Airy pattern.\n\nThe intensity distribution for the Fraunhofer diffraction from a circular aperture is given by:\nI(θ) = I₀ * [ (2 * J₁(k * a * sinθ)) / (k * a * sinθ) ]²\n\nWhere:\n*   I₀ is the maximum intensity at the center.\n*   J₁(x) is the Bessel function of the first kind, of order one.\n*   k is the wave number, k = 2π / λ.\n*   'a' is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   θ is the angular position from the central axis.\n\nThe minima of the diffraction pattern occur at the angles θ where the numerator is zero, which means we need to find the zeros of the Bessel function J₁(x). Let the zeros be denoted by j₁,ₘ where m = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nSo, the condition for the m-th minimum is:\nk * a * sin(θₘ) = j₁,ₘ\n\nSubstituting k = 2π / λ:\n(2π / λ) * a * sin(θₘ) = j₁,ₘ\n\nThe problem states that we can use the small-angle approximation, so sin(θₘ) ≈ θₘ.\n(2π / λ) * a * θₘ = j₁,ₘ\n\nSolving for the angular position θₘ:\nθₘ = (j₁,ₘ * λ) / (2π * a)\n\nTo find the angular distance between the first two minima, we need the first two zeros of the J₁(x) function (excluding x=0, which corresponds to the central maximum).\nFrom standard tables or a computational tool, the first two zeros are approximately:\n*   First zero, j₁,₁ ≈ 3.8317\n*   Second zero, j₁,₂ ≈ 7.0156\n\nThe angular position of the first minimum (m=1) is:\nθ₁ = (j₁,₁ * λ) / (2π * a) = (3.8317 * λ) / (2π * a)\n\nThe angular position of the second minimum (m=2) is:\nθ₂ = (j₁,₂ * λ) / (2π * a) = (7.0156 * λ) / (2π * a)\n\nThe angular distance (Δθ) between these two minima is:\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁\nΔθ = [ (j₁,₂ * λ) / (2π * a) ] - [ (j₁,₁ * λ) / (2π * a) ]\nΔθ = (j₁,₂ - j₁,₁) * λ / (2π * a)\nΔθ = (7.0156 - 3.8317) * λ / (2π * a)\nΔθ = 3.1839 * λ / (2π * a)\n\nTo find the numerical coefficient, we calculate 3.1839 / (2π).\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The first zero of the Bessel function J1(x)\nj1_1 = 3.83170597\n# The second zero of the Bessel function J1(x)\nj1_2 = 7.01558667\n\n# The angular distance between the first two minima is given by\n# delta_theta = (j1_2 - j1_1) / (2 * pi) * (lambda / a)\n# We calculate the coefficient (j1_2 - j1_1) / (2 * pi)\n\ncoefficient = (j1_2 - j1_1) / (2 * math.pi)\n\nprint(f\"{coefficient:.3f}\")\n```\n>>>0.507\n\nThe calculated coefficient is approximately 0.507. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 0.506 λ / a\nB) 1.220 λ /a\nC) 0.610 λ / a\nD) 0.500 λ / a\n\nThe value 0.507 is closest to option A (0.506). The small difference is likely due to the precision of the zero values used. Option A is the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the geometry of the aperture.**\n    An N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a' is described. The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. As the number of sides, N, approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle. The apothem 'a' in this limit becomes the radius of the circle.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the physical phenomenon.**\n    The problem describes monochromatic light passing through an aperture and forming a pattern in the far field. This is Fraunhofer diffraction. For a circular aperture, the resulting diffraction pattern is known as an Airy pattern, which consists of a central bright spot (the Airy disk) surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings.\n\n*   **Step 3: Recall the formula for minima in Fraunhofer diffraction by a circular aperture.**\n    The intensity distribution for Fraunhofer diffraction from a circular aperture of radius 'a' is given by:\n    I(θ) = I₀ [ (2 * J₁(k * a * sinθ)) / (k * a * sinθ) ]²\n    Where:\n    *   J₁(x) is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n    *   k is the wave number, given by k = 2π/λ.\n    *   'a' is the radius of the aperture.\n    *   θ is the angular deviation from the central axis.\n\n    The intensity minima (dark rings) occur at the angles where the numerator is zero, i.e., where the Bessel function J₁(x) is zero (excluding the trivial case x=0 which corresponds to the central maximum).\n    The condition for the m-th minimum is:\n    k * a * sin(θₘ) = j₁,ₘ\n    where j₁,ₘ is the m-th root (zero) of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n\n*   **Step 4: Apply the small-angle approximation.**\n    The problem states that the angles are small, so we can use the approximation sin(θ) ≈ θ. The condition for the m-th minimum becomes:\n    k * a * θₘ = j₁,ₘ\n    Substituting k = 2π/λ:\n    (2π/λ) * a * θₘ = j₁,ₘ\n    Solving for the angular position θₘ:\n    θₘ = (j₁,ₘ * λ) / (2π * a)\n\n*   **Step 5: Find the angular positions of the first two minima.**\n    To find the positions of the first two minima, we need the first two non-zero roots of the Bessel function J₁(x). These are well-known values:\n    *   First zero: j₁,₁ ≈ 3.8317\n    *   Second zero: j₁,₂ ≈ 7.0156\n\n    The angular position of the first minimum (m=1) is:\n    θ₁ = (j₁,₁ * λ) / (2π * a) = (3.8317 * λ) / (2π * a)\n\n    The angular position of the second minimum (m=2) is:\n    θ₂ = (j₁,₂ * λ) / (2π * a) = (7.0156 * λ) / (2π * a)\n\n*   **Step 6: Calculate the angular distance between the first two minima.**\n    The angular distance is the difference between the positions of the second and first minima:\n    Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁\n    Δθ = [ (j₁,₂ * λ) / (2π * a) ] - [ (j₁,₁ * λ) / (2π * a) ]\n    Δθ = ( (j₁,₂ - j₁,₁) / (2π) ) * (λ / a)\n    Plugging in the values for the zeros:\n    Δθ = ( (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π) ) * (λ / a)\n    Δθ = ( 3.1839 / (2 * 3.14159...) ) * (λ / a)\n    Δθ ≈ 0.5066 * (λ / a)\n\n*   **Step 7: Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The calculated coefficient is approximately 0.5066.\n    The given options are:\n    A) 0.506 λ / a\n    B) 1.220 λ /a\n    C) 0.610 λ / a\n    D) 0.500 λ / a\n    The calculated value is closest to option A. (Note: Option C, 0.610 λ/a, corresponds to the position of the first minimum, which is a common distracter).\n\nThe Python code in the initial reasoning block confirms this calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The first non-zero root of the Bessel function J1(x)\nj1_1 = 3.8317\n# The second non-zero root of the Bessel function J1(x)\nj1_2 = 7.0156\n\n# The angular distance coefficient is (j1_2 - j1_1) / (2 * pi)\ncoefficient = (j1_2 - j1_1) / (2 * math.pi)\nprint(f\"Calculated coefficient: {coefficient:.4f}\")\n\n# Compare to the option values\nprint(f\"The result is approximately {coefficient:.3f} * (lambda / a)\")\n```\nThe output of the above code logic is 0.5066, which is best represented by option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "When an N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a' has N approach infinity, the shape of the polygon approaches a circle. The apothem 'a' of the polygon becomes the radius of this circle.\n\nThe problem then simplifies to finding the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'. This diffraction pattern is known as the Airy pattern.\n\nThe intensity minima in the Airy pattern occur at specific angles θ from the central axis. For small angles, the angular position of the *m*-th minimum (where *m* = 1, 2, 3, ...) is given by the formula:\nsin(θₘ) ≈ θₘ = (j₁,ₘ / (2π)) * (λ / a)\nwhere:\n*   λ is the wavelength of the light.\n*   'a' is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   j₁,ₘ is the *m*-th zero of the Bessel function of the first kind of order one, J₁(x).\n\nWe are asked for the angular distance between the first two minima. This corresponds to the distance between the *m*=1 and *m*=2 minima.\n\nThe angular position of the first minimum (m=1) is:\nθ₁ = (j₁,₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a)\n\nThe angular position of the second minimum (m=2) is:\nθ₂ = (j₁,₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a)\n\nThe angular distance between them is Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁.\nΔθ = (j₁,₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a) - (j₁,₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a)\nΔθ = [ (j₁,₂ - j₁,₁) / (2π) ] * (λ / a)\n\nTo solve this, we need the values for the first two zeros of the Bessel function J₁(x):\n*   j₁,₁ ≈ 3.8317\n*   j₁,₂ ≈ 7.0156\n\nNow, we can calculate the numerical coefficient:\nCoefficient = (j₁,₂ - j₁,₁) / (2π)\nCoefficient = (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2 * π)\nCoefficient = 3.1839 / (2 * 3.14159...)\nCoefficient ≈ 0.5066\n\nSo, the angular distance is approximately:\nΔθ ≈ 0.5066 * (λ / a)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.506 λ / a\nB) 1.220 λ / a\nC) 0.610 λ / a\nD) 0.500 λ / a\n\nThe calculated value of 0.5066 is best matched by option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
