    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the uncertainty in the measurement of the observable $P_z$, denoted as $\\Delta P_z$, for a system in a given quantum state.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Uncertainty:** The uncertainty of an operator $A$ in a state $\\ket{\\psi}$ is given by the general formula:\n    $\\Delta A = \\sqrt{\\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2}$\n    where $\\langle A \\rangle = \\bra{\\psi} A \\ket{\\psi}$ is the expectation value of the operator $A$.\n\n3.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The state of the system is given by the column vector (ket):\n        $\\ket{\\psi} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   The matrix representation of the operator $P_z$ is:\n        $P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$:**\n    *   First, we need the conjugate transpose of the state vector (bra):\n        $\\bra{\\psi} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   Now, we compute the product $\\bra{\\psi} P_z \\ket{\\psi}$:\n        $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   Let's first compute the product $P_z \\ket{\\psi}$:\n        $P_z \\ket{\\psi} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar \\cdot (-1/2) + 0 + 0 \\\\ 0 + 0 + 0 \\\\ 0 + 0 + (-\\hbar) \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   Now, multiply by $\\bra{\\psi}$:\n        $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix} = (-1/2)(-\\hbar/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(\\hbar/2) = \\frac{\\hbar}{4} + 0 - \\frac{\\hbar}{4} = 0$\n    *   So, $\\langle P_z \\rangle = 0$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$:**\n    *   First, we need the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$. We find this by squaring the matrix for $P_z$:\n        $P_z^2 = P_z \\cdot P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   Now, we compute the product $\\bra{\\psi} P_z^2 \\ket{\\psi}$:\n        $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   Let's first compute the product $P_z^2 \\ket{\\psi}$:\n        $P_z^2 \\ket{\\psi} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 \\cdot (-1/2) + 0 + 0 \\\\ 0 + 0 + 0 \\\\ 0 + 0 + \\hbar^2 \\cdot (-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   Now, multiply by $\\bra{\\psi}$:\n        $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar^2/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -\\hbar^2/2 \\end{pmatrix} = (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-\\hbar^2/2) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{2\\hbar^2}{4} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n    *   So, $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$:**\n    *   Substitute the calculated expectation values into the uncertainty formula:\n        $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2}$\n    *   $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\n7.  **Final Check and Conclusion:** The calculations are straightforward applications of quantum mechanical postulates. The additional information about $P_x$ and $P_y$ serves to define the context but is not directly needed for the calculation once the state vector is given. The final result for the uncertainty is $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$. This corresponds to option D.\n\nI will use Python to verify the matrix multiplications.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define hbar for symbolic representation in the final answer.
