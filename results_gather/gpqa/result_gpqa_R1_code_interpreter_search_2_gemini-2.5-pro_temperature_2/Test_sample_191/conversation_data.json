    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial state and the introduction of the charge:** We start with an uncharged spherical conductor. This means the net charge of the conductor is zero. A positive charge `+q` is placed inside the spherical cavity.\n\n2.  **Electrostatic Induction:** The presence of the charge `+q` inside the cavity will cause the mobile electrons in the conductor to redistribute themselves.\n    *   **Inner Surface:** The positive charge `+q` will attract electrons to the inner surface of the cavity. This results in an induced charge of `-q` accumulating on the surface of the spherical cavity (the wall of radius `r`). This is a direct consequence of Gauss's Law: if we imagine a Gaussian surface entirely within the conducting material, the electric field must be zero everywhere on that surface. Therefore, the net flux through it is zero, which implies the net charge enclosed must be zero. Since the charge `+q` is inside this Gaussian surface, a charge of `-q` must be induced on the cavity's inner wall to make the total enclosed charge `+q - q = 0`.\n    *   **Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially electrically neutral. Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a corresponding positive charge of `+q` must appear elsewhere in the conductor to maintain charge conservation. This excess positive charge `+q` will reside on the outermost surface of the conductor (the sphere of radius `R`).\n\n3.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** A fundamental property of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside the bulk of the conductor is zero. The conductor acts as an electrostatic shield. This means the charge distribution on the outer surface is not affected by the specific arrangement of charges inside the cavity. Since the outer surface is a sphere, the `+q` charge will distribute itself **uniformly** over the surface of the large sphere of radius `R`.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** We need to find the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor. The electric field at this point is the superposition of the fields created by all charges. However, due to the shielding effect of the conductor, the field outside is determined solely by the charge distribution on the outer surface.\n    *   The charges inside the conductor (`+q` in the cavity and `-q` on the cavity wall) are completely shielded and do not produce any electric field outside the conductor. Their net effect at point P is zero.\n    *   The only charge that creates an electric field at point P is the `+q` charge distributed uniformly on the outer surface of the spherical conductor (the sphere of radius `R`).\n\n5.  **Applying the Shell Theorem:** According to the shell theorem (or by applying Gauss's Law to a spherical surface of radius `L` concentric with the conductor), the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude placed at the center of the sphere.\n    *   Total charge on the outer surface = `+q`.\n    *   Center of the spherical conductor = O.\n    *   Distance of point P from the center O = `L`.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is given by Coulomb's law for a point charge `+q` located at the center O:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The information about the cavity's radius `r`, its offset `s`, the distance `l`, and the angle `\\theta` are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor. They are distractions. The correct expression depends only on the charge `q` and the distance `L` from the center of the outer spherical conductor. Comparing our result with the given options, option D matches perfectly.\n\n<<<D>>>"
