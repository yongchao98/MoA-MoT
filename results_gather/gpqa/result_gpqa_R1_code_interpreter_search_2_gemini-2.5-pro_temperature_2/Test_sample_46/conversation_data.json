    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    1.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is `C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`.\n    2.  DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    3.  A DBE of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs: one ring and three double bonds) plus one additional degree of unsaturation, typically a carbonyl group (C=O) or a nitrile (Câ‰¡N).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    1.  **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1 (medium to strong):** This pair of sharp bands is characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    2.  **1720 cm-1 (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl region and is typical for an ester group (R-CO-O-R'). The position is slightly lower than a simple alkyl ester because of conjugation with the benzene ring.\n    3.  **IR Conclusion:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH2) and a conjugated ester (Ar-COOR) group.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    1.  **Aromatic Region:** The two signals at **7.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)** indicate four protons on a benzene ring. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n        *   The downfield doublet at **8.0 ppm** is ortho to an electron-withdrawing group (like the ester, -COOR).\n        *   The upfield doublet at **7.0 ppm** is ortho to an electron-donating group (like the amine, -NH2).\n    2.  **Aliphatic Region and Functional Groups:**\n        *   The signals at **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)** and **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)** are coupled to each other. A triplet (3H) and a quartet (2H) together are the definitive pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH2CH3)**.\n        *   The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is highly deshielded, which is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an oxygen atom (-O-CH2-), as found in an ethyl ester.\n    3.  **Exchangeable Protons:**\n        *   The signal at **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)** is a broad singlet integrating to two protons. This is consistent with the two protons of the primary amine (-NH2) identified in the IR spectrum. The broadness is due to chemical exchange.\n\n*   **Putting it all together:**\n    1.  We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  One substituent is a primary amine (-NH2).\n    3.  The other substituent is an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n    4.  The only structure that fits all this evidence is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n     \n\n*   **Verification of other options:**\n    *   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is meta-substituted (would not give two doublets in NMR) and is an amide, whose C=O stretch is typically at a lower frequency (~1660-1690 cm-1).\n    *   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H band in the IR. It would also have a formyl proton signal (-CHO) in the NMR around 8.2 ppm.\n    *   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an isomer. The ethyl group is part of a propionate (-OCOCH2CH3), not an ethyl ester. The -CH2- quartet in a propionate would appear around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not at 4.5 ppm. The C=O stretch of this phenyl ester would also be at a higher frequency (~1760 cm-1).\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
