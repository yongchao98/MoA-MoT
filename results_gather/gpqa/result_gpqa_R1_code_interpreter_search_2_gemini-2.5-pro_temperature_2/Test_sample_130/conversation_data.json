    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The NMR data for this anhydride is key:\n        *   ¹H NMR: A single peak at 7 ppm. A single peak means all protons are chemically equivalent. The shift at 7 ppm is in the vinylic (alkene) region.\n        *   ¹³C NMR: Two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon).\n        *   The only structure that fits this data is **maleic anhydride**. It is derived from *cis*-butenedioic acid (maleic acid). Due to the molecule's symmetry (a C₂ axis and a mirror plane), the two alkene protons are equivalent, the two carbonyl carbons are equivalent, and the two alkene carbons are equivalent. This perfectly matches the provided NMR data.\n    *   **Diene:** The problem explicitly states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with a CH₂ group at C5 and four methyl groups on each of the sp²-hybridized carbons of the conjugated diene system (C1, C2, C3, and C4).\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene and the dienophile.\n    *   The reaction yields two products, a major and a minor one. In Diels-Alder reactions, this points to the formation of stereoisomers, specifically the ***endo*** and ***exo*** products.\n    *   According to the **Alder Endo Rule**, the major product is typically the *endo* isomer, which is stabilized by secondary orbital overlap. The minor product is the *exo* isomer.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structure of the Products:**\n    *   The reaction forms a **bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene** derivative. Let's break down the structure of the product:\n        *   The core is the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene framework.\n        *   The anhydride from the maleic anhydride is fused to the bicyclic system.\n        *   The original C1 and C4 of the diene become the **bridgehead carbons**. Each carries a **methyl group** (`Me_bridgehead`).\n        *   The original C2 and C3 of the diene form the new **double bond** in the six-membered ring. Each of these carbons also carries a **methyl group** (`Me_alkene`).\n        *   The original C5 (the CH₂) of the diene becomes the one-carbon **bridge** (`H_bridge`).\n        *   The two protons on the anhydride part of the molecule are `H_anhydride`.\n    *   Now, let's differentiate the *endo* and *exo* stereoisomers:\n        *   ***Endo* isomer (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) of the bicyclic system as the C7 methylene bridge (`H_bridge`).\n        *   ***Exo* isomer (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the bicyclic system from the C7 methylene bridge (`H_bridge`).\n\n4.  **Correlate NMR Signals to Protons:**\n    *   The problem provides descriptions of key signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum. Let's assign them based on typical chemical shifts and the product structure:\n        *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** These are the `H_anhydride` protons. They are alpha to two carbonyl groups, which deshields them significantly.\n        *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** These are the `Me_alkene` protons. Methyl groups on a double bond are typically in this region.\n        *   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** These are the `Me_bridgehead` protons. Methyl groups on saturated sp³ carbons are more shielded and appear at a lower chemical shift (further upfield).\n        *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This must correspond to one of the two protons of the C7 methylene bridge (`H_bridge`). The two bridge protons are diastereotopic. They couple to each other (geminal coupling), forming an AB quartet, which can appear as two doublets if the chemical shift difference is large enough compared to the coupling constant. This signal represents one half of that AB system.\n\n5.  **Interpret the NOESY Spectrum Data:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of two spatially-proximate protons.\n    *   The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the **major product (*endo*)** but absent or weak in the **minor product (*exo*)**. We need to find the pair of protons whose proximity is unique to the *endo* isomer.\n    *   Let's analyze the spatial relationships in each isomer:\n        *   ***Endo* Isomer (Major):** The anhydride group is *syn* to the C7 bridge. This means the `H_anhydride` protons (~3.5 ppm) are **close in space** to the C7 bridge protons (`H_bridge`, one of which is the ~1.5 ppm doublet). A strong NOE cross-peak is expected between them.\n        *   ***Exo* Isomer (Minor):** The anhydride group is *anti* to the C7 bridge. This means the `H_anhydride` protons are **far away** from the `H_bridge` protons. The NOE interaction between them would be absent or very weak.\n    *   This analysis perfectly matches the observation in the problem. The unique cross-peak in the major product connects the `H_anhydride` protons and the `H_bridge` protons.\n\n6.  **Select the Final Answer:**\n    *   The cross-peak connects the resonance for `H_anhydride` (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) and the resonance for one of the `H_bridge` protons (1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm).\n    *   This corresponds to option C.\n    *   Let's briefly consider why the other options are incorrect:\n        *   A) `Me_bridgehead` and `Me_alkene` are far apart in both isomers.\n        *   B) A NOE between `Me_bridgehead` and `H_bridge` would likely exist in both isomers, so it wouldn't be the distinguishing peak.\n        *   D) A NOE between `Me_alkene` and `H_anhydride` would be strong in the *exo* (minor) product and weak/absent in the *endo* (major) product, which is the opposite of what is observed.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak connects the 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n\n<<<C>>>"
