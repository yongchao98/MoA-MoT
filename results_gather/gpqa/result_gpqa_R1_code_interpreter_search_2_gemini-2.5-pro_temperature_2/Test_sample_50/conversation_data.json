    "This is a classic electrostatics problem that can be solved using the method of images.\n\n**1. The Method of Images**\n\nThe problem involves a point charge `q` near a grounded conducting sphere. The electric field outside the sphere is complex to calculate directly due to the unknown distribution of induced charges on the sphere's surface. The method of images simplifies this by replacing the sphere with an \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location inside the sphere.\n\nThe combination of the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` must produce a potential of zero on the surface that was previously occupied by the grounded sphere (i.e., at a radius `R`).\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its position `b` (from the center) are given by:\n\n*   **Image charge magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n*   **Image charge position:** `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThis specific placement ensures that for any point on the sphere's surface, the sum of the potentials from `q` and `q'` is zero, satisfying the \"grounded\" condition.\n\n**2. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d` from the sphere's center.\n\nA common pitfall is to calculate the potential energy as the simple interaction between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`. This is incorrect. The correct formula for the potential energy of a charge `q` in the presence of conductors is:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nwhere `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` created by all *other* charges (in this case, the induced charges on the sphere).\n\nAccording to the method of images, the potential created by the induced surface charges is identical to the potential created by the image charge `q'`. Therefore, `V_induced` is the potential at position `d` due to the image charge `q'` at position `b`.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n*   **Calculate the distance between `q` and `q'`:**\n    The distance is `d - b = d - (R^2 / d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`.\n\n*   **Calculate the potential `V_induced` at the location of `q`:**\n    `V_induced` = (Potential from `q'`) = `k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n    `V_induced = k * [-q * (R / d)] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n    `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n*   **Calculate the total potential energy `U`:**\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\nB) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\nC) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\nD) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n\nThe calculated potential energy `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)` matches option C perfectly. The negative sign indicates that the force between the charge and the grounded sphere is attractive.\n\n<<<C>>>"
