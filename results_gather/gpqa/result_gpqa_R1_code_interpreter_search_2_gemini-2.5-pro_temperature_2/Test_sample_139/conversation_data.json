    "Here is my reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:** I'll break down the user's prompt into individual chemical clues to identify the substances involved.\n\n    *   **Clue 1: Melting Point of B:** \"The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"\n        *   277 Kelvin is approximately 3.85 °C. This is very close to the melting point of heavy water, Deuterium Oxide (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K). This strongly suggests that **B is D₂O**.\n\n    *   **Clue 2: Formation of B:** \"a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B.\"\n        *   If B is D₂O, then G is a substance that releases D₂O upon heating. This is characteristic of a deuterated hydrate (a salt containing D₂O as water of crystallization, Salt·xD₂O) or a deuterated metal hydroxide (M(OD)ₓ), which decomposes upon heating to a metal oxide and D₂O. For example, 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O.\n\n    *   **Clue 3: The Reaction (X + Y -> W + G):** \"Substance X ... reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W ... and a precipitate G forms\".\n        *   We have a violent reaction producing a precipitate (G) and a gas (W). Since G produces D₂O, deuterium must be present in the reactants (X or Y).\n\n    *   **Clue 4: Gas W:** \"gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\"\n        *   Let's analyze common simple gases:\n            *   H₂ (¹H₂): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (No)\n            *   He (⁴He): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Possible)\n            *   **D₂ (²H₂): 2 protons (1+1), 2 neutrons (1+1). (Possible and consistent with D₂O)**\n            *   CH₄: 10 protons, 6 neutrons. (No)\n            *   N₂ (¹⁴N₂): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Possible)\n            *   CO (¹²C¹⁶O): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Possible)\n        *   Given that D₂O is involved, D₂ is a very strong candidate for gas W.\n\n    *   **Clue 5: Substance X:**\n        *   \"known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements.\"\n        *   \"and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"\n        *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n\n2.  **Synthesize the Clues to Identify X:**\n\n    *   Let's hypothesize based on the strong clues. If B is D₂O and W is D₂, then deuterium is heavily involved. The reaction likely involves a deuterated reagent.\n    *   Let's test the idea that Y is heavy water (D₂O) and X is a reactive substance. The reaction is `X + D₂O -> D₂ (gas) + G (precipitate)`. This means X must be a very powerful reducing agent, capable of reducing the D⁺ from D₂O to D₂ gas. This is a characteristic reaction of metal hydrides.\n    *   Consider the organic chemistry clue: a common reagent with a deuterated analog. A prime candidate for a powerful reducing agent is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its deuterated analog is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   Let's test if X = LiAlD₄ fits all clues.\n        *   **Analog:** Its analog, LiAlH₄, is a very common reagent. (Fits)\n        *   **Heavy isotope:** It contains Deuterium (D). (Fits)\n        *   **Reaction with Y=D₂O:** `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O -> LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`.\n        *   **Violent reaction:** LiAlH₄ reacts violently with water, so LiAlD₄ will react violently with D₂O. (Fits)\n        *   **Gas W:** The gas produced is D₂, which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. (Fits)\n        *   **Precipitate G:** The products are LiOD (soluble) and Al(OD)₃. Aluminum hydroxide is a gelatinous precipitate, so Al(OD)₃ would be as well. So, **G = Al(OD)₃**. (Fits)\n        *   **Heating G:** Heating aluminum hydroxide dehydrates it: 2Al(OH)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3H₂O. Therefore, heating G (Al(OD)₃) would produce `Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. The substance released is D₂O (B). (Fits)\n        *   **Keto Acid Reaction:** A keto acid has the general structure R-CO-COOH. It contains 3 oxygen atoms (e.g., pyruvic acid, CH₃COCOOH). LiAlH₄ is a powerful enough reagent to reduce both the ketone group and the carboxylic acid group.\n            `R-CO-COOH --(1. LiAlD₄, 2. workup)--> R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH`\n            The product is a diol, which contains **2 oxygen atoms**. This perfectly matches the clue.\n\n3.  **Conclusion on Identity:** All evidence points conclusively to **Substance X = LiAlD₄**.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\"\n    *   Substance X is LiAlD₄. The formula unit contains: 1 Lithium atom, 1 Aluminum atom, and 4 Deuterium atoms.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n    *   The **lightest element** (by atomic number) is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** (by atomic number) is Aluminum.\n    *   The question uses integer answers, so we will use integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved:\n        *   Aluminum: The main isotope is ²⁷Al. Mass number = 27.\n        *   Hydrogen: The specified isotope is Deuterium (D or ²H). Mass number = 2.\n    *   Now, we apply the calculation instruction:\n        *   \"cumulative ... masses of the lightest ... elements\": This refers to the total mass of all atoms of the lightest element. There are 4 atoms of Deuterium.\n            Total mass from lightest element (Hydrogen) = 4 × (Mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   \"cumulative ... masses of the ... heaviest elements\": This refers to the total mass of all atoms of the heaviest element. There is 1 atom of Aluminum.\n            Total mass from heaviest element (Aluminum) = 1 × (Mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   The final value is the sum of these two contributions:\n        *   Cumulative Mass = (Total mass from H) + (Total mass from Al) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n5.  **Final Answer Selection:** The calculated value is 35, which corresponds to option B.\n```python\n# Final calculation step to verify the arithmetic.\n# Substance X is LiAlD4.\n# Elements are Li, Al, H.\n# Lightest element is H (isotope D). Heaviest is Al.\n# We need to calculate: (total mass of D atoms) + (total mass of Al atoms)\n# Mass number of D (Deuterium, 2H) is 2.\n# Mass number of Al (27Al) is 27.\n# There are 4 D atoms and 1 Al atom in LiAlD4.\n\ntotal_mass_of_deuterium = 4 * 2\ntotal_mass_of_aluminum = 1 * 27\n\ncumulative_mass = total_mass_of_deuterium + total_mass_of_aluminum\nprint(cumulative_mass)\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "The user wants me to solve a chemical puzzle and perform a calculation.\n\n**1. Identifying Substance B:**\nThe problem states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K.\n*   Conversion: 277 K - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n*   This temperature is the melting point of heavy water, Deuterium Oxide (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C.\n*   Therefore, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n**2. Identifying the Reaction and Substances G and W:**\n*   A precipitate G is heated to release B (D₂O). This indicates G is a deuterated hydroxide (like M(OD)x) or a deuterated hydrate (a salt with D₂O as water of crystallization).\n*   Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce a gas W and precipitate G.\n*   Gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's analyze common gases:\n    *   H₂ (Protium): 2 protons, 0 neutrons.\n    *   He: 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Possible)\n    *   **D₂ (Deuterium gas, ²H₂): 2 protons (1+1), 2 neutrons (1+1).** This is a very strong candidate given that D₂O is a product.\n    *   N₂ (¹⁴N₂): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Possible)\n    *   CO (¹²C¹⁶O): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Possible)\n*   The release of Deuterium gas (D₂) strongly suggests that a powerful deuteride reducing agent is reacting with a source of deuterium, like D₂O itself. Let's assume **W is D₂** and **Y is D₂O**.\n*   The reaction is `X + D₂O → D₂ (gas) + G (precipitate)`. This means X must be a substance that can reduce D₂O to D₂. This is characteristic of very reactive metal hydrides or deuterides.\n*   If G is a precipitate that forms from this reaction and releases D₂O upon heating, a metal deuteroxide is a prime candidate.\n\n**3. Identifying Substance X:**\n*   Substance X has a \"very close analog\" used as a reagent in organic chemistry. This points towards common laboratory reagents.\n*   A very common and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Its \"very close analog\" containing a heavier isotope of hydrogen would be **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n*   Let's check if X = LiAlD₄ fits all the clues:\n    *   **Heavier isotope:** Contains Deuterium (D), the heavier isotope of Hydrogen. (✓)\n    *   **Analog in organic chemistry:** LiAlH₄ is a workhorse reagent. (✓)\n    *   **Reaction with Y (D₂O):** The reaction would be:\n        `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → 4D₂ (gas) + LiOD (soluble) + Al(OD)₃ (precipitate)`\n        This reaction is known to be violent, similar to LiAlH₄ with H₂O. (✓)\n    *   **Gas W:** The gas produced is D₂, which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. (✓)\n    *   **Precipitate G:** Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, is a gelatinous precipitate. (✓)\n    *   **Heating G:** Heating Al(OD)₃ would cause decomposition to aluminum oxide and heavy water:\n        `2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O (B)`\n        This releases substance B. (✓)\n    *   **Reaction with a keto acid:** A keto acid has a ketone group (-CO-) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). For example, pyruvic acid (CH₃COCOOH). LiAlH₄ (and thus LiAlD₄) is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce both functional groups:\n        `R-CO-COOH --(1. LiAlD₄ / 2. Workup)--> R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH`\n        The product is a diol, which contains **2 atoms of oxygen**. The initial keto acid contains 3 oxygen atoms. This perfectly matches the final clue. (✓)\n\n**Conclusion:** All clues point to **Substance X being Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**4. Calculation:**\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄). We need to use integer mass numbers for the specified isotopes.\n*   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest element** (by atomic number): Hydrogen. The isotope is Deuterium (²H), with a mass number of 2. There are **four** deuterium atoms.\n*   **Heaviest element** (by atomic number): Aluminum. The isotope is ²⁷Al, with a mass number of 27. There is **one** aluminum atom.\n*   **Calculation:** Sum the masses of all atoms of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n    *   Mass from heaviest element (Al): 1 × 27 = 27\n    *   Mass from lightest element (D): 4 × 2 = 8\n    *   Cumulative sum: 27 + 8 = 35\n\nThe final calculated value is 35.\n\n```python\n# Substance X is identified as LiAlD4 (Lithium Aluminum Deuteride).\n# The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (in the form of its isotope Deuterium, D).\n\n# Identify the lightest and heaviest elements by atomic number.\n# Li (Z=3), Al (Z=13), H (Z=1).\n# Lightest element: Hydrogen (H)\n# Heaviest element: Aluminum (Al)\n\n# Find the mass contributions based on the isotopes in the molecule LiAlD4.\n# Use integer mass numbers.\n# The isotope of Hydrogen is Deuterium (D or 2H), mass number = 2.\n# The isotope of Aluminum is the most common one, 27Al, mass number = 27.\n\n# Count the atoms in the formula unit LiAlD4.\nnum_Al_atoms = 1\nnum_D_atoms = 4\n\n# Calculate the cumulative mass as requested.\n# Cumulative Mass = (mass of all heaviest element atoms) + (mass of all lightest element atoms)\nmass_of_aluminum = num_Al_atoms * 27\nmass_of_deuterium = num_D_atoms * 2\ncumulative_mass = mass_of_aluminum + mass_of_deuterium\n\nprint(cumulative_mass)\n```\n<<<B>>>",
