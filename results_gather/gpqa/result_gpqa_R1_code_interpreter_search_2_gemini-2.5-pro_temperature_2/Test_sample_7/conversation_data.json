    "Here is my reasoning process to determine the relationship between the genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Single-Gene Knockouts (Mutants)**\n\nThis step helps understand the individual role of each gene.\n*   **Wild-type (Control):** 100% resistance. This is our baseline.\n*   **g1 mutant (G1 knocked out):** 75% resistance. The loss of G1 function causes a 25% decrease in resistance. This means G1 contributes to the resistance phenotype, but it is not essential on its own.\n*   **g2 mutant (G2 knocked out):** 0% resistance. The loss of G2 function completely abolishes resistance. This indicates that G2 is an essential gene for this resistance pathway.\n*   **g3 mutant (G3 knocked out):** 50% resistance. The loss of G3 function causes a 50% decrease in resistance. Like G1, G3 contributes to resistance but is not solely responsible for it.\n\nFrom this initial analysis, G2 stands out as the most critical gene. A complete loss of function phenotype (0% resistance) often points to a master regulator or a gene at the top of a signaling/expression cascade.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Double-Gene Knockouts to Identify Epistasis**\n\nEpistasis occurs when the effect of one gene's mutation is masked by the mutation of another gene. The phenotype of the double mutant will resemble the phenotype of the *epistatic* (masking) gene. This is a powerful tool to order genes in a pathway.\n\n*   **g1g2 double mutant:** 0% resistance. This phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant (0% resistance) and different from the `g1` single mutant (75% resistance). Therefore, the `g2` mutation masks the `g1` mutation. This means **G2 is epistatic to G1**. This suggests G2 acts upstream of G1 in the pathway. For example, if G2 is a transcription factor required to turn on G1, then knocking out G2 prevents G1 from ever being made. In that case, it doesn't matter if the G1 gene itself is functional or knocked out (`g1`); the result is the same as the `g2` knockout.\n\n*   **g2g3 double mutant:** 0% resistance. This phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant (0% resistance) and different from the `g3` single mutant (50% resistance). By the same logic, the `g2` mutation masks the `g3` mutation. This means **G2 is epistatic to G3**, placing G2 upstream of G3 as well.\n\n*   **Conclusion from Epistasis:** Since G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, and we know at least one gene is a transcription factor, G2 is the strongest candidate. A likely model is that G2 is a transcription factor that activates the expression of both G1 and G3.\n\n    *Proposed Pathway:* `G2 -> (activates) -> G1 & G3 -> Resistance`\n\n### **3. Analyze the Interaction Between G1 and G3**\n\nNow let's examine the relationship between G1 and G3, which appear to be downstream of G2.\n\n*   **g1g3 double mutant:** 10% resistance.\n*   **Phenotypes of singles:** `g1` = 75% resistance, `g3` = 50% resistance.\n\nLet's consider what we would expect if their effects were simply additive.\n*   Loss from g1 = 25 percentage points.\n*   Loss from g3 = 50 percentage points.\n*   Expected additive phenotype = 100% - (25 + 50) = 25% resistance.\n\nThe observed resistance (10%) is significantly lower than the expected additive result (25%). This type of interaction, where the double mutant has a much more severe phenotype than expected from the sum of the single mutants, is called a **synergistic interaction**. This synergy is a classic hallmark of **gene redundancy**. It implies that G1 and G3 have overlapping or partially redundant functions. When one is knocked out, the other can partially compensate. When both are knocked out, the system fails much more severely.\n\n### **4. Evaluate the Answer Choices**\n\nBased on our analysis, the best description of the system is: **G2 is a transcription factor acting upstream of G1 and G3, and G1 and G3 have redundant functions in conferring disease resistance.**\n\nLet's review the options:\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\": Correct.\n    *   \"G1 and G3 has the same promoter\": Plausible, but we cannot conclude this from the data. It's a hypothesis about the mechanism.\n    *   \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\": Incorrect. The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) does not match the `g3` phenotype (50%).\n\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\": Correct.\n    *   \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\": Correct. The synergistic interaction in the `g1g3` mutant is strong evidence for this.\n    *   \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\": Incorrect. The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) does not match the `g1` phenotype (75%).\n    *   *Note:* Although the third part of this statement is incorrect, the first two parts are the most accurate and comprehensive conclusions that can be drawn from the experiment. It is the \"best fit\" answer.\n\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\": Correct.\n    *   \"G1 and G3 show pleiotropy\": Incorrect. Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple distinct traits. We are only measuring one trait (resistance). There is no evidence for pleiotropy.\n    *   \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\": Incorrect.\n\n*   **D) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   \"G1 is a transcription factor\": Incorrect. G2 is the much better candidate.\n    *   \"G2 is epistatic towards G1\": Correct, but the premise of the entire option is wrong.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nOption B contains the two most accurate and significant conclusions derived from the experimental data: that G2 is a transcription factor and that G1 and G3 exhibit gene redundancy. The third claim about epistasis between G1 and G3 is factually incorrect based on the data, likely an error in the question's construction. However, compared to the other options, which contain incorrect or unsupported claims (\"pleiotropy\") or weaker hypotheses (\"same promoter\"), Option B is the best possible answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
