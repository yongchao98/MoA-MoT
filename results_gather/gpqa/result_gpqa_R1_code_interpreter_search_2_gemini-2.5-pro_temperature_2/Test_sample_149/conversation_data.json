    "*   **Step 1: Elucidate the structure of the starting compound (C8H9NO) from the given ¹H-NMR data.**\n\n    1.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n        DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 9 - 4 = 5.\n        A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 DBE) and one additional double bond or ring (1 DBE), likely a carbonyl group (C=O) given the oxygen in the formula.\n\n    2.  **Analyze the ¹H-NMR signals:**\n        *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This signal is in the characteristic region for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern, a triplet (t), indicates that it is coupled to two adjacent protons (a -CH₂- group) according to the n+1 rule (t, n=2).\n        *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the two protons on the -CH₂- group adjacent to the aldehyde. The splitting, a doublet (d), indicates coupling to one adjacent proton (the -CHO proton) (d, n=1). This confirms the presence of a `-CH₂-CHO` fragment (phenylacetaldehyde moiety). The aldehyde proton splits the CH₂ into a doublet, and the CH₂ splits the aldehyde proton into a triplet. This is a classic AX₂ spin system.\n        *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, both doublets and each integrating to 2 protons, are indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n        *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH₂) group. The protons are exchangeable, which leads to peak broadening.\n\n    3.  **Assemble the structure:**\n        We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring, a `-CH₂-CHO` group, and an `-NH₂` group. Assembling these pieces gives the structure **2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal** (also known as 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde). Let's verify the molecular formula: C₆H₄ (ring) + C₂H₃O (side chain) + NH₂ = **C₈H₉NO**. This matches the given formula.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\n    **Starting Material:** 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal\n     ![](https://i.imgur.com/kSBY9a0.png) \n\n    1.  **NaNO₂, HCl (0-5 °C):** This is the standard procedure for diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The amino group (-NH₂) is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻).\n        **Intermediate A:** [4-(2-oxoethyl)phenyl]diazonium chloride\n         ![](https://i.imgur.com/V9c39lC.png) \n\n    2.  **H₂O:** The diazonium salt is unstable and reacts with water (hydrolyzes), typically upon warming, to replace the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group, releasing nitrogen gas (N₂).\n        **Intermediate B:** 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal (4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde)\n         ![](https://i.imgur.com/4gW5E1T.png) \n\n    3.  **aq. KOH, Heat:** This step involves the reaction of Intermediate B in the presence of a strong base (KOH) and heat. Intermediate B is an aldehyde with acidic α-protons (the protons on the -CH₂- group adjacent to the aldehyde). Such compounds undergo a base-catalyzed **aldol condensation**.\n        *   **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH⁻) deprotonates the α-carbon of one molecule to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. Subsequent protonation of the resulting alkoxide yields a β-hydroxy aldehyde, the aldol addition product.\n            The structure of the aldol addition product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option (D).\n             ![](https://i.imgur.com/w464i8I.png) \n\n        *   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is carried out with **heat**. Heating the aldol addition product in the presence of a base causes elimination of a water molecule (dehydration). The α-proton is removed by the base, and the β-hydroxyl group is eliminated, forming an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. This dehydration is highly favored because the resulting C=C double bond is conjugated with both the aldehyde's C=O group and one of the aromatic rings, leading to a very stable system.\n            The final condensation product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n             ![](https://i.imgur.com/fK5R8p3.png) \n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n\n    The question asks for the **final product**. Since the reaction is heated, the reaction will not stop at the aldol addition stage (product D). The thermodynamically stable, dehydrated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde will be formed. This final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal, which corresponds to option (C).\n\n<<<C>>>"
