    "Here is my step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Chemical Description into a Structure\nI will break down the descriptive text to place each substituent on the benzene ring. I'll use a standard numbering system where the principal functional group is at position 1.\n\n1.  **Identify all groups:**\n    *   Benzene ring (the parent structure).\n    *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   Carbaldehyde (-CHO), its prefix name is \"formyl\".\n    *   Cyano (-CN), its prefix name is \"cyano\".\n    *   Hydroxyl (-OH), its prefix name is \"hydroxy\".\n    *   Dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂), its prefix name is \"dimethylamino\".\n    *   Methoxy (-OCH₃), its prefix name is \"methoxy\".\n\n2.  **Determine the Principal Functional Group:**\n    According to IUPAC nomenclature priority rules, the carboxylic acid (-COOH) is the highest priority group present. Therefore, the parent molecule is **benzoic acid**, and the carbon attached to the -COOH group is designated as **C1**.\n\n3.  **Place Substituents Based on Relative Positions:**\n    *   **-COOH is at C1.**\n    *   \"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group\": The para position to C1 is C4. So, **-OCH₃ is at C4**.\n    *   \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\": The ortho positions to C1 are C2 and C6. So, **{-OH, -N(CH₃)₂} are at positions {C2, C6}**. We don't yet know which is which.\n    *   \"A ... carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another\": The meta positions to C1 are C3 and C5. Since the three groups are meta to each other, they must be in a 1,3,5 arrangement. So, **{-CHO, -CN} are at positions {C3, C5}**. We don't yet know which is which.\n\n4.  **Use the Final Constraint to Resolve Ambiguities:**\n    *   \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\" (Note: alcohol = hydroxyl group; nitrile = cyano group).\n    *   We know methoxy (-OCH₃) is at C4.\n    *   We know hydroxyl (-OH) is at C2 or C6.\n    *   We know cyano (-CN) is at C3 or C5.\n\n    Let's test the two possibilities for the cyano group's position:\n    *   **Case 1: If -CN is at C3.** The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4. The constraint says -OCH₃ and -OH must be at these positions. We have -OCH₃ at C4, which fits. Therefore, **-OH must be at C2**. This resolves the positions: -OH is at C2, which means -N(CH₃)₂ must be at C6. -CN is at C3, which means -CHO must be at C5.\n        *   **Structure from Case 1:** {C1:-COOH, C2:-OH, C3:-CN, C4:-OCH₃, C5:-CHO, C6:-N(CH₃)₂}\n\n    *   **Case 2: If -CN is at C5.** The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6. The constraint says -OCH₃ and -OH must be at these positions. We have -OCH₃ at C4, which fits. Therefore, **-OH must be at C6**. This also resolves the positions: -OH is at C6, which means -N(CH₃)₂ must be at C2. -CN is at C5, which means -CHO must be at C3.\n        *   **Structure from Case 2:** {C1:-COOH, C2:-N(CH₃)₂, C3:-CHO, C4:-OCH₃, C5:-CN, C6:-OH}\n\n    At this point, it appears there are two different constitutional isomers that fit the description. However, a single correct IUPAC name is expected. Let's proceed to name one of these structures and see if it matches an option. Let's choose the structure from Case 1.\n\n### Step 2: Apply IUPAC Naming Rules to the Deduced Structure\n\nLet's name the structure derived from Case 1:\n**Structure:** {C1:-COOH, C2:-OH, C3:-CN, C4:-OCH₃, C5:-CHO, C6:-N(CH₃)₂}\n\n1.  **Parent Name:** Benzoic acid.\n\n2.  **Numbering the Ring:** C1 is assigned to the -COOH group. We number the ring to give the lowest possible set of locants to the substituents. Since all other positions (2,3,4,5,6) are substituted, both clockwise and counter-clockwise numbering will result in the same locant set {2,3,4,5,6}.\n\n3.  **Breaking the Tie:** When the locant set is identical, we choose the direction that gives the lowest number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n    *   List the substituent prefixes alphabetically:\n        1.  **c**yano\n        2.  **d**imethylamino\n        3.  **f**ormyl\n        4.  **h**ydroxy\n        5.  **m**ethoxy\n\n    *   Now, check the two numbering directions for our structure:\n        *   **Clockwise path:** The substituent at C2 is -OH (hydroxy), and at **C3 is -CN (cyano)**.\n        *   **Counter-clockwise path:** The substituent at C2 is -N(CH₃)₂ (dimethylamino), and the -CN group is at C5.\n\n    *   The alphabetically first group is **cyano**. The clockwise path assigns it locant **3**. The counter-clockwise path assigns it locant **5**. We must choose the path that gives the lower number, so we must number **clockwise**.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Name:**\n    *   The numbering is now fixed: 1-COOH, 2-OH, 3-CN, 4-OCH₃, 5-CHO, 6-N(CH₃)₂.\n    *   List the substituents with their locants: 3-cyano, 6-dimethylamino, 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.\n    *   Arrange these alphabetically and attach to the parent name:\n        **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\n### Step 3: Compare with the Options\n\nLet's check the derived name against the given choices:\n\nA) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\nB) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\nC) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid\nD) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid\n\nOur derived name, **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**, perfectly matches option **B**.\n*(Note: Although two constitutional isomers appear to fit the description, they would have different IUPAC names. It is also a common feature in such problems that only one of the options is a correctly formed IUPAC name. In this case, option B is correctly numbered and alphabetized, whereas A, C, and D are not.)*\n\n<<<B>>>"
