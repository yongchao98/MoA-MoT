    "The problem asks for the energy and degeneracy of the third excited state of a particle of mass $m$ in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$.\n\n**1. Energy Eigenvalues**\n\nThe time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system can be separated in Cartesian coordinates $(x, y, z)$. The potential becomes $V(x,y,z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$. This is equivalent to three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators.\n\nThe energy eigenvalue of a 1D harmonic oscillator with quantum number $n_i$ is $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$.\n\nFor the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the three independent 1D oscillators:\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z}$\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nLet $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy levels are given by:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$\n\n**2. Identifying the States**\n\n*   **Ground State:** This corresponds to the lowest possible energy, which occurs when $n=0$.\n    *   $n = n_x + n_y + n_z = 0$. The only combination is $(n_x, n_y, n_z) = (0, 0, 0)$.\n    *   Energy: $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n*   **First Excited State:** This is the next energy level, corresponding to $n=1$.\n    *   $n = n_x + n_y + n_z = 1$.\n    *   Energy: $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n*   **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=2$.\n    *   $n = n_x + n_y + n_z = 2$.\n    *   Energy: $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n*   **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=3$.\n    *   $n = n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$.\n    *   Energy: $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n**3. Degeneracy of the Third Excited State**\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different combinations of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same total quantum number $n$. We need to find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is 3.\n\nLet's list the combinations:\n1.  One quantum number is 3, the others are 0:\n    *   (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3)  (3 states)\n2.  One quantum number is 2, one is 1, and one is 0:\n    *   (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2)  (6 states)\n3.  All three quantum numbers are 1:\n    *   (1, 1, 1)  (1 state)\n\nTotal number of states (degeneracy) = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\nAlternatively, the degeneracy $g_n$ of the n-th energy level for a D-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator is given by the formula:\n$g_n = \\binom{n+D-1}{D-1}$\nFor our case, $n=3$ and $D=3$:\n$g_3 = \\binom{3+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10$.\n\nThus, the third excited state has an energy of $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$ and is 10-fold degenerate. This means there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to this energy eigenvalue.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3\nB) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 10\nC) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10\nD) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
