    "Here's my thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2, which is T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star. The formula is:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    where:\n    *   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   A is the planet's albedo.\n    *   R_star is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** I'll write the expressions for T_eq1 and T_eq2 and then divide them.\n    *   T_eq1 = T_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))\n    *   T_eq2 = T_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))\n\n    The problem states that both planets orbit the same star (so T_star and R_star are the same) and that they have the same albedo (A1 = A2). When I take the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2, these common terms cancel out:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1-A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [T_star * (1-A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt((R_star / (2 * a1)) * ((2 * a2) / R_star))\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\n4.  **Connect Semi-Major Axis (a) to Given Data:** The problem provides radial velocity (RV) data (Doppler shifts) and planet masses. I need to find a way to relate the semi-major axis `a` to these quantities. The connection is through the orbital period `P`.\n\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law connects the orbital period `P` and the semi-major axis `a`. For a planet orbiting a much more massive star (M_star >> M_p), the law simplifies to P² ∝ a³. This means (P1/P2)² = (a1/a2)³.\n    *   From this, I can express the required ratio `a2/a1` in terms of periods: a1/a2 = (P1/P2)^(2/3), and therefore `a2/a1 = (P2/P1)^(2/3)`.\n    *   Substituting this back into the temperature ratio equation: T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt((P2/P1)^(2/3)) = (P2/P1)^(1/3) = (P1/P2)^(-1/3).\n\n5.  **Connect Orbital Period (P) to RV Data:** The radial velocity semi-amplitude `K` (the maximum velocity of the star's wobble) for a circular orbit is given by:\n    K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (M_p * sin(i)) / (M_star)^(2/3)  (assuming M_star >> M_p)\n    *   The problem states the planets are detected by both transit and RV methods. Transit detection implies the orbital inclination `i` is close to 90°, so sin(i) ≈ 1.\n    *   Let's solve for the period P:\n        K³ = (2πG / P) * (M_p³ / M_star²)\n        P = (2πG * M_p³) / (K³ * M_star²)\n    *   Now, I can form the ratio P1 / P2. The terms 2πG and M_star² are the same for both planets and will cancel out:\n        P1 / P2 = (M_p1³ / K1³) / (M_p2³ / K2³)\n        P1 / P2 = (M_p1 / M_p2)³ * (K2 / K1)³\n\n6.  **Connect RV Semi-amplitude (K) to Doppler Shift (Δλ):** The Doppler shift formula relates radial velocity `v` to the shift in wavelength: Δλ / λ₀ = v / c. The maximum shift `Δλ` corresponds to the maximum velocity, which is `K`.\n    *   K = c * (Δλ / λ₀)\n    *   Therefore, the ratio K2 / K1 is:\n        K2 / K1 = (c * Δλ2 / λ₀) / (c * Δλ1 / λ₀) = Δλ2 / Δλ1\n\n7.  **Combine Everything:** Now I substitute the expressions back into the temperature ratio equation.\n    *   Start with: T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (P1 / P2)^(-1/3)\n    *   Substitute the expression for P1 / P2: T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [ (M_p1 / M_p2)³ * (K2 / K1)³ ]^(-1/3)\n    *   The exponent (-1/3) multiplies the exponents inside the bracket: T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p1 / M_p2)^(-1) * (K2 / K1)^(-1)\n    *   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K1 / K2)\n    *   Finally, substitute K1/K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2: T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Value:** I'll plug in the given values:\n    *   M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n    *   M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n    *   Δλ1 = 0.03 Å\n    *   Δλ2 = 0.04 Å\n\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\n9.  **Use Code for Precise Calculation:** To get the decimal value, I will use a simple Python script.\n\n```python\n# Masses of the planets\nM_p1 = 7.0  # Earth masses\nM_p2 = 5.0  # Earth masses\n\n# Doppler shifts for each planet\ndelta_lambda_1 = 0.03  # Angstroms\ndelta_lambda_2 = 0.04  # Angstroms\n\n# The final derived formula for the temperature ratio is:\n# T_ratio = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2)\nT_ratio = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2)\n\nprint(T_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.5357142857142857\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.536. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.53\nB) ~ 1.05\nC) ~ 0.98\nD) ~ 1.30\n\nThe result matches option A most closely.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The goal is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n### Reasoning\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by:\n    `T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))`\n    where `T_star` is the star's effective temperature, `A` is the planet's albedo, `R_star` is the star's radius, and `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n2.  **Forming the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₂))]`\n    The problem states that both planets orbit the same star (so `T_star` and `R_star` are the same) and have the same albedo (`A₁ = A₂`). Therefore, these terms cancel out, leaving:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₁)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₂)) = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)`\n\n3.  **Relating Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data:** We don't have the semi-major axes (`a₁`, `a₂`) directly, but we can find their ratio using the provided radial velocity (RV) and mass data.\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** `P² ∝ a³`, where `P` is the orbital period. This means `(a₂ / a₁)^3 = (P₂ / P₁)^2`, or `a₂ / a₁ = (P₂ / P₁)^(2/3)`.\n    *   **Substituting into the temperature ratio:** `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt((P₂ / P₁)^(2/3)) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(-1/3)`.\n    *   **RV Semi-Amplitude (K):** For a circular orbit viewed nearly edge-on (sin(i) ≈ 1, as implied by transit detection), the maximum stellar wobble velocity `K` is related to the orbital period `P` and planet mass `M_p` by: `K ≈ (2πG / P)^(1/3) * M_p / M_star^(2/3)`.\n    *   **Solving for P:** Rearranging this gives `P ≈ (2πG * M_p³) / (K³ * M_star²)`.\n    *   **Period Ratio (P₁ / P₂):** Taking the ratio for the two planets, the constant terms (`2πG`, `M_star²`) cancel: `P₁ / P₂ = (M_p1³ / K₁³) / (M_p2³ / K₂³) = (M_p1 / M_p2)³ * (K₂ / K₁)³`.\n    *   **RV Amplitude Ratio (K₁ / K₂):** The Doppler shift formula is `Δλ / λ₀ = v / c`. The maximum shift corresponds to the velocity amplitude `K`. Thus, `K = c * Δλ_max / λ₀`. The ratio `K₁ / K₂` is `(c * Δλ₁ / λ₀) / (c * Δλ₂ / λ₀) = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂`.\n\n4.  **Final Combination:** Now substitute everything back into the temperature ratio equation:\n    *   `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (P₁ / P₂)^(-1/3)`\n    *   `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [ (M_p1 / M_p2)³ * (K₂ / K₁)³ ]^(-1/3)`\n    *   `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p1 / M_p2)^(-1) * (K₂ / K₁)^(-1) = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K₁ / K₂)`\n    *   Substitute the expression for K₁/K₂:\n        `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)`\n\n5.  **Calculation:** We can now plug in the given values:\n    *   M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n    *   M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n    *   Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å\n    *   Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04) = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4) = 15 / 28`\n\nThe calculation from the python code gives `15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`.\n\nComparing this result with the options:\nA) ~ 0.53\nB) ~ 1.05\nC) ~ 0.98\nD) ~ 1.30\n\nThe calculated value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<A>>>"
