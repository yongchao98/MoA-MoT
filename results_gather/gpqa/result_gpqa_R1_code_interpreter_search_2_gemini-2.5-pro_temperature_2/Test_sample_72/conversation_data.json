    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe question asks for two quantities for a system of two astronauts:\na) The relative speed ($v_{rel}$) between them.\nb) The total energy ($E$) of the system.\n\n**2. List the Given Information**\n\n*   **Astronaut 1:**\n    *   Mass ($m_1$) = 2m\n    *   Velocity ($v_1$) = 0.6c (in the positive x-direction)\n*   **Astronaut 2:**\n    *   Mass ($m_2$) = 3m\n    *   Velocity ($v_2$) = 0.5c (in the positive x-direction)\n*   c is the speed of light.\n\n**3. Plan the Calculation**\n\n*   **For Relative Speed:** Since the speeds are relativistic, I must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula to find the relative speed. The classical subtraction ($v_1 - v_2$) is not sufficient.\n*   **For Total Energy:** Since the astronauts are moving at relativistic speeds, their energy is not just kinetic energy but the total relativistic energy. The formula for the total energy of a single particle is $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor. The total energy of the system will be the sum of the individual total energies of each astronaut.\n\n---\n\n**4. Execute the Calculation for Relative Speed**\n\nThe formula for relative velocity in one dimension is:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nNow, substitute the given values:\n*   $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   $v_2 = 0.5c$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n$0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c$\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n$1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7$\n\nNow, calculate the final relative speed:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7} = \\frac{1}{7}c$\n\nTo compare with the options, convert the fraction to a decimal:\n$v_{rel} \\approx 0.1428... c$\nRounding to two decimal places, we get $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$.\n\n---\n\n**5. Execute the Calculation for Total Energy**\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual energies:\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$\n\nThe energy of a single particle is $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\n**Calculate the energy of Astronaut 1 ($E_1$):**\n*   $m_1 = 2m$\n*   $v_1 = 0.6c$\n\nFirst, find the Lorentz factor $\\gamma_1$:\n$\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n\nNow, calculate $E_1$:\n$E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m) \\times c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**Calculate the energy of Astronaut 2 ($E_2$):**\n*   $m_2 = 3m$\n*   $v_2 = 0.5c$\n\nFirst, find the Lorentz factor $\\gamma_2$:\n$\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5c)^2/c^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3/4}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}/2} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n\nNow, calculate $E_2$:\n$E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\times (3m) \\times c^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n\n**Calculate the Total Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n$E_{total} = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2$\n\nTo compare with the options, we need to calculate the numerical value of the coefficient. I will use a Python script for precision.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Part 1: Relative Speed\nv1 = 0.6\nv2 = 0.5\nv_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - v1 * v2)\nprint(f\"Relative speed: {v_rel:.2f}c\")\n\n# Part 2: Total Energy\n# Coefficient for astronaut 1\ngamma1 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v1**2)\nenergy1_coeff = gamma1 * 2  # for mass 2m\n\n# Coefficient for astronaut 2\ngamma2 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v2**2)\nenergy2_coeff = gamma2 * 3  # for mass 3m\n\n# Total energy coefficient\ntotal_energy_coeff = energy1_coeff + energy2_coeff\nprint(f\"Total energy: {total_energy_coeff:.2f}mc^2\")\n```\nRelative speed: 0.14c\nTotal energy: 5.96mc^2\n\n---\n**6. Conclude and Select the Answer**\n\nThe calculations yield:\n*   Relative speed: $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$\n*   Total energy: $E \\approx 5.96 mc^2$\n\nThese results match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem requires the application of the principles of special relativity to calculate the relative speed between two objects and the total energy of the system.\n\n**1. Calculation of Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\nSince the speeds are relativistic, we cannot simply subtract them. We must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula for velocities in the same direction:\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nGiven:\n*   $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   $v_2 = 0.5c$\n\nSubstitute the values into the formula:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.1428... c$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n**2. Calculation of Total Energy ($E$)**\n\nThe total energy of a single particle moving at a relativistic speed is given by $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$, where $m_0$ is the rest mass and $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the total energies of the two astronauts ($E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$).\n\n**For astronaut 1:**\n*   Rest mass $m_1 = 2m$\n*   Velocity $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   Lorentz factor $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n*   Energy $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m)c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**For astronaut 2:**\n*   Rest mass $m_2 = 3m$\n*   Velocity $v_2 = 0.5c$\n*   Lorentz factor $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}/2} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 1.1547$\n*   Energy $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\times (3m)c^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2 \\approx 3.464 mc^2$\n\n**Total Energy of the system:**\n*   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2 = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2$\n*   $E_{total} \\approx (2.5 + 3.464) mc^2 \\approx 5.964 mc^2$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mcÂ²**.\n\nComparing these results to the options provided:\n*   $v_{rel} \\approx 0.14c$\n*   $E \\approx 5.96 mc^2$\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
