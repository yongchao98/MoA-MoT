    "*   **Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark feature of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The peak is very broad due to strong hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules. While alcohols also have O-H stretches, they are typically less broad and centered higher, around 3200-3600 cm⁻¹. The position at 3000 cm⁻¹ overlapping with C-H stretches is characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Given the O-H evidence, this is most likely the C=O stretch of the carboxylic acid group, which typically appears at 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, which is usually found between 1620-1680 cm⁻¹.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** This is a definitive confirmation of the presence of a C=C double bond (an alkene) in the molecule. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons directly attached to the carbons of a double bond.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a crucial piece of evidence. We need to identify a common fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45. The most likely candidate is the carboxylium ion, [COOH]⁺. Its mass is calculated as: 12.01 (C) + 16.00 (O) + 16.00 (O) + 1.01 (H) ≈ 45. This fragment is very common in the mass spectra of carboxylic acids.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information:**\n    *   From the combined data, we can confidently identify two functional groups in the unknown compound: a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** and an **alkene (C=C)**.\n    *   The presence of a carboxylic acid group means the molecule must contain **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and D (C6H10O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are now left with two choices: **B) C6H12O2** and **C) C6H10O2**.\n\n5.  **Use the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C - H/2 + 1 (for a formula CₓHᵧ). Oxygen atoms do not affect this calculation.\n    *   Our identified functional groups require two degrees of unsaturation: one for the C=O bond in the carboxylic acid and one for the C=C bond in the alkene. So, the correct formula must have a DoU of 2.\n    *   Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **For B) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**. This formula only has one degree of unsaturation. It can account for the carboxylic acid's C=O bond, but not the additional C=C double bond. An example would be hexanoic acid, which is saturated.\n        *   **For C) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**. This formula has two degrees of unsaturation, which perfectly matches our requirement for one C=O bond and one C=C bond. An example structure would be one of the hexenoic acids.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    All pieces of spectral evidence point towards an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The formula C6H10O2 is the only one that accommodates a carboxylic acid functional group (two oxygens) and has the correct degree of unsaturation (DoU = 2) to include an additional C=C double bond.\n\n<<<C>>>"
