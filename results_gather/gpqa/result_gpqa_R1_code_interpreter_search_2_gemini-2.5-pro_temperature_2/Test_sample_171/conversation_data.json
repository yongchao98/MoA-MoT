    "This problem requires applying the Boltzmann equation to relate the populations of atomic energy levels to the temperature of the stars.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics:** The question relates the \"excitation\" of iron atoms to the temperatures of two stars. The key physical principle governing the population of atomic energy levels in a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) is the **Boltzmann distribution**.\n\n2.  **State the Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms ($N_b$) in an excited state with energy $E_b$ to the number of atoms ($N_a$) in a lower energy state with energy $E_a$:\n\n    $ \\frac{N_b}{N_a} = \\frac{g_b}{g_a} e^{ \\left( - \\frac{E_b - E_a}{k_B T} \\right) } $\n\n    Where:\n    *   $N_b/N_a$ is the ratio of populations of the two states. This ratio can be considered a measure of \"excitation\".\n    *   $g_b$ and $g_a$ are the statistical weights of the energy levels (constants for a given transition).\n    *   $\\Delta E = E_b - E_a$ is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Apply the Equation to Both Stars:** We can write the Boltzmann equation for each star, using their respective temperatures, $T_1$ and $T_2$.\n\n    *   For star 1 (temperature $T_1$):\n        $ \\left( \\frac{N_b}{N_a} \\right)_1 = \\frac{g_b}{g_a} e^{ \\left( - \\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B T_1} \\right) } $\n\n    *   For star 2 (temperature $T_2$):\n        $ \\left( \\frac{N_b}{N_a} \\right)_2 = \\frac{g_b}{g_a} e^{ \\left( - \\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B T_2} \\right) } $\n\n4.  **Use the Information from the Problem:** The problem states that the excitation in star 1 is twice that in star 2. This means:\n\n    $ \\left( \\frac{N_b}{N_a} \\right)_1 = 2 \\times \\left( \\frac{N_b}{N_a} \\right)_2 $\n\n    Substituting the Boltzmann expressions into this relation gives:\n\n    $ \\frac{g_b}{g_a} e^{ \\left( - \\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B T_1} \\right) } = 2 \\times \\frac{g_b}{g_a} e^{ \\left( - \\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B T_2} \\right) } $\n\n5.  **Solve the Equation:**\n    *   First, cancel the constant term $\\frac{g_b}{g_a}$ from both sides:\n        $ e^{ \\left( - \\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B T_1} \\right) } = 2 \\cdot e^{ \\left( - \\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B T_2} \\right) } $\n\n    *   To solve for the temperatures, take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n        $ \\ln \\left( e^{ \\left( - \\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B T_1} \\right) } \\right) = \\ln \\left( 2 \\cdot e^{ \\left( - \\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B T_2} \\right) } \\right) $\n\n    *   Using the logarithm properties $\\ln(e^x) = x$ and $\\ln(a \\cdot b) = \\ln(a) + \\ln(b)$:\n        $ - \\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B T_1} = \\ln(2) - \\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B T_2} $\n\n    *   Rearrange the equation to group the temperature terms:\n        $ \\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B T_2} - \\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B T_1} = \\ln(2) $\n\n    *   Factor out the common term $\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B}$:\n        $ \\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B} \\left( \\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1} \\right) = \\ln(2) $\n\n    *   Combine the fractions inside the parenthesis:\n        $ \\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1} = \\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} $\n\n    *   Substitute this back into the equation:\n        $ \\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B} \\left( \\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \\right) = \\ln(2) $\n\n6.  **Use the Given Numerical Values:**\n    *   The energy difference is $\\Delta E \\approx 1.38 \\times 10^{-23}$ J.\n    *   The Boltzmann constant is $k_B \\approx 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}$ J/K.\n\n    The question provides the energy difference value with a precision that strongly suggests it is numerically equal to the Boltzmann constant. Let's calculate the ratio:\n    $ \\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B} = \\frac{1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J}}{1.380649 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J/K}} \\approx 0.9995 \\text{ K} $\n    \n    Given the wording \"approximately\", we can conclude that the problem intends for this ratio to be treated as exactly 1.\n    \n    So, let's set $\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B} = 1$. The units of this constant are Kelvin (K). The units of the term $(\\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2})$ are $\\frac{\\text{K}}{\\text{K}^2} = \\frac{1}{\\text{K}}$. The product is dimensionless, matching the dimensionless nature of $\\ln(2)$.\n\n7.  **Final Equation:** Substituting $\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B} = 1$ into our derived equation, we get:\n\n    $ 1 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \\right) = \\ln(2) $\n\n    $ \\ln(2) = \\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} $\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:** This result matches option A.\n\n    *   A) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]  -> **Correct**\n    *   B) ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]  -> Incorrect\n    *   C) ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1] -> Incorrect\n    *   D) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ] -> Incorrect\n\n<<<A>>>"
