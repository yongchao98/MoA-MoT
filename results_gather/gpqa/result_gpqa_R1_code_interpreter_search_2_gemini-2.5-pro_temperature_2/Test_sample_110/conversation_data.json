    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### Reaction 1 Analysis:\n**Reaction:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK as base.\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reagents:**\n    *   **Ketone:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This is the nucleophile precursor. Let's analyze its structure:\n        *   It's a six-membered ring (cyclohexane) with a carbonyl group (=O) at position C1.\n        *   At position C2, there is an ethyl group (-CH2CH3) and a methyl group (-CH3). This carbon is a quaternary center.\n        *   At position C6, there is a methyl group (-CH3). This carbon is a tertiary center.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester and will act as the electrophile.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, bulky, non-nucleophilic base.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Type:**\n    *   The reaction between a ketone (after deprotonation) and an α,β-unsaturated compound in the presence of a base is a **Michael Addition**.\n\n3.  **Formation of the Enolate (Nucleophile):**\n    *   The base (t-BuOK) removes an acidic α-proton from the ketone to form an enolate anion.\n    *   The α-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   The carbon at position C2 is quaternary (bonded to an ethyl, a methyl, C1, and C3), so it has **no α-protons**.\n    *   The carbon at position C6 is tertiary and has one α-proton.\n    *   Therefore, the base can only deprotonate the C6 position. This means the enolate formation is **regiospecific**.\n    *   The enolate formed will have a double bond between C1 and C6.\n\n4.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The C6 of the enolate is the nucleophilic center and attacks the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (the CH₂ of the CH₂=CH part).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The resulting enolate from the acrylate part is then protonated (e.g., during aqueous workup or by t-butanol formed in situ) to give the final neutral product.\n\n5.  **Structure of Product A:**\n    *   Starting Ketone's C6: Bonded to C1, C5, one -CH₃ group, and one -H atom.\n    *   After the reaction, the C6 is now bonded to C1, C5, one -CH₃ group, and the new ` -CH₂-CH₂-COOEt ` group. The C6 atom becomes a quaternary center.\n    *   The skeleton of the product is 6-(2-(ethoxycarbonyl)ethyl)-2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n6.  **Naming Product A:**\n    *   According to IUPAC nomenclature rules, when a chain contains a principal functional group (ester > ketone), the chain is treated as the parent. So we will name the product as a derivative of ethyl propanoate.\n    *   Parent chain: ethyl propanoate (`-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`). The ethyl group is from the ester part. The propanoate is a 3-carbon chain.\n    *   A large substituent (the cyclohexanone ring) is attached to C3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   To name the cyclohexyl substituent, its point of attachment is designated as position 1.\n    *   Let's re-number the ring for naming purposes, with the point of attachment being C1 (this was C6 in the original ketone):\n        *   **New C1 (Old C6):** Attached to the propanoate chain and has a **methyl group**.\n        *   **New C2 (Old C1):** Has the **oxo (=O)** group.\n        *   **New C3 (Old C2):** Has an **ethyl group** and a **methyl group**.\n        *   New C4, C5, C6 (Old C3, C4, C5) are CH₂ groups.\n    *   Now, we assemble the name of the substituent alphabetically: `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   The full name of Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction 2 Analysis:\n**Reaction:** 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile in the presence of KOH and H₂O.\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reagents:**\n    *   **Nitroalkane:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂-NO₂). This will be the nucleophile precursor.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN), also known as trans-crotononitrile. This is the electrophile.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n    *   **Solvent:** Water (H₂O), which also serves as a proton source for the final step.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Type:**\n    *   This is a **nitro-Michael Addition**, a variant of the Michael addition where the nucleophile is a nitronate anion derived from a nitroalkane.\n\n3.  **Formation of the Nitronate Anion (Nucleophile):**\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (the carbon bonded to the -NO₂ group).\n    *   `CH₃CH₂CH₂-NO₂ + OH⁻  ⇌  CH₃CH₂CH⁻-NO₂  (nitronate) + H₂O`\n    *   The nitronate anion is resonance-stabilized and is nucleophilic at the carbon atom.\n\n4.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon of the nitronate (`CH₃CH₂CH⁻-NO₂`) attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (the `CH` carbon bonded to the methyl group).\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n    *   The resulting carbanion on the α-carbon of the nitrile is then protonated by water.\n\n5.  **Structure of Product B:**\n    *   The new C-C bond connects the `CH(NO₂)CH₂CH₃` fragment to the `CH(CH₃)` carbon of the original nitrile.\n    *   The structure is: `NC-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(NO₂)-CH₂-CH₃`.\n\n6.  **Naming Product B:**\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so the compound is named as a substituted nitrile.\n    *   Find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1:\n        `NC(1) - C(2)H₂ - C(3)H(CH₃) - C(4)H(NO₂) - C(5)H₂ - C(6)H₃`\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Identify the substituents and their positions:\n        *   A methyl group (-CH₃) at position C3.\n        *   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position C4.\n    *   Putting it all together alphabetically, the full name of Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect B)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A and B)\n*   **C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Correct A and B)**\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A)\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
