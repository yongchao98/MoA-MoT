    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's draw its structure and analyze the positions of the substituents:\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at C3.\n\nThe substituents are arranged in a 1,2,3- (or vicinal) pattern on the benzene ring.\n\nLet's consider the directing effects of these groups in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy)**: Strongly activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-Butyl)**: Moderately activating, ortho-, para-director.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, meta-director.\n\nThe relationship between the groups is as follows:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are ortho to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are ortho to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are meta to each other.\n\nSynthesizing a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring with these groups is challenging due to conflicting directing effects. For example, if we have 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene and try to nitrate it, both the -OEt and -tBu groups will direct the incoming nitro group to positions 4 and 6, not position 3. Therefore, a straightforward sequence of substitutions is unlikely to work, and we must look for a more complex route involving functional group conversions or blocking groups.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Options**\n\nWe will now analyze each provided reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ...**\n    *   Step i: Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n    *   Step ii: Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n    *   Step iii: Aniline + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3. This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring. This makes Option D incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ; ...**\n    *   Step i: Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene.\n    *   Step ii: Nitration → Mixture of o/p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   Step iii: Sulfonation.\n    *   Step iv: Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl). This reaction requires an amino group (-NH2), but at this stage of the synthesis, no amino group is present. This makes Option C incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; ...**\n    *   This sequence uses a sulfonyl group, likely as a blocking group, which is a common strategy for complex syntheses.\n    *   i) Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene.\n    *   ii) Sulfonation → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid (the para position is blocked).\n    *   iii) Nitration → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid (the nitro group is directed ortho to the -tBu group).\n    *   iv) Reduction (Fe/HCl) → 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n    *   v) Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) → Creates a diazonium salt from the amino group.\n    *   vi) HNO3/H2SO4. This step applies a nitrating mixture to a diazonium salt. This is not a standard synthetic step; diazonium salts are highly unstable and reactive intermediates, and trying to perform an electrophilic aromatic substitution on this species is nonsensical. The sequence of subsequent steps (hydrolysis, desulfonation, etherification) is also in an illogical order. This makes Option B incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; ...**\n    *   This option presents a series of plausible functional group interconversions. Let's analyze the pathway.\n    *   i) Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene.\n    *   ii) Nitration gives a mixture of ortho- and para-nitro-tert-butylbenzene. While the para isomer is the major product due to sterics, a high-yield synthesis might involve efficient separation, so we consider the possibility of using the minor ortho-isomer. Let's follow the path of the ortho-isomer, as it has the required 1,2-relationship between the t-Bu and a nitrogen-containing group.\n    *   Intermediate: **2-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n    *   iii) Reduction (Fe/HCl) → **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   iv) Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4). This is the critical step. In the strong acid, the amine is protonated (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. The tert-butyl group is an ortho,para-director. The directing effects are conflicting. Based on standard electronic and steric effects, this reaction should yield primarily 2-tert-butyl-4-nitroaniline, not the required 3-nitro isomer. However, compared to the definitive errors in options B, C, and D (impossible reactions, nonsensical steps), this regioselectivity issue in A is the most \"subtle\" flaw. Let's assume, for the sake of finding the \"best\" answer among flawed options, that the desired **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline** could be formed.\n    *   v) Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) of the amino group. → 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenediazonium salt.\n    *   vi) Hydrolysis (H3O+, H2O/Heat) replaces the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH). → **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    *   vii) Williamson Ether Synthesis (NaOH/EtBr) converts the phenol to an ether. → **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. This yields the target molecule.\n    *   The final two steps in option A (viii, ix) are sulfonation followed by desulfonation, which are redundant and nonsensical at the end of the synthesis. They seem to be extraneous additions to the sequence.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOptions C and D contain fundamentally flawed steps that are chemically impossible under the given conditions. Option B has a chemically nonsensical step and an illogical sequence. Option A presents a logically flowing sequence of transformations that, with the exception of one questionable regiochemical outcome (step iv) and two redundant steps at the end, correctly connects the starting material to the final product. By elimination, Option A is the most plausible choice among the given flawed options.\n\n<<<A>>>"
