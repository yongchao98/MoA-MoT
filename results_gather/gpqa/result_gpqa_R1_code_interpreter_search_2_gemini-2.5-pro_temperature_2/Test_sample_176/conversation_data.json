    "To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we will use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for black body radiation. The distracting information, such as the masses of the stars and the radial velocity of Star_1 being zero, should be handled carefully.\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star that radiates as a perfect black body is given by:\n    `L = 4 * π * R^2 * σ * T^4`\n    where:\n    *   `R` is the star's radius.\n    *   `T` is the star's effective surface temperature.\n    *   `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio:** We want to find the ratio `L_1 / L_2`.\n    `L_1 / L_2 = (4 * π * R_1^2 * σ * T_1^4) / (4 * π * R_2^2 * σ * T_2^4)`\n    Simplifying, we get:\n    `L_1 / L_2 = (R_1 / R_2)^2 * (T_1 / T_2)^4`\n\n3.  **Radius Ratio:** The problem states that `R_1 = 1.5 * R_2`.\n    Therefore, `(R_1 / R_2) = 1.5`.\n\n4.  **Temperature Ratio (The complex part):**\n    *   We are told that the stars \"appeared brightest\" at the same wavelength. This refers to the observed peak wavelength (`λ_obs_max`). So, `λ_obs_max_1 = λ_obs_max_2`.\n    *   The star's temperature is related to its *emitted* peak wavelength (`λ_em_max`) by Wien's Displacement Law: `λ_em_max * T = b`, where `b` is a constant. This means `T` is inversely proportional to `λ_em_max`.\n    *   The observed wavelength is affected by the Doppler shift due to the star's radial velocity. The relationship between the observed and emitted wavelength is given by the relativistic Doppler effect formula:\n        `λ_obs = λ_em * sqrt((1 + β) / (1 - β))` for a receding object, where `β = v/c`. By convention, a positive radial velocity indicates the object is receding.\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity is 0, so `β_1 = 0`. This means its observed peak wavelength is equal to its emitted peak wavelength: `λ_obs_max_1 = λ_em_max_1`.\n    *   For Star_2, the radial velocity is `v_2 = 700 km/s`. We calculate `β_2 = v_2 / c`. The observed peak wavelength is shifted: `λ_obs_max_2 = λ_em_max_2 * sqrt((1 + β_2) / (1 - β_2))`.\n    *   Since `λ_obs_max_1 = λ_obs_max_2`, we have:\n        `λ_em_max_1 = λ_em_max_2 * sqrt((1 + β_2) / (1 - β_2))`\n    *   Now, we can find the ratio of the true temperatures, `T_1 / T_2`.\n        `T_1 / T_2 = (b / λ_em_max_1) / (b / λ_em_max_2) = λ_em_max_2 / λ_em_max_1`\n        Substituting the expression for `λ_em_max_1`:\n        `T_1 / T_2 = λ_em_max_2 / (λ_em_max_2 * sqrt((1 + β_2) / (1 - β_2)))`\n        `T_1 / T_2 = 1 / sqrt((1 + β_2) / (1 - β_2)) = sqrt((1 - β_2) / (1 + β_2))`\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Now we substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    `L_1 / L_2 = (1.5)^2 * (sqrt((1 - β_2) / (1 + β_2)))^4`\n    `L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 * ((1 - β_2) / (1 + β_2))^2`\n\n    We will now use a Python script to compute the precise value of this expression.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv2 = 700.0  # km/s, radial velocity of Star_2\nc = 299792.458  # km/s, speed of light\n\n# Calculate beta\nbeta = v2 / c\n\n# Calculate the luminosity ratio\n# L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\n# R1/R2 = 1.5\n# T1/T2 = sqrt((1 - beta) / (1 + beta))\nluminosity_ratio = (1.5**2) * (((1 - beta) / (1 + beta))**2)\n\nprint(luminosity_ratio)\n```\n\nThe computed luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~2.32\nB) ~2.35\nC) ~2.23\nD) ~2.25\n\nThe value `~2.229` is closest to `~2.23`.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem requires us to calculate the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2.\n\n**1. Identify Relevant Laws:**\n*   The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it's a black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:  `L = AσT⁴ = 4πR²σT⁴`, where R is the radius, T is the surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   The relationship between a star's surface temperature and the peak wavelength (λ_em_max) of its emitted radiation is given by Wien's Displacement Law: `λ_em_max * T = b`, where b is Wien's constant. This implies `T` is inversely proportional to `λ_em_max`.\n*   The observed wavelength (λ_obs_max) from a moving source is affected by the Doppler effect. The relativistic Doppler shift formula for an object moving with radial velocity `v` is `λ_obs = λ_em * √((1+β)/(1-β))`, where `β = v/c`. A positive velocity means the object is receding, and its light is redshifted (wavelength increases).\n\n**2. Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:**\nWe need to find the ratio `L_1 / L_2`.\n`L_1 / L_2 = (4πR_1²σT_1⁴) / (4πR_2²σT_2⁴)`\nThis simplifies to:\n`L_1 / L_2 = (R_1/R_2)² * (T_1/T_2)⁴`\n\n**3. Determine the Radius Ratio:**\nThe problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2: `R_1 = 1.5 * R_2`.\nTherefore, the radius ratio is `R_1 / R_2 = 1.5`.\n\n**4. Determine the Temperature Ratio:**\nThis is the most complex part, as it involves both Wien's Law and the Doppler effect.\n*   From Wien's Law, `T ∝ 1/λ_em_max`. So, the temperature ratio is `T_1 / T_2 = λ_em_max_2 / λ_em_max_1`.\n*   We are given that the stars have the same *observed* peak wavelength: `λ_obs_max_1 = λ_obs_max_2`.\n*   Now we must relate the observed wavelengths to the emitted wavelengths using the Doppler shift.\n    *   For Star_1: `v_1 = 0 km/s`, so `β_1 = 0`. There is no Doppler shift. `λ_obs_max_1 = λ_em_max_1`.\n    *   For Star_2: `v_2 = 700 km/s`. This is a positive radial velocity, meaning the star is receding. Its light is redshifted.\n        `β_2 = v_2 / c = 700 / 299792.458`.\n        `λ_obs_max_2 = λ_em_max_2 * √((1+β_2)/(1-β_2))`.\n*   Since `λ_obs_max_1 = λ_obs_max_2`, we can set their expressions equal:\n    `λ_em_max_1 = λ_em_max_2 * √((1+β_2)/(1-β_2))`\n*   Now we can find the ratio of emitted wavelengths, which we need for the temperature ratio:\n    `λ_em_max_2 / λ_em_max_1 = 1 / √((1+β_2)/(1-β_2)) = √((1-β_2)/(1+β_2))`\n*   Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n    `T_1 / T_2 = √((1-β_2)/(1+β_2))`\n\n**5. Combine and Calculate:**\nSubstitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n`L_1 / L_2 = (1.5)² * (√((1-β_2)/(1+β_2)))⁴`\n`L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 * ((1-β_2)/(1+β_2))²`\n\nThe provided information about the mass of the stars is extraneous and not needed for this calculation. Now we can compute the final value.\n\nThe Python code calculated this exact expression.\n\nThe output from the code is `2.22908325509156`.\n\nComparing this result to the options provided:\n*   A) ~2.32\n*   B) ~2.35\n*   C) ~2.23\n*   D) ~2.25\n\nThe calculated value `2.229...` rounds to `2.23`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
