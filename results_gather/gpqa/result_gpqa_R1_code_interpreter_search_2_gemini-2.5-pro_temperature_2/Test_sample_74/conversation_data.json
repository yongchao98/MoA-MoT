    "This is a molecular biology problem that requires analyzing a DNA sequence to troubleshoot a failed protein expression experiment.\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The user wants to express a recombinant mouse GADD45G protein in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The protein is designed with an N-terminal influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag for purification.\n2.  **Identify the Problem:** The experiment failed because the protein is not being overexpressed as expected.\n3.  **Analyze the Data:** The key piece of information is the DNA sequence of the construct:\n    `5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGC...`\n4.  **Deconstruct the Sequence:** A recombinant protein coding sequence typically starts with a start codon (ATG), followed by any tags, and then the gene of interest, ending with a stop codon.\n    *   **Start Codon:** The sequence begins with `ATG`, which codes for Methionine (M) and is the standard start codon. This is correct.\n    *   **HA Tag:** The problem states there is an N-terminal HA tag. The amino acid sequence for the HA tag is YPYDVPDYA. Let's translate the DNA sequence immediately following the ATG to see if it codes for the HA tag.\n        *   `ATG` -> M\n        *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n        *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n        *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n        *   `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n        *   `GTT` -> Valine (V)\n        *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n        *   `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n        *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n        *   `GCC` -> Alanine (A)\n        The translated sequence `MYPYDVPDYA` perfectly matches a protein starting with Methionine and followed by the HA tag. The DNA sequence `ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCC` is correct for this purpose.\n    *   **Post-Tag Sequence:** Now, we must examine the codons that come immediately after the HA tag sequence. The DNA sequence continues with `...ATTACGCC-AAA-TGA-CTC...`\n        *   `AAA` codes for Lysine (K).\n        *   `TGA` is one of the three standard stop codons (along with TAA and TAG).\n5.  **Synthesize the findings:** The translation of the construct will start at `ATG`, proceed through the HA tag sequence, add one Lysine residue, and then immediately encounter a `TGA` stop codon. The ribosome will detach at this point, terminating the synthesis of the protein. The resulting product would be a very short peptide (MYPYDVPDYAK) instead of the full-length GADD45G protein. This is a premature termination of translation.\n6.  **Evaluate the options:**\n    *   A) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain. While a linker can be important, its absence doesn't inherently cause proteolysis. The fundamental problem here is that the full protein is never even made.\n    *   B) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. As shown above, the DNA sequence for the HA tag is correct and does not contain a missense mutation.\n    *   C) The ribosome terminated the translation early. This is precisely what happened. The premature `TGA` stop codon caused the ribosome to fall off the mRNA, stopping translation before the GADD45G sequence could be read.\n    *   D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse. This is incorrect for two reasons. First, the stop codon in the sequence is `TGA`, not `TAA`. Second, stop codons are recognized by protein release factors, not tRNAs.\n\nThe correct explanation is the premature termination of translation due to an unintended stop codon in the sequence.\n\n<<<C>>>"
