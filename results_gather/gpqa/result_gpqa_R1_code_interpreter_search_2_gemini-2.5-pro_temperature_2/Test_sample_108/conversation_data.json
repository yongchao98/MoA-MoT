    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the non-permitted partial wave.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Initial State\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. The notation is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   `2S+1 = 1` => The total spin is `S(initial) = 0`.\n*   `L = S` => The orbital angular momentum is `L(initial) = 0`.\n*   `J = 0` => The total angular momentum is `J(initial) = 0`.\n*   The parity of the initial state is given by `P(initial) = (-1)^L(initial) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n*   Nucleons are fermions, so their combined wavefunction must be antisymmetric under particle exchange. The generalized Pauli exclusion principle states that `(-1)^(L+S+T) = -1`, where T is the total isospin.\n*   For the initial state, `L=0` and `S=0`. So, `(-1)^(0+0+T(initial)) = -1`, which implies `(-1)^T(initial) = -1`. Therefore, the isospin of the initial state must be odd. For a two-nucleon system, T can be 0 or 1, so `T(initial) = 1`.\n\n### 2. Define the Conservation Laws for the Decay\n\nThe decay process is `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X`.\nWe are given:\n*   The intrinsic parity of particle X is `P(X) = -1`.\n*   The final NN state has isospin `T(NN, final) = 0`.\n*   Let `l_X` be the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle X.\n*   The final NN state is described by `S(NN, final)`, `L(NN, final)`, and `J(NN, final)`.\n\nWe must apply three main rules:\n1.  **Pauli Principle for the Final State:** The problem states `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Since `T(NN, final) = 0`, this becomes `0 = S(NN, final) + L(NN, final) + 1 (mod 2)`. This requires the sum `S(NN, final) + L(NN, final)` to be **odd**.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum `J` must be conserved.\n    *   `J(initial) = 0`.\n    *   The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN angular momentum `J(NN, final)` and the angular momentum of particle X. Assuming particle X has no intrinsic spin (or it is not relevant to the partial wave `l_X`), its total angular momentum is just `l_X`.\n    *   So, `vec(J(initial)) = vec(J(NN, final)) + vec(l_X)`.\n    *   `0 = vec(J(NN, final)) + vec(l_X)`.\n    *   This implies `vec(J(NN, final)) = -vec(l_X)`, which means their magnitudes must be equal: `J(NN, final) = l_X`.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Parity:** The total parity must be conserved.\n    *   `P(initial) = +1`.\n    *   `P(final) = P(NN, final) * P(X) * (-1)^l_X`.\n    *   `P(NN, final) = (-1)^L(NN, final)`.\n    *   `P(X) = -1` (given).\n    *   The conservation equation is `+1 = (-1)^L(NN, final) * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`.\n    *   This simplifies to `+1 = -1 * (-1)^(L(NN, final) + l_X)`.\n    *   This requires `(-1)^(L(NN, final) + l_X) = -1`, which means the sum `L(NN, final) + l_X` must be **odd**.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\n\nLet's check each proposed decay against these three rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `2S+1=7` -> `S=3`; `L=D` -> `L=2`; `J=1`.\n*   Emitted particle `p`: `l_X=1`.\n*   **(Issue):** A two-nucleon system consists of two spin-1/2 particles. Their total spin can only be `S=0` or `S=1`. A state with `S=3` is physically impossible for two nucleons. Therefore, this decay is not permitted because the final state `7D1` cannot exist for an NN system.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `2S+1=3` -> `S=1`; `L=P` -> `L=1`; `J=0`.\n*   Emitted particle `s`: `l_X=0`.\n1.  **Pauli Principle:** `S+L = 1+1=2` (Even). For `T=0`, this sum must be odd. **This rule is violated.**\n2.  **J-Conservation:** `J = l_X`? `0 = 0`. (OK)\n3.  **Parity Conservation:** `L+l_X = 1+0=1` (Odd). (OK)\n*   The transition is not permitted because it violates the Pauli principle for a T=0 final state.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S=1`; `L=2`; `J=3`.\n*   Emitted particle `f`: `l_X=3`.\n1.  **Pauli Principle:** `S+L = 1+2=3` (Odd). (OK)\n2.  **J-Conservation:** `J = l_X`? `3 = 3`. (OK)\n3.  **Parity Conservation:** `L+l_X = 2+3=5` (Odd). (OK)\n*   This transition is permitted by all rules.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S=1`; `L=0`; `J=1`.\n*   Emitted particle `p`: `l_X=1`.\n1.  **Pauli Principle:** `S+L = 1+0=1` (Odd). (OK)\n2.  **J-Conservation:** `J = l_X`? `1 = 1`. (OK)\n3.  **Parity Conservation:** `L+l_X = 0+1=1` (Odd). (OK)\n*   This transition is permitted by all rules. (The final state is the deuteron, which has T=0).\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nBoth options A and B represent non-permitted transitions. However, they are forbidden for different reasons.\n*   Option A is forbidden because the final state `7D1` (`S=3`) cannot be formed by two nucleons. This is a fundamental impossibility of the state itself, independent of the reaction dynamics.\n*   Option B is forbidden because the final `NN` state `3P0` with `T=0` violates the generalized Pauli exclusion principle, which is one of the specific rules the question directs us to check.\n\nGiven the explicit instruction to use the Pauli statistics rule (`T = S+L+1 (mod 2)`), the question is most directly testing the application of this rule. Option B is the only one that fails this specific test. Option A fails on a more fundamental, implicit principle (the composition of angular momentum). In the context of selection rule problems, the intended answer is typically the one that violates the selection rules of the process. The failure in B is a violation of the Pauli rule for the given final state conditions.\n\nTherefore, `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is the non-permitted partial wave according to the rules of the problem.\n\n<<<B>>>"
