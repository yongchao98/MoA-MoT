    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the standard enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) of the given compound, (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. The enthalpy of formation is the enthalpy change when one mole of a compound is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states.\n\nThe overall reaction for the formation of the compound is:\n12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nWe can calculate the enthalpy of formation using a Hess's law cycle that involves the atomization of reactants and products. The formula is:\nΔH_f = [Σ (Enthalpy of atomization of elements)] - [Enthalpy of atomization of the compound]\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula and count the bonds.**\n\nLet's analyze the structure of the molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2 to count the number of atoms and the types of bonds.\n- The structure contains a main carbon chain and several methyl (-CH3) side groups.\n- Let's count the carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms:\n    - `(CH3)2C`: 1 C in the chain, 2 C and 6 H in the two methyl groups.\n    - `CH`: 1 C and 1 H.\n    - `CH2`: 1 C and 2 H.\n    - `CH(CH3)`: 1 C and 1 H in the chain, 1 C and 3 H in the methyl group.\n    - `CH2`: 1 C and 2 H.\n    - `CH`: 1 C and 1 H.\n    - `C(CH3)2`: 1 C in the chain, 2 C and 6 H in the two methyl groups.\n- Total Carbon atoms = 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 12 C atoms.\n- Total Hydrogen atoms = 6 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 H atoms.\n- The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\nNow, let's count the bonds:\n- **C-H bonds**: Equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n- **C=C double bonds**: There are two `C=C` groups in the structure. So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n- **C-C single bonds**:\n    - Bonds within the main chain: C=C-C-C-C-C=C. There are 4 single bonds in the chain.\n    - Bonds connecting the methyl groups to the chain: There are 5 methyl groups ((CH3)2..., -CH(CH3)-, ...C(CH3)2), so there are **5 C-C bonds** to the branches.\n    - Total C-C single bonds = 4 + 5 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound (ΔH_atom(compound)).**\n\nThis is the total energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the gaseous compound. It's the sum of the bond energies of all the bonds in the molecule.\nGiven bond energies:\n- C-H = 400 kJ/mol\n- C-C = 200 kJ/mol\n- C=C = 300 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_atom(C12H22) = (No. C-C bonds × BE_C-C) + (No. C=C bonds × BE_C=C) + (No. C-H bonds × BE_C-H)\nΔH_atom(C12H22) = (9 × 200) + (2 × 300) + (22 × 400)\nΔH_atom(C12H22) = 1800 + 600 + 8800\nΔH_atom(C12H22) = **11200 kJ/mol**\n(Note: This matches option C, but it's an intermediate value, not the final answer for enthalpy of formation).\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Total Enthalpy of Atomization of the Elements (ΣΔH_atom(elements)).**\n\nThis is the energy required to convert the elements from their standard states (C(s) and H2(g)) to gaseous atoms (C(g) and H(g)).\nThe formation requires 12 moles of C atoms and 22 moles of H atoms.\n- Reactants are 12 C(s) and 11 H2(g).\n- Products are 12 C(g) and 22 H(g).\n\nGiven data:\n- Enthalpy of atomization of carbon (C(s) → C(g)), ΔH_atom(C) = 1000 kJ/mol.\n- Bond energy of H-H (H2(g) → 2H(g)), BE(H-H) = 100 kJ/mol.\n\nEnergy for atomizing 12 moles of Carbon = 12 mol × ΔH_atom(C) = 12 × 1000 = 12000 kJ.\nEnergy for atomizing 11 moles of H2 = 11 mol × BE(H-H) = 11 × 100 = 1100 kJ.\n\nTotal enthalpy of atomization of elements = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f).**\n\nΔH_f = ΣΔH_atom(elements) - ΔH_atom(compound)\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol\nΔH_f = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**Step 5: Compare the result with the given options.**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. The options are:\nA) 67.4 kJ/mol\nB) 11.44 kJ/g\nC) 11200 kJ/mol\nD) 1900 kJ/g\n\nOur calculated value doesn't match options A or C directly. Options B and D are given in kJ/g, so we need to convert our result to these units.\n\nMolar Mass of C12H22:\nM = 12 × (atomic mass of C) + 22 × (atomic mass of H)\nM = 12 × 12.011 g/mol + 22 × 1.008 g/mol ≈ 166.3 g/mol.\nFor simplicity, we can use M ≈ 12*12 + 22*1 = 166 g/mol.\n\nEnthalpy of formation in kJ/g = (Enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol) / (Molar mass in g/mol)\nΔH_f (kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol ≈ **11.445 kJ/g**.\n\nThis value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
