    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the total energy of the relativistic system.**\n    In special relativity, the total energy of a particle is given by $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $m$ is the rest mass, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor. This total energy includes the rest energy $mc^2$ and the kinetic energy $K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$.\n\n    For our harmonic oscillator system, the total energy of the system ($E_{total}$) must also include the potential energy $U(x)$ stored in the spring. The potential energy for a spring force $F = -kx$ is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, assuming $U(0)=0$.\n\n    Therefore, the total conserved energy of the system at any point in its oscillation is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x) = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n2.  **Apply the principle of conservation of energy.**\n    The total energy of the isolated system is constant. We can equate the total energy at two specific points in the oscillation:\n    *   **At the point of maximum amplitude (turning point):**\n        Here, the displacement is maximum, $x = A$. At the turning point, the mass momentarily comes to a stop, so its velocity is $v = 0$.\n        The total energy at this point is:\n        $E_{total, A} = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n    *   **At the equilibrium position:**\n        Here, the displacement is zero, $x = 0$. The potential energy is minimum ($U(0) = 0$), and thus the kinetic energy and speed are maximum. Let's call this maximum speed $v_{max}$.\n        The total energy at this point is:\n        $E_{total, 0} = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} + \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n3.  **Equate the energies and solve for $v_{max}$.**\n    According to the conservation of energy, $E_{total, A} = E_{total, 0}$.\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n    Now, we rearrange the equation to solve for $v_{max}$:\n    *   Divide both sides by $mc^2$:\n        $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n    *   To isolate the term with $v_{max}$, we can take the reciprocal of both sides:\n        $\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}}$\n\n    *   Square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n        $\\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2} = 1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$\n\n    *   Rearrange the terms to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    *   Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n        $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n4.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The derived expression for $v_{max}$ is:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n    This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
