    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the Mass Dimension of the Lagrangian Density**\n\nIn natural units, where $\\hbar=c=1$, mass has a dimension of +1, and length and time have a dimension of -1. The action, $S$, is a dimensionless quantity:\n$S = \\int d^4x \\mathcal{L}$\nThe dimension of the four-volume element $d^4x$ is $[d^4x] = [\\text{length}]^4 = -4$ in mass dimension.\nSince the action $S$ must be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ must have a mass dimension of +4 to cancel the -4 from $d^4x$.\nSo, $[\\mathcal{L}]_M = 4$.\n\n**2. Determine the Mass Dimensions of the Fields**\n\nTo find the mass dimension of the individual components of the interaction Lagrangian, we analyze the standard kinetic terms for the fermion and gauge fields.\n\n*   **Fermion Field ($\\psi$):** The kinetic term for a fermion field is $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{fermion}} = \\bar{\\psi}(i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu - m)\\psi$.\n    The entire term must have a mass dimension of 4. Let's look at the derivative term, $\\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu \\psi$.\n    *   The derivative operator $\\partial_\\mu = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^\\mu}$ has a mass dimension of +1, since $x^\\mu$ has a mass dimension of -1. So, $[\\partial_\\mu]_M = 1$.\n    *   The gamma matrices $\\gamma^\\mu$ are dimensionless constant matrices. So, $[\\gamma^\\mu]_M = 0$.\n    *   The dimensions must satisfy: $[\\bar{\\psi}]_M + [\\psi]_M + [\\partial_\\mu]_M = 4$.\n    *   Since $[\\bar{\\psi}]_M = [\\psi]_M$, we have $2[\\psi]_M + 1 = 4$.\n    *   Solving for $[\\psi]_M$, we get $2[\\psi]_M = 3$, which means $[\\psi]_M = 3/2$.\n\n*   **Gauge Field Strength Tensor ($F^{\\mu\\nu}$):** The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{gauge}} = -\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\n    *   Again, this term must have a mass dimension of 4: $[F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4$.\n    *   This implies $2[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4$, so the mass dimension of the field strength tensor is $[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 2$.\n    *   Note: The field strength tensor is defined as $F_{\\mu\\nu} = \\partial_\\mu A_\\nu - \\partial_\\nu A_\\mu$, where $A_\\mu$ is the vector potential. From this, we can find the dimension of $A_\\mu$: $[F_{\\mu\\nu}]_M = [\\partial_\\mu]_M + [A_\\nu]_M \\Rightarrow 2 = 1 + [A_\\nu]_M \\Rightarrow [A_\\nu]_M=1$. This is consistent.\n\n*   **Sigma Tensor ($\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$):** The tensor $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$ is defined as $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{i}{2}[\\gamma_\\mu, \\gamma_\\nu]$.\n    *   Since the gamma matrices $\\gamma_\\mu$ are dimensionless, their commutator is also dimensionless.\n    *   Therefore, $[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 0$.\n\n**3. Calculate the Mass Dimension of the Coupling Constant ($\\kappa$)**\n\nNow we analyze the given interaction Lagrangian: $\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\nLike any other term in the Lagrangian density, this term must have a mass dimension of 4.\n$[\\mathcal{L}_{int}]_M = [\\kappa]_M + [\\bar{\\psi}]_M + [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M + [\\psi]_M + [F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4$.\n\nSubstituting the dimensions we found:\n$[\\kappa]_M + (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2 = 4$\n$[\\kappa]_M + 3 + 2 = 4$\n$[\\kappa]_M + 5 = 4$\n$[\\kappa]_M = -1$\n\nSo, the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$ is -1.\n\n**4. Determine if the Theory is Renormalizable**\n\nThe renormalizability of a quantum field theory can be determined by power-counting, which relates to the mass dimension of its coupling constants.\n*   **Super-renormalizable:** All coupling constants have a positive mass dimension.\n*   **Renormalizable:** All coupling constants have a zero mass dimension (they are dimensionless).\n*   **Non-renormalizable:** At least one coupling constant has a negative mass dimension.\n\nIn this case, the coupling constant $\\kappa$ has a mass dimension of -1. A negative mass dimension implies that when we calculate loop diagrams in perturbation theory, higher-order corrections will have increasingly severe ultraviolet divergences. To cancel these divergences, an infinite number of counter-terms would be required, making the theory lose its predictive power. Such theories are called non-renormalizable. They can still be useful as effective field theories at energies much lower than the scale set by the coupling constant (i.e., at energies $E \\ll 1/|\\kappa|$).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   The mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is $[\\kappa]_M = -1$.\n*   Because the coupling constant has a negative mass dimension, the theory is not renormalizable.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
