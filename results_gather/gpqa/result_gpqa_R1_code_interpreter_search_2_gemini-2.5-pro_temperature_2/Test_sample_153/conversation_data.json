    "*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the molecule with the most common isotopes.\n    *   There is another peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with an intensity of about one-third of the M+ peak (32% is roughly 1/3 of 100%).\n    *   This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a hallmark signature for a compound containing a single chlorine atom, due to the natural abundance of the ³⁵Cl (~75%) and ³⁷Cl (~25%) isotopes.\n    *   Let's check the molecular weight of the proposed structures. We will calculate the mass using the most common isotopes (¹²C, ¹H, ¹⁶O, ³⁵Cl). The molecular formula for all options A, B, C, and D is C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   Mass = (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 amu.\n    *   All four options are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is in the typical range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid, especially when it is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   This IR data strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This rules out option B (Phenyl chloroformate, an acid chloride derivative) and option D (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, which is a phenol and an aldehyde). Phenyl chloroformate would have a C=O stretch at a much higher wavenumber (~1785 cm⁻¹), and the aldehyde would have a C=O stretch closer to 1700 cm⁻¹ and would lack the extremely broad O-H of a carboxylic acid dimer. Both A and C are carboxylic acids and are consistent with the IR data.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** The chemical shift is very far downfield (>10 ppm). This is the classic region for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). The signal is a singlet because this proton is not coupled to any adjacent protons. It integrates to one proton. This further confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid group.\n    *   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):** There are a total of 4 aromatic protons (2H + 2H = 4H). The signals are two distinct doublets, with each doublet representing two equivalent protons. This simple A₂B₂ splitting pattern (or AA'BB' to be more precise) is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n        *   In a para-substituted ring, the two protons on one side of the axis of symmetry are equivalent to the two on the other. For example, in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the two protons next to the -COOH group are equivalent and are split by their neighbors (the protons next to -Cl), resulting in a doublet. Likewise, the two protons next to the -Cl group are equivalent and are split by their neighbors (protons next to -COOH), resulting in another doublet.\n    *   Let's evaluate the remaining options based on the NMR splitting:\n        *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a 1,4-disubstituted ring, which would produce the observed pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H.\n        *   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a 1,2-disubstituted ring. This lack of symmetry would result in four different aromatic proton signals with more complex splitting (e.g., doublets, triplets, or doublets of doublets), not the simple two-doublet pattern observed.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   The MS data indicates a chlorinated compound with MW = 156.\n    *   The IR data points to a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The ¹H NMR data confirms the carboxylic acid and indicates a 1,4- (para) substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n    *   Only 4-chlorobenzoic acid (A) fits all the provided spectral data.\n\n<<<A>>>"
