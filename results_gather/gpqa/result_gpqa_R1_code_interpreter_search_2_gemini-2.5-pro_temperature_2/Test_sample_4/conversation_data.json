    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the operators**:\n    The problem provides the components of the operator $\\vec{P}$ along the x, y, and z axes. Let's write them down using the standard Pauli matrices notation.\n    The Pauli matrices are:\n    $\\sigma_x = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $\\sigma_y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $\\sigma_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    From the problem statement:\n    *   $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x$\n    *   $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\n    *   $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z$\n\n    This is the well-known spin angular momentum operator, $\\vec{S} = (S_x, S_y, S_z)$, for a spin-1/2 particle like a muon. So, $\\vec{P} = \\vec{S}$.\n\n2.  **Define the direction vector $\\vec{n}$**:\n    The problem states that the direction vector $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane. A general unit vector in 3D is given in spherical coordinates by $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the polar angle (angle with the z-axis) and $\\phi$ is the azimuthal angle (angle with the x-axis in the x-y plane).\n    For a vector in the x-z plane, its y-component is zero. This happens when $\\phi=0$.\n    So, the unit vector $\\vec{n}$ is:\n    $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos(0), \\sin\\theta \\sin(0), \\cos\\theta) = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n3.  **Construct the operator along the direction $\\vec{n}$**:\n    The operator for the spin component along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_{\\vec{n}} = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n    $P_{\\vec{n}} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n    $P_{\\vec{n}} = (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x) \\sin\\theta + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y) (0) + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z) \\cos\\theta$\n    $P_{\\vec{n}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (\\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta)$\n    Substituting the matrices:\n    $P_{\\vec{n}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right)$\n    $P_{\\vec{n}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Set up the eigenvalue equation**:\n    We need to find the eigenvector, let's call it $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$, that corresponds to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$.\n    The eigenvalue equation is $P_{\\vec{n}} |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$.\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n5.  **Solve for the eigenvector components**:\n    We can cancel the constant $\\hbar/2$ from both sides of the equation:\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    This matrix equation gives us a system of two linear equations:\n    1)  $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n    2)  $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\n    Let's rearrange the first equation:\n    $b \\sin\\theta = a - a \\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    Now, we use the half-angle trigonometric identities: $\\sin\\theta = 2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)$ and $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)$.\n    $b [2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)] = a [2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)]$\n    Assuming $\\theta$ is not 0 or $2\\pi$ (in which case $\\sin(\\theta/2)$ would be zero), we can divide both sides by $2 \\sin(\\theta/2)$:\n    $b \\cos(\\theta/2) = a \\sin(\\theta/2)$\n    This equation gives the relationship between the components $a$ and $b$. We can express the eigenvector as being proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$ by choosing a proportionality constant such that $a = C \\cos(\\theta/2)$ and $b = C \\sin(\\theta/2)$.\n\n6.  **Normalize the eigenvector**:\n    The final step is to find the normalization constant $C$ by requiring the length of the vector to be 1. The normalization condition is $|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1$.\n    $|C \\cos(\\theta/2)|^2 + |C \\sin(\\theta/2)|^2 = 1$\n    $|C|^2 (\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2)) = 1$\n    Using the identity $\\cos^2(x) + \\sin^2(x) = 1$:\n    $|C|^2 (1) = 1$\n    So, $|C|^2 = 1$. We can choose $C=1$ (the overall phase of an eigenvector is arbitrary and usually chosen to be real and positive).\n    Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is:\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    The elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n7.  **Compare with the given options**:\n    A) $(\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta))$\n    B) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)$\n    C) $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))$\n    D) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2))$\n\n    Our result $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$ matches option C. Options B and D are incorrect because eigenvector components must be dimensionless, not have units of $\\hbar$. Option A has the wrong dependence on $\\theta$.\n\n<<<C>>>"
