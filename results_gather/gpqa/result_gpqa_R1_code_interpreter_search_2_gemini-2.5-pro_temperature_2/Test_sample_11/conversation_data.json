    "Here's a step-by-step derivation to find the kinetic energies of the product particles.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics Principles**\n\nThe decay of a stationary particle is governed by two fundamental conservation laws:\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n\n**2. Set up the Problem**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Pi(+) -> mu(+) + nu\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   The positive pion (Pi+) is stationary.\n    *   Initial momentum (p_initial) = 0.\n    *   Initial energy (E_initial) is the rest energy of the pion, E_initial = M_pi * c^2.\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The products are a positive muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu).\n    *   Let p_mu and p_nu be their momenta, and E_mu and E_nu be their total energies.\n*   **Given Masses (in energy units):**\n    *   Rest energy of Pi(+) (M_pi * c^2) = 139.6 MeV\n    *   Rest energy of mu(+) (M_mu * c^2) = 105.7 MeV\n    *   The neutrino (nu) is considered massless (M_nu * c^2 = 0).\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\n*   p_initial = p_final\n*   0 = p_mu + p_nu\n*   This implies that the muon and the neutrino must move in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude. Let's call this magnitude 'p'.\n    *   |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Energy**\n\n*   E_initial = E_final\n*   M_pi * c^2 = E_mu + E_nu\n\nWe use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2, which means E = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2).\n\n*   For the muon (mu+):\n    *   E_mu = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (M_mu * c^2)^2)\n*   For the massless neutrino (nu):\n    *   E_nu = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (0)^2) = p*c\n    *   The total energy of a massless particle is purely kinetic, so KE_nu = E_nu = p*c.\n\nSubstitute these into the energy conservation equation:\nM_pi * c^2 = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (M_mu * c^2)^2) + p*c\n\n**5. Solve for the Momentum (p*c)**\n\nTo find the kinetic energies, we first need to solve for the momentum term, p*c.\n\n1.  Rearrange the equation:\n    M_pi * c^2 - p*c = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (M_mu * c^2)^2)\n\n2.  Square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n    (M_pi * c^2 - p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (M_mu * c^2)^2\n    (M_pi * c^2)^2 - 2*(M_pi * c^2)*(p*c) + (p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (M_mu * c^2)^2\n\n3.  The (p*c)^2 terms cancel out:\n    (M_pi * c^2)^2 - 2*(M_pi * c^2)*(p*c) = (M_mu * c^2)^2\n\n4.  Isolate the p*c term:\n    2*(M_pi * c^2)*(p*c) = (M_pi * c^2)^2 - (M_mu * c^2)^2\n    p*c = [ (M_pi * c^2)^2 - (M_mu * c^2)^2 ] / [ 2 * (M_pi * c^2) ]\n\n**6. Calculate the Numerical Values**\n\nLet's run the calculation with a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Rest masses in MeV/c^2 (equivalent to rest energies in MeV)\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6  # MeV\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7  # MeV\n\n# Calculate the momentum term, p*c\npc = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# The kinetic energy of the neutrino is equal to its total energy, E_nu = p*c\nke_nu = pc\n\n# The kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest energy\n# KE_mu = E_mu - M_mu*c^2\n# From energy conservation: KE_mu = M_pi*c^2 - M_mu*c^2 - KE_nu\nke_mu = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2 - ke_nu\n\nprint(f\"Kinetic Energy of Muon (KE_mu): {ke_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"Kinetic Energy of Neutrino (KE_nu): {ke_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n>>>\nKinetic Energy of Muon (KE_mu): 4.12 MeV\nKinetic Energy of Neutrino (KE_nu): 29.78 MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino (when rounded).\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The decay process is:\nPi(+) -> mu(+) + nu\n\nThe principles of conservation of energy and momentum are applied to solve this problem.\n\n1.  **Conservation of Momentum**:\n    Since the initial pion (Pi+) is stationary, the initial total momentum is zero. Therefore, the final total momentum must also be zero. This means the muon (mu+) and the neutrino (nu) must travel in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n    |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p\n\n2.  **Conservation of Energy**:\n    The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n    E_initial = E_final\n    The initial energy is just the rest energy of the stationary pion.\n    E_pi = m_pi * c^2\n    The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n    E_final = E_mu + E_nu\n    So, m_pi * c^2 = E_mu + E_nu\n\n3.  **Relativistic Energy and Momentum**:\n    The relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is given by:\n    E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2\n    *   For the muon (mu+): E_mu = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2)\n    *   For the neutrino (nu), we assume it's massless (m_nu = 0), so its energy is: E_nu = sqrt((p*c)^2 + 0) = p*c. This means the neutrino's total energy is purely kinetic.\n        KE_nu = E_nu = p*c\n\n4.  **Solving for Momentum and Energy**:\n    We substitute the energy expressions back into the conservation of energy equation:\n    m_pi * c^2 = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu * c^2)^2) + p*c\n\n    To solve for `p*c`, we can rearrange and square the equation. The derived formula for the momentum term `p*c` is:\n    p*c = [ (m_pi * c^2)^2 - (m_mu * c^2)^2 ] / (2 * m_pi * c^2)\n\n5.  **Calculation**:\n    Using the provided rest mass energies:\n    *   m_pi * c^2 = 139.6 MeV\n    *   m_mu * c^2 = 105.7 MeV\n\n    The Python script calculated the following:\n    *   Kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_nu = p*c) = 29.78 MeV\n    *   Kinetic energy of the muon (KE_mu) = 4.12 MeV\n\n    The total energy released as kinetic energy is Q = m_pi*c^2 - m_mu*c^2 = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV.\n    KE_mu + KE_nu = 4.12 + 29.78 = 33.9 MeV, which confirms the conservation of energy.\n\n    Rounding the calculated values, we get:\n    *   KE_mu = 4.12 MeV\n    *   KE_nu = 29.8 MeV\n\nThese values correspond to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
