    "This question asks to identify the number of optically active compounds from a given list. A compound is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of one or more chiral centers (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups). However, a molecule with chiral centers can be achiral if it has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion; such compounds are called meso compounds. Also, molecules can be chiral without a chiral center (e.g., due to axial or planar chirality).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl(H)C=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   The double bond is between C1 and C2. The (Z) notation indicates that the higher priority groups on each carbon of the double bond are on the same side. For C1, Cl > H. For C2, -CH2CH3 > -CH3. So, Cl and the ethyl group are on the same side.\n    *   There are no chiral centers in the molecule (no sp3 carbon with four different groups).\n    *   The molecule is planar. The plane of the molecule acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **achiral** and not optically active.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   This is a complex, bicyclic molecule.\n    *   The key information is in the stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. The R/S system is used to describe the absolute configuration of chiral centers.\n    *   When a molecule is given with specific R/S descriptors, and it does not have offsetting internal symmetry (making it a meso compound), it refers to a single enantiomer.\n    *   A single enantiomer is, by definition, chiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`.\n    *   It has two chiral centers, at C2 and C3.\n    *   The given stereochemistry is `(2R, 3S)`. Let's examine the symmetry. Due to the symmetrical nature of the molecule (the two ends are identical -COOH groups), the (R,S) combination results in a meso compound.\n    *   A Fischer projection shows a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3.\n        ```\n              COOH\n               |\n        H ----|---- CH3  (S)\n        ------+------\n        CH3 --|---- H    (R)\n               |\n              COOH\n        ```\n    *   Alternatively, in a staggered conformation, it possesses a center of inversion.\n    *   Since it is a meso compound, it is **achiral** and not optically active.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a stereoisomer of the previous compound, with `(2R, 3R)` configuration.\n    *   This isomer does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Its mirror image is the `(2S, 3S)` isomer, and they are non-superimposable. They form an enantiomeric pair.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) -OH, (2) -H, (3) -CH=CH-CH2-CH2- (path one way around the ring), and (4) -CH2-CH2-CH=CH- (path the other way). The two paths are different, so C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule as a whole lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **chiral** and optically active.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The `s,s,s` designation (or simply \"cis\") indicates that all three groups are on the same side of the ring.\n    *   In the most stable chair conformation, all three large -OH groups will occupy equatorial positions.\n    *   This molecule possesses multiple elements of symmetry. For instance, it has three planes of symmetry, each passing through one C-OH group and the carbon atom opposite to it.\n    *   Due to the presence of these planes of symmetry, the molecule is **achiral** (a meso compound) and not optically active.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   Let's determine the structure from the IUPAC name. The parent is butan-1-one, with the carbonyl group at C1. A cyclopentyl group is on C1, and a methyl group is on C3.\n    *   The structure is: `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`. This can also be written as `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers. The C3 atom is bonded to a H, two CH3 groups (the terminal C4 and the methyl substituent, which are equivalent in terms of attachment `(CH3)2CH-`), and the `-CH2CO-Cyclopentyl` group. Since C3 is bonded to two identical methyl groups, it is not a chiral center.\n    *   There are no other chiral centers in the molecule. The molecule has a plane of symmetry (in a certain conformation) that passes through the H atom on C3, the C3-C2 bond, the carbonyl group, and through the cyclopentyl ring, bisecting the two methyl groups.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **achiral** and not optically active.\n\n**Summary**:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: **Achiral**\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Chiral**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Achiral (meso)**\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Chiral**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Chiral**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: **Achiral (meso)**\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: **Achiral**\n\nThere are **3** optically active compounds in the list.\n\n<<<A>>>"
