    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the options based on the definition of density.**\n    Density (ρ) is defined as mass (M) divided by volume (V): ρ = M/V. For a spherical planet, the volume is V = (4/3)πR³, where R is the radius.\n\n*   **Step 2: Evaluate each option.**\n    *   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is our reference planet, Earth. Its average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm³. Let's call this density ρ_E.\n    *   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly given as ~5.5 g/cm³, which is essentially the same as Earth's density (ρ_E).\n    *   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** For planets with the same rocky composition, a more massive planet will experience stronger self-gravity. This increased gravitational force compresses the material more tightly, leading to a smaller volume for a given mass compared to a less massive planet. A smaller volume for a larger mass results in a higher average density. Therefore, this planet will be denser than Earth. Its density will be > ρ_E.\n    *   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** Following the same logic as in (c), a less massive planet will have weaker self-gravity. This leads to less compression of its material. Therefore, this planet will be less dense than Earth. Its density will be < ρ_E.\n\n*   **Step 3: Compare the densities.**\n    *   Density of (a) = ρ_E (≈ 5.51 g/cm³)\n    *   Density of (b) ≈ ρ_E (≈ 5.5 g/cm³)\n    *   Density of (c) > ρ_E\n    *   Density of (d) < ρ_E\n\n*   **Step 4: Conclude.**\n    By comparing the relative densities, it is clear that the planet described in option (c) has the highest density because its greater mass causes more significant gravitational compression.\n\n<<<C>>>"
