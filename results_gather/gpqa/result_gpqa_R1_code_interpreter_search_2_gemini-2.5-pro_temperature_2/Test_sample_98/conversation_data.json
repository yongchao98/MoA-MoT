    "*   **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n    1.  **Deconstruct the Provided Information:**\n        *   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n            *   A very broad absorption at ~3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an O-H stretch from a carboxylic acid dimerized through hydrogen bonding.\n            *   A strong absorption at ~1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O stretch from a carboxylic acid.\n            *   Conclusion: The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this information is consistent with all of them.\n\n        *   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n            *   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated molecules, consistent with this data.\n            *   **Key splitting patterns:** The spectrum contains two distinct, complex signals.\n                *   Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).\n                *   Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).\n            *   This detailed splitting information is the key to differentiating between the four isomers.\n\n    2.  **Analyze the Meaning of the Splitting Patterns:**\n        *   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** For a signal to be a `dtq`, the corresponding proton (let's call it H_A) must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n            *   One proton (n=1), which splits the signal into a **doublet**. This neighbor is a `CH` group.\n            *   Two protons (n=2), which splits the signal into a **triplet**. These neighbors are from a `CH₂` group.\n            *   Three protons (n=3), which splits the signal into a **quartet**. These neighbors are from a `CH₃` group.\n            *   Therefore, the proton H_A must be on a carbon that is adjacent to a `CH`, a `CH₂`, and a `CH₃` group.\n\n        *   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** For a signal to be a `dtt`, the corresponding proton (H_B) must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n            *   One proton (n=1), which splits the signal into a **doublet** (from a neighboring `CH` group).\n            *   Two protons (n=2), which splits the signal into a **triplet** (from a neighboring `CH₂` group).\n            *   Two other chemically non-equivalent protons (n=2), which splits the signal into another **triplet** (from another neighboring `CH₂` group).\n            *   Therefore, the proton H_B must be on a carbon that is adjacent to a `CH` group and two different `CH₂` groups.\n\n    3.  **Evaluate Each Candidate Structure:**\n\n        *   **A) `CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH` → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n            ```\n                       CH₃\n                       |\n            CH₃-CH₂-CH--CH-COOH\n                               |\n                               CH₃\n            ```\n            No proton in this molecule is adjacent to a `CH`, a `CH₂`, and a `CH₃` group simultaneously. No proton is adjacent to a `CH` and two `CH₂` groups simultaneously. Thus, no `dtq` or `dtt` is expected.\n\n        *   **B) `CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH` → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n            ```\n                    CH₃  CH₃\n                    |    |\n                CH₃-CH - CH - CH₂ - COOH\n            ```\n            The proton on C3 is adjacent to a `CH₂` (at C2) and a `CH` (at C4), which would give a triplet of doublets (td). The proton on C4 is adjacent to a `CH` (at C3) and an isopropyl group (`CH(CH₃)₂`), which would give a doublet of septets. No `dtq` or `dtt` is expected.\n\n        *   **C) `CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH` → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n            ```\n                       CH₂CH₃\n                       |\n            CH₃-CH₂-CH--CH-COOH\n                               |\n                               CH₂CH₃\n            ```\n            *   Let's check for a **dtt**. The proton on C3 is adjacent to the `CH` at C2, the `CH₂` of the main chain at C4, and the `CH₂` of its ethyl substituent. This fits the requirement for a `dtt` (coupled to 1H, 2H, and 2H).\n            *   Let's check for a **dtq**. Is there any proton adjacent to a `CH`, `CH₂`, and `CH₃` group? No. For example, the `CH₂` protons of the ethyl group on C4 are adjacent to a `CH` (at C3) and a `CH₃` group. This would lead to a doublet of quartets (dq or qd). This molecule has a `dtt` but not a `dtq`.\n\n        *   **D) `CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH` → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n            *This condensed formula is best interpreted as `CH₃-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`.*\n            ```\n                     CH₂CH₃(h,i)  CH₂CH₃(d,e)\n                     |            |\n            CH₃(a)-CH(b)--------CH(c)---------CH₂(f)--COOH(g)\n            ```\n            Let's analyze the key protons H(b) and H(c).\n            *   **Proton H(b) on C4:** This proton is adjacent to:\n                1.  The `CH₃` group at C5 (protons `H(a)`). Coupling to 3 protons gives a **quartet**.\n                2.  The `CH` group at C3 (proton `H(c)`). Coupling to 1 proton gives a **doublet**.\n                3.  The `CH₂` group of the ethyl substituent on C4 (protons `H(h)`). Coupling to 2 protons gives a **triplet**.\n                Therefore, the signal for H(b) will be a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the data.\n\n            *   **Proton H(c) on C3:** This proton is adjacent to:\n                1.  The `CH` group at C4 (proton `H(b)`). Coupling to 1 proton gives a **doublet**.\n                2.  The `CH₂` group at C2 (protons `H(f)`). Coupling to 2 protons gives a **triplet**.\n                3.  The `CH₂` group of the ethyl substituent on C3 (protons `H(d)`). Coupling to 2 protons gives a **triplet**.\n                Therefore, the signal for H(c) will be a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This also matches the data.\n\n    4.  **Conclusion:**\n        Only the structure corresponding to option D, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, can produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>"
