    "Here's a step-by-by-step breakdown of the reasoning and calculations to solve the problem.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\n\nFirst, we need to determine the new concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water. We can use the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2.\n\n*   **Initial Molarity (M1):** 0.05 M\n*   **Initial Volume (V1):** 20.00 cm3\n*   **Final Volume (V2):** 20.00 cm3 (acid) + 20.00 cm3 (water) = 40.00 cm3\n*   **Final Molarity (M2):** ?\n\nM2 = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm3) / 40.00 cm3 = **0.025 M**\n\nSo, we are titrating a 40.00 cm3 solution of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has reacted with NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (A-). This creates a buffer solution.\n\n*   The reaction is: CH3COOH + OH- -> CH3COO- + H2O\n*   At this point, 75% of the original acetic acid remains, and 25% has been converted to acetate.\n*   The ratio of the conjugate base to the acid, [A-]/[HA], is 25 / 75 = 1/3.\n\nWe can use the **Henderson-Hasselbalch equation** to find the pH:\npH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n\n1.  **Calculate pKa:**\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10^-5)\n\n2.  **Calculate the pH:**\n    pH = pKa + log(1/3) = pKa - log(3)\n\nLet's compute the values.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given Ka for acetic acid\nKa = 1.85e-5\n\n# Calculate pKa\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n\n# At 25% titration, the ratio of [A-]/[HA] is 1/3\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\nprint(f\"The pH at 25% titration is: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\n```\n> **pH at 25% titration: 4.26**\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH, and the solution contains only its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH3COONa). The acetate ion (CH3COO-) will hydrolyze in water, producing OH- ions and making the solution basic.\n\n1.  **Calculate the initial moles of acetic acid:**\n    Moles = Molarity * Volume = 0.025 mol/L * 0.0400 L = **0.001 mol**\n\n2.  **Calculate the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point:**\n    Volume NaOH = Moles / Molarity NaOH = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = **10.00 cm3**\n\n3.  **Calculate the total volume of the solution at the equivalence point:**\n    Total Volume = Initial acid volume + Volume of NaOH added = 40.00 cm3 + 10.00 cm3 = **50.00 cm3** = 0.050 L\n\n4.  **Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion ([A-]) at the equivalence point:**\n    [A-] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = **0.02 M**\n\n5.  **Calculate the Kb for the acetate ion:**\n    The acetate ion hydrolyzes as follows: CH3COO- + H2O <=> CH3COOH + OH-\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10^-14) / (1.85 x 10^-5)\n\n6.  **Calculate the hydroxide ion concentration [OH-]:**\n    We can set up an equilibrium expression: Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-] / [CH3COO-].\n    Assuming [CH3COOH] = [OH-] = x, and [CH3COO-] ≈ 0.02 M:\n    Kb = x² / 0.02\n    x = [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * 0.02)\n\n7.  **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    pOH = -log([OH-])\n    pH = 14.00 - pOH\n\nLet's compute the final values.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\nacetate_concentration = 0.02  # M\n\n# Calculate Kb\nKb = Kw / Ka\n\n# Calculate [OH-]\n# Kb = x^2 / acetate_concentration  => x = sqrt(Kb * acetate_concentration)\nOH_concentration = math.sqrt(Kb * acetate_concentration)\n\n# Calculate pOH and pH\npOH = -math.log10(OH_concentration)\npH_at_equivalence = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"The pH at the equivalence point is: {pH_at_equivalence:.2f}\")\n```\n> **pH at the equivalence point: 8.52**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   The pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n*   The pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nMatching these results with the given options:\nA) 4.73; 7.00\nB) 3.17; 6.73\nC) 4.26; 8.52\nD) 4.57; 6.92\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here's my thinking process:\n1.  **Dilution Calculation**: First, I'll calculate the new concentration of acetic acid after it's diluted with water.\n    *   Initial Molarity (M1) = 0.05 M\n    *   Initial Volume (V1) = 20.00 cm3\n    *   Final Volume (V2) = 20.00 cm3 + 20.00 cm3 = 40.00 cm3\n    *   The new molarity (M2) can be found using the dilution equation M1V1 = M2V2.\n    *   M2 = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm3) / 40.00 cm3 = 0.025 M.\n\n2.  **pH at 25% Titration**: This point is in the buffer region of the titration curve. Here, 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻), and 75% of the acid remains.\n    *   The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is perfect for this: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]).\n    *   The ratio [A⁻]/[HA] is 25/75, which simplifies to 1/3.\n    *   First, I need to calculate the pKa from the given Ka.\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵).\n    *   Then, pH = pKa + log(1/3).\n    *   I've already run the code for this calculation, and the result was pH = 4.26.\n\n3.  **pH at the Equivalence Point**: At this point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. The solution contains only the conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH3COONa). The acetate ion (CH3COO⁻) will hydrolyze in water, making the solution basic.\n    *   **Reaction:** CH3COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH⁻\n    *   First, I need to find the number of moles of acetic acid initially present: Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.0400 L = 0.001 mol.\n    *   At the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added will equal the initial moles of acetic acid (0.001 mol). I'll find the volume of NaOH needed: Volume = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n    *   The total volume of the solution at the equivalence point is the initial volume of the acid solution plus the volume of NaOH added: 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n    *   The concentration of the acetate ion [A⁻] at the equivalence point is the moles of acetate divided by the total volume: [A⁻] = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n    *   Now I need the Kb for the acetate ion, which can be found using the relationship Kw = Ka × Kb. So, Kb = Kw / Ka, where Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴.\n    *   Using the hydrolysis reaction equilibrium, Kb = [CH3COOH][OH⁻] / [CH3COO⁻]. We can let [CH3COOH] = [OH⁻] = x.\n    *   Kb = x² / ([A⁻] - x). Since Kb is small, we can approximate [A⁻] - x ≈ [A⁻]. So, Kb ≈ x² / 0.02.\n    *   I'll solve for x = [OH⁻] = sqrt(Kb * 0.02).\n    *   Finally, I'll calculate pOH = -log([OH⁻]) and then pH = 14.00 - pOH.\n    *   I'll use a python script to perform these final calculations accurately.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n# Concentration of acetate at the equivalence point, calculated in reasoning\nacetate_concentration = 0.02  # M\n\n# Calculate Kb for the acetate ion\nKb = Kw / Ka\n\n# Calculate the hydroxide ion concentration [OH-] at the equivalence point\n# The hydrolysis reaction is A- + H2O <=> HA + OH-\n# Kb = [HA][OH-]/[A-] = x^2 / [A-]\n# x = [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [A-])\nOH_concentration = math.sqrt(Kb * acetate_concentration)\n\n# Calculate pOH\npOH = -math.log10(OH_concentration)\n\n# Calculate pH\npH_at_equivalence = 14.00 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"The pH at the equivalence point is: {pH_at_equivalence:.2f}\")\n```",
