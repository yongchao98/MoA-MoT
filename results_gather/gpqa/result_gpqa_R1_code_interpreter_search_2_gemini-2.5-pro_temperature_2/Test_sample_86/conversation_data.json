    "*   **Step 1: Deciphering the Molecular Formula and Functional Groups**\n    1.  **Core Structure:** The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This means it's a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituents, let's call them X and Y. The base structure is C6H4XY.\n    2.  **Total Carbons:** The molecule contains 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the benzene ring itself has 6 carbons, the two substituents (X and Y) must collectively contribute the remaining 2 carbons (8 - 6 = 2).\n    3.  **FTIR Spectroscopy Data:**\n        *   A peak indicates a **carbonyl group (C=O)**. So, one of the substituents must contain a C=O.\n        *   Another peak indicates an **aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X)**. This means one of the substituents is a halogen (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Step 2: Proposing a Candidate Structure**\n    *   Based on the above, one substituent (X) is a Halogen (-F, -Cl, -Br, or -I).\n    *   The other substituent (Y) must contain the C=O group and the 2 remaining carbon atoms. The most common and chemically stable group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   Combining these pieces, the most plausible structure is a **haloacetophenone**. The general formula is **X-C6H4-COCH3**, where X is a halogen. This structure has 8 carbons (6 in the ring, 2 in the acetyl group), is di-substituted on an aromatic ring, and contains both a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond.\n\n*   **Step 3: Predicting the 1H NMR Spectrum for Haloacetophenone**\n    The number of protons in this molecule is 3 (from the -CH3 group) + 4 (from the C6H4 ring) = 7 protons. Let's predict the signals:\n    1.  **Acetyl group protons (-COCH3):** The methyl (-CH3) group is attached to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, these 3 protons will not be split by any neighbors and will appear as a **singlet (s)**. Their chemical shift is typically in the range of **2.1-2.6 ppm**. The integration should be **3H**. So, we are looking for a peak described as `~2.3 ppm (3H, s)`.\n    2.  **Aromatic protons (-C6H4-):** There are 4 protons on the di-substituted ring. Their splitting pattern depends on the positions of the two substituents (ortho, meta, or para).\n        *   *Ortho* or *meta* substitution would result in a complex pattern of multiple distinct signals (multiplets).\n        *   *Para* (1,4) substitution is the most symmetrical arrangement. The 4 aromatic protons are in two distinct chemical environments. The two protons *ortho* (next to) the acetyl group are equivalent, and the two protons *ortho* to the halogen are equivalent. This results in a very characteristic pattern of **two doublets (d)**, each integrating to **2H**. Due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the carbonyl and halogen, these protons are deshielded and appear downfield, typically in the **7.0-8.0 ppm** region. So, we'd expect `~7.x ppm (2H, d)` and `~7.y ppm (2H, d)`.\n\n*   **Step 4: Evaluating the Given Options**\n    Let's see which option matches our predicted spectrum: `a singlet for 3H around 2.3 ppm` and `two doublets for 2H each between 7-8 ppm`.\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This option has a 3H singlet, but at 1.3 ppm, which is too low for a methyl group next to a carbonyl. The other peaks are not in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm). This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **2.3 (3H, s):** This perfectly matches the signal for the acetyl methyl group (singlet, 3 protons, correct chemical shift).\n        *   **7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d):** This perfectly matches the pattern for a *para*-substituted benzene ring (two doublets, each for 2 protons, correct chemical shifts).\n        *   This option is an excellent fit for *p*-haloacetophenone.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This option lacks the required 3H singlet for the methyl group and has incorrect signals in the wrong regions. This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde (-CHO) proton, not a ketone. While an aldehyde isomer like halo-phenylacetaldehyde (X-C6H4-CH2CHO) also has 8 carbons and the required functional groups, the spectrum provided is inconsistent. The aldehyde proton (-CHO) and the adjacent methylene protons (-CH2-) would split each other, resulting in a triplet and a doublet, respectively, not two singlets as shown. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Option B is the only one that correctly describes the 1H NMR spectrum of a compound that fits all the criteria given in the problem statement. The compound is a *p*-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<B>>>"
