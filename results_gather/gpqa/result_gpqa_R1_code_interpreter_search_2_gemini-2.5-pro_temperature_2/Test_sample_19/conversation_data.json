    "The user wants me to identify the set of assumptions that collectively define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics.\n\n**1. Analyze the core concept: Impulse Approximation**\nThe name itself gives a big clue. \"Impulse\" in physics refers to a large force acting over a very short time interval. The impulse approximation (IA) in nuclear physics treats a high-energy interaction with a nucleus as a sudden, sharp \"hit\" on a single nucleon. The key idea is that the interaction time is so short that the struck nucleon behaves *as if* it were a free particle during the collision. The other nucleons are considered \"spectators\" that do not participate in the primary interaction and don't have time to react until after the interaction is over.\n\n**2. Evaluate each statement in the context of this concept:**\n\n*   **Statement 1: The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.**\n    *   This is the foundation of the approximation. We are simplifying a complex many-body problem (the interaction with the entire nucleus) into a sum of single-body problems (interaction with one nucleon at a time). If the interaction probe (e.g., an electron or neutrino) could interact with multiple nucleons at once (which is described by things like meson-exchange currents), then the whole premise of isolating a single nucleon interaction would fail. So, this assumption is necessary.\n\n*   **Statement 2: The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.**\n    *   This addresses what happens *before* and *after* the main interaction. For the measurement to reflect the simple, single-nucleon interaction, the incoming probe must reach the target nucleon without being scattered by others first (no initial-state interactions). Likewise, the outgoing particles (the scattered probe and the ejected nucleon) must leave the nucleus without further interactions (no final-state interactions). This assumption of a \"transparent\" nucleus is crucial for the simplest form of the impulse approximation (often called the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation or PWIA). While more advanced models try to account for these interactions, they are considered corrections *to* the basic impulse approximation. Therefore, this assumption is a key part of the core approximation.\n\n*   **Statement 3: The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.**\n    *   This statement deals with the *internal structure* of the nucleon itself, not its behavior *within the nucleus*. The impulse approximation is about the nucleon's state relative to its neighbors, not its internal composition. High-energy interactions, where the impulse approximation is most applicable, are often highly relativistic. For example, deep inelastic scattering of electrons off nuclei is treated with the impulse approximation, and at these energies, the quarks are highly relativistic. Therefore, assuming non-relativistic quarks is not a requirement for the impulse approximation; in many cases, it's explicitly not true. This statement is not a necessary component.\n\n*   **Statement 4: The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.**\n    *   This is the essence of the \"impulse\" idea. The interaction is assumed to be so fast that the nuclear binding forces (which hold the nucleon in the nucleus) don't have time to act during the collision. The nucleon's state (its momentum) is changed instantaneously, and we can ignore the potential energy well it was in for the duration of that instant. This is a direct consequence of the interaction time being much shorter than the characteristic time scale of nucleon motion within the nucleus. This is the central physical assumption of the approximation.\n\n**3. Synthesize the findings:**\n*   Statement 1 is required (Target is a single nucleon).\n*   Statement 2 is required (No interference from other nucleons before/after).\n*   Statement 3 is not required (Internal nucleon structure is a separate issue).\n*   Statement 4 is required (Binding forces are ignored during the brief interaction).\n\nThe assumptions that jointly define the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n**4. Match with the given options:**\n*   A) 1, 2, 4\n*   B) 1, 2, 3\n*   C) 1, 3, 4\n*   D) 2, 3, 4\n\nThe correct combination is given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
