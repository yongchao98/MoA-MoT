    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define Frames of Reference:**\n    *   Let the laboratory be the stationary frame of reference, which we'll call `S`. The observer is in this frame.\n    *   Let the moving glass be the moving frame of reference, which we'll call `S'`. Frame `S'` moves with a constant velocity `v` relative to frame `S`. Both the glass and the light beam are moving in the same direction.\n\n2.  **Determine the Speed of Light in the Glass's Rest Frame (S'):**\n    The index of refraction `n` of a medium is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in that medium (`u'`).\n    `n = c / u'`\n    The problem specifies that we should take the speed of light in a vacuum `c = 1`. So, the equation becomes:\n    `n = 1 / u'`\n    Rearranging this, we find the speed of light as measured by an observer in the rest frame of the glass (`S'`):\n    `u' = 1/n`\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    To find the speed of light as seen by the observer in the laboratory frame (`S`), we need to use Einstein's velocity addition formula. This formula correctly combines velocities in special relativity. For motion along a single axis, the formula is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n    Where:\n    *   `u` is the speed of the object (the light beam) in the stationary frame `S`. This is what we need to calculate.\n    *   `u'` is the speed of the object (the light beam) in the moving frame `S'`.\n    *   `v` is the speed of the moving frame `S'` relative to the stationary frame `S`.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\n4.  **Substitute the Known Values into the Formula:**\n    We have the following values:\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v` (the given speed of the glass)\n    *   `c = 1`\n    Substituting these into the velocity addition formula:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Mathematical Expression:**\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n    To eliminate the fractions within the numerator and the denominator, we can multiply both the top and bottom of the main fraction by `n`:\n    `u = n * ( (1/n) + v ) / n * ( 1 + v/n )`\n    Distribute `n` in both the numerator and the denominator:\n    `u = ( n * (1/n) + n * v ) / ( n * 1 + n * (v/n) )`\n    `u = ( 1 + n*v ) / ( n + v )`\n\n6.  **Compare the Result with the Options:**\n    The calculated speed of the light beam in the glass relative to the laboratory observer is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n    B) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n    C) 1\n    D) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n\n    Our result matches option A perfectly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
