    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the System and Energy Levels**\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. According to the spin-statistics theorem, particles with half-integer spin are **fermions**.\n*   **Key Property of Fermions:** Fermions obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state is defined by all its quantum numbers, in this case, the energy level `n` and the spin projection `m_s`.\n*   **Potential Well:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n*   **Single-Particle Energy Levels:** The energy for a single particle in the `n`-th quantum level of a 1D infinite well is given by:\n    E_n = (n^2 * π² * ħ²) / (2 * m * L²)\n    The problem conveniently defines the base energy unit as E = (π² * ħ²) / (2 * m * L²).\n    Therefore, the energy of a single particle in the `n`-th level is simply:\n    E_n = n² * E\n*   **State Degeneracy:** Since the particles are spin-1/2, for each energy level `n`, there are two possible spin states: spin up (m_s = +1/2) and spin down (m_s = -1/2). This means that each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of two fermions (one with spin up, one with spin down).\n\n### **2. Calculate the Ground State Energy**\n\nThe ground state is the lowest possible total energy state of the system. To find this, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four fermions, respecting the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\n*   **Level n=1:** The energy is E₁ = 1² * E = E. We can place two fermions in this level (one spin up, one spin down).\n*   **Level n=2:** We still need to place two more fermions. The next lowest energy level is n=2, with energy E₂ = 2² * E = 4E. We can place the remaining two fermions in this level.\n*   **Total Ground State Energy (E_ground):**\n    E_ground = (2 particles × E₁) + (2 particles × E₂)\n    E_ground = (2 × E) + (2 × 4E)\n    E_ground = 2E + 8E = **10E**\n\n### **3. Calculate the First Excited State Energy**\n\nThe first excited state is the state with the next lowest total energy above the ground state. We achieve this by moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n*   **Ground State Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=2.\n*   **Highest Occupied Level:** n=2.\n*   **Lowest Unoccupied Level:** n=3 (Energy E₃ = 3² * E = 9E).\n*   **Excitation:** Promote one fermion from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   **First Excited State Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n*   **Total First Excited State Energy (E_1st):**\n    E_1st = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃)\n    E_1st = (2 × E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E)\n    E_1st = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**\n\n### **4. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy after the first excited state. We need to consider all possible low-energy excitations from the ground state and find the second-lowest energy increase.\n\nLet's list the possible states with energies just above the ground state (10E):\n\n*   **State A (First Excited State, calculated above):** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: {2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3}\n    *   Energy: 2(E) + 1(4E) + 1(9E) = **15E**\n\n*   **State B:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3 (the n=2 level is full in this transition).\n    *   Configuration: {1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3}\n    *   Energy: 1(E) + 2(4E) + 1(9E) = E + 8E + 9E = **18E**\n\n*   **State C:** Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: {2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3}\n    *   Energy: 2(E) + 2(9E) = 2E + 18E = **20E**\n\n*   **State D:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n    *   Configuration: {2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 0 in n=3, 1 in n=4}\n    *   Energy: 2(E) + 1(4E) + 1(16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = **22E**\n\nComparing the energies of these excited states:\n*   Ground State: 10E\n*   1st Excited State: 15E (State A)\n*   2nd Excited State: 18E (State B is the next lowest energy)\n\nThe second excited state energy is **18E**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
