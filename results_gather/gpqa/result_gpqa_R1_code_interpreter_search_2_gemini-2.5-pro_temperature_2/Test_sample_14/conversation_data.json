    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The goal is to compare the transit probabilities of two exoplanets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, to determine which is the more favorable target for observation.\n\n2.  **State the Transit Probability Formula:** The geometric probability of a planet transiting its star, assuming a circular orbit, is given by the ratio of the stellar radius (R_star) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (a):\n    *   `Probability (P_transit) = R_star / a`\n\n3.  **Express the Semi-Major Axis (a) in Terms of Known Quantities:** We need to relate 'a' to the given parameters: orbital period (P) and stellar mass (M_star). We can use Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion:\n    *   `P^2 = (4 * π^2 * a^3) / (G * M_total)`\n    *   Where G is the gravitational constant and `M_total = M_star + M_planet`.\n\n4.  **Apply Simplifications:** Since the planets are \"Earth-like,\" their masses (M_planet) are negligible compared to their host stars' masses (M_star). Therefore, we can approximate `M_total ≈ M_star`.\n    *   `P^2 ≈ (4 * π^2 * a^3) / (G * M_star)`\n\n5.  **Solve for 'a':** Rearranging Kepler's Third Law to solve for the semi-major axis 'a':\n    *   `a^3 ≈ (G * M_star * P^2) / (4 * π^2)`\n    *   `a ≈ [ (G * M_star * P^2) / (4 * π^2) ] ^ (1/3)`\n    *   Since G and `4π^2` are constants, we can establish a proportionality: `a ∝ (M_star * P^2)^(1/3)`\n\n6.  **Create a Proportionality for Transit Probability:** Substitute the proportionality for 'a' back into the transit probability formula:\n    *   `P_transit ∝ R_star / (M_star * P^2)^(1/3)`\n    *   `P_transit ∝ R_star * M_star^(-1/3) * P^(-2/3)`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Ratio of Probabilities:** We want to find the ratio of the transit probability of Planet_1 to that of Planet_2 (`P_transit_1 / P_transit_2`).\n    *   `Ratio = (R_star_1 * M_star_1^(-1/3) * P_1^(-2/3)) / (R_star_2 * M_star_2^(-1/3) * P_2^(-2/3))`\n    *   `Ratio = (R_star_1 / R_star_2) * (M_star_1 / M_star_2)^(-1/3) * (P_1 / P_2)^(-2/3)`\n\n8.  **Plug in the Given Values:** From the problem description:\n    *   The host stars have the same radii: `R_star_1 = R_star_2` -> `R_star_1 / R_star_2 = 1`\n    *   The star of Planet_1 has twice the mass: `M_star_1 = 2 * M_star_2` -> `M_star_1 / M_star_2 = 2`\n    *   The period of Planet_1 is three times shorter: `P_1 = P_2 / 3` -> `P_1 / P_2 = 1/3`\n\n9.  **Solve the Equation:**\n    *   `Ratio = (1) * (2)^(-1/3) * (1/3)^(-2/3)`\n    *   `Ratio = 2^(-1/3) * 3^(2/3)`\n    *   `Ratio = (3^2 / 2)^(1/3)`\n    *   `Ratio = (9 / 2)^(1/3)`\n    *   `Ratio = 4.5^(1/3)`\n\n10. **Compute the Numerical Value:** To get the final factor, we calculate the cube root of 4.5.\n```python\nimport math\n\nratio = 4.5**(1/3)\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_output>\n1.650963599423696\n</execute_output>\nThe calculation shows that the ratio is approximately 1.65. This means Planet_1's probability of transiting is about 1.65 times higher than Planet_2's probability. Therefore, Planet_1 is the preferred target for observation. Comparing this result with the given options, option C matches our finding.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here's the step-by-step reasoning used to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The main objective is to determine which of the two planets, Planet_1 or Planet_2, has a higher geometric probability of transiting its host star and by what factor.\n\n2.  **Identify the Key Formula:** The geometric probability of a transit for a planet in a circular orbit is the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital semi-major axis.\n    *   `P_transit = R_star / a`\n    *   Where `P_transit` is the probability of transit, `R_star` is the stellar radius, and `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n3.  **Relate Unknowns to Knowns:** The semi-major axis (`a`) is not directly given. However, we can relate it to the given orbital period (`P`) and stellar mass (`M_star`) using Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion. The law states:\n    *   `P² ∝ a³ / M_star` (This is a proportional form, as the constants like G and 4π² will cancel out when we take a ratio).\n\n4.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (`a`):** We need to express `a` in terms of `P` and `M_star`.\n    *   `a³ ∝ P² * M_star`\n    *   `a ∝ (P² * M_star)^(1/3)`\n\n5.  **Develop a Proportionality for Transit Probability:** Now, substitute the expression for `a` back into the transit probability formula:\n    *   `P_transit ∝ R_star / [(P² * M_star)^(1/3)]`\n    *   `P_transit ∝ R_star * P^(-2/3) * M_star^(-1/3)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio of Probabilities:** To compare the two planets, we calculate the ratio of their transit probabilities (`P_transit_1 / P_transit_2`).\n    *   `Ratio = P_transit_1 / P_transit_2 = [R_star_1 * P_1^(-2/3) * M_star_1^(-1/3)] / [R_star_2 * P_2^(-2/3) * M_star_2^(-1/3)]`\n    *   We can group the terms for easier comparison:\n    *   `Ratio = (R_star_1 / R_star_2) * (P_1 / P_2)^(-2/3) * (M_star_1 / M_star_2)^(-1/3)`\n\n7.  **Substitute the Given Values from the Problem:**\n    *   \"both host stars have the same radii\": `R_star_1 = R_star_2` → `R_star_1 / R_star_2 = 1`\n    *   \"The star hosting Planet_1 has a mass that is twice that of the host star of Planet_2\": `M_star_1 = 2 * M_star_2` → `M_star_1 / M_star_2 = 2`\n    *   \"the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2\": `P_1 = P_2 / 3` → `P_1 / P_2 = 1/3`\n\n8.  **Solve the Final Equation:** Plug these values into the ratio formula:\n    *   `Ratio = (1) * (1/3)^(-2/3) * (2)^(-1/3)`\n    *   Using the exponent rule `(x/y)^(-n) = (y/x)^n`:\n    *   `Ratio = (3/1)^(2/3) * (1/2)^(1/3)`\n    *   `Ratio = (3²)^(1/3) * (1/2)^(1/3)`\n    *   `Ratio = (9)^(1/3) * (1/2)^(1/3)`\n    *   Using the exponent rule `x^n * y^n = (x*y)^n`:\n    *   `Ratio = (9 * 1/2)^(1/3)`\n    *   `Ratio = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n\n9.  **Numerical Calculation:** The value `(4.5)^(1/3)` is approximately 1.65096.\n\n10. **Conclusion:** The ratio of the probabilities (`P_transit_1 / P_transit_2`) is ~1.65. This means Planet_1's probability of transiting is about 1.65 times higher than Planet_2's. Therefore, the researchers should prefer to observe Planet_1. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
