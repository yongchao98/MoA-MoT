    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions produce stereoisomers of the same molecule: `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n*   **-pyran-**: Indicates a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **tetrahydro-**: The ring is saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **-2-one**: A carbonyl group (C=O) is at position 2 of the ring. (By convention, the ring oxygen is position 1).\n*   **-4-ethyl-**: An ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) is attached to position 4.\n*   **Lactone**: This overall structure is a cyclic ester, specifically a delta-lactone because the ring is 6-membered.\n*   **Chiral Center**: The carbon at position 4, which is bonded to an ethyl group, a hydrogen atom, and two different parts of the ring, is a chiral center. The products are specified as `(R)` and `(S)`, referring to the configuration at this C4 center.\n\nTo form a 6-membered lactone, the open-chain precursor must be a δ-hydroxy acid (a 5-hydroxy acid). By \"un-cyclizing\" the lactone (breaking the ester bond and adding water), we can identify the precursor acid: **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n`HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₂(5)OH`\nWhen this molecule cyclizes, the -OH on C5 attacks the -COOH on C1, forming a 6-membered ring. The chiral center, C3 of the acid, becomes C4 in the lactone. The stereochemistry at this center is preserved during cyclization.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials and Reducing Agents**\n\nThe options provide stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This is a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid) where one carboxylic acid group is converted to an isobutyl ester. The structure is:\n\n`HOOC-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(=O)(5)-O-iBu`\n(where iBu = isobutyl, -CH₂CH(CH₃)₂)\n\nThis molecule has two different functional groups that can be reduced:\n*   A carboxylic acid (`-COOH`)\n*   An ester (`-COOiBu`)\n\nThe two reducing agents have different selectivities:\n*   **`LiBH₄` (Lithium Borohydride):** This reagent selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **`BH₃` (Borane):** This reagent selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Starting material A + `LiBH₄`\n*   **Product:** `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n\n1.  `LiBH₄` reduces the **ester** group of the starting material.\n    `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu` --(`LiBH₄`)--> `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH`\n    The product is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n2.  The subsequent acidic workup (`H⁺`) catalyzes the intramolecular cyclization (lactonization) of this hydroxy acid to form the final lactone product.\n3.  The reduction and cyclization steps do not affect the chiral center at C3 (which becomes C4 in the product). Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained throughout the reaction.\n4.  Since the final product is the **(R)**-lactone, the intermediate hydroxy acid must have been **(R)**, and thus the starting material **A** must be the **(R)** enantiomer.\n\n    **Conclusion for A: A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Starting material B + `BH₃`\n*   **Product:** `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n\n1.  `BH₃` reduces the **carboxylic acid** group of the starting material.\n    `HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu` --(`BH₃`)--> `HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-iBu`\n    The product is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n2.  The acidic workup (`H⁺`) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The alcohol group (-OH) attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol and forming the 6-membered lactone.\n3.  Again, these reaction steps do not affect the chiral center. The stereochemistry is retained.\n4.  Since the final product is the **(S)**-lactone, the intermediate hydroxy ester must have been **(S)**, and thus the starting material **B** must be the **(S)** enantiomer.\n\n    **Conclusion for B: B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A must be the **(R)** enantiomer.\n*   Starting material B must be the **(S)** enantiomer.\n\nThis matches the description in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
