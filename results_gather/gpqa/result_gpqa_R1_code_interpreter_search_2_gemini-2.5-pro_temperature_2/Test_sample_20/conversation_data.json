    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n### **Part A: Tautomerism Analysis**\n\nTautomerism is a form of isomerism where two structures, called tautomers, are interconvertible by the migration of a proton, typically accompanied by a shift of a double bond. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a carbonyl compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have at least one hydrogen atom on the α-carbon (the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group). This hydrogen is known as an α-hydrogen.\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (specifically, 1,4-benzoquinone):**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring containing two carbonyl (C=O) groups opposite each other and two carbon-carbon double bonds.\n    *   Let's identify the α-carbons for one of the carbonyl groups. The adjacent carbons are part of the C=C double bonds within the ring.\n    *   Structure:\n        ```\n            O\n           //\n        C\n       / \\\n    HC   CH\n    ||   ||\n    HC   CH\n       \\ /\n        C\n       //\n       O\n        ```\n    *   The α-carbons do not have any attached hydrogens on an sp³ hybridized carbon atom. The hydrogens are attached to sp² hybridized carbons. Keto-enol tautomerism requires the removal of a proton from an sp³-hybridized α-carbon. Therefore, benzoquinone does not undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered saturated ring with three carbonyl (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are methylene (-CH₂-) groups.\n    *   Structure (Keto form):\n        ```\n           C=O\n          /   \\\n        H₂C   CH₂\n          |     |\n       O=C   C=O\n          \\   /\n           CH₂\n        ```\n    *   Each of the methylene groups (C2, C4, C6) is an α-carbon to two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   These carbons possess α-hydrogens. These hydrogens are particularly acidic because the negative charge of the resulting enolate ion can be delocalized over two carbonyl groups.\n    *   The keto form can undergo tautomerism to form its enol tautomer, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic compound. The large stabilization energy gained by forming an aromatic ring makes this tautomerization highly favorable.\n    *   Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show tautomerism.\n\n*   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part B: Optical Isomerism Analysis**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality in a molecule is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   Let's analyze the structure to find any potential chiral centers. The central carbon atom (C2) is bonded to the following four groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   Since all four groups attached to the C2 carbon are different, this carbon is a chiral center.\n    *   The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral and thus optically active. It will have two enantiomers (R and S forms).\n    *   Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate *will* show optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid.\n    *   Structure:\n        ```\n             H      COOCH₃\n              \\    /\n               C==C\n              /    \\\n        CH₃OOC   H\n        ```\n    *   There are no chiral centers in the molecule (no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups).\n    *   The molecule possesses a center of inversion (at the midpoint of the C=C bond) and a plane of symmetry (the plane containing all the atoms).\n    *   Molecules with a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion are achiral. Achiral molecules are not optically active.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate *will not* show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Summary**\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism): **Benzoquinone**\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism): **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
