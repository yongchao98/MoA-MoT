    "For a rhombohedral crystal, the interplanar spacing, d_hkl, for the (hkl) planes is given by the formula:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{hkl}^2} = \\frac{(h^2+k^2+l^2)\\sin^2\\alpha + 2(hk+kl+lh)(\\cos^2\\alpha - \\cos\\alpha)}{a^2(1 - 3\\cos^2\\alpha + 2\\cos^3\\alpha)} $$\nGiven the values from the question:\n- The interatomic distance, which corresponds to the lattice parameter,  $ a = 10 $ Angstrom.\n- The Miller indices for the plane are $(hkl) = (111)$.\n- The angle $\\alpha = \\beta = \\gamma = 30^\\circ$.\n\nWe can substitute these values into the formula to find the interplanar distance $d_{111}$.\nFor $(hkl)=(111)$:\n- $h^2+k^2+l^2 = 1^2+1^2+1^2 = 3$\n- $hk+kl+lh = (1)(1)+(1)(1)+(1)(1) = 3$\n\nThe angle is $\\alpha = 30^\\circ$, so we calculate its cosine:\n- $\\cos(30^\\circ) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\approx 0.866$\n- $\\cos^2(30^\\circ) = (\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})^2 = \\frac{3}{4} = 0.75$\n- $\\cos^3(30^\\circ) = (\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})^3 = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{8} \\approx 0.6495$\n\nNow we substitute these values into the formula. First, let's calculate the numerator of the right-hand side:\n$N = (3)\\sin^2(30^\\circ) + 2(3)(\\cos^2(30^\\circ) - \\cos(30^\\circ))$\nSince $\\sin^2\\alpha = 1 - \\cos^2\\alpha$:\n$\\sin^2(30^\\circ) = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25$\n$N = 3 \\times 0.25 + 6 \\times (0.75 - 0.866) = 0.75 + 6 \\times (-0.116) = 0.75 - 0.696 = 0.054$\n\nNext, let's calculate the denominator of the right-hand side:\n$D = a^2(1 - 3\\cos^2\\alpha + 2\\cos^3\\alpha)$\n$D = (10)^2(1 - 3(0.75) + 2(0.6495)) = 100(1 - 2.25 + 1.299) = 100(0.049)$\n$D = 4.9$\n\nNow, we can find $\\frac{1}{d_{111}^2}$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{111}^2} = \\frac{N}{D} = \\frac{0.054}{4.9} \\approx 0.01102 $$\nSo, $d_{111}^2 = \\frac{1}{0.01102} \\approx 90.74$\nAnd finally, the interplanar distance is:\n$$ d_{111} = \\sqrt{90.74} \\approx 9.525 \\text{ Angstrom} $$\nThis value is very close to 9.54 Angstrom.\n\nA more direct way for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral lattice is using a simplified formula derived from the general one:\n$$d_{111} = \\frac{a \\sqrt{1 + 2\\cos\\alpha}}{\\sqrt{3}}$$\nPlugging in the values:\n$$ d_{111} = \\frac{10 \\sqrt{1 + 2\\cos(30^\\circ)}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{10 \\sqrt{1 + 2 \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{10 \\sqrt{1 + \\sqrt{3}}}{\\sqrt{3}} $$\nUsing $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732$:\n$$ d_{111} = \\frac{10 \\sqrt{1 + 1.732}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{10 \\sqrt{2.732}}{1.732} = \\frac{10 \\times 1.6529}{1.732} = \\frac{16.529}{1.732} \\approx 9.543 \\text{ Angstrom} $$\nThis confirms that the calculated interplanar distance is approximately 9.54 Angstrom.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 9.54 Angstrom\nB) 10.05 Angstrom\nC) 8.95 Angstrom\nD) 9.08 Angstrom\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
