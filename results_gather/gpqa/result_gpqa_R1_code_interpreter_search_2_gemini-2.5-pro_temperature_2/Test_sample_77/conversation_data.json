    "The user is asking for the scalar and vector potentials generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### Reasoning and Derivation\n\n1.  **Start with the Retarded Potentials:**\n    The electric and magnetic fields at a point in space and time are not determined by the state of the sources at that instant, but by their state at an earlier time, the \"retarded time\" $t_r$. This is because electromagnetic influences travel at the finite speed of light, `c`.\n    The general solutions to Maxwell's equations for the scalar potential V and vector potential $\\vec{A}$ are given by the retarded potential integrals:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\int \\dfrac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3\\vec{r}'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\int \\dfrac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3\\vec{r}'$\n    where the retarded time $t_r$ is defined by the relation:\n    $t_r = t - \\dfrac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|}{c}$\n\n2.  **Model the Point Charge:**\n    For a single point charge `q` moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge density $\\rho$ and current density $\\vec{J}$ can be described using Dirac delta functions:\n    *   Charge density: $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    *   Current density: $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$, where $\\vec{v}(t') = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t')}{dt'}$ is the velocity of the charge.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Integrals:**\n    Substituting these densities into the potential integrals makes them seem simple, but the retarded time $t_r$ depends on the integration variable $\\vec{r}'$, which complicates things. A rigorous evaluation involves a change of variables in the integration. The standard result of this evaluation (found in most E&M textbooks like Griffiths, Jackson, etc.) is the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n    Let's define the quantities as in the problem description:\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: Position of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n    *   $\\vec{r}$: Observation point (field point).\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$: The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}|$: The magnitude of this vector.\n    *   $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   The retarded time condition is $c(t - t_r) = d$.\n\n    The result of the integration gives:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n    The term in the denominator, $(d - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}/c)$, accounts for the fact that the volume of the charge appears compressed from the point of view of the observer due to the charge's motion (a Doppler-like effect).\n\n4.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    The expressions derived are in a common textbook format. We need to see which option matches. Let's manipulate the derived expressions to match the format in the options.\n    We can factor out `1/c` from the denominator:\n    $d - \\frac{\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c}$\n    Now substitute this back into the potential expressions:\n\n    For the scalar potential V:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c}} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})}$\n\n    For the vector potential $\\vec{A}$:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{c}} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})}$\n\n    These expressions perfectly match the ones given in option A.\n\n    *   **Option A:** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n        This is correct.\n\n    *   **Option B:** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}$. This is the Coulomb potential for a static charge. It ignores the retardation effect in the denominator and the fact that the relevant distance is `d` (to the retarded position), not necessarily `r` (distance from origin). This is incorrect for a moving charge.\n\n    *   **Option C:** Similar to B, it uses the static potential and has an incorrect relation for $\\vec{A}$.\n\n    *   **Option D:** The sign in the denominator is `+` instead of `-`. This would correspond to \"advanced potentials\" where the effect precedes the cause, which is typically ruled out on physical grounds. Therefore, it is incorrect.\n\nAn important relationship between the Liénard-Wiechert potentials is $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r}, t)$. We can verify this for option A, using the identity $\\mu_o \\epsilon_o = 1/c^2$:\n$\\vec{A} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{(1/\\epsilon_o c^2) qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} \\left[ \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi \\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right] = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$.\nThis confirms the internal consistency of the expressions in option A.\n\nFinal Conclusion: The potentials described are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, and their correct expression is given in Option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
