    "Here is the reasoning process to determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### Step 1: Classify the Substituents\n\nFirst, we need to classify the substituent on each benzene ring (`C6H5-`) as either an *ortho, para-director* or a *meta-director*. This classification is the primary determinant of the product distribution.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions. They generally lead to a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) `C6H5-CH3` (Toluene): -CH3 is an activating, o,p-director.\n    *   3) `C6H5-Cl` (Chlorobenzene): -Cl is a deactivating, o,p-director.\n    *   5) `C6H5-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene): -C2H5 is an activating, o,p-director.\n\n*   **Meta-Directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. The yield of the para-isomer is typically very low.\n    *   2) `C6H5-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate): -COOC2H5 is a deactivating, m-director.\n    *   4) `C6H5-NO2` (Nitrobenzene): -NO2 is a strongly deactivating, m-director.\n    *   6) `C6H5-COOH` (Benzoic acid): -COOH is a deactivating, m-director.\n\nBased on this, the three meta-directing compounds (2, 4, 6) will have the lowest para-isomer yields, while the three ortho,para-directing compounds (1, 3, 5) will have the highest.\n\n### Step 2: Rank the Meta-Directors (Lowest Para Yields)\n\nFor meta-directors, the reaction is highly selective for the meta position. The amount of para-isomer formed is very small and is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group leads to a higher percentage of the meta-isomer and, consequently, a lower percentage of the para-isomer.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength for these groups is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n(The nitro group is one of the strongest deactivators. A carboxylic acid group is generally considered slightly more deactivating than an ester group because the alkyl group in the ester is weakly electron-donating, which slightly reduces the overall deactivating effect.)\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is:\n**4 (Nitrobenzene) < 6 (Benzoic Acid) < 2 (Ethyl Benzoate)**\n\n### Step 3: Rank the Ortho, Para-Directors (Highest Para Yields)\n\nFor ortho,para-directors, the yield of the para-isomer relative to the ortho-isomer depends on steric and electronic factors. A common principle, especially for bulky electrophiles like in bromination, is that greater steric hindrance from the substituent will favor substitution at the less crowded para position.\n\n1.  **Compare Alkyl Groups (Toluene vs. Ethylbenzene):**\n    *   The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   According to the simple steric hindrance principle, the bulkier ethyl group should block the ortho positions more effectively, leading to a higher proportion of the para-isomer compared to the methyl group.\n    *   Therefore, Para% (Toluene) < Para% (Ethylbenzene), which gives the order: **1 < 5**.\n\n2.  **Compare with Chlorobenzene:**\n    *   The chloro group (-Cl) is a special case. While it is deactivating overall, it strongly directs to the para position. The combination of its size and strong inductive effect (repelling the electrophile from the nearby ortho positions) leads to a very high para-to-ortho ratio, often higher than that for simple alkylbenzenes. Experimental data for bromination shows para-dibromobenzene can be up to ~88% of the product yield.\n    *   Thus, chlorobenzene will have the highest percentage of para-isomer among this group.\n    *   Para% (Ethylbenzene) < Para% (Chlorobenzene), which gives the order: **5 < 3**.\n\nCombining these findings, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for the ortho,para-directors is:\n**1 (Toluene) < 5 (Ethylbenzene) < 3 (Chlorobenzene)**\n\n### Step 4: Combine the Rankings\n\nNow, we combine the two ranked groups. The meta-directors have the lowest yields, followed by the ortho,para-directors.\n\n*   Meta-Director Order: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Ortho,Para-Director Order: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nCombining these gives the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
