    "This problem requires us to calculate the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) from the dissociation of a Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Define the Reaction and Equilibrium Constant:**\n    The complex is Ca-EDTA, which we can represent as $[CaY]^{2-}$ (where $Y^{4-}$ represents the fully deprotonated EDTA molecule). The problem gives the formation constant ($K_f$) for this complex.\n    The formation reaction is: $Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [CaY]^{2-}$\n    The formation constant is: $K_f = \\frac{[[CaY]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n    To find the concentration of free $Ca^{2+}$ ions, it's easier to consider the dissociation of the complex. The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n    $[CaY]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n    The equilibrium constant for dissociation ($K_d$) is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n2.  **Set up an ICE Table:**\n    We start with a 0.02 M solution of the complex. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates at equilibrium. According to the stoichiometry of the dissociation reaction, for every mole of $[CaY]^{2-}$ that dissociates, one mole of $Ca^{2+}$ and one mole of $Y^{4-}$ are formed.\n\n    | Species         | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n    |:--------------- |:----------- |:---------- |:--------------- |\n    | $[CaY]^{2-}$     | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n    | $Ca^{2+}$       | 0           | +x         | x               |\n    | $Y^{4-}$        | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n3.  **Write the Dissociation Constant Expression:**\n    Using the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table:\n    $K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}{[[CaY]^{2-}]} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{(0.02 - x)}$\n\n4.  **Solve for x:**\n    Substitute the value of $K_d$:\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{x^2}{0.02 - x}$\n\n    Since $K_d$ is extremely small, we can assume that very little of the complex will dissociate. Therefore, 'x' will be much smaller than the initial concentration of 0.02 M. This allows for the simplification:\n    $0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\n    The equation becomes:\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n\n    Now, we solve for x:\n    $x^2 = (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times (0.02)$\n    $x^2 = 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n\n    To perform the calculation:\n    ```python\n    import math\n    \n    # Equilibrium constant for dissociation\n    Kd = 2e-11\n    \n    # Initial concentration of the complex\n    initial_complex_conc = 0.02\n    \n    # Solve for x where x^2 = Kd * initial_complex_conc\n    x_squared = Kd * initial_complex_conc\n    x = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n    \n    # The concentration of Calcium ions is x\n    print(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n    ```\n\nThe final calculated value is $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. Comparing this to the given options, it matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
