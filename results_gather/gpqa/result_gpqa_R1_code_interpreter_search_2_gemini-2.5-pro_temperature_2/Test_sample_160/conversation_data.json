    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   The scenario involves a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) with a high vacuum.\n    *   **λ1** is the mean free path of the residual gas molecules colliding with each other.\n    *   **λ2** is the mean free path of the high-energy electrons (from the 1000 kV beam) scattering off the residual gas molecules.\n    *   The number density `n` of the gas molecules is constant for both scenarios, as the pressure, volume, and temperature of the compartment are the same.\n    *   The question asks to compare λ2 and λ1.\n\n2.  **Recall the Physics of Mean Free Path (MFP):**\n    The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula is inversely proportional to the number density of target particles (`n`) and the collision cross-section (`σ`):\n    `λ = 1 / (n * σ_effective)`\n\n    The effective cross-section depends on the nature of the colliding particles.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Case for λ1 (Gas-Gas Collisions):**\n    *   This is the standard kinetic theory of gases scenario. We are considering a gas molecule moving through other identical gas molecules.\n    *   All particles are in motion with thermal velocities, described by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. To account for their relative velocities, a factor of `√2` is introduced into the denominator.\n    *   The collision cross-section, `σ_gg`, is determined by the size of the molecules. For two identical spherical molecules of diameter `d`, the cross-section `σ_gg = πd²`.\n    *   Therefore, the formula for λ1 is:\n        `λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg) = 1 / (√2 * n * π * d²) `\n\n4.  **Analyze the Case for λ2 (Electron-Gas Collisions):**\n    *   This scenario involves a beam of high-energy (1000 keV) electrons moving through the gas.\n    *   The velocity of these electrons is extremely high (close to the speed of light) compared to the thermal velocity of the gas molecules. Therefore, the gas molecules can be considered stationary targets. The `√2` factor, which accounts for moving targets, is not applicable here.\n    *   The scattering cross-section, `σ_eg`, describes the interaction between a point-like electron and a gas molecule of diameter `d`. In a simple hard-sphere model, the electron needs to pass within a distance of the molecule's radius (`d/2`) from its center to \"collide\".\n    *   The cross-section is the area of a circle with radius `d/2`: `σ_eg = π * (d/2)² = πd² / 4`.\n    *   Therefore, the formula for λ2 is:\n        `λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg) = 1 / (n * (πd² / 4)) = 4 / (n * π * d²) `\n\n5.  **Compare λ1 and λ2:**\n    Now, let's find the ratio of λ2 to λ1 using the expressions from steps 3 and 4.\n    `λ2 / λ1 = [ 4 / (n * π * d²) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * π * d²) ]`\n    `λ2 / λ1 = 4 * √2`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Numerical Value and Evaluate Options:**\n    *   We know `√2 ≈ 1.414`.\n    *   So, `λ2 / λ1 ≈ 4 * 1.414 = 5.656`.\n    *   This means `λ2 ≈ 5.656 * λ1`.\n    *   Now let's look at the given options:\n        A) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1\n        B) λ2 < λ1\n        C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1\n        D) λ2 = λ1\n    *   Our result, `λ2 ≈ 5.656 * λ1`, clearly shows that `λ2` is much larger than `λ1`. It fits the condition `λ2 >= 1.22*λ1`.\n\n7.  **Consider Alternative Models and Physical Refinements:**\n    *   What if we assume the cross-sections are equal (`σ_gg = σ_eg`) for some reason? Even then, the ratio would be determined by the `√2` factor alone: `λ2 / λ1 = √2 ≈ 1.414`. This value is still greater than 1.22, so it also supports option C.\n    *   In reality, for very high-energy electrons (1000 keV), the scattering cross-section `σ_eg` is actually much *smaller* than the kinetic cross-section `σ_gg`. This is because the electron is moving so fast that its interaction time with the molecule's electric field is very short, reducing the probability of scattering. If `σ_eg` is smaller than the hard-sphere model predicts, the ratio `λ2/λ1 = (√2 * σ_gg) / σ_eg` would be even larger than `5.656`.\n    *   All plausible physical models lead to the same conclusion: `λ2` is significantly larger than `λ1`, and the ratio `λ2/λ1` is well above 1.22.\n\n8.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The mean free path for an electron in the beam (`λ2`) is substantially longer than the mean free path for a gas molecule (`λ1`). This is because:\n    1.  The electron's targets (gas molecules) are effectively stationary, removing the `√2` factor that reduces λ1.\n    2.  The effective collision cross-section for an electron is smaller than that for two molecules colliding.\n\nBoth factors make `λ2` larger than `λ1`. The minimum theoretical enhancement is a factor of `√2 ≈ 1.414`. Therefore, the condition `λ2 >= 1.22*λ1` is robustly true.\n\n<<<C>>>"
