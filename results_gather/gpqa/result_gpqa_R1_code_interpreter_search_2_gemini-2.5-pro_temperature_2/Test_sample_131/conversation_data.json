    "Here is my reasoning and thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Compounds:** Two aromatic compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14.\n    *   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio.\n    *   **1H NMR Data:**\n        *   Aromatic region (~6.7 ppm): Two singlets, integration ratio 1:1.\n        *   Aliphatic region (~2.2 ppm): Three singlets, integration ratio 2:1:1.\n    *   **Options:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Candidate Compounds:**\n    I will predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds based on their molecular structure and symmetry. The key is to identify the number of chemically non-equivalent protons.\n\n    *   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n        *   **Formula:** C6H4(C2H5)2 = C10H14. This fits.\n        *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry. There's a plane of symmetry through both ethyl groups and another one perpendicular to it.\n        *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** (for 4H).\n        *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The methylene (CH2) protons will couple with the methyl (CH3) protons. This will produce a **quartet** (for 4H) and a **triplet** (for 6H).\n        *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a quartet and a triplet contradicts the experimental data, which states all signals are singlets. Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene cannot be one of the compounds. This eliminates **Option C**.\n\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n        *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. This fits.\n        *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry. Two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n        *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at positions 3 and 6) are equivalent. This will produce **one aromatic singlet** (for 2H).\n        *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. This will produce **one aliphatic singlet** (for 12H).\n        *   **Summary (Durene):** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n    *   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n        *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. This fits.\n        *   **Symmetry:** One plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n        *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at positions 5 and 6) are equivalent. This will produce **one aromatic singlet** (for 2H).\n        *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are also equivalent but different from the C1/C4 pair. This will produce **two aliphatic singlets** (each for 6H).\n        *   **Summary (Prehnitene):** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H each).\n\n    *   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n        *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. This fits.\n        *   **Symmetry:** No plane of symmetry that simplifies the structure significantly for NMR purposes. All proton and methyl environments are unique.\n        *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at positions 4 and 6) are in different chemical environments. This will produce **two aromatic singlets** (each for 1H).\n        *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups are in different chemical environments. This will produce **four aliphatic singlets** (each for 3H).\n        *   **Summary (Isodurene):** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 4 aliphatic singlets (3H each).\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Mixture Options:**\n    Now I will simulate the spectrum of a 1:1 mixture for the remaining options (A, B, and D) and compare it to the experimental data.\n\n    *   **Data Requirement:** 2 aromatic signals (1:1 ratio) and 3 aliphatic signals (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n    *   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n        *   **Aromatic:** (1 signal, 2H) from 1,2,4,5-TMB + (2 signals, 1H each) from 1,2,3,5-TMB. This would result in three aromatic signals with a 2:1:1 ratio (assuming no overlap). This does not match.\n        *   **Aliphatic:** (1 signal, 12H) + (4 signals, 3H each). This would result in five aliphatic signals. This does not match.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Option A is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option B: 1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n        *   **Aromatic:** (1 signal, 2H) from 1,2,3,4-TMB + (2 signals, 1H each) from 1,2,3,5-TMB. This would result in three aromatic signals with a 2:1:1 ratio (assuming no overlap). This does not match.\n        *   **Aliphatic:** (2 signals, 6H each) + (4 signals, 3H each). This would result in six aliphatic signals. This does not match.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Option B is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB**\n        *   **Aromatic:**\n            *   1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet for 2H.\n            *   1,2,3,4-TMB gives one singlet for 2H.\n            *   Assuming their chemical shifts are slightly different, the 1:1 mixture will show **two singlets**. Since each corresponds to 2 protons from one of the equimolar compounds, their integration ratio will be 2H : 2H, which simplifies to **1:1**. This **matches** the experimental data.\n        *   **Aliphatic:**\n            *   1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet for 12H.\n            *   1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets, each for 6H.\n            *   Assuming all three of these signals have unique chemical shifts, the 1:1 mixture will show **three singlets**. The integration ratio will be 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This **matches** the experimental data.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Option D perfectly explains the observed 1H NMR spectrum.\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n*   Aromatic Signals: (1 singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB, 2H) + (1 singlet from 1,2,3,4-TMB, 2H) -> 2 signals in a 1:1 ratio. (Match)\n*   Aliphatic Signals: (1 singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB, 12H) + (2 singlets from 1,2,3,4-TMB, 6H each) -> 3 signals in a 2:1:1 ratio. (Match)\n\nTherefore, the two compounds in the mixture are 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>"
