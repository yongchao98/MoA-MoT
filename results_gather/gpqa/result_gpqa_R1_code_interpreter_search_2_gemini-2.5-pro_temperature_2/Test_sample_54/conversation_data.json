    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to identify the unknown compound from its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the 1H NMR Data\n\nLet's analyze each signal provided:\n\n*   **Signal 1: `2.1 ppm (3H, s)`**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This indicates the signal is produced by three equivalent protons, which is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s):** A singlet means that this methyl group has no adjacent protons to couple with (it's an isolated methyl group).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** A methyl group appearing as a singlet around 2.1-2.2 ppm is highly characteristic of an acetate methyl group (CH₃-C=O). All four possible compounds are acetates, so this fits perfectly.\n\n*   **Signal 2: `1.6 ppm (3H, d)`**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This is another methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d):** A doublet means this methyl group is coupled to a single adjacent proton (according to the n+1 rule, a doublet means n+1=2, so n=1).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This shift is typical for an allylic methyl group, i.e., a methyl group attached to a C=C double bond. This signal corresponds to the `CH₃-CH=` part of the molecule.\n\n*   **Signal 3: `5.5 ppm (1H, dq)`**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal corresponds to a single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** This shift is in the vinylic region (5-6 ppm), indicating a proton on a C=C double bond.\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq):** A doublet of quartets means this proton is split by two different sets of neighbors:\n        *   The 'd' (doublet) comes from coupling to one neighboring proton.\n        *   The 'q' (quartet) comes from coupling to three neighboring protons (n+1=4, so n=3), which must be the methyl group we identified at 1.6 ppm.\n    *   This proton must be the `H` in `CH=CH-CH₃`.\n\n*   **Signal 4: `7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)`**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This is another single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is also in the vinylic region, but significantly downfield (further to the left). A vinylic proton attached to an oxygen atom (-O-CH=) is highly deshielded and would appear at such a low field.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d):** A doublet indicates it is coupled to a single neighboring proton, which must be the other vinylic proton at 5.5 ppm.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is the key to determining the stereochemistry. For protons across a double bond:\n        *   A *trans* relationship (protons on opposite sides) has a large coupling constant, typically **12-18 Hz**.\n        *   A *cis* relationship (protons on the same side) has a smaller coupling constant, typically **6-12 Hz**.\n    *   The observed J value of **16.0 Hz** strongly indicates a **trans** configuration.\n\n### 2. Assembling the Molecular Structure\n\nBased on the fragments identified:\n1.  We have an acetate group: `CH₃-COO-` (from the signal at 2.1 ppm).\n2.  We have a propenyl group: `-CH=CH-CH₃` (from the signals at 7.0, 5.5, and 1.6 ppm).\n3.  Connecting these gives the molecule **propenyl acetate**: `CH₃-COO-CH=CH-CH₃`.\n4.  The total proton count from the NMR data is 3H + 3H + 1H + 1H = 8H. The structure `CH₃-COO-CH=CH-CH₃` also has 3+1+1+3 = 8 protons. This confirms that the compound is a propenyl acetate, not a butenyl acetate (which would have more protons). This eliminates options B and D.\n\n### 3. Determining the Stereochemistry\n\nWe are left to choose between Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. As established from the J-coupling constant (16.0 Hz), the two protons on the double bond are in a **trans** configuration.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe NMR data corresponds to a structure with an acetate group, a propenyl group, and a *trans* stereochemistry about the double bond. The unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
