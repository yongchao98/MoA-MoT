Primary amines exhibit both an asymmetric and a symmetric N-H stretching vibration, which results in two separate peaks.\n2.  **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group. The frequency is typical for an ester, specifically an α,β-unsaturated or aromatic ester, which usually absorbs in the 1715-1730 cm⁻¹ range. This is slightly lower than a saturated aliphatic ester (1735-1750 cm⁻¹).\n\nFrom the IR data, we can deduce that the molecule contains both a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ester (R-COO-R') functional group, where the carbonyl is likely conjugated with a double bond or an aromatic ring.\n\n### **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n1.  **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal is a triplet and integrates to three protons. This pattern is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH₃) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n2.  **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal is a quartet and integrates to two protons. This pattern indicates a methylene group (-CH₂) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃). The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm strongly suggests the presence of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) implies that the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, such as an oxygen in an ester or ether linkage (R-O-CH₂CH₃).\n3.  **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is typical for exchangeable protons like those in an -OH or -NH₂ group. Given the IR evidence for a primary amine, this signal corresponds to the two protons of the -NH₂ group.\n4.  **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The appearance of two doublets in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm), each integrating to two protons, is the classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two substituents on the ring are electronically different, causing the protons on one side of the ring to be different from those on the other. The protons at 8.0 ppm are deshielded, suggesting they are adjacent to a strong electron-withdrawing group (like the ester's carbonyl group). The protons at 7.0 ppm are more shielded, suggesting they are adjacent to an electron-donating group (like the amine group).\n\n### **Evaluating the Proposed Structures**\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:**\n    *   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂ (Correct)\n    *   **Functional Groups:** Contains a primary amine (-NH₂), an aromatic ring, and an ethyl ester group. This matches the IR data.\n    *   **¹H NMR Prediction:**\n        *   An ethyl group attached to the ester oxygen (-OCH₂CH₃) would show a triplet around 1.3 ppm and a quartet around 4.3 ppm. This matches the signals at 1.20 ppm (t) and 4.5 ppm (q).\n        *   A primary amine (-NH₂) would show a broad singlet for 2H, matching the signal at 4.0 ppm.\n        *   A para-substituted ring with an electron-donating -NH₂ group and an electron-withdrawing -COOEt group would show two doublets, each for 2H. This matches the signals at 7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This structure is perfectly consistent with all the provided data.\n\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:**\n    *   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂ (Correct)\n    *   **Functional Groups:** Contains a primary amide (-CONH₂). The C=O stretch for an amide is typically lower than 1720 cm⁻¹, usually around 1650-1690 cm⁻¹. This is inconsistent with the IR data. The ¹H NMR would also show a more complex pattern for the aromatic protons (not two simple doublets).\n\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:**\n    *   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂ (Correct)\n    *   **Functional Groups:** Contains a propionate group (-O-CO-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **¹H NMR Prediction:** This would have an ethyl group attached to a carbonyl, giving a quartet around 2.2-2.6 ppm and a triplet around 1.1 ppm. The observed spectrum has a quartet at 4.5 ppm, which is indicative of a -CH₂- group attached to an oxygen, not a carbonyl. This is inconsistent with the NMR data.\n\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:**\n    *   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂ (Correct)\n    *   **Functional Groups:** Contains a secondary amide (-NH-CHO). This would show only one N-H stretch in the IR, not two. The amide C=O stretch would also be at a lower frequency. The ¹H NMR would show a signal for the formyl proton (-CHO) around 8-8.5 ppm and only one N-H proton. This is inconsistent with both IR and NMR data.\n\n### **Final Identification**\n\nThe only structure that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on the spectral data provided, the compound is identified as follows:\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula & Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula C9H11NO2 has a degree of unsaturation of 5. This is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The two medium-to-strong bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is in the typical range for a **carbonyl (C=O) stretch**. Its position suggests it is part of a conjugated ester.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂). This is the typical upfield part of an ethyl group.\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons suggests a methylene group (-CH₂) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃). The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm indicates this methylene group is attached to a very electronegative atom, which in this context is the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂-). Together, the signals at 1.20 and 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an **ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons on a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are the classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The difference in chemical shifts indicates one substituent is electron-donating (shielding the adjacent protons to ~7.0 ppm) and the other is electron-withdrawing (deshielding the adjacent protons to ~8.0 ppm). The amino group is donating, and the ethyl ester group is withdrawing, which perfectly fits this pattern.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combined data points to a structure with a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, a primary amine group, and an ethyl ester group. This corresponds to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. The NMR would show a propionyl group, not an ethyl ester.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. This is a primary amide (different IR and NMR signals) and is 1,3-disubstituted (different aromatic NMR pattern).\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. This is a secondary amide (would show only one N-H band in IR) and has a formyl proton signal in the NMR.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure is fully consistent with the molecular formula, IR, and ¹H NMR data.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond (e.g., a C=O group).\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of medium-to-strong bands is characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl region and is typical for the C=O stretch of an ester.\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl (-CH₃) group.\n    *   **Splitting (t, triplet):** According to the n+1 rule, this methyl group is adjacent to a methylene (-CH₂-) group (2+1=3 peaks).\n    *   This signal is the -CH₃ part of an ethyl group.\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents a methylene (-CH₂-) group.\n    *   **Splitting (q, quartet):** This methylene group is adjacent to a methyl (-CH₃) group (3+1=4 peaks).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very downfield shift for a methylene group, indicating it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n    *   Together, the signals at 1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an **ethyl ester** fragment (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents two protons.\n    *   **Splitting (bs, broad singlet):** Broad signals are typical for exchangeable protons, such as those on an -OH or -NH group.\n    *   This signal corresponds to the two protons of the primary amine (-NH₂) group identified in the IR spectrum.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (4H total):** Four protons in the aromatic region.\n    *   **Splitting Pattern:** Two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The protons at 8.0 ppm are more deshielded (further downfield) because they are ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n    *   The protons at 7.0 ppm are more shielded (further upfield) because they are ortho to the electron-donating amine group.\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, the molecule contains:\n*   A para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   A primary amine group (-NH₂).\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nPutting these pieces together gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check the given options:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure matches all the data perfectly.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer, but it has a propionyl group (CH₃CH₂CO-), not an ethyl ester. The NMR would show a quartet for the CH₂ next to the C=O at a much lower chemical shift (~2.4 ppm), not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted ring, which would give a more complex NMR splitting pattern, not two doublets. Also, the C=O of an amide is typically at a lower frequency (~1680 cm⁻¹) than the observed 1720 cm⁻¹.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide (-NH-), which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR, not the two observed for a primary amine.\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula and Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) Calculation:**\n    *   The formula for DoU is: `C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)`, where C is the number of carbons, H is hydrogens, X is halogens, and N is nitrogens.\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2)\n    *   DoU = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5\n    *   DoU = 5\n*   **Interpretation of DoU:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: 3 double bonds + 1 ring) plus one additional degree of unsaturation, which is typically a double bond (like C=O or C=C).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** This pair of sharp bands is characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂). A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one band, and an amide would also have bands in this region but other features would differ.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The position is too high for a simple amide (typically ~1680 cm⁻¹) but is perfect for an ester, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **IR Summary:** The data strongly suggests the presence of a primary amine (-NH₂) and a conjugated ester group (-COO-R).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Splitting (t, triplet):** The signal is split by 2 adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a methyl group next to a methylene group (-CH₂-), which is the classic signature of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Splitting (q, quartet):** The signal is split by 3 adjacent protons (n+1=4, so n=3).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a methylene group next to a methyl group. This confirms the presence of an **ethyl group**.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very downfield shift for a -CH₂- group, indicating it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom in an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents two protons.\n    *   **Splitting (bs, broad singlet):** The broadness and chemical shift are characteristic of the two protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). These protons are exchangeable, which often leads to signal broadening. This confirms the IR data.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift Region (7.0-8.0 ppm):** This is the aromatic region. The total integration is 2H + 2H = 4H, which corresponds to a disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **Splitting Pattern (two doublets):** A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The doublet at 8.0 ppm is significantly downfield, indicating these protons are adjacent to a strong electron-withdrawing group (like the ester's carbonyl). The doublet at 7.0 ppm is more upfield, indicating these protons are adjacent to an electron-donating group (like the amine).\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Structure and Verify**\n\nBased on the analysis of all the data:\n1.  We have a **1,4-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n2.  One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**.\n3.  The other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group**.\n\nLet's put these pieces together: The structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Check against formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂. The structure has a C₆H₄ ring, a -NH₂ group, and a -COOCH₂CH₃ group. Total atoms: (C₆+C₁+C₂) + (H₄+H₂+H₅) + N + O₂ = C₉H₁₁NO₂. The formula matches.\n*   **Check against spectra:** The structure has all the required functional groups and proton environments to explain the IR and NMR data perfectly.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the Given Options**\n\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an ester, but the oxygen is attached to the ring, and the carbonyl is part of a propyl chain. The NMR for the ethyl group would be different (CH₃CH₂C=O), with the -CH₂- appearing around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine. The IR would show one N-H band, and the C=O stretch would be at a lower frequency.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the analytical data derived above.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide (C=O stretch would be ~1680 cm⁻¹) and it is 1,3-disubstituted (meta), which would give a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two simple doublets.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)`\n    *   For C9H11NO2: `DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5`\n*   A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond (e.g., a C=O carbonyl group).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value around 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for an **ester** functional group, especially when conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is generally too high for an amide and too low for a simple saturated ester.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Corresponds to three protons, suggesting a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (t, triplet):** The signal is split into a triplet, which means it is adjacent to a carbon with two protons (a -CH₂- group), according to the n+1 rule.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons, suggesting a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (q, quartet):** The signal is split into a quartet, meaning it is adjacent to a carbon with three protons (a -CH₃ group).\n    *   **Putting it together:** The triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm are a classic signature for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The high chemical shift (4.5 ppm) of the -CH₂- group indicates it is attached to a very electronegative atom, such as the oxygen in an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (bs, broad singlet):** The broadness is typical for exchangeable protons, such as those in -OH or -NH groups. Combined with the IR data, this signal is confidently assigned to the **primary amine (-NH₂)** protons.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** There are a total of four protons in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet for both):** A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The protons at 8.0 ppm are significantly downfield (deshielded), suggesting they are ortho to a strong electron-withdrawing group (like the ester carbonyl). The protons at 7.0 ppm are upfield (shielded), suggesting they are ortho to an electron-donating group (like the amine).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis of the fragments:\n*   We have a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n*   The two substituents are a **primary amine (-NH₂)** and an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\nLet's combine these pieces to form the final structure: **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nThis structure is consistent with all the data:\n*   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂ (C₆H₄ + NH₂ + COOCH₂CH₃ = C₉H₁₁NO₂) - **Matches**\n*   **IR:** Has a primary amine and an ester group. - **Matches**\n*   **¹H NMR:** Has an ethyl group attached to the ester oxygen, a primary amine, and a para-disubstituted aromatic ring with the expected electronic effects on the proton chemical shifts. - **Matches**\n\n**5. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: The -CH₂- of the propionate group would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine and an ester. The IR and NMR would be different.\n*   C) **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data.\n*   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is a primary amide (different C=O stretch) and is meta-substituted (different aromatic NMR pattern).\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe previous step correctly calculated the Degree of Unsaturation as 5.0. The checker feedback indicated a formula mismatch between the proposed answer (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, C9H11N1O2) and the given formula (C9H11NO2). This feedback is incorrect, as these two formulas are identical. My analysis shows that ethyl 4-aminobenzoate is the only structure that fits all the spectral data. I will now provide the complete analysis to justify the final answer.\n\n*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Synthesize the information from the molecular formula (DoU=5), IR spectrum, and 1H NMR spectrum.\n    2.  Systematically evaluate each of the given options against the combined spectral evidence.\n    3.  Conclude with the only structure that is fully consistent with all data.\n\n*   **Execution (Action 2):**\n    I will now perform a comprehensive analysis of all the data to identify the correct compound.\n\n    1.  **Molecular Formula & DoU:** C9H11NO2. The Degree of Unsaturation is 5. This strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional pi bond (1 degree), likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n    2.  **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   The two bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. This immediately rules out option **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**, which is a secondary amide and would only show one N-H band.\n        *   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is in the carbonyl region. This frequency is typical for a conjugated **ester**. It is generally too high for a conjugated amide (like in option A) and a bit low for a phenyl ester (like in option D), making a conjugated ethyl ester the best fit.\n\n    3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   The signals at **1.20 ppm (triplet, 3H)** and **4.5 ppm (quartet, 2H)** are the definitive signature of an **ethyl group attached to an oxygen (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. The very downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm is characteristic of an ethyl ester. This piece of evidence rules out:\n            *   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide**: This has an ethoxy group, but the -OCH₂- quartet would be around 4.0-4.1 ppm.\n            *   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate**: This has a propionyl group (-CO-CH₂CH₃). The quartet for the -CH₂- group adjacent to a carbonyl would appear around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n        *   The signal at **4.0 ppm (broad singlet, 2H)** confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group.\n        *   The signals at **7.0 ppm (doublet, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H)** indicate a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This rules out option **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide**, which is meta-substituted.\n\n    **Conclusion:**\n    Every piece of spectral data points unequivocally to **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n    *   It has a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   It has an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   It has a 1,4-disubstituted (para) ring.\n    *   Its molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n\n    Therefore, option B is the only correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nBased on the detailed analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the compound is identified as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Here is a breakdown of how the data corresponds to the structure:\n\n*   **Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2):** The formula is consistent with ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, also known as Benzocaine. The calculated degree of unsaturation is 5, which accounts for a benzene ring (4 degrees) and a carbonyl group (1 degree).\n\n*   **IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The medium to strong bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is indicative of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. This frequency is typical for an ester that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This triplet signal with an integration of three protons represents a methyl group (-CH₃) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). The broadness is due to quadripolar relaxation and exchange.\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This quartet, integrating to two protons, corresponds to a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group. Its downfield chemical shift indicates it is attached to an electronegative oxygen atom, as in an ethyl ester (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pair of doublets in the aromatic region is a classic pattern for a 1,4- (or para-) disubstituted benzene ring. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-donating amino group, while the downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing ethyl ester group.\n\nAll other possible isomers are inconsistent with one or more of the provided data points. For example, N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide would show a formyl proton signal in the NMR, and 4-aminophenyl propionate would have a different splitting pattern for the alkyl chain. Therefore, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the identification of the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n### 1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for calculating the DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`.\n*   **Calculation:** DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in this region is a classic indicator of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. These correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a **carbonyl (C=O) stretch from an ester group**. The frequency is generally too high for an amide and fits perfectly for an ester conjugated with a benzene ring.\n\n### 3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 protons indicates a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃-).\n    *   Taken together, the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The significant downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm suggests the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, such as the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of the protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. This confirms the interpretation from the IR spectrum. The broadness is due to quadropole broadening from the nitrogen atom and potential hydrogen exchange.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, are the signature pattern of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The protons at 7.0 ppm are upfield, indicating they are adjacent to an electron-donating group (the -NH₂ group).\n    *   The protons at 8.0 ppm are downfield, indicating they are adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester's carbonyl group, -COOEt).\n\n### 4. Structure Assembly and Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of all the data:\n*   We have a **1,4-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n*   One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n*   The other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\nAssembling these pieces gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. This structure matches the molecular formula C9H11NO2 and is consistent with all IR and ¹H NMR data provided.\n\nLet's review the options:\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. The NMR shift for the -CH₂- of the propionate group would be around 2.3-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR and NMR data for a primary amine.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure perfectly matches all spectral data.\n*   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a primary amide (contradicts IR C=O stretch) and is 1,3-disubstituted (contradicts NMR aromatic pattern).\n\nTherefore, the compound is identified as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   The molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n*   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** This pair of medium-to-strong bands is a characteristic doublet for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching of a primary amine (-NH2).\n*   **1720 cm-1:** This strong band is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is consistent with an ester that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n**3. 1H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are deshielded by an electron-withdrawing group (EWG), while the protons at 7.0 ppm are shielded by an electron-donating group (EDG).\n*   **Aliphatic/Functional Group Region:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair confirms the presence of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The high chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates the methylene (-CH2-) group is attached to an oxygen atom, as in an ethyl ester (-O-CH2CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet corresponds to the two exchangeable protons of the primary amine (-NH2) group, which is consistent with the IR data.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n*   The pieces are: a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, a primary amine group (-NH2), and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n*   The -NH2 group is an EDG, and the -COOCH2CH3 group is an EWG.\n*   Placing the EDG (-NH2) and EWG (-COOCH2CH3) in a para arrangement on the benzene ring explains the NMR aromatic signals perfectly. The protons adjacent to the -NH2 group are shielded (appear at 7.0 ppm), and the protons adjacent to the ester group are deshielded (appear at 8.0 ppm).\n*   This leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**5. Verifying the Options**\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an isomer, but the NMR for the propionate group (-O-CO-CH2CH3) would show a quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is a meta-substituted amide. The aromatic NMR pattern would be more complex, not two doublets.\n*   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide. The IR would show only one N-H band, and the NMR would lack the -NH2 signal.\n*   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: This structure perfectly matches all spectral data (IR, NMR) and the molecular formula (C9H11NO2).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n### 1. Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe degree of unsaturation indicates the total number of rings and π bonds within a molecule. It is calculated using the formula:\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n\nFor the molecular formula C9H11NO2:\nDoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n\nA degree of unsaturation of 5 is characteristic of a substituted benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: 1 ring and 3 double bonds) plus one additional double bond, typically a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is a clear indication of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. This frequency is typical for an ester.\n\n### 3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Analysis\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons suggests a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons indicates a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃). The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and this quartet at 4.5 ppm confirms the presence of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The significant downfield chemical shift (4.5 ppm) suggests this methylene group is bonded to a highly electronegative atom, such as the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). The signal is often broad due to nitrogen's quadrupolar moment and chemical exchange.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm) is a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two protons on the ring ortho to the electron-donating amino group are shifted upfield (7.0 ppm), while the two protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group are shifted downfield (8.0 ppm).\n\n### 4. Structure Determination\n\nBased on the analysis of the spectral data, we can assemble the following fragments:\n*   A primary amine group (-NH₂)\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃)\n*   A para-disubstituted benzene ring\n\nConnecting these fragments results in the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. This structure is consistent with the molecular formula (C9H11NO2) and all the spectroscopic data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing our deduced structure with the given options:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches our findings perfectly.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Would have a different ester group and thus a different NMR pattern for the alkyl chain.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Is an amide, which would show a different C=O stretch in the IR and would lack the two N-H stretches of a primary amine.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Is meta-substituted, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum.\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThe analysis of the spectral data is complete and has been verified.\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula & DoU:** C9H11NO2 gives a Degree of Unsaturation of 5, consistent with a substituted benzene ring (4) and a carbonyl group (1).\n2.  **IR Spectrum:** The two bands at 3420/3325 cm⁻¹ confirm a primary amine (-NH2). The strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹ confirms a conjugated ester carbonyl (C=O).\n3.  **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The triplet (3H) at 1.20 ppm and quartet (2H) at 4.5 ppm confirm an ethyl ester group (-O-CH2CH3).\n    *   The two doublets (2H each) at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm confirm a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   The broad singlet (2H) at 4.0 ppm corresponds to the primary amine protons (-NH2).\n\nCombining these pieces of evidence:\n*   A para-substituted benzene ring...\n*   ...with a primary amine group (-NH2) on one side...\n*   ...and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3) on the other.\n\nThis structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. The code execution confirms that only candidate B satisfies all constraints derived from the data.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n**Proposer's Initial Analysis**\n\nThe provided data is for a compound with the formula C9H11NO2.\n1.  **Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula corresponds to 5 degrees of unsaturation, suggesting a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional double bond (C=O or C=C).\n2.  **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The two bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   The strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹ is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) group, specifically an ester.\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The signals at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two distinct doublets suggest one substituent is electron-donating and the other is electron-withdrawing.\n    *   The triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) and the quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) are the classic signature of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The significant downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm indicates the methylene (-CH₂) group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, such as the oxygen of an ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H) is consistent with the two protons of a primary amino group (-NH₂) attached to the aromatic ring. Its broadness is due to quadrupole broadening from the nitrogen atom and potential chemical exchange.\n\n**Proposed Solution Path**\n\nBased on this analysis, the compound is likely ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (structure A). This structure contains a primary amine, an ester, an ethyl group, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, all of which are directly supported by the IR and NMR data. The electron-donating amino group would cause the adjacent aromatic protons to be shielded (appear upfield at ~7.0 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing ethyl ester group would cause its adjacent protons to be deshielded (appear downfield at ~8.0 ppm). This matches the observed spectrum. The next logical step is to confirm the spectral data for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n**Skeptic's Cross-Examination**\n\nThe initial analysis strongly favors ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (A). However, to be certain, let's verify the expected spectral data against published values for all candidates.\n\n1.  **Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (A):**\n    *   **¹H NMR:** A published spectrum shows peaks at δ 1.35 (t, 3H), 4.16 (s, br, 2H, -NH₂), 4.31 (q, 2H), 6.62 (d, 2H), and 7.84 (d, 2H). This is an excellent match to the provided data (1.20, 4.0, 4.5, 7.0, 8.0 ppm). Minor differences in chemical shifts are expected due to solvent effects and spectrometer calibration.\n    *   **IR:** A reference IR spectrum for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (also known as Benzocaine) shows characteristic N-H stretches for a primary amine around 3300-3230 cm⁻¹. This confirms the assignment of the bands at 3420 and 3325 cm⁻¹. The C=O ester stretch is also confirmed to be in the expected region.\n\n2.  **4-aminophenyl propionate (B):**\n    *   **¹H NMR:** The key difference would be the chemical shift of the methylene protons of the ethyl group. In a propionate ester attached to a phenol, the -COCH₂CH₃ group would show a quartet around 2.2-2.6 ppm. This is significantly different from the 4.5 ppm observed in the data. The NMR spectrum for propionic acid shows this quartet at 2.17 ppm. This structure is inconsistent.\n\n3.  **N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide (C):**\n    *   **IR:** This is a secondary amide (-NH-), which would show only *one* N-H stretch, not two. The provided data (3420 and 3325 cm⁻¹) is a clear indication of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   **¹H NMR:** This structure has a formyl proton (-N-CHO) which would appear as a singlet far downfield, typically >8.0 ppm. This signal is absent. Furthermore, the ethoxy quartet (-OCH₂CH₃) in the related compound phenacetin appears at 4.0 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. This structure is inconsistent.\n\n4.  **3-ethoxybenzamide (D):**\n    *   **¹H NMR:** This structure has a 1,3- (meta) substitution pattern on the benzene ring. This would result in a more complex splitting pattern, not the two clean doublets characteristic of 1,4- (para) substitution seen in the data at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. The IR would show two N-H bands from the primary amide, but the NMR aromatic region is a clear mismatch.\n\n**Convergence and Final Decision**\n\nThe search results confirm the initial analysis. The IR and ¹H NMR data are highly characteristic of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The IR bands confirm a primary amine and a carbonyl group. The ¹H NMR signals perfectly match the pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted ring bearing an amino group and an ethyl ester group. The spectral data for the other isomers are inconsistent with the provided information.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound from the provided spectral data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂\n*   **DoU Calculation:** The formula for the degree of unsaturation is `C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`.\n*   `DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5`.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional pi bond, which is likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of medium-to-strong bands is the classic signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong band is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region.

The amine is an electron-donating group, and the ester is an electron-withdrawing group, which explains the aromatic proton shifts.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer, but the ethyl group is part of a propionate ester (-O-CO-CH₂CH₃). The NMR signal for the -CH₂- group next to the carbonyl would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine. The IR would show only one N-H band, and the NMR would be missing the 2H signal for the -NH₂ group.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a 1,3- (meta) substituted ring, which would give a more complex aromatic NMR pattern, not two clean doublets.

Primary amines exhibit both an asymmetric and a symmetric N-H stretching vibration, which results in two separate peaks.\n2.  **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group. The frequency is typical for an ester, specifically an α,β-unsaturated or aromatic ester, which usually absorbs in the 1715-1730 cm⁻¹ range. This is slightly lower than a saturated aliphatic ester (1735-1750 cm⁻¹).\n\nFrom the IR data, we can deduce that the molecule contains both a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ester (R-COO-R') functional group, where the carbonyl is likely conjugated with a double bond or an aromatic ring.\n\n### **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n1.  **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal is a triplet and integrates to three protons. This pattern is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH₃) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n2.  **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal is a quartet and integrates to two protons. This pattern indicates a methylene group (-CH₂) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃). The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm strongly suggests the presence of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) implies that the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, such as an oxygen in an ester or ether linkage (R-O-CH₂CH₃).\n3.  **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is typical for exchangeable protons like those in an -OH or -NH₂ group. Given the IR evidence for a primary amine, this signal corresponds to the two protons of the -NH₂ group.\n4.  **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The appearance of two doublets in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm), each integrating to two protons, is the classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two substituents on the ring are electronically different, causing the protons on one side of the ring to be different from those on the other. The protons at 8.0 ppm are deshielded, suggesting they are adjacent to a strong electron-withdrawing group (like the ester's carbonyl group). The protons at 7.0 ppm are more shielded, suggesting they are adjacent to an electron-donating group (like the amine group).\n\n### **Evaluating the Proposed Structures**\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:**\n    *   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂ (Correct)\n    *   **Functional Groups:** Contains a primary amine (-NH₂), an aromatic ring, and an ethyl ester group. This matches the IR data.\n    *   **¹H NMR Prediction:**\n        *   An ethyl group attached to the ester oxygen (-OCH₂CH₃) would show a triplet around 1.3 ppm and a quartet around 4.3 ppm. This matches the signals at 1.20 ppm (t) and 4.5 ppm (q).\n        *   A primary amine (-NH₂) would show a broad singlet for 2H, matching the signal at 4.0 ppm.\n        *   A para-substituted ring with an electron-donating -NH₂ group and an electron-withdrawing -COOEt group would show two doublets, each for 2H. This matches the signals at 7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This structure is perfectly consistent with all the provided data.\n\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:**\n    *   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂ (Correct)\n    *   **Functional Groups:** Contains a primary amide (-CONH₂). The C=O stretch for an amide is typically lower than 1720 cm⁻¹, usually around 1650-1690 cm⁻¹. This is inconsistent with the IR data. The ¹H NMR would also show a more complex pattern for the aromatic protons (not two simple doublets).\n\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:**\n    *   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂ (Correct)\n    *   **Functional Groups:** Contains a propionate group (-O-CO-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **¹H NMR Prediction:** This would have an ethyl group attached to a carbonyl, giving a quartet around 2.2-2.6 ppm and a triplet around 1.1 ppm. The observed spectrum has a quartet at 4.5 ppm, which is indicative of a -CH₂- group attached to an oxygen, not a carbonyl. This is inconsistent with the NMR data.\n\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:**\n    *   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂ (Correct)\n    *   **Functional Groups:** Contains a secondary amide (-NH-CHO). This would show only one N-H stretch in the IR, not two. The amide C=O stretch would also be at a lower frequency. The ¹H NMR would show a signal for the formyl proton (-CHO) around 8-8.5 ppm and only one N-H proton. This is inconsistent with both IR and NMR data.\n\n### **Final Identification**\n\nThe only structure that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on the spectral data provided, the compound is identified as follows:\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula & Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula C9H11NO2 has a degree of unsaturation of 5. This is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The two medium-to-strong bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is in the typical range for a **carbonyl (C=O) stretch**. Its position suggests it is part of a conjugated ester.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂). This is the typical upfield part of an ethyl group.\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons suggests a methylene group (-CH₂) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃). The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm indicates this methylene group is attached to a very electronegative atom, which in this context is the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂-). Together, the signals at 1.20 and 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an **ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons on a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are the classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The difference in chemical shifts indicates one substituent is electron-donating (shielding the adjacent protons to ~7.0 ppm) and the other is electron-withdrawing (deshielding the adjacent protons to ~8.0 ppm). The amino group is donating, and the ethyl ester group is withdrawing, which perfectly fits this pattern.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combined data points to a structure with a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, a primary amine group, and an ethyl ester group. This corresponds to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. The NMR would show a propionyl group, not an ethyl ester.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. This is a primary amide (different IR and NMR signals) and is 1,3-disubstituted (different aromatic NMR pattern).\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. This is a secondary amide (would show only one N-H band in IR) and has a formyl proton signal in the NMR.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure is fully consistent with the molecular formula, IR, and ¹H NMR data.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond (e.g., a C=O group).\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of medium-to-strong bands is characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl region and is typical for the C=O stretch of an ester.\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl (-CH₃) group.\n    *   **Splitting (t, triplet):** According to the n+1 rule, this methyl group is adjacent to a methylene (-CH₂-) group (2+1=3 peaks).\n    *   This signal is the -CH₃ part of an ethyl group.\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents a methylene (-CH₂-) group.\n    *   **Splitting (q, quartet):** This methylene group is adjacent to a methyl (-CH₃) group (3+1=4 peaks).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very downfield shift for a methylene group, indicating it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n    *   Together, the signals at 1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an **ethyl ester** fragment (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents two protons.\n    *   **Splitting (bs, broad singlet):** Broad signals are typical for exchangeable protons, such as those on an -OH or -NH group.\n    *   This signal corresponds to the two protons of the primary amine (-NH₂) group identified in the IR spectrum.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (4H total):** Four protons in the aromatic region.\n    *   **Splitting Pattern:** Two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The protons at 8.0 ppm are more deshielded (further downfield) because they are ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n    *   The protons at 7.0 ppm are more shielded (further upfield) because they are ortho to the electron-donating amine group.\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, the molecule contains:\n*   A para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   A primary amine group (-NH₂).\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nPutting these pieces together gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check the given options:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure matches all the data perfectly.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer, but it has a propionyl group (CH₃CH₂CO-), not an ethyl ester. The NMR would show a quartet for the CH₂ next to the C=O at a much lower chemical shift (~2.4 ppm), not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted ring, which would give a more complex NMR splitting pattern, not two doublets. Also, the C=O of an amide is typically at a lower frequency (~1680 cm⁻¹) than the observed 1720 cm⁻¹.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide (-NH-), which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR, not the two observed for a primary amine.\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula and Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) Calculation:**\n    *   The formula for DoU is: `C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)`, where C is the number of carbons, H is hydrogens, X is halogens, and N is nitrogens.\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2)\n    *   DoU = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5\n    *   DoU = 5\n*   **Interpretation of DoU:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: 3 double bonds + 1 ring) plus one additional degree of unsaturation, which is typically a double bond (like C=O or C=C).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** This pair of sharp bands is characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂). A secondary amine (-NH-) would show only one band, and an amide would also have bands in this region but other features would differ.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The position is too high for a simple amide (typically ~1680 cm⁻¹) but is perfect for an ester, especially one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **IR Summary:** The data strongly suggests the presence of a primary amine (-NH₂) and a conjugated ester group (-COO-R).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Splitting (t, triplet):** The signal is split by 2 adjacent protons (n+1=3, so n=2).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a methyl group next to a methylene group (-CH₂-), which is the classic signature of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Splitting (q, quartet):** The signal is split by 3 adjacent protons (n+1=4, so n=3).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a methylene group next to a methyl group. This confirms the presence of an **ethyl group**.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very downfield shift for a -CH₂- group, indicating it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom in an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents two protons.\n    *   **Splitting (bs, broad singlet):** The broadness and chemical shift are characteristic of the two protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). These protons are exchangeable, which often leads to signal broadening. This confirms the IR data.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift Region (7.0-8.0 ppm):** This is the aromatic region. The total integration is 2H + 2H = 4H, which corresponds to a disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **Splitting Pattern (two doublets):** A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The doublet at 8.0 ppm is significantly downfield, indicating these protons are adjacent to a strong electron-withdrawing group (like the ester's carbonyl). The doublet at 7.0 ppm is more upfield, indicating these protons are adjacent to an electron-donating group (like the amine).\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Structure and Verify**\n\nBased on the analysis of all the data:\n1.  We have a **1,4-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n2.  One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**.\n3.  The other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) group**.\n\nLet's put these pieces together: The structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Check against formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂. The structure has a C₆H₄ ring, a -NH₂ group, and a -COOCH₂CH₃ group. Total atoms: (C₆+C₁+C₂) + (H₄+H₂+H₅) + N + O₂ = C₉H₁₁NO₂. The formula matches.\n*   **Check against spectra:** The structure has all the required functional groups and proton environments to explain the IR and NMR data perfectly.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the Given Options**\n\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an ester, but the oxygen is attached to the ring, and the carbonyl is part of a propyl chain. The NMR for the ethyl group would be different (CH₃CH₂C=O), with the -CH₂- appearing around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine. The IR would show one N-H band, and the C=O stretch would be at a lower frequency.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the analytical data derived above.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a primary amide (C=O stretch would be ~1680 cm⁻¹) and it is 1,3-disubstituted (meta), which would give a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two simple doublets.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)`\n    *   For C9H11NO2: `DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5`\n*   A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond (e.g., a C=O carbonyl group).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value around 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for an **ester** functional group, especially when conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is generally too high for an amide and too low for a simple saturated ester.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Corresponds to three protons, suggesting a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (t, triplet):** The signal is split into a triplet, which means it is adjacent to a carbon with two protons (a -CH₂- group), according to the n+1 rule.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons, suggesting a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (q, quartet):** The signal is split into a quartet, meaning it is adjacent to a carbon with three protons (a -CH₃ group).\n    *   **Putting it together:** The triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm are a classic signature for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The high chemical shift (4.5 ppm) of the -CH₂- group indicates it is attached to a very electronegative atom, such as the oxygen in an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (bs, broad singlet):** The broadness is typical for exchangeable protons, such as those in -OH or -NH groups. Combined with the IR data, this signal is confidently assigned to the **primary amine (-NH₂)** protons.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** There are a total of four protons in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet for both):** A pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The protons at 8.0 ppm are significantly downfield (deshielded), suggesting they are ortho to a strong electron-withdrawing group (like the ester carbonyl). The protons at 7.0 ppm are upfield (shielded), suggesting they are ortho to an electron-donating group (like the amine).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis of the fragments:\n*   We have a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n*   The two substituents are a **primary amine (-NH₂)** and an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\nLet's combine these pieces to form the final structure: **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nThis structure is consistent with all the data:\n*   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂ (C₆H₄ + NH₂ + COOCH₂CH₃ = C₉H₁₁NO₂) - **Matches**\n*   **IR:** Has a primary amine and an ester group. - **Matches**\n*   **¹H NMR:** Has an ethyl group attached to the ester oxygen, a primary amine, and a para-disubstituted aromatic ring with the expected electronic effects on the proton chemical shifts. - **Matches**\n\n**5. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: The -CH₂- of the propionate group would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine and an ester. The IR and NMR would be different.\n*   C) **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data.\n*   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is a primary amide (different C=O stretch) and is meta-substituted (different aromatic NMR pattern).\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe previous step correctly calculated the Degree of Unsaturation as 5.0. The checker feedback indicated a formula mismatch between the proposed answer (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, C9H11N1O2) and the given formula (C9H11NO2). This feedback is incorrect, as these two formulas are identical. My analysis shows that ethyl 4-aminobenzoate is the only structure that fits all the spectral data. I will now provide the complete analysis to justify the final answer.\n\n*   **Plan:**\n    1.  Synthesize the information from the molecular formula (DoU=5), IR spectrum, and 1H NMR spectrum.\n    2.  Systematically evaluate each of the given options against the combined spectral evidence.\n    3.  Conclude with the only structure that is fully consistent with all data.\n\n*   **Execution (Action 2):**\n    I will now perform a comprehensive analysis of all the data to identify the correct compound.\n\n    1.  **Molecular Formula & DoU:** C9H11NO2. The Degree of Unsaturation is 5. This strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional pi bond (1 degree), likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n    2.  **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   The two bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. This immediately rules out option **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**, which is a secondary amide and would only show one N-H band.\n        *   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is in the carbonyl region. This frequency is typical for a conjugated **ester**. It is generally too high for a conjugated amide (like in option A) and a bit low for a phenyl ester (like in option D), making a conjugated ethyl ester the best fit.\n\n    3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   The signals at **1.20 ppm (triplet, 3H)** and **4.5 ppm (quartet, 2H)** are the definitive signature of an **ethyl group attached to an oxygen (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. The very downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm is characteristic of an ethyl ester. This piece of evidence rules out:\n            *   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide**: This has an ethoxy group, but the -OCH₂- quartet would be around 4.0-4.1 ppm.\n            *   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate**: This has a propionyl group (-CO-CH₂CH₃). The quartet for the -CH₂- group adjacent to a carbonyl would appear around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n        *   The signal at **4.0 ppm (broad singlet, 2H)** confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group.\n        *   The signals at **7.0 ppm (doublet, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H)** indicate a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This rules out option **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide**, which is meta-substituted.\n\n    **Conclusion:**\n    Every piece of spectral data points unequivocally to **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n    *   It has a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   It has an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   It has a 1,4-disubstituted (para) ring.\n    *   Its molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n\n    Therefore, option B is the only correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nBased on the detailed analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the compound is identified as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Here is a breakdown of how the data corresponds to the structure:\n\n*   **Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2):** The formula is consistent with ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, also known as Benzocaine. The calculated degree of unsaturation is 5, which accounts for a benzene ring (4 degrees) and a carbonyl group (1 degree).\n\n*   **IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The medium to strong bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is indicative of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. This frequency is typical for an ester that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This triplet signal with an integration of three protons represents a methyl group (-CH₃) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). The broadness is due to quadripolar relaxation and exchange.\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This quartet, integrating to two protons, corresponds to a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group. Its downfield chemical shift indicates it is attached to an electronegative oxygen atom, as in an ethyl ester (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pair of doublets in the aromatic region is a classic pattern for a 1,4- (or para-) disubstituted benzene ring. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-donating amino group, while the downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing ethyl ester group.\n\nAll other possible isomers are inconsistent with one or more of the provided data points. For example, N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide would show a formyl proton signal in the NMR, and 4-aminophenyl propionate would have a different splitting pattern for the alkyl chain. Therefore, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the identification of the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n### 1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for calculating the DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`.\n*   **Calculation:** DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in this region is a classic indicator of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. These correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a **carbonyl (C=O) stretch from an ester group**. The frequency is generally too high for an amide and fits perfectly for an ester conjugated with a benzene ring.\n\n### 3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 protons indicates a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃-).\n    *   Taken together, the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The significant downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm suggests the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, such as the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of the protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. This confirms the interpretation from the IR spectrum. The broadness is due to quadropole broadening from the nitrogen atom and potential hydrogen exchange.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, are the signature pattern of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The protons at 7.0 ppm are upfield, indicating they are adjacent to an electron-donating group (the -NH₂ group).\n    *   The protons at 8.0 ppm are downfield, indicating they are adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester's carbonyl group, -COOEt).\n\n### 4. Structure Assembly and Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of all the data:\n*   We have a **1,4-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n*   One substituent is a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n*   The other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)**.\n\nAssembling these pieces gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. This structure matches the molecular formula C9H11NO2 and is consistent with all IR and ¹H NMR data provided.\n\nLet's review the options:\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. The NMR shift for the -CH₂- of the propionate group would be around 2.3-2.6 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR and NMR data for a primary amine.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Correct. This structure perfectly matches all spectral data.\n*   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a primary amide (contradicts IR C=O stretch) and is 1,3-disubstituted (contradicts NMR aromatic pattern).\n\nTherefore, the compound is identified as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   The molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n*   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** This pair of medium-to-strong bands is a characteristic doublet for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching of a primary amine (-NH2).\n*   **1720 cm-1:** This strong band is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is consistent with an ester that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n**3. 1H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are deshielded by an electron-withdrawing group (EWG), while the protons at 7.0 ppm are shielded by an electron-donating group (EDG).\n*   **Aliphatic/Functional Group Region:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair confirms the presence of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The high chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) indicates the methylene (-CH2-) group is attached to an oxygen atom, as in an ethyl ester (-O-CH2CH3).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet corresponds to the two exchangeable protons of the primary amine (-NH2) group, which is consistent with the IR data.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n*   The pieces are: a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, a primary amine group (-NH2), and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n*   The -NH2 group is an EDG, and the -COOCH2CH3 group is an EWG.\n*   Placing the EDG (-NH2) and EWG (-COOCH2CH3) in a para arrangement on the benzene ring explains the NMR aromatic signals perfectly. The protons adjacent to the -NH2 group are shielded (appear at 7.0 ppm), and the protons adjacent to the ester group are deshielded (appear at 8.0 ppm).\n*   This leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**5. Verifying the Options**\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is an isomer, but the NMR for the propionate group (-O-CO-CH2CH3) would show a quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is a meta-substituted amide. The aromatic NMR pattern would be more complex, not two doublets.\n*   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amide. The IR would show only one N-H band, and the NMR would lack the -NH2 signal.\n*   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: This structure perfectly matches all spectral data (IR, NMR) and the molecular formula (C9H11NO2).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n### 1. Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe degree of unsaturation indicates the total number of rings and π bonds within a molecule. It is calculated using the formula:\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n\nFor the molecular formula C9H11NO2:\nDoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n\nA degree of unsaturation of 5 is characteristic of a substituted benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: 1 ring and 3 double bonds) plus one additional double bond, typically a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is a clear indication of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. This frequency is typical for an ester.\n\n### 3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Analysis\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons suggests a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons indicates a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃). The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and this quartet at 4.5 ppm confirms the presence of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The significant downfield chemical shift (4.5 ppm) suggests this methylene group is bonded to a highly electronegative atom, such as the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). The signal is often broad due to nitrogen's quadrupolar moment and chemical exchange.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm) is a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two protons on the ring ortho to the electron-donating amino group are shifted upfield (7.0 ppm), while the two protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group are shifted downfield (8.0 ppm).\n\n### 4. Structure Determination\n\nBased on the analysis of the spectral data, we can assemble the following fragments:\n*   A primary amine group (-NH₂)\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃)\n*   A para-disubstituted benzene ring\n\nConnecting these fragments results in the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. This structure is consistent with the molecular formula (C9H11NO2) and all the spectroscopic data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing our deduced structure with the given options:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches our findings perfectly.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Would have a different ester group and thus a different NMR pattern for the alkyl chain.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Is an amide, which would show a different C=O stretch in the IR and would lack the two N-H stretches of a primary amine.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Is meta-substituted, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum.\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThe analysis of the spectral data is complete and has been verified.\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula & DoU:** C9H11NO2 gives a Degree of Unsaturation of 5, consistent with a substituted benzene ring (4) and a carbonyl group (1).\n2.  **IR Spectrum:** The two bands at 3420/3325 cm⁻¹ confirm a primary amine (-NH2). The strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹ confirms a conjugated ester carbonyl (C=O).\n3.  **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The triplet (3H) at 1.20 ppm and quartet (2H) at 4.5 ppm confirm an ethyl ester group (-O-CH2CH3).\n    *   The two doublets (2H each) at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm confirm a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   The broad singlet (2H) at 4.0 ppm corresponds to the primary amine protons (-NH2).\n\nCombining these pieces of evidence:\n*   A para-substituted benzene ring...\n*   ...with a primary amine group (-NH2) on one side...\n*   ...and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3) on the other.\n\nThis structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. The code execution confirms that only candidate B satisfies all constraints derived from the data.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n**Proposer's Initial Analysis**\n\nThe provided data is for a compound with the formula C9H11NO2.\n1.  **Degree of Unsaturation:** The formula corresponds to 5 degrees of unsaturation, suggesting a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional double bond (C=O or C=C).\n2.  **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The two bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   The strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹ is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) group, specifically an ester.\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The signals at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two distinct doublets suggest one substituent is electron-donating and the other is electron-withdrawing.\n    *   The triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) and the quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) are the classic signature of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The significant downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm indicates the methylene (-CH₂) group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, such as the oxygen of an ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H) is consistent with the two protons of a primary amino group (-NH₂) attached to the aromatic ring. Its broadness is due to quadrupole broadening from the nitrogen atom and potential chemical exchange.\n\n**Proposed Solution Path**\n\nBased on this analysis, the compound is likely ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (structure A). This structure contains a primary amine, an ester, an ethyl group, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, all of which are directly supported by the IR and NMR data. The electron-donating amino group would cause the adjacent aromatic protons to be shielded (appear upfield at ~7.0 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing ethyl ester group would cause its adjacent protons to be deshielded (appear downfield at ~8.0 ppm). This matches the observed spectrum. The next logical step is to confirm the spectral data for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n**Skeptic's Cross-Examination**\n\nThe initial analysis strongly favors ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (A). However, to be certain, let's verify the expected spectral data against published values for all candidates.\n\n1.  **Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (A):**\n    *   **¹H NMR:** A published spectrum shows peaks at δ 1.35 (t, 3H), 4.16 (s, br, 2H, -NH₂), 4.31 (q, 2H), 6.62 (d, 2H), and 7.84 (d, 2H). This is an excellent match to the provided data (1.20, 4.0, 4.5, 7.0, 8.0 ppm). Minor differences in chemical shifts are expected due to solvent effects and spectrometer calibration.\n    *   **IR:** A reference IR spectrum for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (also known as Benzocaine) shows characteristic N-H stretches for a primary amine around 3300-3230 cm⁻¹. This confirms the assignment of the bands at 3420 and 3325 cm⁻¹. The C=O ester stretch is also confirmed to be in the expected region.\n\n2.  **4-aminophenyl propionate (B):**\n    *   **¹H NMR:** The key difference would be the chemical shift of the methylene protons of the ethyl group. In a propionate ester attached to a phenol, the -COCH₂CH₃ group would show a quartet around 2.2-2.6 ppm. This is significantly different from the 4.5 ppm observed in the data. The NMR spectrum for propionic acid shows this quartet at 2.17 ppm. This structure is inconsistent.\n\n3.  **N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide (C):**\n    *   **IR:** This is a secondary amide (-NH-), which would show only *one* N-H stretch, not two. The provided data (3420 and 3325 cm⁻¹) is a clear indication of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   **¹H NMR:** This structure has a formyl proton (-N-CHO) which would appear as a singlet far downfield, typically >8.0 ppm. This signal is absent. Furthermore, the ethoxy quartet (-OCH₂CH₃) in the related compound phenacetin appears at 4.0 ppm, not 4.5 ppm. This structure is inconsistent.\n\n4.  **3-ethoxybenzamide (D):**\n    *   **¹H NMR:** This structure has a 1,3- (meta) substitution pattern on the benzene ring. This would result in a more complex splitting pattern, not the two clean doublets characteristic of 1,4- (para) substitution seen in the data at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. The IR would show two N-H bands from the primary amide, but the NMR aromatic region is a clear mismatch.\n\n**Convergence and Final Decision**\n\nThe search results confirm the initial analysis. The IR and ¹H NMR data are highly characteristic of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The IR bands confirm a primary amine and a carbonyl group. The ¹H NMR signals perfectly match the pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted ring bearing an amino group and an ethyl ester group. The spectral data for the other isomers are inconsistent with the provided information.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
