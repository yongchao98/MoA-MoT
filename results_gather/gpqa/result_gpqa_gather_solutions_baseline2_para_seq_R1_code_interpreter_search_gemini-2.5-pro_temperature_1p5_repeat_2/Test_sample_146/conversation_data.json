In this problem, we analyze the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) which results in the creation of two pairs of a new particle-antiparticle, $A^{+}$ and $A^{-}$.\n\nThe reaction is given by:\n$p+\\bar{p}\\rightarrow2A^{+}+2A^{-}$\n\nWe are given that the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". In the context of particle physics, this typically implies that its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We can assume both the proton and the antiproton are effectively at rest in the lab frame. This means the total initial momentum of the system is zero.\n\nThe problem requires us to find the velocity of the resulting A particles. To do this, we will use the principle of conservation of energy.\n\n**1. Calculate the total initial energy ($E_i$)**\n\nThe initial system consists of a proton and an antiproton, both considered to be at rest. The total initial energy is the sum of their rest mass energies.\nThe mass of a proton ($m_p$) is equal to the mass of an antiproton ($m_{\\bar{p}}$). The rest energy of a proton is approximately $m_p c^2 = 938.272 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n$E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n$E_i = 2 \\times 938.272 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.544 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**2. Calculate the total final energy ($E_f$)**\n\nThe final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. Since $A^+$ and $A^-$ are a particle-antiparticle pair, they have the same mass, $m_A$. We are given that the rest energy of particle A is $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nDue to the conservation of momentum (initial momentum is zero), the four final particles must move away from the interaction point with a total momentum of zero. The most symmetric and simplest configuration is that all four particles have the same magnitude of momentum and thus the same kinetic energy and total energy. Let's denote the total energy of a single A particle as $E_A$.\n\nThe total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four A particles:\n$E_f = 4 \\times E_A$\n\nThe energy of each A particle is its relativistic energy, given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$, and $v$ is the speed of the particle.\n\nSo, the total final energy is:\n$E_f = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n**3. Apply the conservation of energy**\n\nAccording to the law of conservation of energy, the total initial energy must equal the total final energy:\n$E_i = E_f$\n$2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\nWe can now solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{938.272 \\text{ MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{938.272}{600} \\approx 1.563787$\n\n**4. Calculate the velocity (v)**\n\nNow that we have the Lorentz factor, we can find the velocity, $v$. The relationship between $\\gamma$ and the velocity ratio $\\beta = v/c$ is:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for $\\beta$:\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n$1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nNow, substitute the value of $\\gamma$ we calculated:\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.563787)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.44547}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.408919}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{0.591081} \\approx 0.7688$\n\nThus, the velocity of particle A is $v = 0.7688c$. This value is closest to 0.77c.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem involves the annihilation of a proton and an antiproton, which is governed by the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n**1. Initial State Analysis**\n\n*   The reaction is $p + \\bar{p} \\rightarrow 2A^{+} + 2A^{-}$.\n*   The antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) is described as \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible. We assume it is at rest.\n*   To conserve momentum, if the antiproton is at rest, the proton ($p$) must also be at rest (or have negligible velocity). Therefore, the total initial momentum of the system is zero.\n*   The total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton. The mass of a proton and an antiproton are identical. The rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.27 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n$E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n$E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938.27 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**2. Final State Analysis**\n\n*   The final state consists of four particles: two $A^{+}$ and two $A^{-}$. Since $A^{+}$ and $A^{-}$ are a particle-antiparticle pair, they have the same mass, $m_A$. We are given $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   According to the conservation of energy, the total initial energy is converted into the total energy of the four final particles.\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final} = E_{2A^+} + E_{2A^-}$\n*   Due to the symmetry of the problem (initial momentum is zero), the energy will be distributed equally among the four resulting particles. Let $E_A$ be the total energy of a single particle A.\n\n$E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A$\n\n**3. Applying Conservation of Energy**\n\nWe equate the initial and final energies to find the energy of a single particle A:\n\n$E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n$1876.54 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times E_A$\n$E_A = \\frac{1876.54 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469.135 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**4. Calculating the Velocity**\n\nThe total energy ($E_A$) of a relativistic particle is given by the equation:\n$E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.\n\nWe can solve for the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469.135 \\text{ MeV}}{300 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 1.5638$\n\nNow, we use the definition of $\\gamma$ to find the velocity $v$. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n$1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nSubstituting the value of $\\gamma$:\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n$\\beta \\approx 0.7688$\n\nThus, the velocity of particle A is $v = \\beta c \\approx 0.769c$.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 0.86c\nB) 0.77c\nC) 0.91c\nD) 0.96c\n\nThe calculated velocity $0.769c$ is closest to $0.77c$.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Principles:** This particle physics problem is governed by the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Initial State:**\n    *   The initial system consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving.\" This is a standard approximation in physics problems, meaning its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest energy. We can assume it is effectively at rest.\n    *   In this context (annihilation with a slow particle), we assume the other particle (the proton) is also at rest, resulting in a total initial momentum of zero. This is the center-of-mass frame.\n    *   The total initial energy ($E_{\\text{initial}}$) is therefore the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n    *   The rest energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938 MeV.

For this to happen, the four final particles must fly apart in such a way that their vector momenta cancel out.\n    *   By symmetry and conservation of energy, the total energy must be distributed equally among the four identical final particles. Therefore, they will all have the same total energy ($E_A$) and the same speed ($v$).\n    *   The total final energy is the sum of the relativistic energies of the four particles: $E_{\\text{final}} = 4 \\times E_A$.\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   Set the initial energy equal to the final energy: $E_{\\text{initial}} = E_{\\text{final}}$.\n    *   $1876 \\, \\text{MeV} = 4 \\times E_A$.\n    *   Solve for the total energy of a single particle A: $E_A = \\frac{1876 \\, \\text{MeV}}{4} = 469 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Velocity:**\n    *   The total relativistic energy of a particle is given by the equation $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   First, we solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469 \\, \\text{MeV}}{300 \\, \\text{MeV}} \\approx 1.563$\n    *   The Lorentz factor is related to velocity by the formula $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.

For the total momentum to be zero, the four resulting particles must be emitted with velocities that are symmetric in some way. Due to this symmetry and the conservation of energy, each of the four final particles must have the same speed ($v$) and thus the same energy ($E_A$).\n\nThe total final energy ($E_f$) is the sum of the energies of the four A particles:\n$E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\times (\\gamma m_A c^2)$.\n\n**3.

    "### Analysis of the Solution Process\n\nThe core task is to determine the velocity of particle A, produced in the annihilation of a proton-antiproton pair. All candidate solutions correctly identify the problem as an application of the conservation of relativistic energy and momentum. The consensus on the methodology is strong and correct. Here is a step-by-step verification of the common reasoning.\n\n**1. Initial Conditions and Conservation Principles**\n*   **Principle:** The fundamental principle is the conservation of energy. The total energy before the reaction must equal the total energy after.\n*   **Initial State:** The process begins with a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The phrase \"slowly moving\" implies that their initial kinetic energies are negligible compared to their rest energies. We can therefore analyze the reaction in the center-of-mass frame, where the total initial momentum is zero, and the total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest energies.\n*   **Constants:** The rest energy of a proton is a known physical constant, $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$. The antiproton has the same mass and rest energy.\n\n**2. Calculation of Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$)**\nThe total initial energy is the sum of the rest energies of the two initial particles.\n$E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n$E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**3. Analysis of the Final State**\n*   **Final Particles:** The reaction produces four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. Since they are a particle-antiparticle pair, they all have the same mass, with a given rest energy of $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   **Energy and Momentum Distribution:** Because the initial momentum was zero, the total final momentum must also be zero. By symmetry, the initial energy will be distributed equally among the four resulting particles. This means they will all be created with the same speed, $v$, and thus the same total energy, $E_A$.\n*   **Energy per Particle:** The total final energy ($E_{final}$) equals the initial energy ($E_{initial}$). The energy of a single particle A is therefore:\n    $E_A = \\frac{E_{final}}{4} = \\frac{1876.6 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469.15 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**4. Calculation of the Velocity of Particle A**\nThe total energy of a relativistic particle is given by the formula $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Solve for Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** We can rearrange the formula to find $\\gamma$.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469.15 \\text{ MeV}}{300 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 1.5638$\n*   **Solve for Velocity (v):** The Lorentz factor is related to the velocity ratio $\\beta = v/c$ by the formula $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$. We rearrange this to solve for $\\beta$:\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    Substituting the value of $\\gamma$:\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089}$\n    $\\beta \\approx \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$\n*   **Conclusion:** The velocity of particle A is $v = 0.7688c$. This value, when rounded to two decimal places, is $0.77c$.\n\n**Final Decision**\nThe analytical and numerical calculations performed by the majority of the agents are correct. The consistent result is a velocity of approximately $0.77c$. The inconsistencies in the final letter choices among the agents appear to stem from variations in the option lists provided to them, not from errors in the physics calculation itself. Based on the provided question options, $0.77c$ corresponds to C.\n\n<<<C>>>"

In this problem, we analyze the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) which results in the creation of two pairs of a new particle-antiparticle, $A^{+}$ and $A^{-}$.\n\nThe reaction is given by:\n$p+\\bar{p}\\rightarrow2A^{+}+2A^{-}$\n\nWe are given that the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". In the context of particle physics, this typically implies that its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We can assume both the proton and the antiproton are effectively at rest in the lab frame. This means the total initial momentum of the system is zero.\n\nThe problem requires us to find the velocity of the resulting A particles. To do this, we will use the principle of conservation of energy.\n\n**1. Calculate the total initial energy ($E_i$)**\n\nThe initial system consists of a proton and an antiproton, both considered to be at rest. The total initial energy is the sum of their rest mass energies.\nThe mass of a proton ($m_p$) is equal to the mass of an antiproton ($m_{\\bar{p}}$). The rest energy of a proton is approximately $m_p c^2 = 938.272 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n$E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n$E_i = 2 \\times 938.272 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.544 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**2. Calculate the total final energy ($E_f$)**\n\nThe final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. Since $A^+$ and $A^-$ are a particle-antiparticle pair, they have the same mass, $m_A$. We are given that the rest energy of particle A is $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nDue to the conservation of momentum (initial momentum is zero), the four final particles must move away from the interaction point with a total momentum of zero. The most symmetric and simplest configuration is that all four particles have the same magnitude of momentum and thus the same kinetic energy and total energy. Let's denote the total energy of a single A particle as $E_A$.\n\nThe total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four A particles:\n$E_f = 4 \\times E_A$\n\nThe energy of each A particle is its relativistic energy, given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$, and $v$ is the speed of the particle.\n\nSo, the total final energy is:\n$E_f = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n**3. Apply the conservation of energy**\n\nAccording to the law of conservation of energy, the total initial energy must equal the total final energy:\n$E_i = E_f$\n$2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\nWe can now solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{938.272 \\text{ MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{938.272}{600} \\approx 1.563787$\n\n**4. Calculate the velocity (v)**\n\nNow that we have the Lorentz factor, we can find the velocity, $v$. The relationship between $\\gamma$ and the velocity ratio $\\beta = v/c$ is:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for $\\beta$:\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n$1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nNow, substitute the value of $\\gamma$ we calculated:\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.563787)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.44547}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.408919}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{0.591081} \\approx 0.7688$\n\nThus, the velocity of particle A is $v = 0.7688c$. This value is closest to 0.77c.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem involves the annihilation of a proton and an antiproton, which is governed by the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n**1. Initial State Analysis**\n\n*   The reaction is $p + \\bar{p} \\rightarrow 2A^{+} + 2A^{-}$.\n*   The antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) is described as \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible. We assume it is at rest.\n*   To conserve momentum, if the antiproton is at rest, the proton ($p$) must also be at rest (or have negligible velocity). Therefore, the total initial momentum of the system is zero.\n*   The total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton. The mass of a proton and an antiproton are identical. The rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.27 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n$E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n$E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938.27 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**2.

We are given $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   According to the conservation of energy, the total initial energy is converted into the total energy of the four final particles.\n    $E_{initial} = E_{final} = E_{2A^+} + E_{2A^-}$\n*   Due to the symmetry of the problem (initial momentum is zero), the energy will be distributed equally among the four resulting particles. Let $E_A$ be the total energy of a single particle A.\n\n$E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A$\n\n**3.

For the total momentum to be zero, the four resulting particles must be emitted with velocities that are symmetric in some way. Due to this symmetry and the conservation of energy, each of the four final particles must have the same speed ($v$) and thus the same energy ($E_A$).\n\nThe total final energy ($E_f$) is the sum of the energies of the four A particles:\n$E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\times (\\gamma m_A c^2)$.\n\n**3.

Understand the Physics Principles**\n\nThe fundamental principle governing this particle annihilation process is the conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after the annihilation.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before the annihilation must equal the total momentum after the annihilation.\n\n**2. Analyze the Initial State**\n\n*   The process starts with a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n*   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving\". In particle physics, \"slowly moving\" implies that its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We can therefore assume the initial system is effectively at rest.\n*   **Initial Momentum ($P_{initial}$):** Since the particles are essentially at rest, the total initial momentum is zero.\n    $P_{initial} \\approx 0$\n*   **Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$):** With negligible kinetic energy, the initial energy is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton. A proton and an antiproton have the same mass.\n    *   Rest mass energy of a proton, $m_p c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   Rest mass energy of an antiproton, $m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 \\approx 938.3 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**3. Analyze the Final State**\n\n*   The final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. Since $A^+$ and $A^-$ are antiparticles of each other, they have the same mass, $m_A$.\n*   We are given the rest mass energy of particle A: $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   **Final Momentum ($P_{final}$):** Due to the conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero. This means the four created particles must fly off in directions such that their vector momenta cancel out.\n*   **Final Energy ($E_{final}$):** The total final energy is the sum of the total energies of the four A particles. By symmetry, each of the four final particles must have the same kinetic energy and thus the same total energy, $E_A$.\n    *   The total energy of a single relativistic particle is given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Energy**\n\nNow we set the initial energy equal to the final energy:\n$E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n$1876.6 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\nWe can now solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n$1876.6 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\text{ MeV})$\n$1876.6 = 1200 \\gamma$\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1876.6}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n**5. Calculate the Velocity**\n\nFinally, we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to find the velocity ($v$) of the A particles.\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n$1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nNow, substitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n$v/c \\approx 0.7688$\n\nSo, the velocity of particle A is approximately $v = 0.77c$.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) 0.96c\nB) 0.86c\nC) 0.77c\nD) 0.91c\n\nThe calculated velocity matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe initial state consists of a proton and an antiproton, both essentially at rest. The total initial energy is the sum of their rest mass energies.\nThe rest mass energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938 MeV. The antiproton has the same mass.\n\nInitial Energy ($E_{initial}$):\n$E_{initial} = m_{p}c^{2} + m_{\\bar{p}}c^{2} = 2 \\times m_{p}c^{2} \\approx 2 \\times 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nThe final state consists of four particles ($2A^+$ and $2A^-$), each with a rest mass energy of $m_{A}c^{2} = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\nAccording to the principle of conservation of energy, the total initial energy must equal the total final energy.\n\nFinal Energy ($E_{final}$):\n$E_{final} = E_{initial} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nAssuming the initial proton and antiproton were at rest (center-of-mass frame), the total initial momentum is zero. To conserve momentum, the final four particles must be produced in a way that their total momentum is also zero. By symmetry, the total energy will be distributed equally among the four final particles.\n\nEnergy per particle A ($E_A$):\n$E_A = \\frac{E_{final}}{4} = \\frac{1876 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nThis is the total relativistic energy for one particle A. The total energy is related to the rest mass energy and the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$) by the formula:\n$E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\nWe can now solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469 \\text{ MeV}}{300 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 1.5633$\n\nThe Lorentz factor is defined in terms of velocity ($v$) as:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n\nLet $\\beta = v/c$. We can rearrange the formula to solve for $\\beta$:\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n$1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nNow, substitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.444}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4092} = \\sqrt{0.5908} \\approx 0.7686$\n\nSo, the velocity of particle A is $v \\approx 0.7686c$.\nThis value is closest to 0.77c.\n\nThe Python code executed in the thinking process confirms this result (`beta=0.7688`), rounding to 0.77c.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe annihilation of a proton and an antiproton converts their rest mass into energy, which then becomes the total energy (rest mass energy + kinetic energy) of the resulting particles.\n\nHere's the step-by-step breakdown of the physics:\n\n**1. Conservation of Energy**\nThe fundamental principle governing this interaction is the conservation of relativistic energy. The total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after the annihilation.\n*   **Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$):** The system starts with a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). Since the antiproton is described as \"slowly moving,\" we can assume the system is in its center-of-mass frame and the initial kinetic energies are negligible. Therefore, the initial energy is just the sum of the rest energies of the proton and antiproton. The rest energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938 \\text{ MeV}$. An antiproton has the same rest mass.\n\n    $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times (m_p c^2)$\n    $E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n*   **Final Energy ($E_{final}$):** The system ends with four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. Since energy is conserved, the total energy of these four particles must be equal to the initial energy.\n\n    $E_{final} = E_{initial} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**2. Energy per Particle A**\nAssuming the final energy is distributed equally among the four resulting particles (which all have the same mass), the energy of a single particle A ($E_A$) is:\n\n$E_A = \\frac{E_{final}}{4} = \\frac{1876 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**3. Relativistic Calculation for Velocity**\nThe total energy of a relativistic particle is given by the equation:\n$E = \\gamma m c^2$\n\nwhere:\n*   $E$ is the total energy of the particle.\n*   $m c^2$ is its rest energy.\n*   $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\nFor particle A, we know its total energy ($E_A = 469 \\text{ MeV}$) and its rest energy ($m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$). We can now find its Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469 \\text{ MeV}}{300 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 1.563$\n\nNow, we solve for the velocity, $v$, using the formula for the Lorentz factor. It's easiest to first solve for $\\beta = v/c$.\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n$1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nSubstituting the value of $\\gamma$:\n\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.563)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.443}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.409} = \\sqrt{0.591} \\approx 0.769$\n\nThus, the velocity of particle A is approximately $0.769c$.\n\n**4.
