This molecule has one chiral center at carbon 5, with the (S) configuration. The structure is CH3-CH(OCH3)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3.\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH reduces the ketone group (C=O) at carbon 3 to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The ketone at C3 is a prochiral center. The hydride ion (H-) can attack the carbonyl carbon from two different faces (re and si faces). This reduction creates a new chiral center at C3. Since the starting molecule already contains a chiral center at C5, the attack on the two faces is not equally probable, leading to the formation of two diastereomeric products. The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:** The products are (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two molecules are diastereomers of each other.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone). Its structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. This molecule is achiral; it has a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH2 group.\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH4), a reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. Since NaBH4 is in excess, both ketone groups will be reduced to hydroxyl groups.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. This molecule has two chiral centers, at C2 and C4. Since the starting material and the reagent (NaBH4) are both achiral, the reaction must produce an overall achiral mixture. Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are enantiomers of each other. Since the reaction is not stereospecific, they will be formed in equal amounts, resulting in a racemic mixture.\n    The (2R, 4S) isomer has an internal plane of symmetry, which means it is a meso compound and is achiral. The (2S, 4R) isomer is the same meso compound.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:** The reaction produces three stereoisomers: the enantiomeric pair of (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, and the meso-pentane-2,4-diol.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined product mixture with normal-phase HPLC.**\n\n*   **Combined Products:** The final mixture contains five compounds in total:\n    1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n    2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC Principle:** A normal-phase HPLC column has an achiral stationary phase. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The enantiomers, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, have identical properties in an achiral environment and will co-elute as a **single peak**. The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it has different properties and will elute as a **separate peak**. This gives two peaks for the products of Reaction II.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C9H20O2) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C5H12O2) and will have different retention times.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-phase HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Rxn I) + 2 peaks (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the combined product mixture with chiral HPLC.**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC Principle:** An HPLC column with a chiral stationary phase can differentiate between chiral molecules, including enantiomers, because they interact differently with the chiral environment.\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated, giving **two peaks**.\n    *   The three stereoisomers from Reaction II will all be separated from each other. The chiral column will resolve the enantiomeric pair, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, into **two separate peaks**. The meso compound is achiral, but it is a diastereomer of the other two and will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, eluting as its own **separate peak**. This gives three peaks for the products of Reaction II.\n    *   Again, the products from the two reactions are structurally distinct and will be separated from each other.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Rxn I) + 3 peaks (from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **5 Peaks in chiral HPLC**\n*   **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   Let's identify the stereocenter. The stereocenter is at carbon C5, which is bonded to -H, -CH₃, -OCH₃, and -CH₂C(=O)CH₂CH₃.\n    *   The problem states the configuration at C5 is (S). This is a single, pure enantiomer.\n*   **Reagents:** LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Transformation:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Product:** The product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH₃.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the product:**\n    *   The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected by the reaction, so its configuration remains (S).\n    *   The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The carbonyl carbon is sp² hybridized and planar. The hydride ion (H⁻) can attack from either the front face or the back face of this planar group.\n    *   This attack creates two possible configurations at C3: (R) or (S).\n    *   Because the starting material is chiral (has a stereocenter at C5), the two faces of the carbonyl group are diastereotopic. The attack will not be a 50:50 mixture, but it will produce both possible stereoisomers.\n    *   The two products formed are:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products are **diastereomers** because they have one stereocenter that is the same (5S) and one that is different (3R vs. 3S).\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction I:** It produces a mixture of **two diastereomers**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral as it possesses a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH₂ group.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Transformation:** NaBH₄ reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols. \"Excess\" ensures both are reduced.\n*   **Product:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the product:**\n    *   The product has two new stereocenters, at C2 and C4.\n    *   Since the starting material is achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. The overall mixture must be optically inactive.\n    *   The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   Let's analyze these stereoisomers:\n        *   **(2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry through the central CH₂ group. It is a **meso compound**. (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) describe the same achiral molecule.\n        *   **(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S):** These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts from an achiral material, they will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   The products are:\n        1.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n        2.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        3.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction II:** It produces a mixture of **three stereoisomers**: one meso compound and a racemic pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains five distinct chemical compounds:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n5.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the Number of Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase and separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment (including polarity) and thus **cannot be separated**. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties (including polarity) and **can be separated**.\n    *   Compounds with different molecular structures (constitutional isomers or simply different molecules) have different properties and **can be separated**.\n\n*   **Applying the principle to the mixture:**\n    *   Compounds 1 and 2 are diastereomers. They will be separated. → **2 peaks**.\n    *   Compound 3 (meso) is a diastereomer of compounds 4 and 5. It will be separated from them. → **1 peak**.\n    *   Compounds 4 and 5 are enantiomers. They will not be separated and will co-elute. → **1 peak**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) and will be easily separated from them.\n    *   Total peaks = (Peaks from Rxn I products) + (Peaks from Rxn II products) = 2 + (1 + 1) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion for Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks are observed.\n\n### **Step 5: Predict the Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. It can form transient diastereomeric complexes with chiral molecules, allowing for their separation.\n    *   It separates **enantiomers**.\n    *   It separates **diastereomers**.\n    *   It separates structurally different compounds.\n    *   Essentially, a chiral column can separate all stereoisomers that are not identical.\n\n*   **Applying the principle to the mixture:**\n    *   All five compounds in the mixture are chemically and stereochemically distinct.\n    *   Compound 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol → **1 peak**\n    *   Compound 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol → **1 peak**\n    *   Compound 3: meso-pentane-2,4-diol → **1 peak**\n    *   Compound 4: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol → **1 peak**\n    *   Compound 5: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol → **1 peak**\n    *   Total peaks = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion for Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks are observed.\n\n### **Final Summary**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nB) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\nC) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nD) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. Let's break down the name to understand the structure. \"hexan-3-one\" indicates a six-carbon chain with a ketone group at carbon 3. \"5-methoxy\" means a -OCH3 group is attached to carbon 5. \"(S)\" specifies the stereochemistry at the chiral center, which is carbon 5 (it's bonded to H, CH3, OCH3, and a larger alkyl ketone group).\n*   **Reagent:** LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone (C=O) to a secondary alcohol (CH-OH). The acidic workup is to protonate the resulting alkoxide ion.\n*   **Product Formation and Stereochemistry:** The reaction occurs at the C3 ketone. The original chiral center at C5 is not involved in the reaction and retains its (S) configuration. The reduction of the planar sp2-hybridized carbonyl carbon at C3 creates a new chiral center. The hydride ion can attack from either face of the carbonyl group, leading to the formation of both (R) and (S) configurations at C3.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:** This reaction produces two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Since one stereocenter is the same (5S) and the other is different (3R vs. 3S), these two products are **diastereomers**. So, Reaction I yields a mixture of **two diastereomeric products**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetrical molecule with two ketone groups. It is achiral.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess NaBH4 (Sodium Borohydride) is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols. The acidic workup protonates the alkoxides.\n*   **Product Formation and Stereochemistry:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol. The reduction of the ketones at C2 and C4 creates two new chiral centers. The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   Let's examine the symmetry. The (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) isomers have an internal plane of symmetry, making them an achiral **meso compound**. They are the same molecule.\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They constitute a pair of **enantiomers**.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:** Since the starting material is achiral, the reaction will produce an optically inactive mixture. This means the two enantiomers are formed in equal amounts (a racemic mixture), along with the meso compound. Therefore, Reaction II yields **three stereoisomeric products**: the (2R,4R)/(2S,4S) enantiomeric pair and the meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle of Separation:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, primarily polarity. It uses an achiral stationary phase.\n*   **Separability:**\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore **cannot** be separated by normal-phase HPLC. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and **can** be separated.\n*   **Applying to the Mixture:**\n    1.  The two diastereomers from Reaction I ((3R, 5S) and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) have different properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    2.  The enantiomeric pair from Reaction II ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) are inseparable on an achiral column. This gives **1 peak**.\n    3.  The meso compound from Reaction II is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has different properties and will be separated from them. This gives **1 peak**.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** The products from Reaction I are also structurally different from those of Reaction II, so they will be well separated. The total number of peaks is the sum of the separable groups: 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (from enantiomers of Rxn II) + 1 (from meso of Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle of Separation:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This creates a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers. The interactions between each enantiomer and the chiral stationary phase are diastereomeric in nature, resulting in different retention times.\n*   **Separability:** Chiral HPLC can separate all stereoisomers, including enantiomers and diastereomers.\n*   **Applying to the Mixture:** We have a total of 5 distinct stereoisomers in our combined product mixture:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Since all five of these compounds are stereochemically distinct, a chiral HPLC column is designed to resolve them all. Therefore, we would expect to see **5 peaks**.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral ketone with one stereocenter at the C5 position, with (S) configuration.\n    The structure is: CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺). LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol (-CHOH).\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting molecule already has a stereocenter at C5, the attack of the hydride ion (H⁻) on the two faces of the carbonyl group is diastereoselective. This means two diastereomeric products will be formed, generally in unequal amounts.\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two products are formed, and they are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral diketone.\n    The structure is: CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Product Formation:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃. This molecule has two stereocenters (at C2 and C4). Because the reactant and reagent are both achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. Due to the symmetry of the molecule (the groups attached to C2 and C4 are identical), there are three possible stereoisomers:\n    *   A meso compound: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. This compound is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n    *   A pair of enantiomers: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. Since they are formed from an achiral starting material, they will be produced as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: one meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Normal-Phase HPLC Chromatogram**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. In an achiral environment:\n*   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical properties and cannot be separated (they co-elute).\n\nThe combined mixture contains five compounds in total: the two diastereomers from Reaction I and the three stereoisomers from Reaction II.\n1.  **Products from Reaction I:** The two products, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. They will have different retention times and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n2.  **Products from Reaction II:** The meso-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-diols). Therefore, the meso compound will be separated from the enantiomeric pair. The two enantiomers, however, will co-elute. This gives **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, one for the racemic pair).\n3.  **Combined Mixture:** The products from Reaction I are methoxy-alcohols, while the products from Reaction II are diols. These two classes of compounds have significantly different structures and polarities and will be easily separated from each other.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks on a normal-phase column will be the sum of the peaks from each group: 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Chiral HPLC Chromatogram**\n\nA chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase, which allows for the separation of enantiomers in addition to diastereomers.\n*   The column creates a chiral environment where enantiomers interact differently with the stationary phase, leading to different retention times.\n\nThe mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n4.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n\nSince all five of these compounds are stereochemically different from one another, a chiral column is expected to resolve all of them.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II will be separated from the others (as it's a diastereomer to them).\n*   The two enantiomers from Reaction II will be resolved from each other.\n\nAssuming no accidental co-elution, each of the five stereoisomers will produce a separate peak. This results in a total of **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a ketone. The chemical formula is C7H14O2.\n    *   The structure is CH3-CH(OCH3)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3.\n    *   The molecule has one chiral center at carbon C5, and it is given as the pure (S) enantiomer.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  LAH (Lithium aluminum hydride): This is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol (-OH).\n    2.  Acidic workup (H3O+): This protonates the intermediate alkoxide to form the final alcohol product.\n*   **Product Formation and Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a *new* chiral center.\n    *   The original chiral center at C5 remains in the (S) configuration.\n    *   The new chiral center at C3 can be either (R) or (S), as the hydride ion (H-) can attack the planar carbonyl group from either face.\n    *   This results in the formation of two products:\n        *   Product A: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        *   Product B: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Since these two products have one stereocenter in common (5S) and one that is different (3R vs. 3S), they are **diastereomers**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   This is a beta-diketone. The chemical formula is C5H8O2.\n    *   The structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.\n    *   This molecule is achiral; it has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  Excess NaBH4 (Sodium borohydride): This is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols.\n    2.  Acidic workup (H3O+): This protonates the intermediate alkoxides to form the final diol product.\n*   **Product Formation and Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.\n    *   The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n    *   Starting from an achiral molecule with an achiral reagent, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and (2R, 4S)/(2S, 4R).\n        *   Product C: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   Product D: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   Product E: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Products C and D are **enantiomers**. Since they are formed from an achiral starting material, they will be produced in equal amounts, forming a racemic mixture.\n    *   Product E, (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, has a plane of symmetry and is an achiral **meso compound**. (Note: (2S, 4R) is the same molecule as (2R, 4S)).\n    *   The meso compound (E) is a **diastereomer** of the enantiomers (C and D).\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces three distinct stereoisomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains five different stereoisomers:\n1.  Product A: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  Product B: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  Product C: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  Product D: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  Product E: meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\nWe need to determine how many peaks are observed on two different types of HPLC columns.\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   A normal-phase (achiral) column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n*   **Constitutional isomers** (different connectivity, e.g., products from Rxn I vs. Rxn II) have different physical properties and will be separated.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will be separated.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will **not** be separated; they will elute together as a single peak.\n\nLet's apply this to our mixture:\n*   Products A and B are diastereomers. They will separate into **2 peaks**.\n*   Products C and D are enantiomers. They will co-elute as **1 peak**.\n*   Product E is a diastereomer of C and D. It will separate from the C/D pair, giving **1 peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (A and B) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (C, D, and E), so they will all be well-separated from each other.\n*   Total peaks = 2 (from A and B) + 1 (from C+D) + 1 (from E) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC (Chiral Column)**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase, which allows it to distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   It separates constitutional isomers, diastereomers, **and** enantiomers.\n*   Essentially, every unique stereoisomer in the mixture will be separated from all the others, assuming the column has adequate resolving power.\n\nLet's apply this to our mixture of 5 unique stereoisomers:\n*   Product A will be separated.\n*   Product B will be separated.\n*   Product C will be separated.\n*   Product D will be separated (from its enantiomer, C).\n*   Product E will be separated.\n*   Total peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to the option: 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the products formed in two separate reactions and then determining how these products will be separated using two different types of High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Reaction I\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.\n    *   There is a pre-existing stereocenter at C-5 with the (S) configuration. This means the starting material is a single, pure enantiomer.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), followed by an acidic workup (H3O+).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C-3 to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Product:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C-3 creates a new stereocenter. The hydride ion (H-) can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces. Since the molecule already contains a stereocenter at C-5, these two faces are diastereotopic. The attack from one face will lead to the (3S) alcohol, and the attack from the other face will lead to the (3R) alcohol. The stereocenter at C-5 is not affected by the reaction.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:** The reaction produces two stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship between Products:** These two products are diastereomers because they have two stereocenters, with one being the same (5S) and the other being different (3S vs. 3R).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Reaction II\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.\n    *   This is an achiral molecule (it has a plane of symmetry).\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4), followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH4 is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups. The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Product:** The reaction creates two new stereocenters at C-2 and C-4.\n    The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are enantiomers of each other. Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, this pair of chiral products will be formed in equal amounts, resulting in a racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** is a meso compound. It is superimposable on its mirror image ((2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol) and is achiral.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:** The reaction produces a mixture of three stereoisomers:\n    1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n    The first two are produced as a single racemic mixture. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the other two.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It operates in an achiral environment.\n*   It **can** separate constitutional isomers.\n*   It **can** separate diastereomers, as they have different physical properties.\n*   It **cannot** separate enantiomers, as they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n\nLet's analyze the combined product mixture:\n*   **From Reaction I:** (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These are diastereomers and will be separated into **two distinct peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The racemic mixture of [(2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol] and the meso-pentane-2,4-diol. The racemic pair and the meso compound are diastereomers and will be separated. The two enantiomers within the racemic mixture will elute together. This gives **two distinct peaks**: one for the racemic pair and one for the meso compound.\n*   **Total Peaks:** The products from Reaction I (C7 ether-alcohols) are constitutionally different from the products of Reaction II (C5 diols) and will have different retention times. Therefore, there will be no accidental overlap.\n\nThe total number of peaks in the normal-phase HPLC is the sum of peaks from the separated groups: 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC\n\nAn HPLC with a chiral stationary phase is designed to separate enantiomers. It creates a chiral environment where enantiomers interact differently with the stationary phase, leading to different retention times. It can also separate diastereomers.\n*   We have a total of five distinct stereoisomers in the final mixture:\n    1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   The chiral column will separate the two diastereomers from Reaction I.\n*   The chiral column will separate the two enantiomers from Reaction II.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II, being a diastereomer of the other products from Reaction II, will also be separated.\n*   Since all five compounds are stereochemically unique (or achiral but diastereomeric to the chiral molecules), they will each interact differently with the chiral stationary phase. Assuming an ideal separation with no accidental co-elution, each compound will produce its own peak.\n\nThe total number of peaks in the chiral HPLC is **5 peaks**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC: 4 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   It has one pre-existing chiral center at carbon C5, with the (S) configuration.\n    *   The carbonyl group is at carbon C3. This carbon is prochiral, meaning a reaction at this site can create a new chiral center.\n\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the ketone with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   LAH reduces the ketone C=O group to a secondary alcohol C-OH group.\n    *   The reduction creates a new chiral center at C3. The hydride ion (H⁻) can attack the carbonyl group from either the top face or the bottom face.\n    *   Because the starting molecule is already chiral (due to the (S) center at C5), the two faces of the carbonyl group are diastereotopic. The attack is not equally probable, leading to an unequal mixture of two diastereomeric products.\n    *   The configuration at C5 remains unchanged during the reaction. The new center at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   **Products of Reaction I:**\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products are diastereomers because they have two chiral centers, with one being the same ((S) at C5) and the other being different ((R) vs (S) at C3).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral and has no chiral centers. It has a plane of symmetry.\n\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   \"Excess\" NaBH₄ ensures that both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohol groups.\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   The reaction creates two new chiral centers at carbons C2 and C4.\n    *   Since the starting material is achiral, any chiral products must be formed as a racemic mixture (an equal amount of each enantiomer).\n    *   Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol:\n        *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images, so they are a pair of enantiomers. They will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has a plane of symmetry (it's superimposable on its mirror image, which would be (2S, 4R)). Therefore, it is a meso compound, which is achiral.\n    *   **Products of Reaction II:**\n        1.  A racemic mixture of (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n        2.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   So, Reaction II produces a total of three distinct stereoisomeric compounds.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity. It can separate structurally different compounds and diastereomers. However, it cannot separate enantiomers, as they have identical physical properties (including polarity) in an achiral environment.\n*   **The combined mixture contains:**\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n\n*   **Expected Peaks:**\n    *   Compounds 1 and 2 are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   Compounds 3 and 4 are enantiomers. They have identical polarity and will co-elute (not separate). This gives **1 peak**.\n    *   Compound 5 (the meso form) is a diastereomer of compounds 3 and 4. It has different properties and will be separated from them. This gives **1 peak**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇ ethers/alcohols) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (C₅ diols) and will have different polarities. Therefore, the peaks from Reaction I will be separate from the peaks from Reaction II.\n    *   Total peaks = (Peak for Cpd 1) + (Peak for Cpd 2) + (Peak for Cpds 3 & 4) + (Peak for Cpd 5) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP). The CSP interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It can also separate diastereomers. Essentially, it can separate all different stereoisomers.\n*   **The combined mixture contains 5 distinct stereoisomers:**\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Expected Peaks:**\n    *   Since all five compounds are stereochemically distinct and a chiral column is designed to separate such isomers, we expect each compound to produce a separate peak (assuming ideal separation conditions).\n    *   Total peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC: **4 peaks**\n*   Chiral HPLC: **5 peaks**\n\nThis corresponds to the option: 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃OCH(CH₃)CH₂C(=O)CH₂CH₃.\n    *   Let's identify the stereocenter. The IUPAC name indicates the stereocenter is at C5, and its configuration is (S). The molecule is chiral.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of a ketone with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol (-CH(OH)-).\n    *   The carbonyl carbon (C3) is prochiral. The attack by the hydride ion (H⁻) can occur from either the Re face or the Si face of the carbonyl group.\n    *   This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3. Since the original molecule already has a stereocenter at C5 (which remains unchanged), the products will be diastereomers.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:**\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two molecules are diastereomers. Since they are formed from a chiral starting material using an achiral reagent, they will likely be formed in unequal amounts, but both will be present in the final mixture.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** We obtain **2 distinct stereoisomeric products (diastereomers)**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃C(=O)CH₂C(=O)CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is symmetrical and does not have any stereocenters. It is achiral.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of a diketone with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄).\n    *   NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that converts ketones to secondary alcohols. \"Excess\" ensures both ketone groups are reduced.\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃CH(OH)CH₂CH(OH)CH₃.\n    *   The reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:**\n    *   Starting with an achiral molecule and an achiral reagent, any chiral products must be formed as a racemic mixture (a 1:1 mixture of enantiomers).\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are enantiomers. They will be produced as a racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** has a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH₂ group, making it a **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration is the same molecule, just rotated.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** We obtain **3 distinct stereoisomeric products** (one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the total mixture of products**\n\nThe combined mixture from both reactions contains a total of 2 + 3 = **5 distinct stereoisomers**:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n### **Step 4: Determine the number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their polarity. The stationary phase is polar (e.g., silica).\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment, including polarity. Therefore, they **cannot be separated** and will elute as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties, including polarity. Therefore, they **can be separated** and will give distinct peaks.\n*   Let's analyze our mixture:\n    *   **Products from Reaction I:** (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol are diastereomers. They have different polarities and will produce **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Products from Reaction II:**\n        *   (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are enantiomers. They will elute together as **1 peak**.\n        *   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It will have a different polarity and produce a separate peak (**1 peak**).\n        *   So, the products from Reaction II will give a total of 1 + 1 = **2 peaks**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (one -OH, one ether) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (two -OH groups) and will have significantly different polarities. Thus, it's safe to assume their peaks will not overlap.\n*   **Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC = (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + 2 = 4 peaks.**\n\n### **Step 5: Determine the number of peaks in chiral HPLC**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP). The CSP interacts differently with different stereoisomers.\n*   Chiral HPLC can separate **both enantiomers and diastereomers**.\n*   Since we have 5 chemically distinct stereoisomers in our final mixture, and chiral HPLC can resolve them all, we expect to see one peak for each compound.\n    1.

(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 4\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 5 (It will have a diastereomeric interaction with the CSP relative to the chiral isomers, so it will also be separated).\n*   **Total peaks in chiral HPLC = 5 peaks.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 4\n*   Number of peaks in chiral HPLC = 5\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a ketone with a single stereocenter at carbon 5, which has the (S) configuration.

The carbonyl carbon at C3 is prochiral. The hydride ion can attack from two different faces, creating a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** Since the original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected, the reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3. This results in the formation of two products which are diastereomers of each other.\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed. Let's call them Product A and Product B.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone).\n    *   The structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. This is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH4 is a reducing agent. \"Excess\" indicates that both ketone groups will be reduced to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   The structure of the product is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Products:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at carbons 2 and 4. Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) forms are enantiomers of each other. Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, they will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) form has a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and is therefore a meso compound. The (2S, 4R) form is identical to the (2R, 4S) form (they are superimposable).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomeric products are formed: one meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   meso-pentane-2,4-diol (Let's call this Product C)\n    *   A racemic mixture of (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Product D) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Product E).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture and HPLC Separation**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n*   **Product A:** (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Product B:** (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Product C:** meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Product D:** (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Product E:** (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n\nNow, let's determine how many peaks will be observed in each HPLC experiment.\n\n#### **A) Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Stationary Phase)**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment (including polarity) and therefore cannot be separated.

They have different polarities and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n    *   Product C (meso) is a diastereomer of products D and E. Therefore, C will be separated from the D/E pair.\n    *   Products D and E are enantiomers. They will not be separated and will elute together as a **single peak**.\n    *   So, the products from Reaction II will give **two peaks** in total on a normal-phase column (one for C, one for the D+E pair).\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C7H16O2) are structurally distinct from the products of Reaction II (C5H12O2) and will have different retention times.\n    *   Total peaks = 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 2 peaks (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **B) Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase)**\n\nA chiral stationary phase allows for the separation of enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers. Essentially, it can separate all unique stereoisomers.\n*   The mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers (A, B, C, D, E).\n*   Product A and Product B are diastereomers and will be resolved. (2 peaks)\n*   Product C is an achiral meso compound and will appear as a single peak.\n*   Product D and Product E are enantiomers, and the chiral column is designed to separate them. They will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n*   All five compounds (A, B, C, D, E) are chemically distinct and will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, resulting in different retention times.\n*   Therefore, all five stereoisomers will be separated.\n*   Total peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   Let's draw the structure. The main chain is a hexane with a ketone at position 3 and a methoxy group at position 5. The numbering starts from the end closer to the ketone.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-CH(OCH3)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   This molecule has one chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is given as (S).\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction with Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol (-CHOH).\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new chiral center. The hydride ion (H⁻) can attack the planar carbonyl from two different faces (re or si face).\n    *   The original stereocenter at C5 remains unchanged (its configuration is still S).\n    *   The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   This results in the formation of two products:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship between products:** These two products have two stereocenters, with one being the same (5S) and the other being different (3R vs. 3S). Molecules that are stereoisomers but not mirror images of each other are called **diastereomers**.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric alcohol products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`.\n    *   This molecule is achiral (it has a plane of symmetry through the central CH2 group).\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction with excess Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH4 is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols. The use of \"excess\" ensures both are reduced.\n*   **Product:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: `CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3`.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Products:** The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4. We need to consider all possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Relationship between products:**\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are an **enantiomeric pair**. Since the starting material is achiral, they will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S) has an internal plane of symmetry (passing through C3), making it an achiral molecule. This is a **meso compound**. (2S, 4R) is the same molecule, just flipped over.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomeric products are formed: a pair of enantiomers ((2R,4R) and (2S,4S)) and a meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe combined mixture from both reactions contains a total of **five** different compounds:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n#### **A) Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, primarily polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they **cannot be separated** and will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and **can be separated**.\n*   Let's analyze the mixture:\n    *   The two products from Reaction I ((3R, 5S) and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) are diastereomers. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) will co-elute as **1 peak**.\n    *   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it has different properties and will elute as a separate, single peak. This gives **1 peak**.\n    *   The compounds from Reaction I (C7 ethers/alcohols) are structurally very different from the compounds from Reaction II (C5 diols). Their polarities will be different, so there will be no accidental overlap between the peaks from the two reactions.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (for the enantiomeric pair from Rxn II) + 1 (for the meso from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **B) Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase (CSP). The CSP interacts differently with different stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n*   Therefore, a chiral column can separate both **diastereomers and enantiomers**.\n*   We have 5 distinct stereoisomers in our mixture.\n*   Since a chiral column can resolve all of them, each compound will produce a separate peak (assuming the column is effective and there's no accidental co-elution, which is the standard assumption for such problems).\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** We count the number of unique stereoisomers.\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   This gives a total of **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 4\n*   Number of peaks in chiral HPLC = 5\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   Let's draw the structure: The parent chain is hexane. There's a ketone (C=O) at position 3 and a methoxy group (-OCH3) at position 5. The stereocenter at carbon 5 has the (S) configuration.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-CH(OCH3)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3`. The chiral center at C5 is marked (S).\n\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H3O+).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols.\n\n*   **Products:**\n    *   The ketone at carbon 3 is prochiral. Its reduction to an alcohol will create a new chiral center at C3.\n    *   The nucleophilic hydride ion (H-) can attack the carbonyl carbon from either the top face or the bottom face. This results in the formation of two possible stereoisomers for the new alcohol group at C3, which can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   The original chiral center at C5 is not involved in the reaction, so its (S) configuration remains unchanged.\n    *   The two products formed are:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two molecules are stereoisomers but are not mirror images of each other (the mirror image of (3R, 5S) is (3S, 5R)). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`. This molecule is achiral and has a plane of symmetry.\n\n*   **Reagents:** Excess Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH4 is also a reducing agent for ketones. Since it is in excess, both ketone groups will be reduced to secondary alcohols.\n\n*   **Products:**\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: `CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3`.\n    *   This reduction creates two new chiral centers at carbons C2 and C4.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   However, the molecule is symmetric around C3. This means that (2R, 4S) is the same molecule as (2S, 4R). This specific stereoisomer has an internal plane of symmetry and is an achiral **meso compound**.\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) stereoisomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**.\n    *   Since the starting material and the reagent are both achiral, any chiral products must be formed in equal amounts as a racemic mixture.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: the meso compound and a racemic mixture of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe products from both reactions are combined. We have a total of 5 stereoisomers in the mixture:\n*   **From Rxn I:**\n    *   Compound 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Compound 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **From Rxn II:**\n    *   Compound 3: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Compound 4: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Compound 5: meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n#### **Analysis on Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but **it cannot separate enantiomers**.\n*   **Separating Rxn I products:** Compounds 1 and 2 are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and are separable by normal-phase HPLC. This will produce **2 peaks**.\n*   **Separating Rxn II products:**\n    *   Compounds 3 and 4 are enantiomers. They have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will co-elute as a single peak.\n    *   Compound 5 (the meso compound) is a diastereomer of compounds 3 and 4. It has different physical properties and will be separated from them.\n    *   Therefore, the products from Reaction II will produce **2 peaks** on a normal-phase column (one for the racemic pair, one for the meso compound).\n*   **Combining the results:** The products from Reaction I (methoxyhexanols) are constitutionally different from the products of Reaction II (pentanediols). They have different molecular formulas, sizes, and polarities, and will thus be separated from each other.\n*   **Total Peaks on Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Rxn I) + 2 peaks (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Analysis on Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase. This chiral environment allows for the separation of **enantiomers** as well as diastereomers.\n*   The goal of chiral chromatography is to resolve all stereoisomers. We assume the column and conditions are suitable for this task.\n*   We have 5 chemically distinct stereoisomers in our mixture.\n    *   Compound 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Compound 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (diastereomer of 1)\n    *   Compound 3: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Compound 4: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (enantiomer of 3)\n    *   Compound 5: meso-pentane-2,4-diol (diastereomer of 3 and 4)\n*   A chiral HPLC column can distinguish between all of these. Enantiomers (3 and 4) will be separated. Diastereomers (e.g., 1 vs 2, or 3 vs 5) will be separated. Constitutional isomers (the hexanols vs the diols) will be separated.\n*   **Total Peaks on Chiral HPLC:** Each of the 5 unique stereoisomers will produce its own peak. Thus, we expect **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of peaks in each chromatogram.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Reaction I\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   There is a single chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is specified as (S). This molecule is chiral.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), followed by an acidic workup (e.g., H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Reduction of a ketone to a secondary alcohol. LAH is a strong, non-selective reducing agent.\n*   **Product:** The ketone at C3 will be reduced to an alcohol (-OH group). The reaction creates a new chiral center at C3. The original chiral center at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n    *   The product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH₃.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   The starting material has one chiral center (C5). The reaction creates a new one (C3). The starting material is (5S).\n    *   The hydride attack on the prochiral carbonyl group at C3 can occur from two different faces, leading to two possible configurations at the new C3 center: (R) or (S).\n    *   This results in the formation of two products:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products have the same connectivity but differ in the configuration at one of their two chiral centers. Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Reaction II\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral and has a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH₂ group.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Reduction of two ketone groups to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Product:** Both ketone groups are reduced, yielding pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   The product is CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   The reaction creates two new chiral centers, at C2 and C4.\n    *   We need to determine the possible stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol. Since the molecule is symmetrical about C3, we need to check for meso compounds.\n    *   The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and (2R, 4S).\n        *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are **enantiomers** of each other. Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, they will be formed as a racemic mixture.\n        *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** has a plane of symmetry (when in the right conformation) because of the identical substituents on C2 and C4. It is a **meso compound**. (Note that (2S, 4R) is the same meso compound).\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces three stereoisomers: a pair of enantiomers ((2R,4R) and (2S,4S)) and a meso compound.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of **five** unique stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol  (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol  (from Rxn I, diastereomer of 1)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol  (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol  (from Rxn II, enantiomer of 3)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol  (from Rxn II, diastereomer of 3 and 4)\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Number of Peaks in Each HPLC Experiment\n\n**A) Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Stationary Phase):**\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Constitutional isomers** (like the products from Reaction I vs. Reaction II) have different physical properties and will be separated.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and are separable on an achiral column.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n\nLet's apply this to our mixture:\n*   The two products from Reaction I ((3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) are diastereomers. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair ((2R,4R)- and (2S,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and a meso compound.\n    *   The enantiomeric pair will co-elute, giving **1 peak**.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have different physical properties. It will be separated, giving **1 peak**.\n*   The products of Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are constitutionally different from the products of Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂), so they will all elute at different times.\n*   Total peaks = (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + (1 + 1) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**B) Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase):**\n*   Chiral HPLC can do everything a normal-phase column can do (separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers), but it can **also separate enantiomers**.\n*   The chiral stationary phase interacts differently with each enantiomer, leading to different retention times.\n\nLet's apply this to our mixture of five unique stereoisomers:\n*   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol will give **1 peak**.\n*   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (diastereomer of the above) will give a separate **1 peak**.\n*   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol will give **1 peak**.\n*   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (enantiomer of the above) will now be separated, giving its own **1 peak**.\n*   meso-pentane-2,4-diol is achiral but is a unique stereoisomer (diastereomer of the others) and will have its own retention time, giving **1 peak**.\n*   Total peaks = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **5 peaks**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   It has one chiral center at C-5, with the (S) configuration. This chiral center is not involved in the reaction and its configuration will be retained.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), 2. Acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C-3 to a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Product:** 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH₃.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the product:**\n    *   The reduction of the planar carbonyl group at C-3 creates a new chiral center. The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack the carbonyl carbon from two different faces.\n    *   This results in the formation of two possible configurations at C-3: (R) and (S).\n    *   Since the original chiral center at C-5 remains (S), the two products formed are:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two molecules are **diastereomers** because they have two chiral centers, with one center being the same (5S) and the other being different (3R vs 3S). Diastereomers are distinct chemical compounds with different physical properties.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This is an **achiral** molecule.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), 2. Acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. \"Excess\" indicates that both ketone groups will be reduced.\n*   **Product:** Pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the product:**\n    *   The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C-2 and C-4.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are **enantiomers** of each other. Since the reaction starts with achiral materials, these must be formed in equal amounts, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S) has a plane of symmetry passing through the CH₂ group, making it an achiral **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration is identical to the (2R, 4S) configuration (they are superimposable).\n    *   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture for HPLC Separation**\n\nThe combined final mixture contains five distinct chemical compounds:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n\n### **Step 4: Determine the Number of Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC is an **achiral** separation technique. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n*   It can separate structural isomers and diastereomers.\n*   It **cannot** separate enantiomers. Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together (co-elute), giving a single peak.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will separate into **2 peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) products are enantiomers. They will co-elute and produce **1 peak**.\n*   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has different physical properties and will be separated, giving its own **1 peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are structurally different from the products from Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂), so they will not co-elute with each other.\n\nTotal peaks in normal-phase HPLC = (Peaks from Rxn I products) + (Peaks from Rxn II products) = 2 + (1 + 1) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 5: Determine the Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase.\n*   This chiral environment allows for the separation of stereoisomers that interact differently with the stationary phase.\n*   It can separate **both diastereomers and enantiomers**.\n*   Therefore, each distinct stereoisomer in the mixture should produce a separate peak.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   We have 5 distinct stereoisomers in our mixture.\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> Peak 1\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> Peak 2 (diastereomer, separates)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 3\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 4 (enantiomer, separates on chiral column)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 5 (diastereomer, separates)\n\nTotal peaks in chiral HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-Phase HPLC: **4 peaks**\n*   Chiral HPLC: **5 peaks**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is chiral, with a stereocenter at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is specified as (S).\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group (-OH). This reaction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n    *   The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces. Since the molecule is already chiral (due to C5), these two attacks lead to the formation of two different products.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:**\n    *   The starting stereocenter at C5 remains (S). The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products have one stereocenter the same (S at C5) and one different (R/S at C3). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral; it has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH₄ reduces ketones to alcohols. \"Excess\" indicates that both ketone groups will be reduced.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups at C2 and C4 are reduced to hydroxyl groups.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:**\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule has two stereocenters, at C2 and C4. The maximum number of stereoisomers is 2² = 4. Let's analyze the possibilities:\n        1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n        2.  **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n        3.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n        4.  **(2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are an **enantiomeric pair**. They will be formed in equal amounts (a racemic mixture) because the starting material is achiral.\n    *   Let's look at the (2R, 4S) isomer. This molecule possesses an internal plane of symmetry that passes through C3. A molecule with stereocenters that is achiral due to internal symmetry is called a **meso compound**.\n    *   The (2S, 4R) isomer is identical to the (2R, 4S) isomer (it is the same meso compound).\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces three stereoisomers: a racemic mixture of (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, and the meso-pentane-2,4-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC is an achiral technique. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity), which means it can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it cannot separate enantiomers.\n\n*   **Products from Reaction I:** We have two diastereomers, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated by normal-phase HPLC. This will produce **2 peaks**.\n*   **Products from Reaction II:** We have a pair of enantiomers ((2R,4R)/(2S,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and a meso compound. Enantiomers are inseparable on an achiral column and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it has different physical properties and will be separated, giving a second peak. This will produce **2 peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks:** The products of Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are different compounds with different molecular formulas, structures, and polarities. They will be separated from each other. Therefore, the total number of peaks is the sum of the peaks from each reaction's products.\n    *   Total Peaks = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\nChiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase, which allows for the separation of enantiomers in addition to diastereomers.\n\n*   **Products from Reaction I:** The two diastereomers ((3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) will be separated. This produces **2 peaks**.\n*   **Products from Reaction II:** The chiral column will separate the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers from each other. This will produce 2 peaks. The meso compound is a distinct, achiral stereoisomer and will elute as its own peak. Thus, the three stereoisomers from Reaction II will be fully resolved. This produces **3 peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks:** Again, the compounds from Reaction I and Reaction II are different and will not co-elute. The total number of peaks is the sum from each group.\n    *   Total Peaks = 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC: 4 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   The IUPAC numbering starts from the right to give the ketone the lowest number (3). So the carbon chain is C1 to C6 from right to left: CH₃(1)-CH₂(2)-C(=O)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH(OCH₃)(5)-CH₃(6).\n    *   There is a stereocenter at C5, and its configuration is given as (S). This molecule is a single enantiomer.\n\n2.  **Reaction:** The ketone is treated with LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH reduces the ketone group (C=O) at C3 to a secondary alcohol (-CH(OH)-).\n\n3.  **Products' Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The reaction does not affect the existing stereocenter at C5.\n    *   The carbonyl carbon at C3 is sp²-hybridized and prochiral. The hydride ion (H⁻) can attack from either face of the planar carbonyl group, creating a new stereocenter at C3.\n    *   Since the starting molecule already has a stereocenter, the attack of the hydride is on a chiral molecule. This will lead to the formation of two products which are diastereomers. The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   The products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction I produces **two distinct diastereomeric compounds**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral and symmetric.\n\n2.  **Reaction:** The dione is treated with *excess* NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride), followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols.\n\n3.  **Products' Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n    *   Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, any chiral products must be formed as a racemic mixture.\n    *   Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers: (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n        *   **(2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry (in a certain conformation) and is therefore a **meso compound**. (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) represent the same achiral molecule.\n        *   **(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S):** These two are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a **pair of enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts from an achiral precursor, they will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces a mixture of **three distinct stereoisomers**: one meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC is an achiral technique. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore **cannot be separated**. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and **can be separated**.\n    *   **Constitutional isomers** have different connectivity and will be separated.\n\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:**\n    1.  **Products from Reaction I:** (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These are diastereomers, so they have different polarities and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    2.  **Products from Reaction II:** The meso-pentane-2,4-diol and the enantiomeric pair of pentane-2,4-diols. The meso compound is a diastereomer of each of the enantiomers. Thus, the meso compound will be separated from the enantiomeric pair. The two enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will not separate from each other and will form a single peak. This gives **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, one for the racemic pair).\n    3.  **Comparing Products from I and II:** The products of Reaction I are 5-methoxyhexan-3-ols (C₇H₁₆O₂), while the products of Reaction II are pentane-2,4-diols (C₅H₁₂O₂). These are constitutional isomers with different molecular formulas, sizes, and functional groups. They will have significantly different polarities and will be easily separated from each other.\n\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** Adding the peaks from each separable group: 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP). This chiral environment allows for the separation of stereoisomers that have different three-dimensional shapes.\n    *   It separates **enantiomers**.\n    *   It also separates **diastereomers**.\n    *   Assuming an ideal chiral column with sufficient resolving power, all stereochemically unique compounds will be separated.\n\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:**\n    *   The final mixture contains 5 unique stereoisomers:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        3.  meso-(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        4.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        5.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Since all five of these compounds are stereochemically distinct (either constitutional isomers, diastereomers, or enantiomers), they will all interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Each of the 5 stereoisomers will be resolved into a separate peak. Therefore, we will observe **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

This is a chiral molecule containing a single stereocenter (C5) in the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the ketone at C3 using Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH).\n*   **Stereochemistry of Products:** The reduction of the prochiral ketone at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting material is already chiral (at C5, which is unaffected by the reaction), the two products formed will have configurations (3R, 5S) and (3S, 5S). These two molecules are stereoisomers that are not mirror images, making them **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two distinct diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetrical and achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of both ketone groups using excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄).\n*   **Stereochemistry of Products:** The reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4, producing pentane-2,4-diol. The possible stereoisomers are:\n    1.  A pair of **enantiomers**: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.

The two enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together. This gives **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair).\n*   **Total Peaks:** The products from Reaction I are structurally different from those of Reaction II, so they will be separated from each other. Total peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 5: Analysis with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Uses a chiral stationary phase that can differentiate between enantiomers as well as diastereomers.\n*   **Separation of the Mixture:**\n    *   The chiral column will separate all five unique stereoisomers from each other.\n*   **Total Peaks:** Each of the 5 stereoisomers will produce a distinct peak.

This molecule has one chiral center at carbon 5, with the (S) configuration. The structure is CH3-CH(OCH3)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3.\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH reduces the ketone group (C=O) at carbon 3 to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The ketone at C3 is a prochiral center. The hydride ion (H-) can attack the carbonyl carbon from two different faces (re and si faces). This reduction creates a new chiral center at C3. Since the starting molecule already contains a chiral center at C5, the attack on the two faces is not equally probable, leading to the formation of two diastereomeric products. The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:** The products are (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two molecules are diastereomers of each other.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone). Its structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. This molecule is achiral; it has a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH2 group.\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH4), a reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. Since NaBH4 is in excess, both ketone groups will be reduced to hydroxyl groups.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. This molecule has two chiral centers, at C2 and C4. Since the starting material and the reagent (NaBH4) are both achiral, the reaction must produce an overall achiral mixture. Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are enantiomers of each other. Since the reaction is not stereospecific, they will be formed in equal amounts, resulting in a racemic mixture.\n    The (2R, 4S) isomer has an internal plane of symmetry, which means it is a meso compound and is achiral. The (2S, 4R) isomer is the same meso compound.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:** The reaction produces three stereoisomers: the enantiomeric pair of (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, and the meso-pentane-2,4-diol.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined product mixture with normal-phase HPLC.**\n\n*   **Combined Products:** The final mixture contains five compounds in total:\n    1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n    2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC Principle:** A normal-phase HPLC column has an achiral stationary phase. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   The two products from Reaction I, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n    *   The products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The enantiomers, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, have identical properties in an achiral environment and will co-elute as a **single peak**. The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it has different properties and will elute as a **separate peak**. This gives two peaks for the products of Reaction II.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C9H20O2) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C5H12O2) and will have different retention times.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-phase HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Rxn I) + 2 peaks (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the combined product mixture with chiral HPLC.**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC Principle:** An HPLC column with a chiral stationary phase can differentiate between chiral molecules, including enantiomers, because they interact differently with the chiral environment.\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated, giving **two peaks**.\n    *   The three stereoisomers from Reaction II will all be separated from each other. The chiral column will resolve the enantiomeric pair, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, into **two separate peaks**. The meso compound is achiral, but it is a diastereomer of the other two and will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, eluting as its own **separate peak**. This gives three peaks for the products of Reaction II.\n    *   Again, the products from the two reactions are structurally distinct and will be separated from each other.\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Rxn I) + 3 peaks (from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **5 Peaks in chiral HPLC**\n*   **4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   Let's identify the stereocenter. The stereocenter is at carbon C5, which is bonded to -H, -CH₃, -OCH₃, and -CH₂C(=O)CH₂CH₃.\n    *   The problem states the configuration at C5 is (S). This is a single, pure enantiomer.\n*   **Reagents:** LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Transformation:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Product:** The product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH₃.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the product:**\n    *   The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected by the reaction, so its configuration remains (S).\n    *   The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The carbonyl carbon is sp² hybridized and planar. The hydride ion (H⁻) can attack from either the front face or the back face of this planar group.\n    *   This attack creates two possible configurations at C3: (R) or (S).\n    *   Because the starting material is chiral (has a stereocenter at C5), the two faces of the carbonyl group are diastereotopic. The attack will not be a 50:50 mixture, but it will produce both possible stereoisomers.\n    *   The two products formed are:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products are **diastereomers** because they have one stereocenter that is the same (5S) and one that is different (3R vs. 3S).\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction I:** It produces a mixture of **two diastereomers**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral as it possesses a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH₂ group.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Transformation:** NaBH₄ reduces both ketone groups to secondary alcohols. \"Excess\" ensures both are reduced.\n*   **Product:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the product:**\n    *   The product has two new stereocenters, at C2 and C4.\n    *   Since the starting material is achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. The overall mixture must be optically inactive.\n    *   The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   Let's analyze these stereoisomers:\n        *   **(2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry through the central CH₂ group. It is a **meso compound**. (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) describe the same achiral molecule.\n        *   **(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S):** These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts from an achiral material, they will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   The products are:\n        1.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n        2.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        3.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction II:** It produces a mixture of **three stereoisomers**: one meso compound and a racemic pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains five distinct chemical compounds:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n5.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the Number of Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC uses an achiral stationary phase and separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment (including polarity) and thus **cannot be separated**. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties (including polarity) and **can be separated**.\n    *   Compounds with different molecular structures (constitutional isomers or simply different molecules) have different properties and **can be separated**.\n\n*   **Applying the principle to the mixture:**\n    *   Compounds 1 and 2 are diastereomers. They will be separated. → **2 peaks**.\n    *   Compound 3 (meso) is a diastereomer of compounds 4 and 5. It will be separated from them. → **1 peak**.\n    *   Compounds 4 and 5 are enantiomers. They will not be separated and will co-elute. → **1 peak**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) and will be easily separated from them.\n    *   Total peaks = (Peaks from Rxn I products) + (Peaks from Rxn II products) = 2 + (1 + 1) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion for Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks are observed.\n\n### **Step 5: Predict the Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase.

Let's break down the name to understand the structure. \"hexan-3-one\" indicates a six-carbon chain with a ketone group at carbon 3. \"5-methoxy\" means a -OCH3 group is attached to carbon 5. \"(S)\" specifies the stereochemistry at the chiral center, which is carbon 5 (it's bonded to H, CH3, OCH3, and a larger alkyl ketone group).\n*   **Reagent:** LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride) is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone (C=O) to a secondary alcohol (CH-OH). The acidic workup is to protonate the resulting alkoxide ion.\n*   **Product Formation and Stereochemistry:** The reaction occurs at the C3 ketone. The original chiral center at C5 is not involved in the reaction and retains its (S) configuration. The reduction of the planar sp2-hybridized carbonyl carbon at C3 creates a new chiral center. The hydride ion can attack from either face of the carbonyl group, leading to the formation of both (R) and (S) configurations at C3.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:** This reaction produces two products: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Since one stereocenter is the same (5S) and the other is different (3R vs. 3S), these two products are **diastereomers**. So, Reaction I yields a mixture of **two diastereomeric products**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetrical molecule with two ketone groups. It is achiral.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess NaBH4 (Sodium Borohydride) is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols. The acidic workup protonates the alkoxides.\n*   **Product Formation and Stereochemistry:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol. The reduction of the ketones at C2 and C4 creates two new chiral centers. The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   Let's examine the symmetry. The (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) isomers have an internal plane of symmetry, making them an achiral **meso compound**. They are the same molecule.\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They constitute a pair of **enantiomers**.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:** Since the starting material is achiral, the reaction will produce an optically inactive mixture. This means the two enantiomers are formed in equal amounts (a racemic mixture), along with the meso compound. Therefore, Reaction II yields **three stereoisomeric products**: the (2R,4R)/(2S,4S) enantiomeric pair and the meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle of Separation:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, primarily polarity. It uses an achiral stationary phase.\n*   **Separability:**\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore **cannot** be separated by normal-phase HPLC. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and **can** be separated.\n*   **Applying to the Mixture:**\n    1.  The two diastereomers from Reaction I ((3R, 5S) and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) have different properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    2.  The enantiomeric pair from Reaction II ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) are inseparable on an achiral column. This gives **1 peak**.\n    3.  The meso compound from Reaction II is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has different properties and will be separated from them. This gives **1 peak**.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** The products from Reaction I are also structurally different from those of Reaction II, so they will be well separated. The total number of peaks is the sum of the separable groups: 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (from enantiomers of Rxn II) + 1 (from meso of Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle of Separation:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This creates a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers. The interactions between each enantiomer and the chiral stationary phase are diastereomeric in nature, resulting in different retention times.\n*   **Separability:** Chiral HPLC can separate all stereoisomers, including enantiomers and diastereomers.\n*   **Applying to the Mixture:** We have a total of 5 distinct stereoisomers in our combined product mixture:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Since all five of these compounds are stereochemically distinct, a chiral HPLC column is designed to resolve them all. Therefore, we would expect to see **5 peaks**.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral ketone with one stereocenter at the C5 position, with (S) configuration.\n    The structure is: CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺). LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol (-CHOH).\n*   **Product Formation:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting molecule already has a stereocenter at C5, the attack of the hydride ion (H⁻) on the two faces of the carbonyl group is diastereoselective. This means two diastereomeric products will be formed, generally in unequal amounts.\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two products are formed, and they are diastereomers of each other.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral diketone.\n    The structure is: CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Product Formation:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃. This molecule has two stereocenters (at C2 and C4). Because the reactant and reagent are both achiral, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. Due to the symmetry of the molecule (the groups attached to C2 and C4 are identical), there are three possible stereoisomers:\n    *   A meso compound: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. This compound is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n    *   A pair of enantiomers: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol. Since they are formed from an achiral starting material, they will be produced as a 1:1 racemic mixture.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: one meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Normal-Phase HPLC Chromatogram**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. In an achiral environment:\n*   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n*   Enantiomers have identical physical properties and cannot be separated (they co-elute).\n\nThe combined mixture contains five compounds in total: the two diastereomers from Reaction I and the three stereoisomers from Reaction II.\n1.  **Products from Reaction I:** The two products, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers. They will have different retention times and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n2.  **Products from Reaction II:** The meso-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-diols). Therefore, the meso compound will be separated from the enantiomeric pair. The two enantiomers, however, will co-elute. This gives **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, one for the racemic pair).\n3.  **Combined Mixture:** The products from Reaction I are methoxy-alcohols, while the products from Reaction II are diols. These two classes of compounds have significantly different structures and polarities and will be easily separated from each other.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks on a normal-phase column will be the sum of the peaks from each group: 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Chiral HPLC Chromatogram**\n\nA chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase, which allows for the separation of enantiomers in addition to diastereomers.\n*   The column creates a chiral environment where enantiomers interact differently with the stationary phase, leading to different retention times.\n\nThe mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n4.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n\nSince all five of these compounds are stereochemically different from one another, a chiral column is expected to resolve all of them.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II will be separated from the others (as it's a diastereomer to them).\n*   The two enantiomers from Reaction II will be resolved from each other.\n\nAssuming no accidental co-elution, each of the five stereoisomers will produce a separate peak. This results in a total of **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a ketone. The chemical formula is C7H14O2.\n    *   The structure is CH3-CH(OCH3)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3.\n    *   The molecule has one chiral center at carbon C5, and it is given as the pure (S) enantiomer.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  LAH (Lithium aluminum hydride): This is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol (-OH).\n    2.  Acidic workup (H3O+): This protonates the intermediate alkoxide to form the final alcohol product.\n*   **Product Formation and Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a *new* chiral center.\n    *   The original chiral center at C5 remains in the (S) configuration.\n    *   The new chiral center at C3 can be either (R) or (S), as the hydride ion (H-) can attack the planar carbonyl group from either face.\n    *   This results in the formation of two products:\n        *   Product A: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        *   Product B: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Since these two products have one stereocenter in common (5S) and one that is different (3R vs. 3S), they are **diastereomers**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   This is a beta-diketone. The chemical formula is C5H8O2.\n    *   The structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.\n    *   This molecule is achiral; it has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  Excess NaBH4 (Sodium borohydride): This is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols.\n    2.  Acidic workup (H3O+): This protonates the intermediate alkoxides to form the final diol product.\n*   **Product Formation and Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.\n    *   The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n    *   Starting from an achiral molecule with an achiral reagent, all possible stereoisomers will be formed. The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and (2R, 4S)/(2S, 4R).\n        *   Product C: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   Product D: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   Product E: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Products C and D are **enantiomers**. Since they are formed from an achiral starting material, they will be produced in equal amounts, forming a racemic mixture.\n    *   Product E, (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, has a plane of symmetry and is an achiral **meso compound**. (Note: (2S, 4R) is the same molecule as (2R, 4S)).\n    *   The meso compound (E) is a **diastereomer** of the enantiomers (C and D).\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces three distinct stereoisomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains five different stereoisomers:\n1.  Product A: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  Product B: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  Product C: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  Product D: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  Product E: meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\nWe need to determine how many peaks are observed on two different types of HPLC columns.\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   A normal-phase (achiral) column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n*   **Constitutional isomers** (different connectivity, e.g., products from Rxn I vs. Rxn II) have different physical properties and will be separated.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and will be separated.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will **not** be separated; they will elute together as a single peak.\n\nLet's apply this to our mixture:\n*   Products A and B are diastereomers. They will separate into **2 peaks**.\n*   Products C and D are enantiomers. They will co-elute as **1 peak**.\n*   Product E is a diastereomer of C and D. It will separate from the C/D pair, giving **1 peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (A and B) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (C, D, and E), so they will all be well-separated from each other.\n*   Total peaks = 2 (from A and B) + 1 (from C+D) + 1 (from E) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC (Chiral Column)**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase, which allows it to distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   It separates constitutional isomers, diastereomers, **and** enantiomers.\n*   Essentially, every unique stereoisomer in the mixture will be separated from all the others, assuming the column has adequate resolving power.\n\nLet's apply this to our mixture of 5 unique stereoisomers:\n*   Product A will be separated.\n*   Product B will be separated.\n*   Product C will be separated.\n*   Product D will be separated (from its enantiomer, C).\n*   Product E will be separated.\n*   Total peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to the option: 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the products formed in two separate reactions and then determining how these products will be separated using two different types of High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Reaction I\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.\n    *   There is a pre-existing stereocenter at C-5 with the (S) configuration. This means the starting material is a single, pure enantiomer.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), followed by an acidic workup (H3O+).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C-3 to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Product:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C-3 creates a new stereocenter. The hydride ion (H-) can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces. Since the molecule already contains a stereocenter at C-5, these two faces are diastereotopic. The attack from one face will lead to the (3S) alcohol, and the attack from the other face will lead to the (3R) alcohol. The stereocenter at C-5 is not affected by the reaction.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:** The reaction produces two stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship between Products:** These two products are diastereomers because they have two stereocenters, with one being the same (5S) and the other being different (3S vs. 3R).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Reaction II\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.\n    *   This is an achiral molecule (it has a plane of symmetry).\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4), followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH4 is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups. The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Product:** The reaction creates two new stereocenters at C-2 and C-4.\n    The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are enantiomers of each other. Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, this pair of chiral products will be formed in equal amounts, resulting in a racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** is a meso compound. It is superimposable on its mirror image ((2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol) and is achiral.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:** The reaction produces a mixture of three stereoisomers:\n    1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n    The first two are produced as a single racemic mixture. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the other two.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It operates in an achiral environment.\n*   It **can** separate constitutional isomers.\n*   It **can** separate diastereomers, as they have different physical properties.\n*   It **cannot** separate enantiomers, as they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n\nLet's analyze the combined product mixture:\n*   **From Reaction I:** (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These are diastereomers and will be separated into **two distinct peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The racemic mixture of [(2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol] and the meso-pentane-2,4-diol. The racemic pair and the meso compound are diastereomers and will be separated. The two enantiomers within the racemic mixture will elute together. This gives **two distinct peaks**: one for the racemic pair and one for the meso compound.\n*   **Total Peaks:** The products from Reaction I (C7 ether-alcohols) are constitutionally different from the products of Reaction II (C5 diols) and will have different retention times. Therefore, there will be no accidental overlap.\n\nThe total number of peaks in the normal-phase HPLC is the sum of peaks from the separated groups: 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC\n\nAn HPLC with a chiral stationary phase is designed to separate enantiomers. It creates a chiral environment where enantiomers interact differently with the stationary phase, leading to different retention times. It can also separate diastereomers.\n*   We have a total of five distinct stereoisomers in the final mixture:\n    1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.

Assuming an ideal separation with no accidental co-elution, each compound will produce its own peak.\n\nThe total number of peaks in the chiral HPLC is **5 peaks**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC: 4 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   It has one pre-existing chiral center at carbon C5, with the (S) configuration.\n    *   The carbonyl group is at carbon C3. This carbon is prochiral, meaning a reaction at this site can create a new chiral center.\n\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the ketone with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   LAH reduces the ketone C=O group to a secondary alcohol C-OH group.\n    *   The reduction creates a new chiral center at C3. The hydride ion (H⁻) can attack the carbonyl group from either the top face or the bottom face.\n    *   Because the starting molecule is already chiral (due to the (S) center at C5), the two faces of the carbonyl group are diastereotopic. The attack is not equally probable, leading to an unequal mixture of two diastereomeric products.\n    *   The configuration at C5 remains unchanged during the reaction. The new center at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   **Products of Reaction I:**\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products are diastereomers because they have two chiral centers, with one being the same ((S) at C5) and the other being different ((R) vs (S) at C3).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral and has no chiral centers. It has a plane of symmetry.\n\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   \"Excess\" NaBH₄ ensures that both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohol groups.\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   The reaction creates two new chiral centers at carbons C2 and C4.\n    *   Since the starting material is achiral, any chiral products must be formed as a racemic mixture (an equal amount of each enantiomer).\n    *   Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol:\n        *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images, so they are a pair of enantiomers. They will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has a plane of symmetry (it's superimposable on its mirror image, which would be (2S, 4R)). Therefore, it is a meso compound, which is achiral.\n    *   **Products of Reaction II:**\n        1.  A racemic mixture of (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n        2.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   So, Reaction II produces a total of three distinct stereoisomeric compounds.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity. It can separate structurally different compounds and diastereomers. However, it cannot separate enantiomers, as they have identical physical properties (including polarity) in an achiral environment.\n*   **The combined mixture contains:**\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n\n*   **Expected Peaks:**\n    *   Compounds 1 and 2 are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   Compounds 3 and 4 are enantiomers. They have identical polarity and will co-elute (not separate). This gives **1 peak**.\n    *   Compound 5 (the meso form) is a diastereomer of compounds 3 and 4. It has different properties and will be separated from them. This gives **1 peak**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇ ethers/alcohols) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (C₅ diols) and will have different polarities. Therefore, the peaks from Reaction I will be separate from the peaks from Reaction II.\n    *   Total peaks = (Peak for Cpd 1) + (Peak for Cpd 2) + (Peak for Cpds 3 & 4) + (Peak for Cpd 5) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP). The CSP interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It can also separate diastereomers. Essentially, it can separate all different stereoisomers.\n*   **The combined mixture contains 5 distinct stereoisomers:**\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Expected Peaks:**\n    *   Since all five compounds are stereochemically distinct and a chiral column is designed to separate such isomers, we expect each compound to produce a separate peak (assuming ideal separation conditions).\n    *   Total peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC: **4 peaks**\n*   Chiral HPLC: **5 peaks**\n\nThis corresponds to the option: 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃OCH(CH₃)CH₂C(=O)CH₂CH₃.\n    *   Let's identify the stereocenter. The IUPAC name indicates the stereocenter is at C5, and its configuration is (S). The molecule is chiral.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of a ketone with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol (-CH(OH)-).\n    *   The carbonyl carbon (C3) is prochiral. The attack by the hydride ion (H⁻) can occur from either the Re face or the Si face of the carbonyl group.\n    *   This reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3. Since the original molecule already has a stereocenter at C5 (which remains unchanged), the products will be diastereomers.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:**\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two molecules are diastereomers. Since they are formed from a chiral starting material using an achiral reagent, they will likely be formed in unequal amounts, but both will be present in the final mixture.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** We obtain **2 distinct stereoisomeric products (diastereomers)**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃C(=O)CH₂C(=O)CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is symmetrical and does not have any stereocenters. It is achiral.\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of a diketone with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄).\n    *   NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that converts ketones to secondary alcohols. \"Excess\" ensures both ketone groups are reduced.\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃CH(OH)CH₂CH(OH)CH₃.\n    *   The reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:**\n    *   Starting with an achiral molecule and an achiral reagent, any chiral products must be formed as a racemic mixture (a 1:1 mixture of enantiomers).\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are enantiomers. They will be produced as a racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** has a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH₂ group, making it a **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration is the same molecule, just rotated.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** We obtain **3 distinct stereoisomeric products** (one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the total mixture of products**\n\nThe combined mixture from both reactions contains a total of 2 + 3 = **5 distinct stereoisomers**:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n### **Step 4: Determine the number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their polarity. The stationary phase is polar (e.g., silica).\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment, including polarity. Therefore, they **cannot be separated** and will elute as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties, including polarity. Therefore, they **can be separated** and will give distinct peaks.\n*   Let's analyze our mixture:\n    *   **Products from Reaction I:** (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol are diastereomers. They have different polarities and will produce **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Products from Reaction II:**\n        *   (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are enantiomers. They will elute together as **1 peak**.\n        *   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It will have a different polarity and produce a separate peak (**1 peak**).\n        *   So, the products from Reaction II will give a total of 1 + 1 = **2 peaks**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (one -OH, one ether) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (two -OH groups) and will have significantly different polarities. Thus, it's safe to assume their peaks will not overlap.\n*   **Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC = (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + 2 = 4 peaks.**\n\n### **Step 5: Determine the number of peaks in chiral HPLC**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP). The CSP interacts differently with different stereoisomers.\n*   Chiral HPLC can separate **both enantiomers and diastereomers**.\n*   Since we have 5 chemically distinct stereoisomers in our final mixture, and chiral HPLC can resolve them all, we expect to see one peak for each compound.\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> Peak 1\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> Peak 2\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 3\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 4\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 5 (It will have a diastereomeric interaction with the CSP relative to the chiral isomers, so it will also be separated).\n*   **Total peaks in chiral HPLC = 5 peaks.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC = 4\n*   Number of peaks in chiral HPLC = 5\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a ketone with a single stereocenter at carbon 5, which has the (S) configuration. The structure is CH3-O-C*H(CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3, where C* is the chiral center.\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H3O+).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at carbon 3 to a secondary alcohol. The carbonyl carbon at C3 is prochiral. The hydride ion can attack from two different faces, creating a new stereocenter at C3.\n*   **Products:** Since the original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected, the reduction creates a new stereocenter at C3. This results in the formation of two products which are diastereomers of each other.\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed. Let's call them Product A and Product B.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone).\n    *   The structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. This is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH4 is a reducing agent. \"Excess\" indicates that both ketone groups will be reduced to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   The structure of the product is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Products:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at carbons 2 and 4. Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) forms are enantiomers of each other. Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, they will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   The (2R, 4S) form has a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and is therefore a meso compound. The (2S, 4R) form is identical to the (2R, 4S) form (they are superimposable).\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomeric products are formed: one meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   meso-pentane-2,4-diol (Let's call this Product C)\n    *   A racemic mixture of (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Product D) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Product E).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture and HPLC Separation**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n*   **Product A:** (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Product B:** (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Product C:** meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Product D:** (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Product E:** (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n\nNow, let's determine how many peaks will be observed in each HPLC experiment.\n\n#### **A) Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Stationary Phase)**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment (including polarity) and therefore cannot be separated. They co-elute as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and different polarities, so they can be separated.\n*   Let's analyze the mixture:\n    *   Products A and B are diastereomers. They have different polarities and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n    *   Product C (meso) is a diastereomer of products D and E. Therefore, C will be separated from the D/E pair.\n    *   Products D and E are enantiomers. They will not be separated and will elute together as a **single peak**.\n    *   So, the products from Reaction II will give **two peaks** in total on a normal-phase column (one for C, one for the D+E pair).\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C7H16O2) are structurally distinct from the products of Reaction II (C5H12O2) and will have different retention times.\n    *   Total peaks = 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 2 peaks (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **B) Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase)**\n\nA chiral stationary phase allows for the separation of enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers.

They will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n*   All five compounds (A, B, C, D, E) are chemically distinct and will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, resulting in different retention times.\n*   Therefore, all five stereoisomers will be separated.\n*   Total peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   Let's draw the structure. The main chain is a hexane with a ketone at position 3 and a methoxy group at position 5. The numbering starts from the end closer to the ketone.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-CH(OCH3)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   This molecule has one chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is given as (S).\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction with Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol (-CHOH).\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new chiral center. The hydride ion (H⁻) can attack the planar carbonyl from two different faces (re or si face).\n    *   The original stereocenter at C5 remains unchanged (its configuration is still S).\n    *   The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   This results in the formation of two products:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship between products:** These two products have two stereocenters, with one being the same (5S) and the other being different (3R vs. 3S). Molecules that are stereoisomers but not mirror images of each other are called **diastereomers**.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric alcohol products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`.\n    *   This molecule is achiral (it has a plane of symmetry through the central CH2 group).\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction with excess Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH4 is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols. The use of \"excess\" ensures both are reduced.\n*   **Product:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: `CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3`.\n*   **Stereochemistry of Products:** The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4. We need to consider all possible stereoisomers:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Relationship between products:**\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are an **enantiomeric pair**. Since the starting material is achiral, they will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S) has an internal plane of symmetry (passing through C3), making it an achiral molecule. This is a **meso compound**. (2S, 4R) is the same molecule, just flipped over.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomeric products are formed: a pair of enantiomers ((2R,4R) and (2S,4S)) and a meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe combined mixture from both reactions contains a total of **five** different compounds:\n1.

Therefore, they **cannot be separated** and will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and **can be separated**.\n*   Let's analyze the mixture:\n    *   The two products from Reaction I ((3R, 5S) and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) are diastereomers. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) will co-elute as **1 peak**.\n    *   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it has different properties and will elute as a separate, single peak. This gives **1 peak**.\n    *   The compounds from Reaction I (C7 ethers/alcohols) are structurally very different from the compounds from Reaction II (C5 diols). Their polarities will be different, so there will be no accidental overlap between the peaks from the two reactions.\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (for the enantiomeric pair from Rxn II) + 1 (for the meso from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **B) Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase (CSP). The CSP interacts differently with different stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n*   Therefore, a chiral column can separate both **diastereomers and enantiomers**.\n*   We have 5 distinct stereoisomers in our mixture.\n*   Since a chiral column can resolve all of them, each compound will produce a separate peak (assuming the column is effective and there's no accidental co-elution, which is the standard assumption for such problems).\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** We count the number of unique stereoisomers.\n    1.

Its reduction to an alcohol will create a new chiral center at C3.\n    *   The nucleophilic hydride ion (H-) can attack the carbonyl carbon from either the top face or the bottom face. This results in the formation of two possible stereoisomers for the new alcohol group at C3, which can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   The original chiral center at C5 is not involved in the reaction, so its (S) configuration remains unchanged.\n    *   The two products formed are:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two molecules are stereoisomers but are not mirror images of each other (the mirror image of (3R, 5S) is (3S, 5R)). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`. This molecule is achiral and has a plane of symmetry.\n\n*   **Reagents:** Excess Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH4 is also a reducing agent for ketones. Since it is in excess, both ketone groups will be reduced to secondary alcohols.\n\n*   **Products:**\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: `CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3`.\n    *   This reduction creates two new chiral centers at carbons C2 and C4.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   However, the molecule is symmetric around C3. This means that (2R, 4S) is the same molecule as (2S, 4R). This specific stereoisomer has an internal plane of symmetry and is an achiral **meso compound**.\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) stereoisomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**.\n    *   Since the starting material and the reagent are both achiral, any chiral products must be formed in equal amounts as a racemic mixture.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: the meso compound and a racemic mixture of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe products from both reactions are combined. We have a total of 5 stereoisomers in the mixture:\n*   **From Rxn I:**\n    *   Compound 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Compound 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **From Rxn II:**\n    *   Compound 3: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Compound 4: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Compound 5: meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n#### **Analysis on Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but **it cannot separate enantiomers**.\n*   **Separating Rxn I products:** Compounds 1 and 2 are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and are separable by normal-phase HPLC. This will produce **2 peaks**.\n*   **Separating Rxn II products:**\n    *   Compounds 3 and 4 are enantiomers. They have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will co-elute as a single peak.\n    *   Compound 5 (the meso compound) is a diastereomer of compounds 3 and 4. It has different physical properties and will be separated from them.\n    *   Therefore, the products from Reaction II will produce **2 peaks** on a normal-phase column (one for the racemic pair, one for the meso compound).\n*   **Combining the results:** The products from Reaction I (methoxyhexanols) are constitutionally different from the products of Reaction II (pentanediols). They have different molecular formulas, sizes, and polarities, and will thus be separated from each other.\n*   **Total Peaks on Normal-Phase HPLC:** 2 peaks (from Rxn I) + 2 peaks (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Analysis on Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase. This chiral environment allows for the separation of **enantiomers** as well as diastereomers.\n*   The goal of chiral chromatography is to resolve all stereoisomers. We assume the column and conditions are suitable for this task.\n*   We have 5 chemically distinct stereoisomers in our mixture.\n    *   Compound 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Compound 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (diastereomer of 1)\n    *   Compound 3: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Compound 4: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (enantiomer of 3)\n    *   Compound 5: meso-pentane-2,4-diol (diastereomer of 3 and 4)\n*   A chiral HPLC column can distinguish between all of these. Enantiomers (3 and 4) will be separated. Diastereomers (e.g., 1 vs 2, or 3 vs 5) will be separated. Constitutional isomers (the hexanols vs the diols) will be separated.\n*   **Total Peaks on Chiral HPLC:** Each of the 5 unique stereoisomers will produce its own peak. Thus, we expect **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of peaks in each chromatogram.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Reaction I\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   There is a single chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is specified as (S). This molecule is chiral.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), followed by an acidic workup (e.g., H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Reduction of a ketone to a secondary alcohol. LAH is a strong, non-selective reducing agent.\n*   **Product:** The ketone at C3 will be reduced to an alcohol (-OH group). The reaction creates a new chiral center at C3. The original chiral center at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n    *   The product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH₃.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   The starting material has one chiral center (C5). The reaction creates a new one (C3). The starting material is (5S).\n    *   The hydride attack on the prochiral carbonyl group at C3 can occur from two different faces, leading to two possible configurations at the new C3 center: (R) or (S).\n    *   This results in the formation of two products:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products have the same connectivity but differ in the configuration at one of their two chiral centers. Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Reaction II\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral and has a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH₂ group.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Reduction of two ketone groups to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Product:** Both ketone groups are reduced, yielding pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   The product is CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   The reaction creates two new chiral centers, at C2 and C4.\n    *   We need to determine the possible stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol. Since the molecule is symmetrical about C3, we need to check for meso compounds.\n    *   The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and (2R, 4S).\n        *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are **enantiomers** of each other. Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, they will be formed as a racemic mixture.\n        *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** has a plane of symmetry (when in the right conformation) because of the identical substituents on C2 and C4. It is a **meso compound**. (Note that (2S, 4R) is the same meso compound).\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces three stereoisomers: a pair of enantiomers ((2R,4R) and (2S,4S)) and a meso compound.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of **five** unique stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol  (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol  (from Rxn I, diastereomer of 1)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol  (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol  (from Rxn II, enantiomer of 3)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol  (from Rxn II, diastereomer of 3 and 4)\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Number of Peaks in Each HPLC Experiment\n\n**A) Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Stationary Phase):**\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Constitutional isomers** (like the products from Reaction I vs. Reaction II) have different physical properties and will be separated.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and are separable on an achiral column.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n\nLet's apply this to our mixture:\n*   The two products from Reaction I ((3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) are diastereomers. They will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n*   The three products from Reaction II consist of an enantiomeric pair ((2R,4R)- and (2S,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and a meso compound.\n    *   The enantiomeric pair will co-elute, giving **1 peak**.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have different physical properties. It will be separated, giving **1 peak**.\n*   The products of Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are constitutionally different from the products of Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂), so they will all elute at different times.\n*   Total peaks = (Peaks from Rxn I) + (Peaks from Rxn II) = 2 + (1 + 1) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**B) Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase):**\n*   Chiral HPLC can do everything a normal-phase column can do (separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers), but it can **also separate enantiomers**.\n*   The chiral stationary phase interacts differently with each enantiomer, leading to different retention times.\n\nLet's apply this to our mixture of five unique stereoisomers:\n*   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol will give **1 peak**.\n*   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (diastereomer of the above) will give a separate **1 peak**.\n*   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol will give **1 peak**.\n*   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (enantiomer of the above) will now be separated, giving its own **1 peak**.\n*   meso-pentane-2,4-diol is achiral but is a unique stereoisomer (diastereomer of the others) and will have its own retention time, giving **1 peak**.\n*   Total peaks = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **5 peaks**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   It has one chiral center at C-5, with the (S) configuration. This chiral center is not involved in the reaction and its configuration will be retained.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), 2. Acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C-3 to a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Product:** 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH₃.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the product:**\n    *   The reduction of the planar carbonyl group at C-3 creates a new chiral center. The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack the carbonyl carbon from two different faces.\n    *   This results in the formation of two possible configurations at C-3: (R) and (S).\n    *   Since the original chiral center at C-5 remains (S), the two products formed are:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two molecules are **diastereomers** because they have two chiral centers, with one center being the same (5S) and the other being different (3R vs 3S). Diastereomers are distinct chemical compounds with different physical properties.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This is an **achiral** molecule.\n*   **Reagents:** 1. Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), 2. Acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. \"Excess\" indicates that both ketone groups will be reduced.\n*   **Product:** Pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the product:**\n    *   The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C-2 and C-4.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are **enantiomers** of each other. Since the reaction starts with achiral materials, these must be formed in equal amounts, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S) has a plane of symmetry passing through the CH₂ group, making it an achiral **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration is identical to the (2R, 4S) configuration (they are superimposable).\n    *   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed: a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture for HPLC Separation**\n\nThe combined final mixture contains five distinct chemical compounds:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n\n### **Step 4: Determine the Number of Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC is an **achiral** separation technique. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n*   It can separate structural isomers and diastereomers.\n*   It **cannot** separate enantiomers. Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together (co-elute), giving a single peak.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. They have different physical properties and will separate into **2 peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) products are enantiomers. They will co-elute and produce **1 peak**.\n*   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It has different physical properties and will be separated, giving its own **1 peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are structurally different from the products from Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂), so they will not co-elute with each other.\n\nTotal peaks in normal-phase HPLC = (Peaks from Rxn I products) + (Peaks from Rxn II products) = 2 + (1 + 1) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 5: Determine the Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase.\n*   This chiral environment allows for the separation of stereoisomers that interact differently with the stationary phase.\n*   It can separate **both diastereomers and enantiomers**.\n*   Therefore, each distinct stereoisomer in the mixture should produce a separate peak.\n\nLet's count the peaks:\n*   We have 5 distinct stereoisomers in our mixture.\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> Peak 1\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> Peak 2 (diastereomer, separates)\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 3\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 4 (enantiomer, separates on chiral column)\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 5 (diastereomer, separates)\n\nTotal peaks in chiral HPLC = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-Phase HPLC: **4 peaks**\n*   Chiral HPLC: **5 peaks**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is chiral, with a stereocenter at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is specified as (S).\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to secondary alcohols.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl group (-OH). This reaction creates a new stereocenter at C3.\n    *   The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces. Since the molecule is already chiral (due to C5), these two attacks lead to the formation of two different products.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:**\n    *   The starting stereocenter at C5 remains (S). The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products have one stereocenter the same (S at C5) and one different (R/S at C3). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral; it has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH₄ reduces ketones to alcohols. \"Excess\" indicates that both ketone groups will be reduced.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups at C2 and C4 are reduced to hydroxyl groups.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:**\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule has two stereocenters, at C2 and C4. The maximum number of stereoisomers is 2² = 4. Let's analyze the possibilities:\n        1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n        2.  **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n        3.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n        4.  **(2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are an **enantiomeric pair**. They will be formed in equal amounts (a racemic mixture) because the starting material is achiral.\n    *   Let's look at the (2R, 4S) isomer. This molecule possesses an internal plane of symmetry that passes through C3. A molecule with stereocenters that is achiral due to internal symmetry is called a **meso compound**.\n    *   The (2S, 4R) isomer is identical to the (2R, 4S) isomer (it is the same meso compound).\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces three stereoisomers: a racemic mixture of (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, and the meso-pentane-2,4-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC is an achiral technique. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity), which means it can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it cannot separate enantiomers.\n\n*   **Products from Reaction I:** We have two diastereomers, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated by normal-phase HPLC. This will produce **2 peaks**.\n*   **Products from Reaction II:** We have a pair of enantiomers ((2R,4R)/(2S,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and a meso compound. Enantiomers are inseparable on an achiral column and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it has different physical properties and will be separated, giving a second peak. This will produce **2 peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks:** The products of Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) and Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) are different compounds with different molecular formulas, structures, and polarities. They will be separated from each other. Therefore, the total number of peaks is the sum of the peaks from each reaction's products.\n    *   Total Peaks = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\nChiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase, which allows for the separation of enantiomers in addition to diastereomers.\n\n*   **Products from Reaction I:** The two diastereomers ((3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) will be separated. This produces **2 peaks**.\n*   **Products from Reaction II:** The chiral column will separate the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers from each other. This will produce 2 peaks. The meso compound is a distinct, achiral stereoisomer and will elute as its own peak. Thus, the three stereoisomers from Reaction II will be fully resolved. This produces **3 peaks**.\n*   **Total Peaks:** Again, the compounds from Reaction I and Reaction II are different and will not co-elute. The total number of peaks is the sum from each group.\n    *   Total Peaks = 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC: 4 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   The IUPAC numbering starts from the right to give the ketone the lowest number (3). So the carbon chain is C1 to C6 from right to left: CH₃(1)-CH₂(2)-C(=O)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH(OCH₃)(5)-CH₃(6).\n    *   There is a stereocenter at C5, and its configuration is given as (S). This molecule is a single enantiomer.\n\n2.  **Reaction:** The ketone is treated with LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH reduces the ketone group (C=O) at C3 to a secondary alcohol (-CH(OH)-).\n\n3.  **Products' Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The reaction does not affect the existing stereocenter at C5.\n    *   The carbonyl carbon at C3 is sp²-hybridized and prochiral. The hydride ion (H⁻) can attack from either face of the planar carbonyl group, creating a new stereocenter at C3.\n    *   Since the starting molecule already has a stereocenter, the attack of the hydride is on a chiral molecule. This will lead to the formation of two products which are diastereomers. The new stereocenter at C3 can be either (R) or (S).\n    *   The products are (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction I produces **two distinct diastereomeric compounds**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral and symmetric.\n\n2.  **Reaction:** The dione is treated with *excess* NaBH₄ (Sodium Borohydride), followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols.\n\n3.  **Products' Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n    *   Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, any chiral products must be formed as a racemic mixture.\n    *   Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers: (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n        *   **(2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry (in a certain conformation) and is therefore a **meso compound**. (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) represent the same achiral molecule.\n        *   **(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S):** These two are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a **pair of enantiomers**. Since the reaction starts from an achiral precursor, they will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n    *   Therefore, Reaction II produces a mixture of **three distinct stereoisomers**: one meso compound and a pair of enantiomers.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC is an achiral technique. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore **cannot be separated**. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and **can be separated**.\n    *   **Constitutional isomers** have different connectivity and will be separated.\n\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:**\n    1.  **Products from Reaction I:** (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These are diastereomers, so they have different polarities and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    2.  **Products from Reaction II:** The meso-pentane-2,4-diol and the enantiomeric pair of pentane-2,4-diols. The meso compound is a diastereomer of each of the enantiomers. Thus, the meso compound will be separated from the enantiomeric pair. The two enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) will not separate from each other and will form a single peak. This gives **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, one for the racemic pair).\n    3.  **Comparing Products from I and II:** The products of Reaction I are 5-methoxyhexan-3-ols (C₇H₁₆O₂), while the products of Reaction II are pentane-2,4-diols (C₅H₁₂O₂). These are constitutional isomers with different molecular formulas, sizes, and functional groups. They will have significantly different polarities and will be easily separated from each other.\n\n*   **Total Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:** Adding the peaks from each separable group: 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP). This chiral environment allows for the separation of stereoisomers that have different three-dimensional shapes.\n    *   It separates **enantiomers**.\n    *   It also separates **diastereomers**.\n    *   Assuming an ideal chiral column with sufficient resolving power, all stereochemically unique compounds will be separated.\n\n*   **Analysis of the mixture:**\n    *   The final mixture contains 5 unique stereoisomers:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        3.  meso-(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        4.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        5.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Since all five of these compounds are stereochemically distinct (either constitutional isomers, diastereomers, or enantiomers), they will all interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.\n\n*   **Total Peaks in Chiral HPLC:** Each of the 5 stereoisomers will be resolved into a separate peak. Therefore, we will observe **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show **5 peaks**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
