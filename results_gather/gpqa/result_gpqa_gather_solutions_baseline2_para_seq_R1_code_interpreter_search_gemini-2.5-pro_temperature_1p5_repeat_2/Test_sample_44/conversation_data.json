Single-Particle Energy Levels\n\nFor a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L, the energy levels are quantized. The energy of the *n*-th level is given by:\n$E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\nwhere *n* is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n\nThe problem defines the base energy unit as $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. Therefore, the energy of the *n*-th level can be expressed as:\n$E_n = n^2 E$\n\nSo, the first few single-particle energy levels are:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n*   and so on.\n\n### 2. Pauli Exclusion Principle\n\nThe particles are spin-1/2 particles, which means they are fermions. According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. For this system, a quantum state is defined by the pair of quantum numbers: the principal quantum number *n* and the spin projection quantum number *m_s* (which can be +1/2 for spin-up or -1/2 for spin-down).\n\nThis implies that each energy level *n* can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n### 3. Calculating the System Energies\n\nThe total energy of the four-particle system is the sum of the energies of the individual particles. We need to find the three lowest possible total energies by distributing the four particles among the available single-particle states.\n\n#### Ground State (Lowest Energy)\n\nTo find the ground state energy, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up:\n*   We place the first two particles in the lowest energy level, **n=1** (one spin-up, one spin-down). Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times (1E) = 2E$.\n*   We place the next two particles in the second lowest energy level, **n=2** (one spin-up, one spin-down). Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times (4E) = 8E$.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n$E_{ground} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E$\n\n#### First Excited State (Next Lowest Energy)\n\nTo find the first excited state, we create the lowest-energy excitation from the ground state. This is done by moving one particle from the highest occupied level to the lowest unoccupied level.\n*   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is n=2, and the lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n*   We move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n$E_{first} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3)$\n$E_{first} = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$\n\n#### Second Excited State (Third Lowest Energy)\n\nTo find the second excited state, we need to find the configuration with the next lowest energy. We can consider other possible excitations from the ground state:\n*   **Possibility 1 (First Excited State):** Move one particle from n=2 to n=3. Energy = 15E.\n*   **Possibility 2:** Move one particle from n=1 to n=3. The configuration becomes: one particle in n=1, two particles in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n    *   Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n*   **Possibility 3:** Move one particle from n=2 to n=4. The configuration becomes: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=4.\n    *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n\nComparing the energies of the excited states we have found so far (15E, 18E, 22E, ...), the lowest energy is 15E (the first excited state), and the next lowest is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the second excited state is 18E.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states of the system are:\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n**1. System and Energy Levels**\n\n*   **System:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Since they are identical fermions, they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n*   **Potential Well:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n*   **Single-Particle Energy:** The energy for a single particle in such a well is given by the formula:\n    $E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$ , where n = 1, 2, 3, ... is the principal quantum number.\n*   **Energy Unit:** The problem defines a base energy unit $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\n    Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as $E_n = n^2 E$.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** For spin-1/2 particles, the spin quantum number can be $m_s = +1/2$ (spin-up) or $m_s = -1/2$ (spin-down). The Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state (defined by both n and $m_s$). This means that for each energy level 'n', we can place at most two particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n**2. Ground State Energy Calculation**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **Level n=1 (Energy $E_1 = 1^2E = E$):** We can place two particles in this level (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n*   **Level n=2 (Energy $E_2 = 2^2E = 4E$):** We have two remaining particles, which we place in the next lowest level (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n\nThe total energy of the ground state ($E_{gs}$) is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n$E_{gs} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2)$\n$E_{gs} = (2 \\times E) + (2 \\times 4E)$\n$E_{gs} = 2E + 8E = 10E$\n\n**3. First Excited State Energy Calculation**\n\nThe first excited state is created by the lowest possible energy excitation from the ground state. This involves moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n*   **Ground State Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=2.\n*   **Excitation:** Move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level (Energy $E_3 = 3^2E = 9E$).\n*   **First Excited State Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, one particle in n=3.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state ($E_{1st}$) is:\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3)$\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E)$\n$E_{1st} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$\n\n**4. Second Excited State Energy Calculation**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We must consider all possible excitations from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy.\n\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E (from excitation n=2 → n=3).\n*   Let's consider other possible single-particle and multi-particle excitations from the ground state:\n    *   **Possibility A: Excite one particle from n=1 to n=3.**\n        *   Configuration: One particle in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3.\n        *   Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n    *   **Possibility B: Excite two particles from n=2 to n=3.**\n        *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3.\n        *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times E) + (2 \\times 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n    *   **Possibility C: Excite one particle from n=2 to n=4.**\n        *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4.\n        *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = (2 \\times E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n\nThe possible excited state energies are 15E, 18E, 20E, 22E, etc.\n*   The lowest energy is the first excited state: 15E.\n*   The next lowest energy is the second excited state: 18E.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: 10E\n*   First Excited State: 15E\n*   Second Excited State: 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the System\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin are called fermions.\n*   **Identical Fermions and the Pauli Exclusion Principle:** According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n*   **Quantum States:** For a particle in a 1D potential well, a quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (which can be `+1/2` for spin-up or `-1/2` for spin-down).\n*   **Energy Levels:** The energy for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L is given by:\n    `E_n = n^2 * (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)`\n    The problem defines the base energy unit as `E = (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)`.\n    So, the single-particle energy levels are `E_n = n^2 * E`, where `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`.\n*   **State Occupancy:** Because of the two possible spin states (up and down), each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of two particles (one with spin up and one with spin down) without violating the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Ground State Energy (E_ground)\n\nThe ground state is the state with the lowest possible total energy. To achieve this, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up with the four fermions.\n\n1.  **Level n=1:** We place the first two particles in the lowest energy level, `n=1`. One will be spin-up, the other spin-down.\n    *   Energy of these two particles = `2 * E_1 = 2 * (1^2 * E) = 2E`.\n2.  **Level n=2:** We place the remaining two particles in the next available energy level, `n=2`.\n    *   Energy of these two particles = `2 * E_2 = 2 * (2^2 * E) = 2 * 4E = 8E`.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n`E_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)\n\nThe first excited state is the state with the lowest energy above the ground state. We can find this by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n*   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is `n=2` and the lowest unoccupied level is `n=3`.\n*   We move one particle from the `n=2` level to the `n=3` level.\n*   The new configuration of particles is:\n    *   2 particles in `n=1` (Energy: `2 * E_1 = 2E`)\n    *   1 particle in `n=2` (Energy: `1 * E_2 = 4E`)\n    *   1 particle in `n=3` (Energy: `1 * E_3 = 1 * (3^2 * E) = 9E`)\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n`E_1st = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)\n\nThe second excited state is the state with the next lowest energy after the first excited state. We need to consider different possible excitations from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy.\n\nLet's list the energies of a few possible low-energy configurations:\n\n*   **Ground State:** {2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2} -> Energy = `(2*1 + 2*4)E = 10E`.\n*   **First Excited State:** {2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3} -> Energy = `(2*1 + 1*4 + 1*9)E = 15E`.\n*   **Other Excitations:**\n    *   **Possibility A:** Excite one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`.

The configuration becomes {2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=3}.\n        *   Energy = `(2 * E_1) + (2 * E_3) = (2*1 + 2*9)E = (2 + 18)E = 20E`.\n    *   **Possibility C:** Excite one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`. The configuration becomes {2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4}.\n        *   Energy = `(2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_4) = (2*1 + 1*4 + 1*16)E = (2 + 4 + 16)E = 22E`.\n\nComparing the energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E...), the second lowest energy after the ground state is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the second excited state is `E_2nd = 18E`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis problem requires us to determine the total energy of a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a 1D infinite potential well for its three lowest energy states.\n\n**1. Understand the System and Principles**\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin are fermions.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state for a particle in this well is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (which can be spin-up, +1/2, or spin-down, -1/2).\n*   **Implication:** Because there are two possible spin states for each energy level `n`, each level can hold a maximum of two particles (one spin-up and one spin-down).\n\n**2. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nThe energy for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well of length L is given by:\nE_n = (n^2 * π^2 * ħ^2) / (2 * m * L^2)\nwhere `n` is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n\nThe problem defines a base energy unit E = (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2mL^2). So, we can express the single-particle energy levels in terms of E:\nE_n = n^2 * E\n\nLet's list the first few energy levels:\n*   n = 1: E_1 = 1^2 * E = 1E\n*   n = 2: E_2 = 2^2 * E = 4E\n*   n = 3: E_3 = 3^2 * E = 9E\n*   n = 4: E_4 = 4^2 * E = 16E\n\n**3. Calculating the Total Energies**\n\nWe need to place the four fermions into these energy levels to find the total energy for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state.\n\n**A. Ground State Energy (E_ground)**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest possible energy levels first.\n*   Place two particles in the `n=1` level. Their combined energy is 2 * E_1 = 2 * (1E) = 2E.\n*   Place the remaining two particles in the next lowest level, `n=2`.

First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. We achieve this by promoting one particle from the highest occupied level in the ground state (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n*   The total energy for this configuration is:\n    E_1st = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_3)\n    E_1st = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E)\n    E_1st = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\n**C. Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We need to consider different possible excitations from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy increase.\nLet's list the possibilities and their energies:\n*   **First Excited State (already found):** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=3. Energy = 15E.\n*   **Possibility 1:** Promote one particle from a lower level, `n=1`, to the lowest empty level, `n=3`.\n    *   Configuration: one particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, one in `n=3`.\n    *   Energy = (1 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = (1 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n*   **Possibility 2:** Promote both particles from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n    *   Configuration: two particles in `n=1`, two in `n=3`.\n    *   Energy = (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_3) = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n*   **Possibility 3:** Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`.\n    *   Configuration: two particles in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, one in `n=4`.\n    *   Energy = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_4) = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n\nComparing the energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E,...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state), and the next lowest is 18E.

Since they are identical and have half-integer spin, they are **fermions**.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This means no two particles can occupy the exact same quantum state. In this system, a quantum state is defined by the energy level `n` and the spin projection `m_s` (spin-up or spin-down). Consequently, each energy level `n` can hold at most two particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n*   **Potential Well:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The single-particle energy eigenvalues are given by:\n    $E_n = \\frac{n^2 h^2}{8mL^2}$, where `n` is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n*   **Energy Unit E:** The problem defines a unit of energy $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. We need to relate this to the standard energy formula.\n    Using $\\hbar = \\frac{h}{2\\pi}$, we get $\\hbar^2 = \\frac{h^2}{4\\pi^2}$.\n    Substituting this into the definition of E:\n    $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 (\\frac{h^2}{4\\pi^2})}{2mL^2} = \\frac{h^2/4}{2mL^2} = \\frac{h^2}{8mL^2}$.\n    This is exactly the energy of the n=1 state. So, the single-particle energy levels can be conveniently written as:\n    $E_n = n^2 E$.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_gs)\n\nThe ground state is the state with the lowest possible total energy. To achieve this, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **n = 1 level:** Can hold two particles. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times (1^2 E) = 2E$.\n*   **n = 2 level:** We still need to place two more particles. They go into the next lowest level, n=2. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times (2^2 E) = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n\nAll four particles are now placed. The total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all particles:\n$E_{gs} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E$.\n\n### 3. Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the next lowest total energy. We can find this by promoting one particle from the ground state configuration to the next available energy level, requiring the minimum amount of energy.\n\n*   **Ground state configuration:** Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=2.\n*   **Lowest energy excitation:** Promote one particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied level (n=3).\n*   **New configuration:**\n    *   **n = 1 level:** Two particles. Energy = $2 \\times E_1 = 2E$.\n    *   **n = 2 level:** One particle. Energy = $1 \\times E_2 = 1 \\times (2^2 E) = 4E$.\n    *   **n = 3 level:** One particle. Energy = $1 \\times E_3 = 1 \\times (3^2 E) = 9E$.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n$E_{1st} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)\n\nThe second excited state has the third-lowest total energy. We need to find the next possible excitation from the ground state that has the lowest energy after the first excited state. Let's consider the possibilities:\n\n*   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4.\n    *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = 2E + 4E + (4^2 E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n\n*   **Possibility B:** Promote two particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=3.\n    *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = 2E + 2 \\times (3^2 E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n\n*   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3.\n    *   Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = 1E + 2 \\times (2^2 E) + 9E = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n\nComparing the energies of these excited states (22E, 20E, 18E) with the first excited state (15E), the next lowest energy is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the second excited state is:\n$E_{2nd} = 18E$.\n\n### 5.

Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\n*   First, let's recall the energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well. The energy for a given quantum number *n* (where n = 1, 2, 3, ...) is:\n    E_n = (n^2 * π^2 * ħ^2) / (2mL^2)\n*   The problem defines a base energy unit E = (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2mL^2).\n*   So, we can express the single-particle energy levels in terms of E:\n    E_n = n^2 * E\n*   The first few energy levels are:\n    *   E_1 = 1^2 * E = 1E\n    *   E_2 = 2^2 * E = 4E\n    *   E_3 = 3^2 * E = 9E\n    *   E_4 = 4^2 * E = 16E\n    *   ...and so on.\n\n**3. Applying the Pauli Exclusion Principle**\n\n*   A quantum state for a particle in this well is defined by its energy level (*n*) and its spin state (spin up, m_s = +1/2, or spin down, m_s = -1/2).\n*   The Pauli Exclusion Principle means that each energy level *n* can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n**4. Calculating the Ground State Energy (E_ground)**\n\n*   To find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles.\n*   **Level n=1 (Energy E_1 = 1E):** We can place two particles here (one spin up, one spin down).\n*   **Level n=2 (Energy E_2 = 4E):** We have two particles left, so we place them in the next lowest level (one spin up, one spin down).\n*   **Total Ground State Energy:**\n    E_ground = (2 particles * E_1) + (2 particles * E_2)\n    E_ground = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E\n\n**5. Calculating the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n\n*   To get the first excited state, we must move one particle from the ground state configuration to the next available higher energy level. This corresponds to the lowest possible energy increase.\n*   **Ground State Configuration:** 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2.\n*   **Excitation:** The smallest energy jump is to promote one particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied level (n=3).\n*   **First Excited State Configuration:**\n    *   Level n=1: 2 particles\n    *   Level n=2: 1 particle\n    *   Level n=3: 1 particle\n*   **Total First Excited State Energy:**\n    E_1st = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_3)\n    E_1st = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E\n\n**6. Calculating the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\n\n*   The second excited state is the state with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We must consider all possible single-particle promotions from the ground state and find the one with the second-smallest energy increase.\n*   **From Ground State (Total Energy = 10E):**\n    *   **Promotion 1 (First Excitation):** Move a particle from n=2 to n=3.\n        *   Energy Increase: E_3 - E_2 = 9E - 4E = 5E.\n        *   Total Energy: 10E + 5E = 15E.\n    *   **Promotion 2 (Second Excitation):** Move a particle from n=1 to n=3.\n        *   Energy Increase: E_3 - E_1 = 9E - 1E = 8E.\n        *   Total Energy: 10E + 8E = 18E.\n    *   **Other promotions** would have higher energy costs (e.g., n=2 to n=4 has an increase of E_4 - E_2 = 16E - 4E = 12E).\n*   The lowest energy excitation gives the first excited state (15E). The second-lowest energy excitation gives the second excited state (18E).\n*   **Second Excited State Configuration:**\n    *   Level n=1: 1 particle\n    *   Level n=2: 2 particles\n    *   Level n=3: 1 particle\n*   **Total Second Excited State Energy:**\n    E_2nd = (1 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) + (1 * E_3)\n    E_2nd = (1 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E\n\n**Summary of Energies:**\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis sequence matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis problem requires understanding the behavior of fermions in a quantum system, specifically within a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n### **1.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Principles of the System**\n\n*   **Particles:** The system contains four identical spin-1/2 particles. This means they are **fermions**.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** As fermions, they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state.\n*   **Quantum States:** For a particle in a 1D potential well, a quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal energy quantum number `n` (n = 1, 2, 3, ...) and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (+1/2 for spin-up, -1/2 for spin-down).\n*   **Energy Levels:** The energy of a single particle in the well is given by `E_n = n^2 * E`, where `E` is the base energy unit `pi^2 * hbar^2 / (2mL^2)`.\n*   **Occupancy:** Because of the two possible spin states for each energy level `n`, a maximum of two particles can occupy that level (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n\n### **2. Calculation of the Ground State Energy (E_ground)**\n\nThe ground state is the configuration with the minimum possible total energy. To find this, we fill the energy levels from the lowest energy upwards.\n\n*   **n = 1 level (Energy = 1²E = E):** We place the first two particles here. Their combined energy is `2 * E = 2E`.\n*   **n = 2 level (Energy = 2²E = 4E):** We place the remaining two particles here. Their combined energy is `2 * 4E = 8E`.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of these energies:\n`E_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n\n### **3. Calculation of the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the next-lowest energy. This is found by promoting one particle from the highest occupied level in the ground state to the lowest unoccupied level.\n\n*   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is `n=2` and the lowest unoccupied level is `n=3`.\n*   We move one particle from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n*   The total energy for this state is:\n    `E_1st = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n### **4. Calculation of the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\n\nThe second excited state is the state with the next-lowest energy. We must consider other possible low-energy excitations from the ground state.\n\n*   **Possibility A (First Excited State):** Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=3`. Total Energy = 15E.\n*   **Possibility B:** Promote one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`. The new configuration would be: one particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, and one in `n=3`.\n    *   Total Energy = `(1 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = (1 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n*   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`. Total Energy = `(2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_4) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`.\n*   **Possibility D:** Promote both particles from `n=2` to `n=3`. Total Energy = `(2 * E_1) + (2 * E_3) = 2E + 18E = 20E`.\n\nComparing the possible total energies for the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E, ...), the lowest is 15E, and the second-lowest is 18E.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis sequence matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"

Single-Particle Energy Levels\n\nFor a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L, the energy levels are quantized. The energy of the *n*-th level is given by:\n$E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\nwhere *n* is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n\nThe problem defines the base energy unit as $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. Therefore, the energy of the *n*-th level can be expressed as:\n$E_n = n^2 E$\n\nSo, the first few single-particle energy levels are:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n*   and so on.\n\n### 2. Pauli Exclusion Principle\n\nThe particles are spin-1/2 particles, which means they are fermions. According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. For this system, a quantum state is defined by the pair of quantum numbers: the principal quantum number *n* and the spin projection quantum number *m_s* (which can be +1/2 for spin-up or -1/2 for spin-down).\n\nThis implies that each energy level *n* can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n### 3. Calculating the System Energies\n\nThe total energy of the four-particle system is the sum of the energies of the individual particles. We need to find the three lowest possible total energies by distributing the four particles among the available single-particle states.\n\n#### Ground State (Lowest Energy)\n\nTo find the ground state energy, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up:\n*   We place the first two particles in the lowest energy level, **n=1** (one spin-up, one spin-down). Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times (1E) = 2E$.\n*   We place the next two particles in the second lowest energy level, **n=2** (one spin-up, one spin-down). Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times (4E) = 8E$.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n$E_{ground} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E$\n\n#### First Excited State (Next Lowest Energy)\n\nTo find the first excited state, we create the lowest-energy excitation from the ground state. This is done by moving one particle from the highest occupied level to the lowest unoccupied level.\n*   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is n=2, and the lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n*   We move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n$E_{first} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3)$\n$E_{first} = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$\n\n#### Second Excited State (Third Lowest Energy)\n\nTo find the second excited state, we need to find the configuration with the next lowest energy. We can consider other possible excitations from the ground state:\n*   **Possibility 1 (First Excited State):** Move one particle from n=2 to n=3. Energy = 15E.\n*   **Possibility 2:** Move one particle from n=1 to n=3. The configuration becomes: one particle in n=1, two particles in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n    *   Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n*   **Possibility 3:** Move one particle from n=2 to n=4. The configuration becomes: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=4.\n    *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n\nComparing the energies of the excited states we have found so far (15E, 18E, 22E, ...), the lowest energy is 15E (the first excited state), and the next lowest is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the second excited state is 18E.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states of the system are:\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n**1. System and Energy Levels**\n\n*   **System:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Since they are identical fermions, they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n*   **Potential Well:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n*   **Single-Particle Energy:** The energy for a single particle in such a well is given by the formula:\n    $E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$ , where n = 1, 2, 3, ... is the principal quantum number.\n*   **Energy Unit:** The problem defines a base energy unit $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\n    Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as $E_n = n^2 E$.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** For spin-1/2 particles, the spin quantum number can be $m_s = +1/2$ (spin-up) or $m_s = -1/2$ (spin-down). The Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state (defined by both n and $m_s$). This means that for each energy level 'n', we can place at most two particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n**2. Ground State Energy Calculation**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **Level n=1 (Energy $E_1 = 1^2E = E$):** We can place two particles in this level (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n*   **Level n=2 (Energy $E_2 = 2^2E = 4E$):** We have two remaining particles, which we place in the next lowest level (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n\nThe total energy of the ground state ($E_{gs}$) is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n$E_{gs} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2)$\n$E_{gs} = (2 \\times E) + (2 \\times 4E)$\n$E_{gs} = 2E + 8E = 10E$\n\n**3. First Excited State Energy Calculation**\n\nThe first excited state is created by the lowest possible energy excitation from the ground state. This involves moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n*   **Ground State Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=2.\n*   **Excitation:** Move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level (Energy $E_3 = 3^2E = 9E$).\n*   **First Excited State Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, one particle in n=3.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state ($E_{1st}$) is:\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3)$\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E)$\n$E_{1st} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$\n\n**4. Second Excited State Energy Calculation**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We must consider all possible excitations from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy.\n\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E (from excitation n=2 → n=3).\n*   Let's consider other possible single-particle and multi-particle excitations from the ground state:\n    *   **Possibility A: Excite one particle from n=1 to n=3.**\n        *   Configuration: One particle in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3.\n        *   Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n    *   **Possibility B: Excite two particles from n=2 to n=3.**\n        *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3.\n        *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times E) + (2 \\times 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n    *   **Possibility C: Excite one particle from n=2 to n=4.**\n        *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4.\n        *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = (2 \\times E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n\nThe possible excited state energies are 15E, 18E, 20E, 22E, etc.\n*   The lowest energy is the first excited state: 15E.\n*   The next lowest energy is the second excited state: 18E.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: 10E\n*   First Excited State: 15E\n*   Second Excited State: 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the System\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin are called fermions.\n*   **Identical Fermions and the Pauli Exclusion Principle:** According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n*   **Quantum States:** For a particle in a 1D potential well, a quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (which can be `+1/2` for spin-up or `-1/2` for spin-down).\n*   **Energy Levels:** The energy for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L is given by:\n    `E_n = n^2 * (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)`\n    The problem defines the base energy unit as `E = (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)`.\n    So, the single-particle energy levels are `E_n = n^2 * E`, where `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`.\n*   **State Occupancy:** Because of the two possible spin states (up and down), each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of two particles (one with spin up and one with spin down) without violating the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Ground State Energy (E_ground)\n\nThe ground state is the state with the lowest possible total energy. To achieve this, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up with the four fermions.\n\n1.  **Level n=1:** We place the first two particles in the lowest energy level, `n=1`. One will be spin-up, the other spin-down.\n    *   Energy of these two particles = `2 * E_1 = 2 * (1^2 * E) = 2E`.\n2.  **Level n=2:** We place the remaining two particles in the next available energy level, `n=2`.\n    *   Energy of these two particles = `2 * E_2 = 2 * (2^2 * E) = 2 * 4E = 8E`.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n`E_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)\n\nThe first excited state is the state with the lowest energy above the ground state. We can find this by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n*   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is `n=2` and the lowest unoccupied level is `n=3`.\n*   We move one particle from the `n=2` level to the `n=3` level.\n*   The new configuration of particles is:\n    *   2 particles in `n=1` (Energy: `2 * E_1 = 2E`)\n    *   1 particle in `n=2` (Energy: `1 * E_2 = 4E`)\n    *   1 particle in `n=3` (Energy: `1 * E_3 = 1 * (3^2 * E) = 9E`)\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n`E_1st = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)\n\nThe second excited state is the state with the next lowest energy after the first excited state. We need to consider different possible excitations from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy.\n\nLet's list the energies of a few possible low-energy configurations:\n\n*   **Ground State:** {2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2} -> Energy = `(2*1 + 2*4)E = 10E`.\n*   **First Excited State:** {2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3} -> Energy = `(2*1 + 1*4 + 1*9)E = 15E`.\n*   **Other Excitations:**\n    *   **Possibility A:** Excite one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`.

The configuration becomes {2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=3}.\n        *   Energy = `(2 * E_1) + (2 * E_3) = (2*1 + 2*9)E = (2 + 18)E = 20E`.\n    *   **Possibility C:** Excite one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`. The configuration becomes {2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4}.\n        *   Energy = `(2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_4) = (2*1 + 1*4 + 1*16)E = (2 + 4 + 16)E = 22E`.\n\nComparing the energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E...), the second lowest energy after the ground state is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the second excited state is `E_2nd = 18E`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThis problem requires us to determine the total energy of a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a 1D infinite potential well for its three lowest energy states.\n\n**1. Understand the System and Principles**\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin are fermions.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state for a particle in this well is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level) and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (which can be spin-up, +1/2, or spin-down, -1/2).\n*   **Implication:** Because there are two possible spin states for each energy level `n`, each level can hold a maximum of two particles (one spin-up and one spin-down).\n\n**2. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nThe energy for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well of length L is given by:\nE_n = (n^2 * π^2 * ħ^2) / (2 * m * L^2)\nwhere `n` is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n\nThe problem defines a base energy unit E = (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2mL^2).

Calculating the Total Energies**\n\nWe need to place the four fermions into these energy levels to find the total energy for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state.\n\n**A. Ground State Energy (E_ground)**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest possible energy levels first.\n*   Place two particles in the `n=1` level.

First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. We achieve this by promoting one particle from the highest occupied level in the ground state (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.\n*   The total energy for this configuration is:\n    E_1st = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_3)\n    E_1st = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E)\n    E_1st = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\n**C.

We need to consider different possible excitations from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy increase.\nLet's list the possibilities and their energies:\n*   **First Excited State (already found):** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=3. Energy = 15E.\n*   **Possibility 1:** Promote one particle from a lower level, `n=1`, to the lowest empty level, `n=3`.\n    *   Configuration: one particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, one in `n=3`.\n    *   Energy = (1 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = (1 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n*   **Possibility 2:** Promote both particles from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n    *   Configuration: two particles in `n=1`, two in `n=3`.\n    *   Energy = (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_3) = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n*   **Possibility 3:** Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`.\n    *   Configuration: two particles in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, one in `n=4`.\n    *   Energy = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_4) = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n\nComparing the energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E,...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state), and the next lowest is 18E. Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is 18E.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Ground State Energy = 10E\n*   First Excited State Energy = 15E\n*   Second Excited State Energy = 18E\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe problem asks for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics**\n\n*   **Particles:** The particles are spin-1/2, which means they are fermions.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Identical fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state here is defined by both the energy level (principal quantum number `n`) and the spin projection (`m_s`, which can be spin up or spin down).\n*   **Energy Levels:** The energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well of length L are given by:\n    $E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\n    where n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n*   **Energy Unit:** The problem defines a base energy unit $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. So, the single-particle energy levels are $E_n = n^2 E$.\n*   **State Occupancy:** Because of spin, each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n**2. Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_GS)**\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles, following the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **Level n=1:** Can hold 2 particles. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times (1^2)E = 2E$.\n*   **Level n=2:** We place the remaining 2 particles here. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times (2^2)E = 8E$.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n$E_{GS} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E$\n\n**3. Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (n=3).\n\n*   The ground state configuration is (2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2).\n*   The first excited state configuration is (2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3).\n\nThe total energy for this configuration is:\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3)$\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times 1^2 E) + (1 \\times 2^2 E) + (1 \\times 3^2 E)$\n$E_{1st} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$\n\n**4. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We must consider the next possible low-energy excitation from the ground state.\n\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State Energy:** 15E (by promoting one particle from n=2 to n=3)\n\nLet's consider the next lowest-energy promotion. We can promote a particle from a lower level (n=1) or promote a particle to a higher level (n=4).\n\n*   **Option A: Promote from n=1 to n=3.**\n    *   Configuration: (1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, 1 particle in n=3).\n    *   Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times 1^2 E) + (2 \\times 2^2 E) + (1 \\times 3^2 E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n\n*   **Option B: Promote from n=2 to n=4.**\n    *   Configuration: (2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=4).\n    *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = (2 \\times 1^2 E) + (1 \\times 2^2 E) + (1 \\times 4^2 E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n\nComparing the energies of these possible excited states, the lowest is 15E (the first excited state), and the next lowest is 18E. Therefore, the second excited state has an energy of 18E.\n\n**Summary of Energies:**\n*   Ground State: 10E\n*   First Excited State: 15E\n*   Second Excited State: 18E\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the System and Energy Levels\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Since they are identical and have half-integer spin, they are **fermions**.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This means no two particles can occupy the exact same quantum state. In this system, a quantum state is defined by the energy level `n` and the spin projection `m_s` (spin-up or spin-down). Consequently, each energy level `n` can hold at most two particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n*   **Potential Well:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The single-particle energy eigenvalues are given by:\n    $E_n = \\frac{n^2 h^2}{8mL^2}$, where `n` is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n*   **Energy Unit E:** The problem defines a unit of energy $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. We need to relate this to the standard energy formula.\n    Using $\\hbar = \\frac{h}{2\\pi}$, we get $\\hbar^2 = \\frac{h^2}{4\\pi^2}$.\n    Substituting this into the definition of E:\n    $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 (\\frac{h^2}{4\\pi^2})}{2mL^2} = \\frac{h^2/4}{2mL^2} = \\frac{h^2}{8mL^2}$.\n    This is exactly the energy of the n=1 state. So, the single-particle energy levels can be conveniently written as:\n    $E_n = n^2 E$.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_gs)\n\nThe ground state is the state with the lowest possible total energy. To achieve this, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **n = 1 level:** Can hold two particles. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times (1^2 E) = 2E$.\n*   **n = 2 level:** We still need to place two more particles. They go into the next lowest level, n=2. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times (2^2 E) = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n\nAll four particles are now placed. The total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all particles:\n$E_{gs} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E$.\n\n### 3. Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the next lowest total energy. We can find this by promoting one particle from the ground state configuration to the next available energy level, requiring the minimum amount of energy.\n\n*   **Ground state configuration:** Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=2.\n*   **Lowest energy excitation:** Promote one particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied level (n=3).\n*   **New configuration:**\n    *   **n = 1 level:** Two particles. Energy = $2 \\times E_1 = 2E$.\n    *   **n = 2 level:** One particle. Energy = $1 \\times E_2 = 1 \\times (2^2 E) = 4E$.\n    *   **n = 3 level:** One particle. Energy = $1 \\times E_3 = 1 \\times (3^2 E) = 9E$.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n$E_{1st} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)\n\nThe second excited state has the third-lowest total energy. We need to find the next possible excitation from the ground state that has the lowest energy after the first excited state. Let's consider the possibilities:\n\n*   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4.\n    *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = 2E + 4E + (4^2 E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n\n*   **Possibility B:** Promote two particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=3.\n    *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = 2E + 2 \\times (3^2 E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n\n*   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3.\n    *   Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = 1E + 2 \\times (2^2 E) + 9E = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n\nComparing the energies of these excited states (22E, 20E, 18E) with the first excited state (15E), the next lowest energy is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the second excited state is:\n$E_{2nd} = 18E$.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: 10E\n*   First Excited State: 15E\n*   Second Excited State: 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the System**\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Since they have half-integer spin, they are fermions.\n*   **Potential Well:** They are confined in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n*   **Key Principle:** Because the particles are identical fermions, they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n\n**2. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\n*   First, let's recall the energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well. The energy for a given quantum number *n* (where n = 1, 2, 3, ...) is:\n    E_n = (n^2 * π^2 * ħ^2) / (2mL^2)\n*   The problem defines a base energy unit E = (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2mL^2).\n*   So, we can express the single-particle energy levels in terms of E:\n    E_n = n^2 * E\n*   The first few energy levels are:\n    *   E_1 = 1^2 * E = 1E\n    *   E_2 = 2^2 * E = 4E\n    *   E_3 = 3^2 * E = 9E\n    *   E_4 = 4^2 * E = 16E\n    *   ...and so on.\n\n**3. Applying the Pauli Exclusion Principle**\n\n*   A quantum state for a particle in this well is defined by its energy level (*n*) and its spin state (spin up, m_s = +1/2, or spin down, m_s = -1/2).\n*   The Pauli Exclusion Principle means that each energy level *n* can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n**4. Calculating the Ground State Energy (E_ground)**\n\n*   To find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles.\n*   **Level n=1 (Energy E_1 = 1E):** We can place two particles here (one spin up, one spin down).\n*   **Level n=2 (Energy E_2 = 4E):** We have two particles left, so we place them in the next lowest level (one spin up, one spin down).\n*   **Total Ground State Energy:**\n    E_ground = (2 particles * E_1) + (2 particles * E_2)\n    E_ground = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E\n\n**5. Calculating the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n\n*   To get the first excited state, we must move one particle from the ground state configuration to the next available higher energy level. This corresponds to the lowest possible energy increase.\n*   **Ground State Configuration:** 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2.\n*   **Excitation:** The smallest energy jump is to promote one particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied level (n=3).\n*   **First Excited State Configuration:**\n    *   Level n=1: 2 particles\n    *   Level n=2: 1 particle\n    *   Level n=3: 1 particle\n*   **Total First Excited State Energy:**\n    E_1st = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_3)\n    E_1st = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E\n\n**6. Calculating the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\n\n*   The second excited state is the state with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We must consider all possible single-particle promotions from the ground state and find the one with the second-smallest energy increase.\n*   **From Ground State (Total Energy = 10E):**\n    *   **Promotion 1 (First Excitation):** Move a particle from n=2 to n=3.\n        *   Energy Increase: E_3 - E_2 = 9E - 4E = 5E.\n        *   Total Energy: 10E + 5E = 15E.\n    *   **Promotion 2 (Second Excitation):** Move a particle from n=1 to n=3.\n        *   Energy Increase: E_3 - E_1 = 9E - 1E = 8E.\n        *   Total Energy: 10E + 8E = 18E.\n    *   **Other promotions** would have higher energy costs (e.g., n=2 to n=4 has an increase of E_4 - E_2 = 16E - 4E = 12E).\n*   The lowest energy excitation gives the first excited state (15E). The second-lowest energy excitation gives the second excited state (18E).\n*   **Second Excited State Configuration:**\n    *   Level n=1: 1 particle\n    *   Level n=2: 2 particles\n    *   Level n=3: 1 particle\n*   **Total Second Excited State Energy:**\n    E_2nd = (1 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) + (1 * E_3)\n    E_2nd = (1 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E\n\n**Summary of Energies:**\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis sequence matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis problem requires understanding the behavior of fermions in a quantum system, specifically within a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n### **1.

Understand the System and Principles**\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin are called fermions.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state is defined by its set of quantum numbers.\n*   **Quantum Numbers:** For a particle in a 1D infinite potential well, the quantum state is defined by two numbers:\n    1.  The principal quantum number `n` (n = 1, 2, 3, ...), which determines the energy level.\n    2.  The spin magnetic quantum number `m_s`, which can be +1/2 (spin up, ↑) or -1/2 (spin down, ↓).\n*   **Energy Levels:** The energy of a single particle in the `n`-th state of a 1D infinite potential well of length L is given by:\n    E_n = (n^2 * π^2 * ħ^2) / (2mL^2)\n    The problem provides a unit of energy E = (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2mL^2). So, the single-particle energy levels can be simplified to:\n    E_n = n^2 * E\n*   **State Capacity:** Because of the two possible spin states (up and down), each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles, one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n**2.

We place the remaining two particles here (one spin up, one spin down).\n    *   Energy contributed by these two particles = 2 * E₂ = 2 * (2² * E) = 2 * 4E = 8E.\n*   **Total Ground State Energy:**\n    E_ground = (Energy from n=1) + (Energy from n=2) = 2E + 8E = **10E**.\n\n    *Ground State Configuration: (n=1)²(n=2)²*\n\n**3. Calculation of the First Excited State Energy (E_1st_excited)**\n\nTo find the first excited state, we promote one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state to the lowest unoccupied energy level. This corresponds to the smallest possible increase in total energy.\n\n*   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is `n=2`, and the lowest unoccupied level is `n=3`.\n*   We move one particle from the `n=2` level to the `n=3` level.\n*   The new configuration is:\n    *   Two particles in `n=1`.

Being identical, they are indistinguishable. Particles with half-integer spin (like spin-1/2) are fermions.\n    *   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state here is defined by the energy level quantum number `n` and the spin quantum number `m_s`.\n    *   **Potential:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n    *   **Single-Particle Energy Levels:** The energy for a single particle in the n-th level of a 1D infinite well is given by `E_n = (n^2 * pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)`.\n    *   **Energy Unit:** The problem defines a base energy unit `E = (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2 * m * L^2)`. Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be simplified to `E_n = n^2 * E`, where `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`.\n    *   **State Degeneracy:** For each energy level `n`, there are two possible spin states: spin up (`m_s = +1/2`) and spin down (`m_s = -1/2`). This means each energy level `E_n` can hold a maximum of two fermions.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_g):**\n    To find the ground state, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle, until all four particles are placed.\n    *   **n = 1 (E_1 = 1^2 * E = 1E):** We can place two particles in this level (one spin up, one spin down). Total energy from this level = `2 * 1E = 2E`.\n    *   **n = 2 (E_2 = 2^2 * E = 4E):** We place the remaining two particles in this level (one spin up, one spin down). Total energy from this level = `2 * 4E = 8E`.\n    *   **Total Ground State Energy:** The total energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles.\n        `E_g = (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st):**\n    The first excited state is the lowest possible energy state above the ground state. It is achieved by making the smallest possible energy jump for one particle. This means promoting a particle from the highest occupied energy level (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (LUMO).\n    *   **Ground State Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=2. The HOMO is n=2, and the LUMO is n=3.\n    *   **Excitation:** We move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n    *   **First Excited State Configuration:**\n        *   Two particles in **n = 1** (Energy = `2 * E_1 = 2 * 1E = 2E`)\n        *   One particle in **n = 2** (Energy = `1 * E_2 = 1 * 4E = 4E`)\n        *   One particle in **n = 3** (Energy = `1 * E_3 = 1 * 3^2 * E = 9E`)\n    *   **Total First Excited State Energy:**\n        `E_1st = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd):**\n    The second excited state is the next lowest energy configuration. We need to consider all possible excitations from the ground state that result in a higher energy than the first excited state and find the minimum among them.\n    *   **Ground State:** [2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2]. Energy = 10E.\n    *   **First Excited State:** [2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3]. Energy = 15E.\n\n    Let's examine the next possible excitations:\n    *   **Possibility A:** Excite one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n        *   Configuration: [1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3]\n        *   Energy = `(1 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = (1 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n    *   **Possibility B:** Excite both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n        *   Configuration: [2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3]\n        *   Energy = `(2 * E_1) + (2 * E_3) = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E`.\n    *   **Possibility C:** Excite one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n        *   Configuration: [2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 0 in n=3, 1 in n=4]\n        *   Energy = `(2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_4) = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`.\n\n    Comparing the energies of these new excited states (18E, 20E, 22E), the lowest one is 18E. This is the energy of the second excited state.\n\n5.  **Final Summary:**\n    *   Ground State Energy = **10E**\n    *   First Excited State Energy = **15E**\n    *   Second Excited State Energy = **18E**\n\nThis sequence of energies matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
