We are given the following relationships for their rest masses:\n1.  One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's say m1 is the more massive one:\n    *   m1 = 2 * m2\n2.  The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M:\n    *   m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M\n\nWe can solve this system of equations to find the masses of the fragments in terms of M:\n*   Substitute (1) into (2): (2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M => 3 * m2 = 0.99 * M => **m2 = 0.33 * M**\n*   Now find m1: m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) => **m1 = 0.66 * M**\n\nNow, let's find the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n*   Rest energy of the more massive fragment (m1): E1_rest = m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = **198 GeV**\n*   Rest energy of the less massive fragment (m2): E2_rest = m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = **99 GeV**\n\nBy the principle of conservation of energy, the initial energy equals the total final energy (rest energies + kinetic energies of the fragments).\n*   E_initial = E_final = (m1*c^2 + T1) + (m2*c^2 + T2)\n*   The total kinetic energy (Q-value) released in the fission is:\n    *   Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)\n    *   Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = **3 GeV**\n\nThe initial nucleus was at rest, so the initial momentum was zero. By conservation of momentum, the final total momentum must also be zero. This means the two fragments move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n*   |p1| = |p2| = p\n\n**Case 1: Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation for T1**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = p^2 / (2m).\n*   T1_classical = p^2 / (2 * m1)\n*   T2_classical = p^2 / (2 * m2)\nThe ratio of the kinetic energies is inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses:\n*   T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = (0.33 M) / (0.66 M) = 1/2\n*   So, T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical\nNow, we use the total kinetic energy:\n*   T1_classical + T2_classical = Q = 3 GeV\n*   T1_classical + (2 * T1_classical) = 3 GeV\n*   3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV\n*   **T1_classical = 1 GeV**\n\n**Case 2: Correct (Relativistic) Calculation for T1**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the relationship between energy, momentum, and mass is E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2. This can be rearranged to find the momentum: (p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2.\nSince the momenta are equal, (p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2.\n*   E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2\nWe also know from energy conservation that E1 + E2 = E_initial = 300 GeV. So, E2 = 300 - E1.\n*   E1^2 - (198)^2 = (300 - E1)^2 - (99)^2\n*   E1^2 - 39204 = (90000 - 600*E1 + E1^2) - 9801\nCancel the E1^2 terms:\n*   -39204 = 90000 - 600*E1 - 9801\n*   -39204 = 80199 - 600*E1\n*   600*E1 = 80199 + 39204\n*   600*E1 = 119403\n*   E1 = 119403 / 600 = 199.005 GeV\nThe kinetic energy T1 is the total energy E1 minus the rest energy m1*c^2:\n*   T1_relativistic = E1 - m1*c^2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = **1.005 GeV**\n\n**Final Step: Calculate the Difference**\n\nThe difference between the relativistic and classical values for T1 is:\n*   Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\n*   Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV\n\nThe question asks for the answer in MeV.

Thus, $(p_1c)^2 = (p_2c)^2$.\n$(p_1c)^2 = E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2$\n$(p_2c)^2 = E_2^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$\nSo, $E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2 = E_2^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$.\n\nFrom conservation of total energy, the sum of the total energies of the fragments must equal the rest energy of the initial nucleus:\n$E_1 + E_2 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nRearranging the momentum equation:\n$E_1^2 - E_2^2 = (m_1c^2)^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$\n$(E_1 - E_2)(E_1 + E_2) = (198 \\text{ GeV})^2 - (99 \\text{ GeV})^2$\n$(E_1 - E_2)(300 \\text{ GeV}) = 39204 - 9801 \\text{ GeV}^2 = 29403 \\text{ GeV}^2$\n$E_1 - E_2 = \\frac{29403}{300} \\text{ GeV} = 98.01 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nNow we solve the system of equations:\n1) $E_1 + E_2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$\n2) $E_1 - E_2 = 98.01 \\text{ GeV}$\nAdding the two equations:\n$2E_1 = 398.01 \\text{ GeV} \\implies E_1 = 199.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nThe kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, $T_1$, is its total energy minus its rest energy:\n$T_{1, \\text{correct}} = E_1 - m_1c^2 = 199.005 \\text{ GeV} - 198 \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n$T_{1, \\text{correct}} = 1005 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**Calculate the Difference**\n\nDifference = $T_{1, \\text{correct}} - T_{1, \\text{classical}}$\nDifference = $1005 \\text{ MeV} - 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nAn atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, so its initial total energy is its rest-mass energy `E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV` and its initial momentum is `p_initial = 0`.\n\nThe nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\nWe are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other.

So `E_tot = T + E_rest`.\nSubstituting this into the energy-momentum relation:\n`(T + E_rest)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (E_rest)^2`\n`T^2 + 2*T*E_rest + (E_rest)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (E_rest)^2`\n`(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*E_rest`\n\nAgain, from conservation of momentum, `|p1| = |p2|`, which means `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*E1 = T2^2 + 2*T2*E2`\nWe know `E1 = 198 GeV`, `E2 = 99 GeV`, and `T2 = T_total - T1 = 3 GeV - T1`.\nLet's substitute these values (energies are in GeV):\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n`396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n`396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n`396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n\n**Calculate the Difference:**\n\nThe difference is between the correct relativistic value (`T1`) and the classical approximation (`T1_classical`).\n`Difference = T1 - T1_classical`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nThe question asks for the answer in MeV.\n`1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nAn atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, so its initial total energy is its rest-mass energy, `E_initial = Mc^2 = 300 GeV`, and its initial momentum is `p_initial = 0`.\n\nThe nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\nWe are given the following relationships:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2` (one fragment is twice as massive as the other)\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M` (the sum of fragment rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass)\n\nFirst, let's find the rest masses of the fragments in terms of `M`.\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3*m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow, find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, let's calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (m1): `E1_rest = m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (Mc^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (m2): `E2_rest = m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (Mc^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\nThe energy released in the fission (Q-value) is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n`Q = E_initial - E_final_rest = Mc^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\nThis total kinetic energy is shared by the two fragments: `T1 + T2 = Q = 3 GeV`.\n\n**Correct (Relativistic) Calculation of T1**\n\nBy conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the fragments must fly apart with equal and opposite momenta.\n`|p1| = |p2| = p`\n\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass energy (E_rest) is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (E_rest)^2`.\nSince total energy is `E = T + E_rest`, we can write `(p*c)^2 = (T + E_rest)^2 - (E_rest)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*E_rest`.\n\nSince `|p1| = |p2|`, we have `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.

Calculation of Fragment Rest-Mass Energies**\n\nWe can calculate the rest-mass energies of the fragments (`m1*c^2` and `m2*c^2`):\n*   Sum of final rest-mass energies: `(m1 + m2) * c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   We have a system of two equations:\n    1.  `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`\n    2.  `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n*   Substituting (1) into (2):\n    ` (2 * m2*c^2) + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV `\n    ` 3 * m2*c^2 = 297 GeV `\n    ` m2*c^2 = 99 GeV `\n*   Therefore, the energy of the more massive fragment is:\n    ` m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV `\n\n### **3. Conservation of Energy and Momentum**\n\n*   **Energy Conservation:** The initial energy equals the sum of the final energies (rest-mass + kinetic). The difference in rest-mass energy is converted into kinetic energy (Q-value).\n    ` Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2) `\n    ` Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV `\n*   **Momentum Conservation:** The initial momentum was zero, so the final fragments must have equal and opposite momenta.\n    ` |p1| = |p2| = p `\n\n### **4.

Calculation of T1 (Correct Relativistic Value)**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the energy-momentum relation is `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2`. Since `E = T + m*c^2`, this becomes:\n` (p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2) `\n*   Since the momenta are equal (`p1 = p2`):\n    ` T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2) `\n*   Substitute `T2 = 3 - T1`, `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, and `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`:\n    ` T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99) `\n    ` T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1) `\n*   Combine terms and cancel `T1^2` from both sides:\n    ` 396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603 `\n    ` 600*T1 = 603 `\n    ` T1 = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV `\n\n### **6.

The sum of their rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3*m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow, find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nWe can express their rest-mass energies in GeV:\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1: `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2: `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value).\n\nThe energy released, `Q`, is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy. This released energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n`Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the kinetic energy T1 using the classical approximation.\n\nIn the classical (non-relativistic) framework, we use the conservation of momentum. Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the final momenta of the fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: `p1 = p2 = p`.\n\nThe kinetic energy is `T_c = p^2 / (2m)`.\nTherefore, `T1_c = p^2 / (2*m1)` and `T2_c = p^2 / (2*m2)`.\n\nThis gives us a relationship between the kinetic energies:\n`p^2 = 2*m1*T1_c = 2*m2*T2_c`\n`T1_c / T2_c = m2 / m1 = m2 / (2*m2) = 1/2`\nSo, `T2_c = 2 * T1_c`.\n\nThe total kinetic energy is `Q = T1_c + T2_c`. Substituting the relationship above:\n`3 GeV = T1_c + 2 * T1_c = 3 * T1_c`\n`T1_c = 1 GeV`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the correct kinetic energy T1 using relativistic mechanics.\n\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (`E`), momentum (`p`), and rest-mass (`m`) is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`. The total energy is also `E = T + m*c^2`, where `T` is the kinetic energy.\n\nSubstituting for `E`, we can solve for `(p*c)^2`:\n`(T + m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\n`T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2 + (m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\n`(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2`\n\nFrom momentum conservation, `p1 = p2`, so `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*m1*c^2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2*c^2`\n\nWe also know `T2 = Q - T1 = 3 GeV - T1`. Let's substitute this into the equation:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out. Now, group the terms with `T1` to solve for `T1`:\n`396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n`396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n`396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the difference.\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct value (`T1`) and the classical approximation (`T1_c`).\n`Difference = T1 - T1_c`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, convert the answer to Mega-electron Volts (MeV):\n`Difference = 0.005 GeV * (1000 MeV / 1 GeV) = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1.

Calculate the Rest Masses of the Fragments**\n\nWe have a system of two equations for m1 and m2:\n1.  m1 = 2 * m2\n2.  m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M\n3 * m2 = 0.99 * M\nm2 = 0.33 * M\n\nNow find m1:\nm1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M\n\nNext, we convert these masses to their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1 (m1*c^2):\n    m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2 (m2*c^2):\n    m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy.\n*   Q = E_initial_rest - E_final_rest\n*   Q = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV.\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: Q = T1 + T2.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = p^2 / (2m), where p is the momentum.\n*   From the conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the final momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: |p1| = |p2| = p.\n*   The kinetic energies are T1_cl = p^2 / (2*m1) and T2_cl = p^2 / (2*m2).\n*   We can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n    T1_cl / T2_cl = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1.\n*   Since m1 = 2*m2, the ratio is T1_cl / T2_cl = 1/2, which means T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl.\n*   The total kinetic energy is Q = T1_cl + T2_cl.\n*   Substitute T2_cl: Q = T1_cl + 2*T1_cl = 3*T1_cl.\n*   Therefore, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment in the classical approximation is:\n    T1_cl = Q / 3 = 3 GeV / 3 = 1 GeV.\n\n**5. Calculate T1 using the Correct Relativistic Formulas**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, we use the conservation of total energy and momentum.\n*   **Conservation of Total Energy:**\n    E_initial = E_final\n    M*c^2 = E1 + E2, where E1 and E2 are the total energies (rest energy + kinetic energy) of the fragments.\n    300 GeV = (T1 + m1*c^2) + (T2 + m2*c^2)\n    300 GeV = E1 + E2\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    p1 = -p2 => |p1| = |p2| = p.\n*   We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2.\n    This gives us (p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2.\n*   Since the magnitudes of the momenta are equal, (p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2:\n    E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2\n    E1^2 - E2^2 = (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2\n    (E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (m1*c^2 - m2*c^2)(m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)\n*   Substitute the known values:\n    *   E1 + E2 = 300 GeV\n    *   m1*c^2 = 198 GeV\n    *   m2*c^2 = 99 GeV\n    (E1 - E2) * (300 GeV) = (198 GeV - 99 GeV) * (198 GeV + 99 GeV)\n    (E1 - E2) * 300 = (99) * (297)\n    E1 - E2 = (99 * 297) / 300 = 98.01 GeV.\n*   Now we have a system of two linear equations for E1 and E2:\n    1.  E1 + E2 = 300 GeV\n    2.  E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV\n*   Add the two equations to solve for E1 (the total energy of the more massive fragment):\n    2 * E1 = 398.01 GeV\n    E1 = 199.005 GeV.\n*   The (correct) relativistic kinetic energy T1 is the total energy E1 minus the rest-mass energy m1*c^2:\n    T1 = E1 - m1*c^2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV.\n\n**6. Calculate the Difference**\n\nThe difference is between the correct relativistic value (T1) and the classical approximation (T1_cl).\n*   Difference = T1 - T1_cl\n*   Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV.\n\nFinally, convert the answer to Mega-electron Volts (MeV). Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV:\n*   Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is the step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### **1. Parse Given Information**\n\n*   Initial rest-mass energy of nucleus, `E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   The nucleus is at rest, so initial momentum `P_initial = 0`.\n*   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\n*   Fragment `m1` is the more massive one: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n### **2. Calculate Fragment Rest Masses and Energies**\n\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n`2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3*m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow, solve for `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, calculate their respective rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest energy of `m1`: `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest energy of `m2`: `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### **3. Calculate Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released as kinetic energy is the difference between the initial rest energy and the final rest energy.\n`Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\nSo, the total kinetic energy of the two fragments is `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n### **4. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Mechanics**\n\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, conservation of momentum requires the two fragments to have equal and opposite momenta: `|p1| = |p2|`.\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`, so `p^2 = 2*m*T`.\nTherefore, `p1^2 = p2^2` implies:\n`2 * m1 * T1_classical = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`\n`(2 * m2) * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`\n`2 * T1_classical = T2_classical`\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy: `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical + (2 * T1_classical) = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\n\n### **5. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics**\n\nIn special relativity, the relationship between momentum `p`, kinetic energy `T`, and rest mass energy `m*c^2` is `(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`.\n\nAgain, from momentum conservation, `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n\nWe know `T2 = 3 GeV - T1`, `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, and `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`. Substitute these values (all in GeV):\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms cancel out:\n`396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n`T1 = 1005 MeV`\n\n### **6. Find the Difference**\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\nDifference = `T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\nDifference = `1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nAn atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV.

Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies:**\n*   Initial rest-mass energy `E_M = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   Total rest-mass energy of fragments: `E_fragments = 0.99 * E_M = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   Let the fragments have rest-mass energies `m1*c^2` and `m2*c^2`. We are given `m1 = 2*m2`.\n*   So, `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV` and `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`.\n*   Solving this system: `2*m2*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV` -> `3*m2*c^2 = 297 GeV` -> `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`.\n*   Therefore, the more massive fragment has a rest-mass energy of `m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value):**\n*   The Q-value is the energy released as kinetic energy, which is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n*   `Q = E_M - E_fragments = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   This energy is shared between the two fragments: `Q = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate T1 (Classical Approximation):**\n*   By conservation of momentum (the initial nucleus is at rest), the fragments have equal and opposite momenta.\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   Since the momentum `p` is the same for both, `T` is inversely proportional to `m`.\n*   `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 1 / 2`.\n*   So, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   Substituting into the Q-value equation: `T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `3*T1_classical = 3 GeV` -> `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 (Relativistic - Correct Value):**\n*   The relativistic momentum is given by `(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2`, where `E = T + mc^2` is the total energy.\n*   ` (pc)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2T(mc^2)`.\n*   Since `p` is the same for both fragments:\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n*   Substitute `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`, and `T2 = 3 - T1`:\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198T1)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = T1^2 + 603 - 204T1`\n    `396*T1 = 603 - 204T1`\n    `600*T1 = 603`\n    `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**5. Find the Difference:**\n*   Difference = `T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n*   Convert to MeV: `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThe problem asks for the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) calculated relativistically and classically.\n\n**1. Initial Information & Given Values**\n\n*   Initial nucleus rest-mass energy: `E₀ = Mc² = 300 GeV`\n*   Initial nucleus is at rest, so its initial momentum is `p_initial = 0`.\n*   The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses `m₁` and `m₂`.\n*   We are told one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's designate the more massive fragment as fragment 1: `m₁ = 2 * m₂`.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M`.\n\n**2. Calculating the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\nWe have a system of two equations to find the masses:\n1.  `m₁ = 2m₂`\n2.  `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n`3m₂ = 0.99M`\n`m₂ = 0.33M`\n\nNow find m₁:\n`m₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`\n\nNext, we convert these masses to their rest-mass energies in GeV:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (m₁): `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (m₂): `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n**3. Applying Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before fission equals the total energy after fission. The energy released as kinetic energy (the Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final rest-mass energies.\n    `E_initial = E_final`\n    `Mc² = (m₁c² + T₁) + (m₂c² + T₂)`\n    `T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`\n    `Q = T₁ + T₂ = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n    So, the total kinetic energy of the two fragments is `3 GeV`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum after the fission must be zero. This means the two fragments fly off in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude.\n    `p_initial = p_final = 0`\n    `p₁ + p₂ = 0  =>  p₁ = -p₂`\n    The magnitudes are equal: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n\n**4. Calculating T₁ (Classical Approximation)**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`. Since the momentum `p` is the same for both fragments:\n*   `T₁_cl = p² / (2m₁)`\n*   `T₂_cl = p² / (2m₂)`\n\nFrom these equations, we can see that the kinetic energy is inversely proportional to the mass: `T₁_cl / T₂_cl = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\nThis gives us `T₂_cl = 2 * T₁_cl`.\n\nNow we use the total kinetic energy `Q`:\n`T₁_cl + T₂_cl = 3 GeV`\n`T₁_cl + 2*T₁_cl = 3 GeV`\n`3*T₁_cl = 3 GeV`\n`T₁_cl = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\n\n**5. Calculating T₁ (Correct Relativistic Value)**\n\nIn special relativity, the relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass (m) is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`.\nThe total energy `E` is the sum of the rest-mass energy and kinetic energy: `E = T + mc²`.\nSubstituting this in, we get:\n`(T + mc²)² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`\n`T² + 2Tmc² + (mc²)² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`\nThis simplifies to a useful expression for momentum: `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n\nSince the momentum magnitudes are equal, `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`:\n`T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`\n\nNow, substitute the known values:\n*   `m₁c² = 198 GeV`\n*   `m₂c² = 99 GeV`\n*   `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`\n\n`T₁² + 2 * T₁ * (198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2 * (3 - T₁) * (99)`\n`T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n\nThe `T₁²` term cancels from both sides:\n`396T₁ = 9 - 6T₁ + 594 - 198T₁`\n`396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n`396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n`600T₁ = 603`\n`T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`\n\n**6. Finding the Difference**\n\nFinally, we calculate the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n*   `T₁_relativistic = 1005 MeV`\n*   `T₁_classical = 1000 MeV`\n\n`Difference = T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Given Information:**\n    *   Initial state: An atomic nucleus at rest.\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: `E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Final state: The nucleus splits into two fragments (fragment 1 and fragment 2).\n    *   Mass relationship: Let `m1` be the mass of the more massive fragment and `m2` be the mass of the less massive one.

This means the two fragments fly apart with equal and opposite momenta (`|p1| = |p2| = p`).\n    *   Objective: Find the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T1`) calculated using relativistic mechanics and classical mechanics.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Rest Masses of the Fragments:**\n    We have a system of two equations for the masses:\n    1) `m1 = 2 * m2`\n    2) `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\n    Substitute (1) into (2):\n    `2 * m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\n    Now find `m1`:\n    `m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments:**\n    We can express the rest-mass energies in terms of the initial energy (`M * c^2 = 300 GeV`):\n    *   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1: `E_m1 = m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2: `E_m2 = m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value):**\n    From the conservation of energy, the initial total energy equals the final total energy.\n    `E_initial = (m1 * c^2 + T1) + (m2 * c^2 + T2)`\n    The total kinetic energy of the fragments (`Q = T1 + T2`) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies.\n    `Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (m1 * c^2 + m2 * c^2)`\n    `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n    So, `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n5.  **Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Mechanics:**\n    In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is given by `T = p^2 / (2m)`, where `p` is the momentum.\n    From conservation of momentum, `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n    So, `p^2 = 2 * m1 * T1_classical` and `p^2 = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`.\n    This means `m1 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`.\n    Since `m1 = 2 * m2`, we have `2 * m2 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`, which simplifies to `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n    Now, use the total kinetic energy equation:\n    `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n6.  **Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value):**\n    The relativistic relationship between total energy (`E`), rest-mass energy (`m*c^2`), and momentum (`p`) is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n    The kinetic energy is `T = E - m*c^2`, so `E = T + m*c^2`.\n    Substituting `E` into the equation gives `(T + m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n    Expanding this gives `T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2 + (m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n    This simplifies to the useful relation: `(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2`.\n    From conservation of momentum, `|p1| = |p2|`, so `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n    Therefore:\n    `T1 * (T1 + 2 * m1*c^2) = T2 * (T2 + 2 * m2*c^2)`\n    Substitute the known values (`m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`, and `T2 = 3 - T1`):\n    `T1 * (T1 + 2 * 198) = (3 - T1) * ((3 - T1) + 2 * 99)`\n    `T1 * (T1 + 396) = (3 - T1) * (3 - T1 + 198)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (3 - T1) * (201 - T1)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = 603 - 3*T1 - 201*T1 + T1^2`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\n    `396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n    `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n    `600*T1 = 603`\n    `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n    This is the correct (relativistic) value, `T1_correct = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Difference:**\n    The difference is `ΔT1 = T1_correct - T1_classical`.\n    `ΔT1 = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n\n8.  **Convert the Result to MeV:**\n    Since the options are in MeV, we convert GeV to MeV (`1 GeV = 1000 MeV`).\n    `ΔT1 = 0.005 GeV * (1000 MeV / 1 GeV) = 5 MeV`.\n\nFinal check of all steps shows the logic and calculations are sound.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem and Extract Key Information**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of rest-mass `M` is at rest. Its rest-mass energy `Mc² = 300 GeV`. Since it's at rest, its initial total momentum is 0.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses `m₁` and `m₂`.\n*   **Mass Relation:** One fragment is twice as massive as the other. We'll label the more massive one `m₁`, so `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n*   **Mass Defect:** The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 M`.\n*   **Goal:** Calculate the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T₁`) using both relativistic and classical physics, and find the difference. The difference should be expressed in MeV.\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest Masses (or Rest-Mass Energies)**\n\nIt's easiest to work with rest-mass energies (`mc²`).\n\n*   Initial rest-mass energy: `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   Total final rest-mass energy: `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * (Mc²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   We also have the mass relation in terms of energy: `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n\nNow we can solve this system of two equations:\n1.  Substitute the relation into the sum: `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n2.  `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`\n3.  `m₂c² = 99 GeV`\n4.  `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`\n\nSo, the rest-mass energies are:\n*   More massive fragment (`m₁`): **198 GeV**\n*   Less massive fragment (`m₂`): **99 GeV**\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nBy conservation of energy, the \"lost\" rest-mass energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = (Initial Rest-Mass Energy) - (Final Rest-Mass Energy)`\n*   `Q = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   The total kinetic energy shared between the two fragments is **3 GeV**.\n\n**4. Calculate `T₁` using the Classical Approximation (`T₁_classical`)**\n\nIn classical (non-relativistic) physics:\n\n*   **Momentum Conservation:** The initial momentum was zero, so the fragments must fly off with equal and opposite momenta. Let their momentum magnitude be `p`.\n*   **Kinetic Energy:** The classical formula is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   We can write `p² = 2m₁T₁_classical` and `p² = 2m₂T₂_classical`.\n*   Therefore, `m₁T₁_classical = m₂T₂_classical`.\n*   This gives us the ratio of kinetic energies: `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 99 / 198 = 1/2`.\n*   So, `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   **Energy Conservation:** We know `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = Q = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substitute `T₂_classical`: `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**5. Calculate `T₁` using the Correct (Relativistic) Formulas (`T₁_relativistic`)**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics:\n\n*   **Momentum Conservation:** Same as before, the momentum magnitudes are equal. Let this magnitude be `p`.\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`, where `E` is the total energy (`E = T + mc²`).\n*   From this, we can find `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)²`.\n*   Applying this to both fragments:\n    *   `(pc)² = (T₁ + m₁c²)² - (m₁c²)²`\n    *   `(pc)² = (T₂ + m₂c²)² - (m₂c²)²`\n*   Equating the two expressions for `(pc)²`: `(T₁ + m₁c²)² - (m₁c²)² = (T₂ + m₂c²)² - (m₂c²)²`\n*   **Energy Conservation:** We also know `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`.\n*   Substitute `T₂`, `m₁c²`, and `m₂c²` (all in GeV):\n    `(T₁ + 198)² - 198² = ( (3 - T₁) + 99)² - 99²`\n    `(T₁ + 198)² - 198² = (102 - T₁)² - 99²`\n*   Expand the squares:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ + 198² - 198² = (102² - 204T₁ + T₁²) - 99²`\n*   Cancel terms (`T₁²` and `198²`):\n    `396T₁ = 10404 - 204T₁ - 9801`\n*   Solve for `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 10404 - 9801`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n*   `T₁_relativistic = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**6. Find the Difference**\n\n*   Difference = `T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, convert the answer to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n\n*   Difference = `0.005 GeV * (1000 MeV / 1 GeV) = 5 MeV`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nAn atomic nucleus with a rest-mass energy of $E_0 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$ is initially at rest. It fissions into two fragments with rest masses $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n\n**1. Determine Fragment Masses and Energies**\n\n*   **Mass Relationship:** We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let $m_1$ be the mass of the more massive fragment.\n    $m_1 = 2m_2$\n*   **Sum of Masses:** The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass M.\n    $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$\n*   **Solving for Masses:** Substitute the first equation into the second:\n    $2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99M \\implies 3m_2 = 0.99M \\implies m_2 = 0.33M$\n    And for the more massive fragment:\n    $m_1 = 2m_2 = 2(0.33M) = 0.66M$\n*   **Calculating Rest-Mass Energies:**\n    *   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1: $m_1c^2 = 0.66(Mc^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2: $m_2c^2 = 0.33(Mc^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released in the fission (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest energy and the final total rest energy. This released energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n$Q = T_{total} = T_1 + T_2 = (\\text{Initial rest energy}) - (\\text{Final rest energy})$\n$Q = Mc^2 - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2)$\n$Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - (198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV}) = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**3. Calculate Kinetic Energy ($T_1$) using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   **Momentum Conservation:** The initial nucleus is at rest, so the initial total momentum is zero. By the law of conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta after the fission.\n    $p_1 = p_2 = p$\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is $T = \\frac{p^2}{2m}$.\n*   **Relating Kinetic Energies:** We can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n    $\\frac{T_{1, classical}}{T_{2, classical}} = \\frac{p^2/(2m_1)}{p^2/(2m_2)} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \\frac{m_2}{2m_2} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n    This means $T_{2, classical} = 2T_{1, classical}$.\n*   **Solving for $T_1$:** Using the total kinetic energy:\n    $T_{1, classical} + T_{2, classical} = Q$\n    $T_{1, classical} + 2T_{1, classical} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n    $3T_{1, classical} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n    $T_{1, classical} = 1 \\text{ GeV} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**4. Calculate Kinetic Energy ($T_1$) using Relativistic Formulas**\n\n*   **Relativistic Momentum-Energy Relation:** The relationship between total energy ($E = T + m_0c^2$) and momentum is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$. From this, we derive the expression for momentum: $(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2T(m_0c^2)$.\n*   **Momentum Conservation:** As before, $p_1 = p_2$, which implies $(p_1c)^2 = (p_2c)^2$.\n    $T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = T_2^2 + 2T_2(m_2c^2)$\n*   **Solving for $T_1$:** We know $T_2 = Q - T_1$. Let's substitute the values for $Q$, $m_1c^2$, and $m_2c^2$ (all in GeV):\n    $T_1^2 + 2T_1(198) = (3 - T_1)^2 + 2(3 - T_1)(99)$\n    $T_1^2 + 396T_1 = (9 - 6T_1 + T_1^2) + (594 - 198T_1)$\n    Cancel the $T_1^2$ terms on both sides:\n    $396T_1 = 9 - 6T_1 + 594 - 198T_1$\n    $396T_1 = 603 - 204T_1$\n    $396T_1 + 204T_1 = 603$\n    $600T_1 = 603$\n    $T_1 = \\frac{603}{600} \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV} = 1005 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**5.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus is at rest.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is `E_initial = Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Its initial momentum is `p_initial = 0`.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments. Let's call them fragment 1 (more massive) and fragment 2 (less massive).\n    *   Rest masses: `m₁` and `m₂`.\n    *   Kinetic energies: `T₁` and `T₂`.\n    *   Momenta: `p₁` and `p₂`.\n\n### **2. Determine the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\nWe are given two relationships:\n1.  One fragment is twice as massive: `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n2.  The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`.\n\nWe can express these in terms of rest-mass energy (`E_rest = mc²`):\n1.  `E_rest₁ = 2 * E_rest₂`.\n2.  `E_rest₁ + E_rest₂ = 0.99 * (Mc²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n\nNow, we solve this system of equations:\n*   Substitute the first equation into the second: `(2 * E_rest₂) + E_rest₂ = 297 GeV`.\n*   This gives `3 * E_rest₂ = 297 GeV`, so `E_rest₂ = 99 GeV`.\n*   The rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment is `E_rest₁ = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nBy the principle of conservation of energy, the \"lost\" rest-mass energy is converted into kinetic energy.\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = E_initial - (E_rest₁ + E_rest₂)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\nThe total kinetic energy shared between the fragments is 3 GeV.\n\n### **4. Calculate T₁ using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, by conservation of momentum, the fragments must have equal magnitude and opposite direction momenta: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n\n*   The classical kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   We can establish a ratio: `T₁_cl / T₂_cl = (p² / 2m₁) / (p² / 2m₂) = m₂ / m₁`.\n*   Since `m₁ = 2m₂`, the ratio is `1/2`. Therefore, `T₂_cl = 2 * T₁_cl`.\n*   Substitute this into the total kinetic energy equation: `T₁_cl + T₂_cl = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T₁_cl + 2*T₁_cl = 3 GeV`.\n*   `3 * T₁_cl = 3 GeV`, which means `T₁_cl = 1 GeV`.\n\n### **5. Calculate T₁ using Correct Relativistic Mechanics**\n\nThe relativistic relationship between momentum, kinetic energy, and rest-mass energy is `(pc)² = T² + 2T(mc²)`.\n\n*   Again, since momenta are equal, `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`.\n*   `T₁² + 2T₁(m₁c²) = T₂² + 2T₂(m₂c²)`.\n*   We substitute the known values: `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, `m₂c² = 99 GeV`, and `T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁`.\n    `T₁² + 2T₁(198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2(3 - T₁)(99)`\n*   Expand and simplify:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n*   The `T₁²` terms on both sides cancel out:\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n*   Solve for `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### **6. Find the Difference and Convert to MeV**\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\n*   Difference = `T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n\nFinally, we convert the result to MeV (1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   Difference = `0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"

The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M:\n    *   m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M\n\nWe can solve this system of equations to find the masses of the fragments in terms of M:\n*   Substitute (1) into (2): (2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M => 3 * m2 = 0.99 * M => **m2 = 0.33 * M**\n*   Now find m1: m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) => **m1 = 0.66 * M**\n\nNow, let's find the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n*   Rest energy of the more massive fragment (m1): E1_rest = m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = **198 GeV**\n*   Rest energy of the less massive fragment (m2): E2_rest = m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = **99 GeV**\n\nBy the principle of conservation of energy, the initial energy equals the total final energy (rest energies + kinetic energies of the fragments).\n*   E_initial = E_final = (m1*c^2 + T1) + (m2*c^2 + T2)\n*   The total kinetic energy (Q-value) released in the fission is:\n    *   Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)\n    *   Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = **3 GeV**\n\nThe initial nucleus was at rest, so the initial momentum was zero. By conservation of momentum, the final total momentum must also be zero. This means the two fragments move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n*   |p1| = |p2| = p\n\n**Case 1: Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation for T1**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = p^2 / (2m).\n*   T1_classical = p^2 / (2 * m1)\n*   T2_classical = p^2 / (2 * m2)\nThe ratio of the kinetic energies is inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses:\n*   T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = (0.33 M) / (0.66 M) = 1/2\n*   So, T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical\nNow, we use the total kinetic energy:\n*   T1_classical + T2_classical = Q = 3 GeV\n*   T1_classical + (2 * T1_classical) = 3 GeV\n*   3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV\n*   **T1_classical = 1 GeV**\n\n**Case 2: Correct (Relativistic) Calculation for T1**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the relationship between energy, momentum, and mass is E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2. This can be rearranged to find the momentum: (p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2.\nSince the momenta are equal, (p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2.\n*   E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2\nWe also know from energy conservation that E1 + E2 = E_initial = 300 GeV. So, E2 = 300 - E1.\n*   E1^2 - (198)^2 = (300 - E1)^2 - (99)^2\n*   E1^2 - 39204 = (90000 - 600*E1 + E1^2) - 9801\nCancel the E1^2 terms:\n*   -39204 = 90000 - 600*E1 - 9801\n*   -39204 = 80199 - 600*E1\n*   600*E1 = 80199 + 39204\n*   600*E1 = 119403\n*   E1 = 119403 / 600 = 199.005 GeV\nThe kinetic energy T1 is the total energy E1 minus the rest energy m1*c^2:\n*   T1_relativistic = E1 - m1*c^2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = **1.005 GeV**\n\n**Final Step: Calculate the Difference**\n\nThe difference between the relativistic and classical values for T1 is:\n*   Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\n*   Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV\n\nThe question asks for the answer in MeV.

Thus, $(p_1c)^2 = (p_2c)^2$.\n$(p_1c)^2 = E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2$\n$(p_2c)^2 = E_2^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$\nSo, $E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2 = E_2^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$.\n\nFrom conservation of total energy, the sum of the total energies of the fragments must equal the rest energy of the initial nucleus:\n$E_1 + E_2 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nRearranging the momentum equation:\n$E_1^2 - E_2^2 = (m_1c^2)^2 - (m_2c^2)^2$\n$(E_1 - E_2)(E_1 + E_2) = (198 \\text{ GeV})^2 - (99 \\text{ GeV})^2$\n$(E_1 - E_2)(300 \\text{ GeV}) = 39204 - 9801 \\text{ GeV}^2 = 29403 \\text{ GeV}^2$\n$E_1 - E_2 = \\frac{29403}{300} \\text{ GeV} = 98.01 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nNow we solve the system of equations:\n1) $E_1 + E_2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$\n2) $E_1 - E_2 = 98.01 \\text{ GeV}$\nAdding the two equations:\n$2E_1 = 398.01 \\text{ GeV} \\implies E_1 = 199.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nThe kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, $T_1$, is its total energy minus its rest energy:\n$T_{1, \\text{correct}} = E_1 - m_1c^2 = 199.005 \\text{ GeV} - 198 \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n$T_{1, \\text{correct}} = 1005 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**Calculate the Difference**\n\nDifference = $T_{1, \\text{correct}} - T_{1, \\text{classical}}$\nDifference = $1005 \\text{ MeV} - 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nAn atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, so its initial total energy is its rest-mass energy `E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV` and its initial momentum is `p_initial = 0`.\n\nThe nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\nWe are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other.

Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the final momenta of the fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: `p1 = p2 = p`.\n\nThe kinetic energy is `T_c = p^2 / (2m)`.\nTherefore, `T1_c = p^2 / (2*m1)` and `T2_c = p^2 / (2*m2)`.\n\nThis gives us a relationship between the kinetic energies:\n`p^2 = 2*m1*T1_c = 2*m2*T2_c`\n`T1_c / T2_c = m2 / m1 = m2 / (2*m2) = 1/2`\nSo, `T2_c = 2 * T1_c`.\n\nThe total kinetic energy is `Q = T1_c + T2_c`. Substituting the relationship above:\n`3 GeV = T1_c + 2 * T1_c = 3 * T1_c`\n`T1_c = 1 GeV`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the correct kinetic energy T1 using relativistic mechanics.\n\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (`E`), momentum (`p`), and rest-mass (`m`) is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`. The total energy is also `E = T + m*c^2`, where `T` is the kinetic energy.\n\nSubstituting for `E`, we can solve for `(p*c)^2`:\n`(T + m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\n`T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2 + (m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\n`(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2`\n\nFrom momentum conservation, `p1 = p2`, so `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*m1*c^2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2*c^2`\n\nWe also know `T2 = Q - T1 = 3 GeV - T1`. Let's substitute this into the equation:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out. Now, group the terms with `T1` to solve for `T1`:\n`396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n`396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n`396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the difference.\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct value (`T1`) and the classical approximation (`T1_c`).\n`Difference = T1 - T1_c`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, convert the answer to Mega-electron Volts (MeV):\n`Difference = 0.005 GeV * (1000 MeV / 1 GeV) = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1.

Calculate the Rest Masses of the Fragments**\n\nWe have a system of two equations for m1 and m2:\n1.  m1 = 2 * m2\n2.  m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M\n3 * m2 = 0.99 * M\nm2 = 0.33 * M\n\nNow find m1:\nm1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M\n\nNext, we convert these masses to their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1 (m1*c^2):\n    m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2 (m2*c^2):\n    m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final total rest-mass energy.\n*   Q = E_initial_rest - E_final_rest\n*   Q = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV.\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: Q = T1 + T2.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using the Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = p^2 / (2m), where p is the momentum.\n*   From the conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the final momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: |p1| = |p2| = p.\n*   The kinetic energies are T1_cl = p^2 / (2*m1) and T2_cl = p^2 / (2*m2).\n*   We can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n    T1_cl / T2_cl = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1.\n*   Since m1 = 2*m2, the ratio is T1_cl / T2_cl = 1/2, which means T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl.\n*   The total kinetic energy is Q = T1_cl + T2_cl.\n*   Substitute T2_cl: Q = T1_cl + 2*T1_cl = 3*T1_cl.\n*   Therefore, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment in the classical approximation is:\n    T1_cl = Q / 3 = 3 GeV / 3 = 1 GeV.\n\n**5. Calculate T1 using the Correct Relativistic Formulas**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, we use the conservation of total energy and momentum.\n*   **Conservation of Total Energy:**\n    E_initial = E_final\n    M*c^2 = E1 + E2, where E1 and E2 are the total energies (rest energy + kinetic energy) of the fragments.\n    300 GeV = (T1 + m1*c^2) + (T2 + m2*c^2)\n    300 GeV = E1 + E2\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    p1 = -p2 => |p1| = |p2| = p.\n*   We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2.\n    This gives us (p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2.\n*   Since the magnitudes of the momenta are equal, (p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2:\n    E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2\n    E1^2 - E2^2 = (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2\n    (E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (m1*c^2 - m2*c^2)(m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)\n*   Substitute the known values:\n    *   E1 + E2 = 300 GeV\n    *   m1*c^2 = 198 GeV\n    *   m2*c^2 = 99 GeV\n    (E1 - E2) * (300 GeV) = (198 GeV - 99 GeV) * (198 GeV + 99 GeV)\n    (E1 - E2) * 300 = (99) * (297)\n    E1 - E2 = (99 * 297) / 300 = 98.01 GeV.\n*   Now we have a system of two linear equations for E1 and E2:\n    1.  E1 + E2 = 300 GeV\n    2.  E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV\n*   Add the two equations to solve for E1 (the total energy of the more massive fragment):\n    2 * E1 = 398.01 GeV\n    E1 = 199.005 GeV.\n*   The (correct) relativistic kinetic energy T1 is the total energy E1 minus the rest-mass energy m1*c^2:\n    T1 = E1 - m1*c^2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV.\n\n**6. Calculate the Difference**\n\nThe difference is between the correct relativistic value (T1) and the classical approximation (T1_cl).\n*   Difference = T1 - T1_cl\n*   Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV.\n\nFinally, convert the answer to Mega-electron Volts (MeV). Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV:\n*   Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is the step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### **1. Parse Given Information**\n\n*   Initial rest-mass energy of nucleus, `E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   The nucleus is at rest, so initial momentum `P_initial = 0`.\n*   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\n*   Fragment `m1` is the more massive one: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\n### **2. Calculate Fragment Rest Masses and Energies**\n\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n`2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3*m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow, solve for `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, calculate their respective rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest energy of `m1`: `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest energy of `m2`: `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### **3. Calculate Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released as kinetic energy is the difference between the initial rest energy and the final rest energy.\n`Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\nSo, the total kinetic energy of the two fragments is `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n### **4. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Mechanics**\n\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, conservation of momentum requires the two fragments to have equal and opposite momenta: `|p1| = |p2|`.\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`, so `p^2 = 2*m*T`.\nTherefore, `p1^2 = p2^2` implies:\n`2 * m1 * T1_classical = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`\n`(2 * m2) * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`\n`2 * T1_classical = T2_classical`\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy: `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical + (2 * T1_classical) = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\n\n### **5. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics**\n\nIn special relativity, the relationship between momentum `p`, kinetic energy `T`, and rest mass energy `m*c^2` is `(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`.\n\nAgain, from momentum conservation, `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n\nWe know `T2 = 3 GeV - T1`, `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, and `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`. Substitute these values (all in GeV):\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms cancel out:\n`396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n`T1 = 1005 MeV`\n\n### **6. Find the Difference**\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\nDifference = `T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\nDifference = `1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nAn atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV.

Calculate Fragment Rest-Mass Energies:**\n*   Initial rest-mass energy `E_M = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   Total rest-mass energy of fragments: `E_fragments = 0.99 * E_M = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   Let the fragments have rest-mass energies `m1*c^2` and `m2*c^2`. We are given `m1 = 2*m2`.\n*   So, `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV` and `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2`.\n*   Solving this system: `2*m2*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV` -> `3*m2*c^2 = 297 GeV` -> `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`.\n*   Therefore, the more massive fragment has a rest-mass energy of `m1*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value):**\n*   The Q-value is the energy released as kinetic energy, which is the difference between the initial and final rest-mass energies.\n*   `Q = E_M - E_fragments = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   This energy is shared between the two fragments: `Q = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate T1 (Classical Approximation):**\n*   By conservation of momentum (the initial nucleus is at rest), the fragments have equal and opposite momenta.\n*   In classical mechanics, kinetic energy `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   Since the momentum `p` is the same for both, `T` is inversely proportional to `m`.\n*   `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 1 / 2`.\n*   So, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n*   Substituting into the Q-value equation: `T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `3*T1_classical = 3 GeV` -> `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 (Relativistic - Correct Value):**\n*   The relativistic momentum is given by `(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2`, where `E = T + mc^2` is the total energy.\n*   ` (pc)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2T(mc^2)`.\n*   Since `p` is the same for both fragments:\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n*   Substitute `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`, and `T2 = 3 - T1`:\n    `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198T1)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = T1^2 + 603 - 204T1`\n    `396*T1 = 603 - 204T1`\n    `600*T1 = 603`\n    `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**5. Find the Difference:**\n*   Difference = `T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n*   Convert to MeV: `0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThe problem asks for the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) calculated relativistically and classically.\n\n**1. Initial Information & Given Values**\n\n*   Initial nucleus rest-mass energy: `E₀ = Mc² = 300 GeV`\n*   Initial nucleus is at rest, so its initial momentum is `p_initial = 0`.\n*   The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses `m₁` and `m₂`.\n*   We are told one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's designate the more massive fragment as fragment 1: `m₁ = 2 * m₂`.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M`.\n\n**2. Calculating the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments**\n\nWe have a system of two equations to find the masses:\n1.  `m₁ = 2m₂`\n2.  `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2m₂ + m₂ = 0.99M`\n`3m₂ = 0.99M`\n`m₂ = 0.33M`\n\nNow find m₁:\n`m₁ = 2 * (0.33M) = 0.66M`\n\nNext, we convert these masses to their rest-mass energies in GeV:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (m₁): `m₁c² = 0.66 * Mc² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (m₂): `m₂c² = 0.33 * Mc² = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n**3. Applying Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before fission equals the total energy after fission. The energy released as kinetic energy (the Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final rest-mass energies.\n    `E_initial = E_final`\n    `Mc² = (m₁c² + T₁) + (m₂c² + T₂)`\n    `T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`\n    `Q = T₁ + T₂ = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n    So, the total kinetic energy of the two fragments is `3 GeV`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum after the fission must be zero. This means the two fragments fly off in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude.\n    `p_initial = p_final = 0`\n    `p₁ + p₂ = 0  =>  p₁ = -p₂`\n    The magnitudes are equal: `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`.\n\n**4. Calculating T₁ (Classical Approximation)**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`. Since the momentum `p` is the same for both fragments:\n*   `T₁_cl = p² / (2m₁)`\n*   `T₂_cl = p² / (2m₂)`\n\nFrom these equations, we can see that the kinetic energy is inversely proportional to the mass: `T₁_cl / T₂_cl = m₂ / m₁ = 1/2`.\nThis gives us `T₂_cl = 2 * T₁_cl`.\n\nNow we use the total kinetic energy `Q`:\n`T₁_cl + T₂_cl = 3 GeV`\n`T₁_cl + 2*T₁_cl = 3 GeV`\n`3*T₁_cl = 3 GeV`\n`T₁_cl = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\n\n**5. Calculating T₁ (Correct Relativistic Value)**\n\nIn special relativity, the relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass (m) is `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`.\nThe total energy `E` is the sum of the rest-mass energy and kinetic energy: `E = T + mc²`.\nSubstituting this in, we get:\n`(T + mc²)² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`\n`T² + 2Tmc² + (mc²)² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`\nThis simplifies to a useful expression for momentum: `(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`.\n\nSince the momentum magnitudes are equal, `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`:\n`T₁² + 2T₁m₁c² = T₂² + 2T₂m₂c²`\n\nNow, substitute the known values:\n*   `m₁c² = 198 GeV`\n*   `m₂c² = 99 GeV`\n*   `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`\n\n`T₁² + 2 * T₁ * (198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2 * (3 - T₁) * (99)`\n`T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n\nThe `T₁²` term cancels from both sides:\n`396T₁ = 9 - 6T₁ + 594 - 198T₁`\n`396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n`396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n`600T₁ = 603`\n`T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`\n\n**6. Finding the Difference**\n\nFinally, we calculate the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n*   `T₁_relativistic = 1005 MeV`\n*   `T₁_classical = 1000 MeV`\n\n`Difference = T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Given Information:**\n    *   Initial state: An atomic nucleus at rest.\n    *   Initial rest-mass energy: `E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Final state: The nucleus splits into two fragments (fragment 1 and fragment 2).\n    *   Mass relationship: Let `m1` be the mass of the more massive fragment and `m2` be the mass of the less massive one.

This means the two fragments fly apart with equal and opposite momenta (`|p1| = |p2| = p`).\n    *   Objective: Find the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T1`) calculated using relativistic mechanics and classical mechanics.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Rest Masses of the Fragments:**\n    We have a system of two equations for the masses:\n    1) `m1 = 2 * m2`\n    2) `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\n    Substitute (1) into (2):\n    `2 * m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\n    Now find `m1`:\n    `m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Rest-Mass Energies of the Fragments:**\n    We can express the rest-mass energies in terms of the initial energy (`M * c^2 = 300 GeV`):\n    *   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1: `E_m1 = m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2: `E_m2 = m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value):**\n    From the conservation of energy, the initial total energy equals the final total energy.\n    `E_initial = (m1 * c^2 + T1) + (m2 * c^2 + T2)`\n    The total kinetic energy of the fragments (`Q = T1 + T2`) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies.\n    `Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (m1 * c^2 + m2 * c^2)`\n    `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n    So, `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n5.  **Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Mechanics:**\n    In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is given by `T = p^2 / (2m)`, where `p` is the momentum.\n    From conservation of momentum, `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n    So, `p^2 = 2 * m1 * T1_classical` and `p^2 = 2 * m2 * T2_classical`.\n    This means `m1 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`.\n    Since `m1 = 2 * m2`, we have `2 * m2 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical`, which simplifies to `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n    Now, use the total kinetic energy equation:\n    `T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n6.  **Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value):**\n    The relativistic relationship between total energy (`E`), rest-mass energy (`m*c^2`), and momentum (`p`) is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n    The kinetic energy is `T = E - m*c^2`, so `E = T + m*c^2`.\n    Substituting `E` into the equation gives `(T + m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n    Expanding this gives `T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2 + (m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n    This simplifies to the useful relation: `(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2`.\n    From conservation of momentum, `|p1| = |p2|`, so `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n    Therefore:\n    `T1 * (T1 + 2 * m1*c^2) = T2 * (T2 + 2 * m2*c^2)`\n    Substitute the known values (`m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`, `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`, and `T2 = 3 - T1`):\n    `T1 * (T1 + 2 * 198) = (3 - T1) * ((3 - T1) + 2 * 99)`\n    `T1 * (T1 + 396) = (3 - T1) * (3 - T1 + 198)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (3 - T1) * (201 - T1)`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = 603 - 3*T1 - 201*T1 + T1^2`\n    `T1^2 + 396*T1 = T1^2 - 204*T1 + 603`\n    `396*T1 = -204*T1 + 603`\n    `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n    `600*T1 = 603`\n    `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`.\n    This is the correct (relativistic) value, `T1_correct = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Difference:**\n    The difference is `ΔT1 = T1_correct - T1_classical`.\n    `ΔT1 = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n\n8.  **Convert the Result to MeV:**\n    Since the options are in MeV, we convert GeV to MeV (`1 GeV = 1000 MeV`).\n    `ΔT1 = 0.005 GeV * (1000 MeV / 1 GeV) = 5 MeV`.\n\nFinal check of all steps shows the logic and calculations are sound.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem and Extract Key Information**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of rest-mass `M` is at rest. Its rest-mass energy `Mc² = 300 GeV`. Since it's at rest, its initial total momentum is 0.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses `m₁` and `m₂`.\n*   **Mass Relation:** One fragment is twice as massive as the other. We'll label the more massive one `m₁`, so `m₁ = 2m₂`.\n*   **Mass Defect:** The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 M`.\n*   **Goal:** Calculate the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (`T₁`) using both relativistic and classical physics, and find the difference. The difference should be expressed in MeV.\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest Masses (or Rest-Mass Energies)**\n\nIt's easiest to work with rest-mass energies (`mc²`).\n\n*   Initial rest-mass energy: `Mc² = 300 GeV`.\n*   Total final rest-mass energy: `m₁c² + m₂c² = 0.99 * (Mc²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n*   We also have the mass relation in terms of energy: `m₁c² = 2(m₂c²)`.\n\nNow we can solve this system of two equations:\n1.  Substitute the relation into the sum: `2(m₂c²) + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n2.  `3(m₂c²) = 297 GeV`\n3.  `m₂c² = 99 GeV`\n4.  `m₁c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`\n\nSo, the rest-mass energies are:\n*   More massive fragment (`m₁`): **198 GeV**\n*   Less massive fragment (`m₂`): **99 GeV**\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nBy conservation of energy, the \"lost\" rest-mass energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n\n*   `Q = T₁ + T₂ = (Initial Rest-Mass Energy) - (Final Rest-Mass Energy)`\n*   `Q = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n*   The total kinetic energy shared between the two fragments is **3 GeV**.\n\n**4. Calculate `T₁` using the Classical Approximation (`T₁_classical`)**\n\nIn classical (non-relativistic) physics:\n\n*   **Momentum Conservation:** The initial momentum was zero, so the fragments must fly off with equal and opposite momenta. Let their momentum magnitude be `p`.\n*   **Kinetic Energy:** The classical formula is `T = p² / (2m)`.\n*   We can write `p² = 2m₁T₁_classical` and `p² = 2m₂T₂_classical`.\n*   Therefore, `m₁T₁_classical = m₂T₂_classical`.\n*   This gives us the ratio of kinetic energies: `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = m₂ / m₁ = 99 / 198 = 1/2`.\n*   So, `T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`.\n*   **Energy Conservation:** We know `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = Q = 3 GeV`.\n*   Substitute `T₂_classical`: `T₁_classical + 2T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `3T₁_classical = 3 GeV`.\n*   `T₁_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**5. Calculate `T₁` using the Correct (Relativistic) Formulas (`T₁_relativistic`)**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics:\n\n*   **Momentum Conservation:** Same as before, the momentum magnitudes are equal. Let this magnitude be `p`.\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`, where `E` is the total energy (`E = T + mc²`).\n*   From this, we can find `(pc)² = E² - (mc²)² = (T + mc²)² - (mc²)²`.\n*   Applying this to both fragments:\n    *   `(pc)² = (T₁ + m₁c²)² - (m₁c²)²`\n    *   `(pc)² = (T₂ + m₂c²)² - (m₂c²)²`\n*   Equating the two expressions for `(pc)²`: `(T₁ + m₁c²)² - (m₁c²)² = (T₂ + m₂c²)² - (m₂c²)²`\n*   **Energy Conservation:** We also know `T₂ = Q - T₁ = 3 - T₁`.\n*   Substitute `T₂`, `m₁c²`, and `m₂c²` (all in GeV):\n    `(T₁ + 198)² - 198² = ( (3 - T₁) + 99)² - 99²`\n    `(T₁ + 198)² - 198² = (102 - T₁)² - 99²`\n*   Expand the squares:\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ + 198² - 198² = (102² - 204T₁ + T₁²) - 99²`\n*   Cancel terms (`T₁²` and `198²`):\n    `396T₁ = 10404 - 204T₁ - 9801`\n*   Solve for `T₁`:\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 10404 - 9801`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n*   `T₁_relativistic = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n**6. Find the Difference**\n\n*   Difference = `T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical`\n*   Difference = `1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, convert the answer to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n\n*   Difference = `0.005 GeV * (1000 MeV / 1 GeV) = 5 MeV`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nAn atomic nucleus with a rest-mass energy of $E_0 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$ is initially at rest. It fissions into two fragments with rest masses $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n\n**1. Determine Fragment Masses and Energies**\n\n*   **Mass Relationship:** We are given that one fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let $m_1$ be the mass of the more massive fragment.\n    $m_1 = 2m_2$\n*   **Sum of Masses:** The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass M.\n    $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$\n*   **Solving for Masses:** Substitute the first equation into the second:\n    $2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99M \\implies 3m_2 = 0.99M \\implies m_2 = 0.33M$\n    And for the more massive fragment:\n    $m_1 = 2m_2 = 2(0.33M) = 0.66M$\n*   **Calculating Rest-Mass Energies:**\n    *   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1: $m_1c^2 = 0.66(Mc^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n    *   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2: $m_2c^2 = 0.33(Mc^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe energy released in the fission (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest energy and the final total rest energy. This released energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n$Q = T_{total} = T_1 + T_2 = (\\text{Initial rest energy}) - (\\text{Final rest energy})$\n$Q = Mc^2 - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2)$\n$Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - (198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV}) = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**3. Calculate Kinetic Energy ($T_1$) using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\n*   **Momentum Conservation:** The initial nucleus is at rest, so the initial total momentum is zero. By the law of conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta after the fission.\n    $p_1 = p_2 = p$\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** The formula is $T = \\frac{p^2}{2m}$.\n*   **Relating Kinetic Energies:** We can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n    $\\frac{T_{1, classical}}{T_{2, classical}} = \\frac{p^2/(2m_1)}{p^2/(2m_2)} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \\frac{m_2}{2m_2} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n    This means $T_{2, classical} = 2T_{1, classical}$.\n*   **Solving for $T_1$:** Using the total kinetic energy:\n    $T_{1, classical} + T_{2, classical} = Q$\n    $T_{1, classical} + 2T_{1, classical} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n    $3T_{1, classical} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$\n    $T_{1, classical} = 1 \\text{ GeV} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**4. Calculate Kinetic Energy ($T_1$) using Relativistic Formulas**\n\n*   **Relativistic Momentum-Energy Relation:** The relationship between total energy ($E = T + m_0c^2$) and momentum is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$. From this, we derive the expression for momentum: $(pc)^2 = T^2 + 2T(m_0c^2)$.\n*   **Momentum Conservation:** As before, $p_1 = p_2$, which implies $(p_1c)^2 = (p_2c)^2$.\n    $T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = T_2^2 + 2T_2(m_2c^2)$\n*   **Solving for $T_1$:** We know $T_2 = Q - T_1$. Let's substitute the values for $Q$, $m_1c^2$, and $m_2c^2$ (all in GeV):\n    $T_1^2 + 2T_1(198) = (3 - T_1)^2 + 2(3 - T_1)(99)$\n    $T_1^2 + 396T_1 = (9 - 6T_1 + T_1^2) + (594 - 198T_1)$\n    Cancel the $T_1^2$ terms on both sides:\n    $396T_1 = 9 - 6T_1 + 594 - 198T_1$\n    $396T_1 = 603 - 204T_1$\n    $396T_1 + 204T_1 = 603$\n    $600T_1 = 603$\n    $T_1 = \\frac{603}{600} \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV} = 1005 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**5.
