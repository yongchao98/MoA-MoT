    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the experimental data provided.**\n    1.  **¹H NMR:** Two peaks are observed for a single alpha-proton.\n        *   They have similar chemical shifts.\n        *   Their combined integral is 1H, and they are roughly equal in size, implying a ~1:1 ratio of the two species giving rise to the peaks.\n        *   Spin-spin coupling is ruled out, meaning the splitting is not due to adjacent protons. This indicates the presence of two distinct chemical environments for that alpha-proton.\n    2.  **LC-MS:** Two distinct peaks are observed in the liquid chromatogram.\n        *   They have equal intensities, reinforcing the ~1:1 ratio seen in the NMR.\n        *   They are observed at an elevated temperature, which suggests the two species are stable and do not interconvert rapidly upon heating (if they did, the peaks might broaden or coalesce).\n        *   Both peaks give the exact same mass spectrum, which matches the expected molecular weight of the target peptide.\n\n*   **Step 2: Evaluate the provided options based on the data.**\n    *   **A) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** \"Double coupling\" is a procedural step in synthesis to ensure a reaction goes to completion. It does not describe a chemical outcome that would result in two stable, isomeric products. This option is not a plausible chemical explanation for the observations.\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they cannot be distinguished by ¹H NMR (they would show a single set of peaks) or by a standard (achiral) LC column (they would co-elute as a single peak). This option is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data.\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. This occurs when a molecule has two or more stereocenters, and the configuration differs at one or more, but not all, of them.\n        *   **Properties:** Diastereoisomers have different physical properties (e.g., melting points, boiling points, solubility) and different chemical properties.\n        *   **NMR:** Because they are chemically distinct molecules, they will have different NMR spectra. It is expected that corresponding protons (like the alpha-proton) in two diastereomers would have different chemical shifts, leading to two separate peaks. A 1:1 mixture would give peaks of equal integrals. This matches the NMR data perfectly.\n        *   **LC-MS:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereoisomers can be separated by standard (achiral) chromatography. This would result in two separate peaks in the LC chromatogram. As they are isomers, they have the same molecular formula and thus the same mass, which would lead to identical mass spectra for both peaks. This also matches the LC-MS data perfectly.\n        *   **Context:** In peptide synthesis, a common side reaction is the epimerization (racemization) of the alpha-carbon of an amino acid during the coupling step, especially under harsh conditions. If one amino acid in a peptide epimerizes, it creates a diastereomer of the original peptide. For example, if L-Ala-L-Val is synthesized, some epimerization at the alanine residue would produce D-Ala-L-Val. These two molecules are diastereomers. This is a very common problem in peptide chemistry and a classic explanation for this set of analytical data.\n    *   **D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor (a starting material or an intermediate) would almost certainly have a different molecular formula and therefore a different molecular weight than the final product. The mass spectrometry data shows that both peaks have the same mass, which is that of the *expected molecule*. This directly contradicts the possibility of a precursor contaminant.\n\n*   **Step 3: Conclude the most likely explanation.**\n    The presence of a mixture of diastereomers is the only explanation that is fully consistent with all the evidence: two distinct species that are separable by LC, have the same mass, and are distinguishable by NMR in an achiral environment.\n\n<<<C>>>"
