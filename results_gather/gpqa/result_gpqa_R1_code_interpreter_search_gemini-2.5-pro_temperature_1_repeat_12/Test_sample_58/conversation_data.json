    "This problem requires calculating the pH of a solution made by mixing a weak acid (CH3COOH), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)2). The calculation involves stoichiometry to determine the final composition of the solution after neutralization reactions.\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of each reactant.**\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = Volume × Concentration = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.050 mol\n\n*   **Moles of H+ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of HCl = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.080 mol\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely: HCl → H+ + Cl-.\n    *   Moles of H+ = 0.080 mol\n\n*   **Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that dissociates to yield two hydroxide ions per formula unit: Ba(OH)2 → Ba2+ + 2OH-.\n    *   Moles of OH- = 2 × Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol\n\n**2. Perform the neutralization reactions.**\n\nFirst, the strong acid (H+ from HCl) will react with the strong base (OH- from Ba(OH)2).\n\n*   Reaction: H+ + OH- → H2O\n*   Initial moles of H+ = 0.080 mol\n*   Initial moles of OH- = 0.180 mol\n*   Since there are more moles of OH- than H+, the H+ will be completely consumed.\n*   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\nNext, the remaining strong base (OH-) will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   Reaction: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O\n*   Initial moles of CH3COOH = 0.050 mol\n*   Moles of OH- available = 0.100 mol\n*   The weak acid (CH3COOH) is the limiting reactant and will be completely consumed.\n*   Moles of OH- remaining (in excess) = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\nAfter all reactions, the solution contains a significant amount of excess strong base (OH-). The pH of the solution will be determined by the concentration of this excess OH-.\n\n**3. Calculate the final concentration of OH- and the pH.**\n\n*   **Total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L\n\n*   **Concentration of excess OH-:**\n    *   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n    *   [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log10([OH-])\n    *   pOH = -log10(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    *   The relationship between pH and pOH is: pH + pOH = 14\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe final pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<A>>>"
