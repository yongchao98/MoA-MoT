    "An organic compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral, meaning its molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Let's analyze each of the given compounds for chirality.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   This is a biphenyl compound. Biphenyls can exhibit a type of chirality called atropisomerism if there is restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings.\n    *   Rotation is restricted when there are bulky substituents at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6').\n    *   In this molecule, the ortho positions are substituted with large groups: nitro groups (-NO2) at positions 6 and 6', and dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3) at positions 2 and 2'.\n    *   These bulky groups prevent the two phenyl rings from becoming coplanar, locking the molecule into a twisted conformation.\n    *   This twisted molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   Therefore, it is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   The chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group, -OH).\n    *   This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  a hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  a hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  a methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   A carbon atom bonded to four different groups is a chiral center (or asymmetric carbon).\n    *   The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral.\n    *   Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    *   The chemical structure is a central carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings (C₆H₅). The formula is (C₆H₅)₂CO.\n    *   This molecule possesses elements of symmetry. For instance, a plane of symmetry can pass through the carbon and oxygen atoms of the carbonyl group and bisect the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   A molecule that has a plane of symmetry is achiral and cannot be optically active.\n    *   Therefore, benzophenone does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, and it has a *trans* configuration around the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   The molecule is planar. Any planar molecule possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself), which makes it achiral.\n    *   Additionally, dimethyl fumarate has a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the C=C bond.\n    *   The presence of a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion means the molecule is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, only compounds 1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate) and 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) are chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n<<<B>>>"
