    "This problem asks for the energy and degeneracy of the third excited state of a three-dimensional isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator.\n\n### 1. Understanding the System\n\nThe potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" means the potential is the same in all directions, depending only on the distance from the origin, $r$.\n\nThe Hamiltonian for this system can be separated into three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators in Cartesian coordinates $(x, y, z)$:\n$H = H_x + H_y + H_z = \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2x^2\\right) + \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2y^2\\right) + \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2z^2\\right)$\n\n### 2. Energy Eigenvalues\n\nThe energy eigenvalues of a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator are given by $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number for that dimension.\n\nFor the three-dimensional isotropic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the three independent oscillators:\n$E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z}$\n$E = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nLet's define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$. The energy eigenvalues can then be written as:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n### 3. Finding the Third Excited State Energy\n\nThe energy levels are determined by the value of the principal quantum number $n$.\n*   **Ground State:** $n = 0$. Energy $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **First Excited State:** $n = 1$. Energy $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Second Excited State:** $n = 2$. Energy $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Third Excited State:** $n = 3$. Energy $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Degeneracy\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different sets of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that correspond to the same energy. This means we need to find the number of ways we can choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is $n$.\n\nFor the third excited state, we need to find the number of combinations such that $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$. Let's list them:\n1.  One quantum number is 3, the others are 0:\n    *   (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3) - **3 states**\n2.  One quantum number is 2, one is 1, and one is 0:\n    *   (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2) - **6 states**\n3.  All three quantum numbers are 1:\n    *   (1, 1, 1) - **1 state**\n\nThe total number of states (degeneracy) is the sum: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for the degeneracy $g_n$ of the $n$-th energy level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is:\n$g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\nFor the third excited state, $n=3$:\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\nThus, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the energy $E_3 = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy is 10. This corresponds to option C. The energy expressions in options A and D, involving $1/r^2$, are characteristic of a particle in a spherical box (infinite potential well), not a harmonic oscillator.\n\n<<<C>>>"
