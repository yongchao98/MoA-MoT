    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the given reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n    *   The core structure, 7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, is an epoxide fused to a cyclohexane ring (cyclohexene oxide). The bridgehead carbons are C1 and C6, and the oxygen is atom 7.\n    *   There are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   The stereochemistry is given as (1R,3R,4R,6S). We need to determine the 3D structure from this information.\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), also known as a Gilman reagent.\n    *   This reagent acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n    *   The problem provides two key rules for this reaction:\n        1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n        2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The reaction proceeds via an **SN2-type mechanism**, resulting in **inversion of configuration** at the carbon atom that is attacked.\n\n**2. Determine the Structure of the Starting Material**\n\nWe will draw a planar representation of the cyclohexane ring with \"wedge\" (up) and \"dash\" (down) bonds to represent the 3D structure. Let's assume the epoxide oxygen is on the 'up' face (wedge).\n\n*   **Epoxide:** The C1-O and C6-O bonds are 'up' (wedge).\n*   **Stereocenters:** We must assign the orientation of the substituents to match the given (1R,3R,4R,6S) configuration. This requires applying the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n    *   **At C1 (must be R):**\n        *   Substituents: -O-, -C6, -C2, -CH₃.\n        *   CIP Priorities: -O- > -C6 > -C2 > -CH₃. (The path through C6 is higher priority than C2 because C6 is bonded to an oxygen).\n        *   To get an **R** configuration, the lowest priority group (-CH₃) must be 'down' (dash). (Viewing with the dashed -CH₃ away from the observer, the path O → C6 → C2 is clockwise, which is R).\n        *   So, **C1-Me is dash (down)**.\n\n    *   **At C6 (must be S):**\n        *   Substituents: -O-, -C1, -C5, -H.\n        *   CIP Priorities: -O- > -C1 > -C5 > -H.\n        *   The epoxide is 'up', so the H on C6 must be 'down' to maintain the tetrahedral geometry.\n        *   To get an **S** configuration, the lowest priority group (-H) must be 'down' (dash). (Viewing with the dashed -H away, the path O → C1 → C5 is counter-clockwise, which is S).\n        *   So, **C6-H is dash (down)**.\n\n    *   **At C3 (must be R):**\n        *   Substituents: -C2, -C4, -CH₃, -H.\n        *   CIP Priorities: -C2 > -C4 > -CH₃ > -H. (The path through C2 is higher priority than C4 because C2 leads to C1, which is bonded to O, while C4 leads to C5).\n        *   To get an **R** configuration, with the -CH₃ group 'down' (dash), the -H group is 'up' (wedge). (Viewing from the front with the wedged -H towards the observer, the path C2 → C4 → Me is counter-clockwise. Since the lowest priority group is towards the observer, we reverse the assignment to R).\n        *   So, **C3-Me is dash (down)**.\n\n    *   **At C4 (must be R):**\n        *   Substituents: -C5, -C3, -CH₃, -H.\n        *   CIP Priorities: -C5 > -C3 > -CH₃ > -H.\n        *   To get an **R** configuration, the lowest priority group (-H) must be 'down' (dash), making the -CH₃ group 'up' (wedge). (Viewing with the dashed -H away, the path C5 → C3 → Me is clockwise, which is R).\n        *   So, **C4-Me is wedge (up)**.\n\n**Summary of Starting Material Structure:**\n*   Epoxide oxygen: up (wedge)\n*   C1-Me: down (dash)\n*   C3-Me: down (dash)\n*   C4-Me: up (wedge)\n*   C6-H: down (dash)\n\n**3. Analyze the Reaction Pathway**\n\n*   **Step 1 (Attack):** The Me⁻ nucleophile attacks the less hindered carbon of the epoxide. C1 has a methyl group, while C6 has a hydrogen atom. Therefore, **attack occurs at C6**.\n*   **Step 2 (Inversion):** The attack is backside, relative to the C-O bond. Since the C6-O bond is 'up' (wedge), the Me⁻ attacks from the 'down' (dash) side. This causes inversion at C6. The original 'down' hydrogen at C6 is pushed to an 'up' position.\n*   **Step 3 (Ring Opening & Protonation):** The C6-O bond breaks. The electrons move to the oxygen, which remains attached to C1. A subsequent aqueous workup (implied) protonates the resulting O⁻ to form an -OH group. The stereochemistry at C1, C3, and C4 is unaffected.\n\n**4. Determine the Product Structure**\n\nBased on the reaction mechanism:\n*   At original **C1**: The -OH group is 'up' (wedge). The -Me group remains 'down' (dash).\n*   At original **C6**: The new -Me group from the cuprate is 'down' (dash). The -H atom is now 'up' (wedge).\n*   At original **C3**: The -Me group remains 'down' (dash).\n*   At original **C4**: The -Me group remains 'up' (wedge).\n\n**5. Name the Product and Assign Stereochemistry**\n\n*   **IUPAC Name:**\n    *   The principal functional group is the alcohol, so the carbon it's attached to (original C1) becomes **new C1**.\n    *   To give the substituents the lowest possible numbers, we number the ring counter-clockwise.\n    *   New C1 = Original C1\n    *   New C2 = Original C6\n    *   New C4 = Original C4\n    *   New C5 = Original C3\n    *   The methyl groups are at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. The name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options B and C.\n\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   **New C1 (Original C1):** No reaction occurred at this center. Its configuration is retained. It was **R** in the starting material. So, C1 is **1R**.\n    *   **New C2 (Original C6):** Inversion of configuration occurred. However, because the substituents change (O is replaced by Me), we must re-determine the configuration from the product structure rather than simply flipping 'S' to 'R'.\n        *   Substituents: -C1, -C3, -Me, -H. Priorities: C1(OH) > C3 > Me > H.\n        *   Arrangement: H is 'up' (wedge), which is the lowest priority group.\n        *   Viewing from H towards C2, the sequence of the other groups (C1 → C3 → Me) is clockwise.\n        *   Since the lowest priority group is pointing towards us, we reverse the result. Clockwise → **S**. So, C2 is **2S**.\n    *   **New C4 (Original C4):** Configuration is retained. It was **R**. So, C4 is **4R**.\n    *   **New C5 (Original C3):** Configuration is retained. It was **R**. So, C5 is **5R**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe final product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
