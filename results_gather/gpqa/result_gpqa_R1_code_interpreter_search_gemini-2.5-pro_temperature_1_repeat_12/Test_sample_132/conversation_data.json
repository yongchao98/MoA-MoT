    "This problem requires a step-by-step calculation of ion concentrations in a buffer solution.\n\n**1. Understand the System:**\nThe solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4●2H2O.\n*   KH2PO4 dissociates completely in water to give K+ and H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate).\n*   Na2HPO4●2H2O dissociates completely to give 2 Na+, HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and 2 H2O.\nThis creates a buffer solution composed of the weak acid H2PO4- and its conjugate base HPO4^2-.\n\n**2. Calculate Initial Molar Concentrations:**\nFirst, we calculate the number of moles of each phosphate species.\n*   Moles of KH2PO4 = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 moles. This gives 0.007348 moles of H2PO4-.\n*   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 moles. This gives 0.005618 moles of HPO4^2-.\n\nNext, we calculate the molar concentrations using the total volume of the solution (200.00 cm3 = 0.20000 L).\n*   [H2PO4-] = 0.007348 moles / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n*   [HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 moles / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**3. Determine the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H+]:**\nThe primary equilibrium governing the pH of this buffer is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid:\nH2PO4-  <=>  H+ + HPO4^2-      (Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8)\n\nWe can rearrange the equilibrium expression to solve for [H+]:\nKa2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n[H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\n\nAssuming the initial concentrations are a good approximation of the equilibrium concentrations (which is valid for a buffer), we can plug in the values:\n[H+] = (6.2x10^-8) * (0.03674 M) / (0.02809 M)\n[H+] ≈ 8.10x10^-8 M\n\n**4. Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion [PO4^3-] Concentration:**\nThe orthophosphate ion (PO4^3-) is formed from the third dissociation of phosphoric acid:\nHPO4^2-  <=>  H+ + PO4^3-      (Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12)\n\nWe rearrange this equilibrium expression to solve for [PO4^3-]:\nKa3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n[PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\n\nNow, we use the concentrations we have calculated. We use the concentration of HPO4^2- from step 2 and the [H+] from step 3.\n[PO4^3-] = (1.8x10^-12) * (0.02809 M) / (8.10x10^-8 M)\n[PO4^3-] ≈ 6.24x10^-7 M\n\nTo verify the calculations, we can use a computational approach.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given Values ---\n# Masses and Molar Weights\nmass_kh2po4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_kh2po4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_na2hpo4_2h2o = 1.00  # g\nmw_na2hpo4_2h2o = 177.99  # g/mol\n\n# Solution Volume\nvolume_L = 200.00 / 1000  # L\n\n# Dissociation Constants\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate moles ---\nmoles_h2po4_minus = mass_kh2po4 / mw_kh2po4\nmoles_hpo4_2minus = mass_na2hpo4_2h2o / mw_na2hpo4_2h2o\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate initial concentrations ---\nconc_h2po4_minus = moles_h2po4_minus / volume_L\nconc_hpo4_2minus = moles_hpo4_2minus / volume_L\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculate [H+] using the buffer equilibrium (Ka2) ---\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\nH_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_h2po4_minus / conc_hpo4_2minus)\n\n# --- Step 4: Calculate [PO4^3-] using the third dissociation (Ka3) ---\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\nconc_po4_3minus = (Ka3 * conc_hpo4_2minus) / H_plus_conc\n\nprint(f\"{conc_po4_3minus:.2e}\")\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",

Recognize the buffer system and the relevant equilibrium.**\n*   The solution contains a weak acid (H₂PO₄⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻).

Calculate the concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻).**\n*   The orthophosphate ion is formed from the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻):\n    HPO₄²⁻  ⇌  H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n*   The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹².\n*   The equilibrium expression is:\n    Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n*   We rearrange this to solve for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, [PO₄³⁻]:\n    [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n*   Now, we substitute the known values: the initial concentration of [HPO₄²⁻] and the calculated concentration of [H⁺].\n    [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11x10⁻⁸ M)\n    [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.24x10⁻⁷ M.\n\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is approximately 6.24x10⁻⁷ M, which corresponds to option B.\n\nThe provided Python code execution confirms this calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given Values ---\n# Masses and Molar Weights\nmass_kh2po4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_kh2po4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_na2hpo4_2h2o = 1.00  # g\nmw_na2hpo4_2h2o = 177.99  # g/mol\n\n# Solution Volume\nvolume_L = 200.00 / 1000  # L\n\n# Dissociation Constants\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate moles ---\nmoles_h2po4_minus = mass_kh2po4 / mw_kh2po4\nmoles_hpo4_2minus = mass_na2hpo4_2h2o / mw_na2hpo4_2h2o\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate initial concentrations ---\nconc_h2po4_minus = moles_h2po4_minus / volume_L\nconc_hpo4_2minus = moles_hpo4_2minus / volume_L\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculate [H+] using the buffer equilibrium (Ka2) ---\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\nH_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_h2po4_minus / conc_hpo4_2minus)\n\n# --- Step 4: Calculate [PO4^3-] using the third dissociation (Ka3) ---\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\nconc_po4_3minus = (Ka3 * conc_hpo4_2minus) / H_plus_conc\n\nprint(f\"{conc_po4_3minus:.2e}\")\n```\n<<<B>>>",
