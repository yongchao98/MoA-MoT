    "To determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to find the mutation that would most severely disrupt the function of the protein encoded by the gene. The most effective way to \"knock out\" a gene's function is to cause a major disruption in the protein structure, such as by creating a truncated protein or altering the entire amino acid sequence after the mutation point.\n\nLet's analyze the genetic code and the effect of each mutation. The genetic code is read in triplets called codons, and each codon specifies an amino acid (or a stop signal). The process starts at the `ATG` start codon.\n\n**Intact Gene:**\nSequence: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...-3’\nTranslation:\n*   `ATG` -> Methionine (Start)\n*   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine\n*   `CTC` -> Leucine\n*   `GCT` -> Alanine\n*   `GGT` -> Glycine\n*   ...and so on.\nThe resulting protein starts with: **Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly...**\n\nNow let's examine each mutant:\n\n**Mutant 1:**\nSequence: 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...-3’\n*   `ATG` -> Methionine (Same as intact)\n*   `TTC` -> Phenylalanine (The change from TTT to TTC is a **silent mutation** as both code for Phenylalanine).\n*   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (The change from CTC to TAC is a **missense mutation**, changing the amino acid from Leucine to Tyrosine).\n*   The rest of the sequence is the same.\nThe resulting protein would be **Met-Phe-Tyr-Ala-Gly...** This changes one amino acid. While this could potentially affect protein function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it entirely.\n\n**Mutant 2:**\nSequence: 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...-3’\n*   `ATG` -> Methionine\n*   `TTC` -> Phenylalanine\n*   `TAA` -> **STOP**\nThis is a **nonsense mutation**. The codon `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAA`, which is a stop codon. This will cause the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely. The resulting product would be a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe). This peptide is almost certain to be non-functional. This is the most effective way to eliminate the protein's function.\n\n**Mutant 3:**\nSequence: 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT...-3’\n*   `ATG` -> Methionine\n*   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine\n*   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Missesnse mutation: Leucine -> Tyrosine)\n*   `GCT` -> Alanine\n*   `GGT` -> Glycine\n*   `GTC` -> Valine (Missesnse mutation: Threonine (ACT) -> Valine (GTC))\nThis mutant has two missense mutations. While two amino acid changes are more likely to be disruptive than one, the protein is still produced at its full length, and there's no guarantee of a complete loss of function.\n\n**Mutant 4:**\nSequence: 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...-3’\n*   Comparing to the intact sequence (`...CTC GCT GGT ACT...`), we can see that the `GGT` codon has been deleted, and the `CTC` codon has been changed to `TAC`.\n*   `ATG` -> Methionine\n*   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine\n*   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Missesnse mutation: Leucine -> Tyrosine)\n*   `GCT` -> Alanine\n*   `ACT` -> Threonine (The `GGT` codon for Glycine is missing)\nThis is an **in-frame deletion** of one amino acid (Glycine) plus a missense mutation. The reading frame is maintained, so the rest of the protein is translated correctly, but it will be missing one amino acid and have another one substituted. This is disruptive but generally less so than a premature stop codon.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe mutation in **Mutant 2** introduces a premature stop codon very early in the sequence. This leads to the production of a severely truncated and non-functional protein. This is the most definitive way among the given options to eliminate the activity of the gene product.\n\n<<<B>>>"
