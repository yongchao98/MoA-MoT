    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the physical system and the operator**\n\nThe problem asks for an eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ for a muon. A muon is a spin-1/2 particle. The operator $\\vec{P}$ is given by its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$.\n\n$P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThese are the standard components of the spin angular momentum operator $\\vec{S} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\vec{\\sigma}$, where $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ are the Pauli matrices. The problem uses the symbol $\\vec{P}$ for the spin operator.\n\n**2. Define the operator for the specific direction**\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector of the operator along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ that lies in the x-z plane. A unit vector $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane can be parameterized by a single angle $\\theta$ with respect to the z-axis. In spherical coordinates, this corresponds to setting the azimuthal angle $\\phi=0$.\n\nThe unit vector is $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n\nThe operator corresponding to the spin component in the direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_n = \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{P}$:\n\n$P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z$\n$P_n = (\\sin\\theta) P_x + (0) P_y + (\\cos\\theta) P_z$\n$P_n = \\sin\\theta \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) + \\cos\\theta \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\right)$\n\nFactoring out $\\hbar/2$ and combining the matrices:\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**3. Set up and solve the eigenvalue equation**\n\nWe are looking for the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$. The eigenvalue equation is:\n\n$P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$\n$\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nWe can cancel the constant factor $\\hbar/2$ from both sides of the equation:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis matrix equation represents a system of two linear equations:\n1) $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n2) $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\nLet's solve for the relationship between $a$ and $b$ using the first equation:\n$b \\sin\\theta = a - a \\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n\nNow, we use the half-angle trigonometric identities:\n$\\sin\\theta = 2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)$\n$1 - \\cos\\theta = 2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n\nSubstituting these into our equation:\n$b \\cdot (2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)) = a \\cdot (2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2))$\n\nAssuming $\\theta \\neq 0$ (so that $\\sin(\\theta/2) \\neq 0$), we can divide both sides by $2 \\sin(\\theta/2)$:\n$b \\cos(\\theta/2) = a \\sin(\\theta/2)$\n\nThis gives the ratio of the components:\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\nSo, the eigenvector is proportional to the vector $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$. We can write the unnormalized eigenvector as $|\\psi\\rangle = C \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$ for some normalization constant $C$.\n\n**4. Normalize the eigenvector**\n\nThe normalization condition requires that the inner product of the state vector with itself is 1, i.e., $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$.\nFor our eigenvector, this is:\n$\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = \\left( C^* \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) & \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\left( C \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = 1$\n$|C|^2 (\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2)) = 1$\nUsing the fundamental trigonometric identity $\\cos^2(x) + \\sin^2(x) = 1$:\n$|C|^2 (1) = 1 \\implies |C| = 1$\n\nWe can choose the simplest normalization constant, $C=1$.\nTherefore, the normalized eigenvector is:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe elements of this eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n**5. Compare with the given options**\n\nThe calculated elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. This matches option D.\n\n*   A) $(\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta))$ - Incorrect, uses $\\theta$ instead of $\\theta/2$.\n*   B) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)$ - Incorrect, eigenvector components should be dimensionless, not containing $\\hbar$.\n*   C) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2))$ - Incorrect for the same reason as B.\n*   D) $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))$ - This matches our result.\n\n<<<D>>>"
