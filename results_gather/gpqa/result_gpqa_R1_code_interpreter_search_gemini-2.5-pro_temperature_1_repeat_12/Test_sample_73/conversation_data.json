    "This is a classic conditional probability problem related to exponential decay. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n**1. Understand the Nature of Radioactive Decay**\nRadioactive decay is a memoryless process. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. The fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not change its intrinsic probability of decaying in the next instant.\n\n**2. Define the Probability of Decay**\nThe probability of an atom decaying by a certain time *t* is given by the formula:\nP(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\nwhere:\n*   P(t) is the probability of decay by time *t*.\n*   λ (lambda) is the decay constant, a characteristic of the specific atom.\n*   *t* is the time elapsed.\n\nThe probability of an atom *not* decaying (surviving) by time *t* is:\nS(t) = e^(-λt)\n\n**3. Calculate the Decay Constant (λ)**\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32). We can use this information to find the decay constant λ.\n\nP(100) = 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for e^(-λ * 100):\ne^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32\ne^(-λ * 100) = 0.68\n\nTo find λ, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n-λ * 100 = ln(0.68)\nλ = -ln(0.68) / 100\n\nNow, let's compute the value of λ.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We are given P(decay in 100 min) = 0.32\n# P(t) = 1 - exp(-lambda * t)\n# 0.32 = 1 - exp(-lambda * 100)\n# exp(-lambda * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n# -lambda * 100 = ln(0.68)\n# lambda = -ln(0.68) / 100\n\nlambda_val = -math.log(0.68) / 100\n\n# We need to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given it has survived 50 minutes.\n# Due to the memoryless property of exponential decay, this is equivalent to the probability of a new atom decaying in 150 minutes.\n# P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - exp(-lambda * 150)\n\nprob_decay_150 = 1 - math.exp(-lambda_val * 150)\n\n# The final answer as a percentage\nprob_percent = prob_decay_150 * 100\n\nprint(f\"{prob_percent:.0f}%\")\n```\n\n**4. Calculate the Desired Probability**\nThe question asks for the probability that the atom will decay in the *next* 150 minutes, given it has already survived for 50 minutes. Because of the memoryless property, this is simply the probability that a new atom of the same type would decay within 150 minutes.\n\nWe use the formula P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt) with t = 150 minutes and the value of λ we just found.\n\nP(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\nSubstituting the expression for λ:\nP(150) = 1 - e^([-ln(0.68) / 100] * 150)\nP(150) = 1 - e^(ln(0.68) * -1.5)\nP(150) = 1 - (e^ln(0.68))^(-1.5)\nP(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5\nP(150) ≈ 1 - 0.559\nP(150) ≈ 0.441\n\n**5. Final Answer**\nThe probability is approximately 0.441, which corresponds to 44.1%. The closest answer is 44%.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Underlying Principle: Memoryless Property**\n\nRadioactive decay is a stochastic process that follows an exponential distribution. A key feature of this distribution is that it is **memoryless**. This means the probability of an event (decay) occurring in a future time interval is independent of how much time has already elapsed. In simpler terms, the atom doesn't \"age\" or \"get tired.\" The fact that it has survived for 50 minutes has no bearing on its probability of decaying in the next minute, hour, or day.\n\nTherefore, the probability of the atom decaying in the *next* 150 minutes, given it has survived for 50 minutes, is exactly the same as the probability of a brand-new atom of the same type decaying within 150 minutes.\n\n**2. Model the Decay Probability**\n\nThe probability of an atom *not* decaying by a certain time *t* is given by the survival function:\nS(t) = e^(-λt)\n\nThe probability of an atom decaying by time *t* is:\nP(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\nHere, λ (lambda) is the decay constant, a value specific to the type of atom.\n\n**3. Calculate the Decay Constant (λ)**\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32). We can use this information to find λ.\n\n*   P(100) = 0.32\n*   1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32\n*   e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32\n*   e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68\n\nTo solve for λ, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\n*   -λ * 100 = ln(0.68)\n*   λ = -ln(0.68) / 100\n\nWe don't need to calculate the exact numerical value of λ yet; we can use this expression in the next step.\n\n**4. Calculate the Desired Probability**\n\nWe need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. As explained by the memoryless property, this is equivalent to P(150).\n\n*   P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\nNow, substitute the expression for λ we found in the previous step:\n\n*   P(150) = 1 - e^([-ln(0.68) / 100] * 150)\n*   P(150) = 1 - e^([ln(0.68)] * [-150 / 100])\n*   P(150) = 1 - e^(ln(0.68) * 1.5)\n\nUsing the logarithm property that `a * ln(b) = ln(b^a)` and that `e^ln(x) = x`:\n\n*   P(150) = 1 - (e^ln(0.68))^1.5\n*   P(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5\n\nCalculating the final value:\n\n*   (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.559\n*   P(150) ≈ 1 - 0.559\n*   P(150) ≈ 0.441\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes is approximately 0.441, or 44.1%. This corresponds to option D. The Python code executed confirmed this calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
