    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Aperture Shape:** An N-sided regular polygon.\n    *   **Geometric Constraint:** All apothems are of the same length 'a'. An apothem is the line segment from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon, all apothems are equal. This length 'a' is essentially the radius of the inscribed circle of the polygon.\n    *   **Limiting Case:** The number of sides, N, is infinitely large (N → ∞).\n    *   **Physics Setup:** Fraunhofer (far-field) diffraction of monochromatic light (wavelength λ) incident normally on the aperture.\n    *   **Approximation:** Small angle approximation (sin θ ≈ tan θ ≈ θ) is valid.\n    *   **Objective:** Find the angular distance between the first two intensity minima in the diffraction pattern.\n\n2.  **Determine the Shape in the Limiting Case:**\n    *   Consider a regular N-sided polygon. The apothem 'a' is the radius of the inscribed circle. The distance from the center to a vertex is the radius of the circumscribed circle.\n    *   As the number of sides N increases and approaches infinity, the polygon itself will more and more closely resemble its inscribed circle.\n    *   Therefore, for N → ∞, the N-sided polygon with a constant apothem 'a' becomes a perfect circle of radius r = a.\n\n3.  **Identify the Relevant Diffraction Pattern:**\n    *   The problem now simplifies to finding the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture.\n    *   The far-field (Fraunhofer) diffraction pattern of a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern. It consists of a bright central disk (the Airy disk) surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings.\n    *   The dark rings correspond to the intensity minima.\n\n4.  **Recall the Formula for Minima of a Circular Aperture:**\n    *   The angular positions (θ) of the minima in an Airy pattern are given by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x).\n    *   The intensity is proportional to `[2 * J₁(x) / x]²`, where `x = k * r * sin(θ)`.\n    *   Here, `r` is the radius of the aperture, and `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π / λ`.\n    *   Minima occur when the numerator `J₁(x)` is zero. So, we need `J₁(k * r * sin(θ)) = 0`.\n    *   This condition is met when the argument `x = k * r * sin(θ)` is equal to one of the non-zero roots of J₁(x). Let's call these roots `zₙ` (where n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n    *   So, the condition for the n-th minimum is: `k * r * sin(θₙ) = zₙ`.\n\n5.  **Apply the Specifics of the Problem:**\n    *   Substitute `k = 2π / λ` and `r = a` (from step 2) into the condition:\n        `(2π / λ) * a * sin(θₙ) = zₙ`\n    *   Rearrange to solve for `sin(θₙ)`:\n        `sin(θₙ) = zₙ * λ / (2π * a)`\n    *   Using the small angle approximation (`sin(θₙ) ≈ θₙ`):\n        `θₙ = (zₙ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n6.  **Find the Required Numerical Values:**\n    *   We need the angular positions of the *first* and *second* minima. This requires the first two non-zero roots of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n    *   These are well-known values:\n        *   First root, z₁ ≈ 3.8317\n        *   Second root, z₂ ≈ 7.0156\n    *   The angular position of the first minimum (n=1) is:\n        `θ₁ = (z₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ (3.8317 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)`\n    *   The angular position of the second minimum (n=2) is:\n        `θ₂ = (z₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ (7.0156 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   The question asks for the angular distance *between* the first two minima, which is Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁.\n    *   Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = `[(z₂ / (2π)) - (z₁ / (2π))] * (λ / a)`\n    *   Δθ = `[(z₂ - z₁) / (2π)] * (λ / a)`\n    *   Δθ ≈ `[(7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π)] * (λ / a)`\n    *   Δθ ≈ `[3.1839 / (2π)] * (λ / a)`\n    *   Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)\n\n8.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) 0.610 λ / a  (This is the position of the *first* minimum, θ₁, not the distance between minima)\n    *   B) 0.506 λ / a  (This matches our calculated value)\n    *   C) 1.220 λ / a  (This is related to the Rayleigh criterion for a diameter 'a', which is incorrect; the diameter is 2a)\n    *   D) 0.500 λ / a  (This is a close but less accurate approximation)\n\n9.  **Use Python for a Precise Calculation (Self-Correction/Verification):**\n    To ensure the accuracy of the Bessel function roots and the final calculation, a short Python script can be used.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.special import jn_zeros\n\n# The problem simplifies to finding the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n# The angular positions of the minima are given by theta_n = (z_n / (2 * pi)) * (lambda / a),\n# where z_n are the non-zero roots of the first-order Bessel function, J1(x).\n\n# We need the first two non-zero roots of J1(x).\n# jn_zeros(1, 2) returns the first 2 roots of J1.\nz1, z2 = jn_zeros(1, 2)\n\n# The angular distance between the first two minima is Delta_theta = theta_2 - theta_1.\n# Delta_theta = [ (z2 / (2*pi)) - (z1 / (2*pi)) ] * (lambda / a)\n# Delta_theta = ( (z2 - z1) / (2 * np.pi) ) * (lambda / a)\n\n# Calculate the coefficient (z2 - z1) / (2 * pi).\ncoefficient = (z2 - z1) / (2 * np.pi)\n\n# Print the coefficient rounded to three decimal places to compare with the options.\nprint(f\"{coefficient:.3f}\")\n```\n\n> Execution output:\n> 0.507\n\nThe calculated coefficient is 0.507 (or 0.5067 without rounding), which corresponds to the expression `0.506 λ / a` in option B. The slight difference is due to rounding in the option.\n\nFinal conclusion is that option B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "An N-sided polygon with a constant apothem `a` approaches a circle of radius `r = a` as the number of sides `N` tends to infinity. The apothem of the polygon becomes the radius of the circle in this limit.\n\nTherefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius `a`. The diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern. It consists of a central bright disk (the Airy disk) surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings. The dark rings correspond to the minima of intensity.\n\nThe angular positions `θ` of the minima are given by the condition:\n`sin(θ) = C * λ / D`\nwhere `D` is the diameter of the aperture (`D = 2a`), `λ` is the wavelength of the light, and `C` is a constant that depends on the order of the minimum.\n\nMore formally, the condition for the n-th minimum is given by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, `J₁(x)`. The intensity is zero when `J₁(k * a * sin(θ))` is zero, where `k = 2π/λ` is the wave number.\n\nLet `z_n` be the n-th non-zero root of `J₁(x)`. The condition for the n-th minimum is:\n`k * a * sin(θ_n) = z_n`\n`(2π / λ) * a * sin(θ_n) = z_n`\n\nUsing the small angle approximation (`sin(θ) ≈ θ`), we can solve for the angular position `θ_n`:\n`θ_n = (z_n / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\nTo find the angular distance between the first two minima, we need the first two non-zero roots of `J₁(x)`:\n*   First root: `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second root: `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nNow, we can find the angular positions of the first and second minima:\n*   Angular position of the first minimum:\n    `θ₁ = (z₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ (3.8317 / (2 * 3.14159)) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)`\n\n*   Angular position of the second minimum:\n    `θ₂ = (z₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ (7.0156 / (2 * 3.14159)) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)`\n\nThe angular distance between these two minima is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`:\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = ( (z₂ - z₁) / (2π) ) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ ( (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π) ) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ ( 3.1839 / (2π) ) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 0.610 λ / a (This is the position of the first minimum, `θ₁`)\nB) 0.506 λ / a (This matches our calculation)\nC) 1.220 λ /a (This is 2 * `θ₁`, related to the diameter of the Airy disk)\nD) 0.500 λ / a\n\nThe calculated value `0.5067 * (λ / a)` is best represented by option B. The python code output of `0.507` also confirms this result.\n\n<<<B>>>"
