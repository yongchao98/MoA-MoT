    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial setup:** We have a neutral, spherical conductor with a cavity. A positive charge $+q$ is placed inside this cavity. We need to find the electric field at a point P outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Apply the principle of charge induction:** The positive charge $+q$ inside the cavity will attract negative charges within the conductor. In electrostatic equilibrium, these charges will move to the surface of the cavity. According to Gauss's Law, if we draw a Gaussian surface inside the conducting material enclosing the cavity, the electric field must be zero. For the field to be zero, the net charge enclosed must be zero. Therefore, a total charge of $-q$ must be induced on the inner wall of the cavity to cancel out the $+q$ charge inside it.\n\n3.  **Consider the overall charge of the conductor:** The conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral). Since a charge of $-q$ has moved to the inner surface, to maintain charge conservation, a charge of $+q$ must appear on the outer surface of the conductor. This is because the total charge of the conductor must remain zero.\n\n4.  **Analyze the distribution of charge on the outer surface:** The charge $+q$ on the outer surface will distribute itself to reach electrostatic equilibrium. Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere and there are no other external charges mentioned in the problem, this charge $+q$ will spread out uniformly over the entire outer surface. The complex arrangement inside the cavity (the position of the charge $+q$, the shape and position of the cavity) does not affect the charge distribution on the outer surface. This is the principle of electrostatic shielding â€“ the conductor's bulk shields the outer surface from the electrostatic details of the interior.\n\n5.  **Calculate the electric field at point P:** The electric field at any point outside the conductor is the field produced by the charge on its outer surface. We have a total charge of $+q$ distributed uniformly on a spherical surface of radius $R$. According to the Shell Theorem (a result of Gauss's Law), the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field produced by a single point charge of the same total magnitude, located at the center of the sphere.\n\n6.  **Formulate the final expression:**\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is $+q$.\n    *   This charge acts as if it's a point charge located at the center of the spherical conductor.\n    *   The point P is at a distance $L$ from the center of the spherical conductor.\n    *   Using Coulomb's Law for a point charge, the magnitude of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ at point P is:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Evaluate the given options:**\n    *   A) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect. This involves details of the cavity's position, which are shielded.\n    *   B) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ - Incorrect. Same reason as A.\n    *   C) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ - Correct. This matches our derivation based on fundamental principles.\n    *   D) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ - Incorrect. This would be the field if the charge were at the cavity's center and there was no conductor.\n\nThe information about the cavity's radius ($r$), its displacement from the center ($s$), the distance from the cavity's center to P ($l$), and the angle $\\theta$ are all distractors intended to test the understanding of electrostatic shielding.\n\n<<<C>>>"
