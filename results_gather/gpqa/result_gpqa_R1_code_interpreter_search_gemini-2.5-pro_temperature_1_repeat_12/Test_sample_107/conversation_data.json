    "The user wants to compare the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling energy with a specific atomic transition energy.\n\n**1. Calculate the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy (`<H>`)**\n\nThe paramagnetic coupling term, also known as the Zeeman effect energy, describes the interaction of an atom's magnetic moment with an external magnetic field. The energy shift is given by the formula:\n\n$$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = m \\mu_B B $$\n\nWhere:\n*   `m` is the orbital magnetic quantum number. The problem states to use \"small values of m\", so we will use `m=1` for this order-of-magnitude calculation.\n*   `B` is the magnitude of the external magnetic field, given as `B = 1 T`.\n*   `\\mu_B` is the Bohr magneton, a physical constant.\n\nThe value of the Bohr magneton is:\n$$ \\mu_B = 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J/T} $$\n\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = (1) \\times (9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J/T}) \\times (1 \\, \\text{T}) = 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J} $$\n\nTo make the comparison easier, we can convert this energy to electron-volts (eV). The conversion factor is `1 eV = 1.602 x 10⁻¹⁹ J`.\n$$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\frac{9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J}}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J/eV}} \\approx 5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV} $$\n\nSo, the paramagnetic coupling energy is on the order of `10⁻⁵ eV`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Transition Energy (`ΔE`)**\n\nThe transition energy corresponds to the energy of a photon with a given wavelength. The formula relating energy and wavelength is:\n\n$$ \\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} $$\n\nWhere:\n*   `h` is Planck's constant, `h = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J·s}`.\n*   `c` is the speed of light, `c = 3.00 \\times 10^{8} \\, \\text{m/s}`.\n*   `\\lambda` is the wavelength of the light, given as `λ = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}`.\n\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ \\Delta E = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J·s}) \\times (3.00 \\times 10^{8} \\, \\text{m/s})}{0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}} \\approx 4.089 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J} $$\n\nAgain, converting to electron-volts (eV):\n$$ \\Delta E = \\frac{4.089 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J}}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J/eV}} \\approx 2.55 \\, \\text{eV} $$\n\nThis wavelength, `486.1 nm`, corresponds to the Balmer series (n=4 to n=2 transition) in the Hydrogen atom, which is a typical visible light transition with energy on the order of a few eV.\n\n**3. Compare the Magnitudes**\n\nNow we compare the two energy values:\n*   Paramagnetic coupling energy: `⟨H⟩ ≈ 5.79 x 10⁻⁵ eV`\n*   Atomic transition energy: `ΔE ≈ 2.55 eV`\n\nLet's find the ratio:\n$$ \\frac{\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}}{2.55 \\, \\text{eV}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5} $$\n\nThis ratio is very small, which means the paramagnetic coupling energy is many orders of magnitude smaller than the atomic transition energy.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that:\n$$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E $$\n\n<<<C>>>"
