    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Determine the goal:** The primary goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which is T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Write down the formula for equilibrium temperature:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n    where:\n    *   T_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n    *   R_star is the radius of the star.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   A is the planet's Bond albedo.\n\n3.  **Formulate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:** We need to compute the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq1 = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_1))^(1/2) * (1 - A_1)^(1/4)\n    T_eq2 = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_2))^(1/2) * (1 - A_2)^(1/4)\n\n    The ratio is:\n    (T_eq1 / T_eq2) = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_1))^(1/2) * (1 - A_1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_2))^(1/2) * (1 - A_2)^(1/4)]\n\n    The problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are the same for both equations. It also states that both planets have the same albedo (A_1 = A_2). Therefore, these terms cancel out.\n\n    (T_eq1 / T_eq2) = [(1 / a_1)^(1/2)] / [(1 / a_2)^(1/2)]\n    (T_eq1 / T_eq2) = (a_2 / a_1)^(1/2) = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n\n    This means the problem is reduced to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes of the two planets.\n\n4.  **Relate the semi-major axis to the given observational data:** The problem provides the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ) for each planet, which is used in the radial velocity (RV) method. The Doppler shift is related to the star's radial velocity (v_r) by:\n    v_r / c = Δλ / λ_0\n    where `c` is the speed of light and λ_0 is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\n    The maximum radial velocity is the semi-amplitude, K.\n    K = (Δλ_max / λ_0) * c\n\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the stellar radial velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's mass (M_p) and semi-major axis (a) by:\n    K = (M_p * sin(i) / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G / a)\n    where M_star is the star's mass, G is the gravitational constant, and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n    Since both planets are detected via the transit method, their orbits must be viewed nearly edge-on, which means the inclination `i` is close to 90° for both. We can assume sin(i) is the same for both and is approximately 1.\n\n5.  **Solve for the semi-major axis 'a':** Rearranging the formula for K to solve for 'a':\n    sqrt(a) = (M_p * sin(i) * sqrt(G)) / (K * sqrt(M_star))\n    a = G * (M_p^2 * sin^2(i)) / (K^2 * M_star)\n\n6.  **Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes (a_2 / a_1):**\n    a_2 / a_1 = [G * (M_p2^2 * sin^2(i)) / (K_2^2 * M_star)] / [G * (M_p1^2 * sin^2(i)) / (K_1^2 * M_star)]\n\n    The terms G, M_star, and sin^2(i) are the same for both and cancel out.\n    a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / K_2^2) / (M_p1^2 / K_1^2)\n    a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2\n\n7.  **Calculate the required ratios from the given data:**\n    *   **Mass ratio (M_p2 / M_p1):**\n        M_p1 = 7 M_earth\n        M_p2 = 5 M_earth\n        M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n\n    *   **Velocity semi-amplitude ratio (K_1 / K_2):**\n        The ratio of K values is directly proportional to the ratio of their maximum Doppler shifts (Δλ_max).\n        K_1 / K_2 = Δλ_max1 / Δλ_max2\n        Δλ_max1 = 0.03 Å\n        Δλ_max2 = 0.04 Å\n        K_1 / K_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n8.  **Substitute these ratios back into the equation for a_2 / a_1:**\n    a_2 / a_1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (3 / 4)^2\n    a_2 / a_1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\n    a_2 / a_1 = 225 / 784\n\n9.  **Calculate the final ratio of equilibrium temperatures:**\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\n10. **Compute the numerical value.**\n```python\n# Given mass and doppler shift ratios\nmass_ratio_p2_to_p1 = 5 / 7\ndoppler_shift_ratio_p1_to_p2 = 3 / 4\n\n# The ratio of semi-major axes a2/a1 is given by:\n# a2/a1 = (M_p2/M_p1)^2 * (K1/K2)^2\n# K1/K2 is the same as the doppler shift ratio\nsemi_major_axis_ratio_a2_to_a1 = (mass_ratio_p2_to_p1)**2 * (doppler_shift_ratio_p1_to_p2)**2\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq1/T_eq2 is given by:\n# T_eq1/T_eq2 = sqrt(a2/a1)\nimport math\ntemp_ratio = math.sqrt(semi_major_axis_ratio_a2_to_a1)\n\nprint(temp_ratio)\n```\n\nThe computed value is approximately 0.5357. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature of a planet (T_eq) is given by the formula:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nwhere T_star is the star's effective temperature, R_star is the star's radius, `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, and `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\nWe need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_1))^(1/2) * (1 - A_1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_2))^(1/2) * (1 - A_2)^(1/4)]\n\nSince the planets orbit the same star (T_star and R_star are the same) and have the same albedo (A_1 = A_2), these terms cancel out:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [(1 / a_1)^(1/2)] / [(1 / a_2)^(1/2)] = (a_2 / a_1)^(1/2)\n\nNow we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, a_2 / a_1. We can do this using the information from the radial velocity (RV) method. The stellar radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n\nK = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star^(1/2)) * (G / a)^(1/2)\n\nwhere M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, `i` is the orbital inclination, and G is the gravitational constant.\n\nBy rearranging this equation to solve for `a`, we get:\n\na = G * (M_p^2 * sin^2(i)) / (K^2 * M_star)\n\nNow we can find the ratio a_2 / a_1:\n\na_2 / a_1 = [G * (M_p2^2 * sin^2(i_2)) / (K_2^2 * M_star)] / [G * (M_p1^2 * sin^2(i_1)) / (K_1^2 * M_star)]\n\nSince both planets were detected by the transit method, their orbital inclinations `i` are close to 90°, so sin(i) ≈ 1 for both. The terms G, M_star, and sin^2(i) cancel out.\n\na_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / K_2^2) / (M_p1^2 / K_1^2) = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude K is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ_max), so K_1 / K_2 = Δλ_max1 / Δλ_max2.\n\nWe are given:\n*   M_p1 = 7 M_earth\n*   M_p2 = 5 M_earth\n*   Δλ_max1 = 0.03 Å\n*   Δλ_max2 = 0.04 Å\n\nLet's calculate the ratios:\n*   M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n*   K_1 / K_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\nNow substitute these back into the equation for a_2 / a_1:\na_2 / a_1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (3 / 4)^2 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16) = 225 / 784\n\nFinally, we can calculate the temperature ratio:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a_2 / a_1)^(1/2) = (225 / 784)^(1/2) = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<A>>>"
