    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical particle.\n\n**1. Express the Potential in Cartesian Coordinates**\n\nThe given potential is in polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$:\n$V(r, \\theta) = \\frac{1}{2} k r^2 + \\frac{3}{2} k r^2 \\cos^2(\\theta)$\n\nTo solve the Schrödinger equation more easily, we should convert this potential into Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$. The conversion relations are:\n$x = r \\cos(\\theta)$\n$y = r \\sin(\\theta)$\n$r^2 = x^2 + y^2$\n\nSubstitute these into the potential expression:\nThe first term is:\n$\\frac{1}{2} k r^2 = \\frac{1}{2} k (x^2 + y^2)$\n\nThe second term involves $r \\cos(\\theta)$, which is simply $x$:\n$\\frac{3}{2} k r^2 \\cos^2(\\theta) = \\frac{3}{2} k (r \\cos(\\theta))^2 = \\frac{3}{2} k x^2$\n\nNow, add the two terms to get the full potential in Cartesian coordinates:\n$V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2} k (x^2 + y^2) + \\frac{3}{2} k x^2$\n$V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2} k x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k y^2 + \\frac{3}{2} k x^2$\nCombine the terms with $x^2$:\n$V(x, y) = (\\frac{1}{2} k + \\frac{3}{2} k) x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$\n$V(x, y) = \\frac{4}{2} k x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$\n$V(x, y) = 2 k x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$\n\n**2. Identify the Separable Harmonic Oscillator Potentials**\n\nThe potential $V(x, y)$ is separable, meaning it can be written as a sum of a function of $x$ only and a function of $y$ only:\n$V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)$\nwhere:\n$V_x(x) = 2 k x^2$\n$V_y(y) = \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$\n\nThis form represents a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. The motion in the x-direction is independent of the motion in the y-direction. The total energy of the system will be the sum of the energies of two independent one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillators.\n\n**3. Determine the Angular Frequencies**\n\nThe potential for a 1D harmonic oscillator with mass $m$ and angular frequency $\\omega$ is $V = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 q^2$. We can use this form to find the angular frequencies $\\omega_x$ and $\\omega_y$.\n\nFor the x-direction:\n$V_x(x) = 2 k x^2 = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega_x^2 x^2$\n$2k = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega_x^2$\n$\\omega_x^2 = \\frac{4k}{m}$\n$\\omega_x = \\sqrt{\\frac{4k}{m}} = 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\nFor the y-direction:\n$V_y(y) = \\frac{1}{2} k y^2 = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega_y^2 y^2$\n$\\frac{1}{2} k = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega_y^2$\n$\\omega_y^2 = \\frac{k}{m}$\n$\\omega_y = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Energy Spectrum**\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator are given by $E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$\n\nThe total energy $E$ of the 2D system is the sum of the energies of the two independent oscillators:\n$E = E_x + E_y$\n$E = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega_x + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega_y$\n\nSubstitute the expressions for $\\omega_x$ and $\\omega_y$:\n$E = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\left(2 \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}\\right) + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}\\right)$\n\nNow, factor out the common term $\\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$:\n$E = \\left[ 2(n_x + \\frac{1}{2}) + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2}) \\right] \\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n$E = \\left[ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + \\frac{1}{2} \\right] \\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n$E = \\left( 2n_x + n_y + \\frac{3}{2} \\right) \\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\n**5. Compare with the Options**\n\nThe calculated energy spectrum is $E = (2n_x + n_y + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$.\nLet's compare this with the given choices:\nA) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nB) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nC) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nD) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n\nOur result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
