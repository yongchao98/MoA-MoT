    "This problem requires the application of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the relationship between energy, momentum, and velocity.\n\n**1. Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:**\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for position and momentum states that the product of the uncertainties in position (Δx) and momentum (Δp) must be at least of the order of the reduced Planck constant (ħ). The minimum uncertainty is given by:\nΔx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2\nwhere ħ = h / (2π) ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s.\n\n**2. Relate Energy Uncertainty (ΔE) to Momentum Uncertainty (Δp):**\nThe relationship between a particle's energy (E) and momentum (p) is fundamental. The uncertainty in energy (ΔE) can be related to the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) by the following differential relation:\nΔE ≈ |dE/dp| * Δp\n\nThe derivative dE/dp represents the group velocity of the particle's wave packet, which is equal to the classical velocity (v) of the particle. This holds true for both classical and relativistic particles.\nSo, dE/dp = v.\nTherefore, the relationship simplifies to:\nΔE ≈ v * Δp\n\n**3. Calculation Steps:**\nFirst, we calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp) using the given uncertainty in position (Δx).\nGiven:\n*   Uncertainty in position, Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 * 10⁻⁹ m = 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   Reduced Planck's constant, ħ ≈ 1.054 * 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n\nFrom the uncertainty principle:\nΔp ≥ ħ / (2 * Δx)\nΔp_min = (1.054 * 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 * 10⁻¹⁰ m)\nΔp_min ≈ 5.27 * 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s\n\nNow, we use this minimum momentum uncertainty to find the minimum energy uncertainty.\nGiven:\n*   Speed of the electron, v = 2 * 10⁸ m/s\n*   Δp_min ≈ 5.27 * 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s\n\nUsing the relation ΔE ≈ v * Δp:\nΔE_min ≈ (2 * 10⁸ m/s) * (5.27 * 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s)\nΔE_min ≈ 10.54 * 10⁻¹⁷ J\nΔE_min ≈ 1.054 * 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\nThis value is approximately 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\nTo confirm the calculation, let's use a script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nh_bar = 1.054571817e-34  # Reduced Planck constant in J.s\n\n# Given values\nv = 2e8  # speed of electron in m/s\ndelta_x = 0.1e-9  # uncertainty in position in m (0.1 nm)\n\n# 1. Calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum (delta_p)\n# delta_x * delta_p >= h_bar / 2\ndelta_p = h_bar / (2 * delta_x)\n\n# 2. Calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy (delta_E)\n# The relation is delta_E = v * delta_p\ndelta_E = v * delta_p\n\nprint(f\"{delta_E:.2e} J\")\n```\n<execute_result>\n1.05e-16 J\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculation yields approximately 1.05 * 10⁻¹⁶ J, which matches the order of magnitude of option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This problem combines the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle with the relationship between energy and momentum.\n\n**1. Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:**\nThe principle states that the product of the uncertainty in a particle's position (Δx) and the uncertainty in its momentum (Δp) has a lower bound:\nΔx ⋅ Δp ≥ ħ / 2\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ = h / 2π ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n\nTo find the *minimum* uncertainty, we use the equality:\nΔp_min = ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx)\n\n**2. Relate Energy and Momentum Uncertainty:**\nThe uncertainty in energy (ΔE) can be related to the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) through the energy-momentum relation E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)². A simpler and more general relation is derived from the group velocity of the wave packet, which is the particle's velocity (v).\nΔE ≈ |dE/dp| ⋅ Δp\nThe term dE/dp is the particle's velocity, v. So, we have:\nΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp\n\n**3. Calculation:**\nFirst, we calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp_min) using the given uncertainty in position.\nGiven:\n*   Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 × 10⁻⁹ m = 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   v = 2 × 10⁸ m/s\n*   ħ ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n\nCalculate Δp_min:\nΔp_min = (1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m)\nΔp_min ≈ 5.27 × 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s\n\nNow, use this to find the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE_min):\nΔE_min ≈ v ⋅ Δp_min\nΔE_min ≈ (2 × 10⁸ m/s) × (5.27 × 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s)\nΔE_min ≈ 10.54 × 10⁻¹⁷ J\nΔE_min ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\nThis result is approximately 10⁻¹⁶ J. The Python code execution confirms this calculation, yielding `1.05e-16 J`.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\nB) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\nC) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\nD) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\n\nThe calculated value matches the order of magnitude of option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
