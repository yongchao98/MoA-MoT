    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical principle:** The problem involves a conservative force (from the spring) in a relativistic setting. The total energy of the system is conserved.\n\n2.  **Define the total relativistic energy:** The total energy (E) of a particle of mass m moving at speed v in a potential U(x) is the sum of its relativistic kinetic energy, its rest energy, and its potential energy. This can be expressed as:\n    $E_{total} = E_{kinetic} + E_{rest} + U(x)$\n    $E_{total} = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2 + mc^2 + U(x)$\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x)$\n    where $m$ is the rest mass, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Define the potential energy:** The force is given by Hooke's Law, $F = -kx$. The potential energy $U(x)$ stored in the spring when it is stretched or compressed by a distance $x$ from its equilibrium position is:\n    $U(x) = \\int_0^x (-F) dx' = \\int_0^x kx' dx' = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n4.  **Set up the energy conservation equation:** The total energy of the oscillator remains constant throughout its motion. We can equate the total energy at two specific points in the oscillation:\n    *   **Point 1: Maximum amplitude.** The mass is at its maximum displacement, $x = A$. At this point, the mass momentarily stops, so its velocity is $v = 0$.\n    *   **Point 2: Equilibrium position.** The mass is at its equilibrium position, $x = 0$. At this point, the potential energy is zero, and the speed is at its maximum, $v = v_{max}$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the total energy at Point 1 (maximum amplitude):**\n    *   $x = A$\n    *   $v = 0 \\implies \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-0^2/c^2}} = 1$\n    *   $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n    The total energy is:\n    $E_1 = \\gamma mc^2 + U(A) = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n6.  **Calculate the total energy at Point 2 (equilibrium position):**\n    *   $x = 0$\n    *   $v = v_{max} \\implies \\gamma = \\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n    *   $U(0) = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$\n    The total energy is:\n    $E_2 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2 + U(0) = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}} + 0$\n\n7.  **Apply the conservation of energy:** Since the total energy is conserved, $E_1 = E_2$.\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n8.  **Solve for $v_{max}$:** Now, we need to algebraically rearrange the equation to isolate $v_{max}$.\n    *   Divide both sides by $mc^2$:\n        $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n    *   Square both sides of the equation:\n        $(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2 = \\frac{1}{1-v_{max}^2/c^2}$\n    *   Invert both sides:\n        $\\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2} = 1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$\n    *   Rearrange to solve for the velocity term:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n    *   Multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n        $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n9.  **Compare with the given options:** The derived expression for $v_{max}$ matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
