    "This problem requires us to determine the product (B) and the correct sequence of reagents (A) for the alkylation reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material and Reaction Type**\n\n*   The starting material is given as **(E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium**. This is an iminium salt, which is a key intermediate in enamine chemistry. It is formed from the reaction of **pentan-2-one** (a ketone) and **N-methylethanamine** (a secondary amine).\n    *   Pentan-2-one: CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃\n    *   N-methylethanamine: CH₃NHCH₂CH₃\n*   The overall reaction is an alkylation at the α-carbon of the ketone. This can be achieved either via an **enamine** (Stork enamine synthesis) or an **enolate**. The reagents provided in the options will clarify the pathway.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reagents (A)**\n\nThe options for reagent sequence A are:\n*   A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺\n\nLet's break down the purpose of each step:\n*   **(i) LDA, DME:** LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide) is a strong, bulky, non-nucleophilic base. It is commonly used to deprotonate carbonyl compounds to form enolates. DME (1,2-dimethoxyethane) is a polar aprotic solvent that is suitable for this reaction. Because LDA is sterically hindered, it preferentially removes the proton from the less-substituted α-carbon. This is known as **kinetic control**.\n*   **(ii) CH₃CH₂I:** Iodoethane is an alkylating agent. It's an electrophile that will be attacked by the nucleophile created in the first step.\n*   **(iii) H₃O⁺:** This indicates an acidic workup. This step is used to neutralize the reaction mixture and, in the context of enamine chemistry, to hydrolyze the intermediate iminium salt back to a ketone.\n\n**3. Determine the Reaction Pathway and Product (B)**\n\nThere are two ways to interpret this problem, both leading to the same conclusion.\n\n*   **Interpretation 1: Ketone Enolate Alkylation**\n    The reagent sequence (LDA, then alkyl halide) is the classic method for alkylating a ketone via its enolate. The named starting material simply tells us which ketone to start with: pentan-2-one.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Pentan-2-one has two α-carbons: the methyl group (C1) and the methylene group (C3). LDA, being a bulky base, will deprotonate the less hindered C1 methyl group (kinetic product).\n        CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃ + LDA → [CH₂=C(O⁻Li⁺)-CH₂CH₂CH₃] (Kinetic enolate)\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The nucleophilic carbon of the enolate attacks the iodoethane.\n        [CH₂=C(O⁻Li⁺)-CH₂CH₂CH₃] + CH₃CH₂I → CH₃CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃ + LiI\n    3.  **Product:** The resulting ketone is CH₃CH₂CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃. This is a seven-carbon chain with the carbonyl at position 4, so it is **heptan-4-one**. The H₃O⁺ is for the final workup.\n\n*   **Interpretation 2: Literal Reaction with the Iminium Salt**\n    Even if we start literally with the iminium salt, the outcome is the same.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** The iminium salt [CH₃-C(=N⁺(Me)Et)-CH₂CH₂CH₃] has acidic protons on the α-carbons (C1 and C3). LDA will deprotonate the less hindered C1 to form an enamine.\n        [CH₃-C(=N⁺...)-...] + LDA → CH₂=C(N(Me)Et)-CH₂CH₂CH₃ (Enamine)\n    2.  **Alkylation:** The resulting enamine is nucleophilic and attacks the iodoethane to form a new, alkylated iminium salt.\n        CH₂=C(N(Me)Et)-CH₂CH₂CH₃ + CH₃CH₂I → [CH₃CH₂-CH₂-C(=N⁺(Me)Et)-CH₂CH₂CH₃]I⁻\n    3.  **Hydrolysis:** The final step with H₃O⁺ hydrolyzes this iminium salt back to a ketone.\n        [CH₃CH₂-CH₂-C(=N⁺...)-...] + H₃O⁺ → CH₃CH₂-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂CH₂CH₃ + [H₂N(Me)Et]⁺\n    4.  **Product:** The final organic product is again **heptan-4-one**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   **A) (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺; B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine:** Incorrect product. The reaction is an alkylation, not a simple hydrolysis. The amine shown is also incorrect.\n*   **B) (i) LDA (ii) DME, CH₃CH₂I, H₃O⁺; B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine:** The reagent sequence is chemically incorrect (mixing a strong base with acid), and the product is wrong.\n*   **C) A = (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺; B = heptan-4-one:** The reagent sequence is correct for a sequential reaction, and the product, heptan-4-one, is the result of the kinetic alkylation of pentan-2-one. This is the correct choice.\n*   **D) (i) LDA (ii) DME, CH₃CH₂I, H₃O⁺; B = heptan-4-one:** The product is correct, but the representation of the reagent addition is chemically nonsensical. Sequential addition is required and denoted by (i), (ii), (iii).\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence of reagents leads to the formation of heptan-4-one.\n\n<<<C>>>"
