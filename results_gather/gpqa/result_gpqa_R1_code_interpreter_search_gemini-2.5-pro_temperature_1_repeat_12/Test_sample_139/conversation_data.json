    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues to Identify the Substances**\n\n    *   **Clue 1: Gas W's Properties:** \"a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons\". Let's examine some simple gaseous molecules.\n        *   Hydrogen (H2): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. No.\n        *   Nitrogen (N2): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. Possible.\n        *   Deuterium (D2): Deuterium (D) is a heavy isotope of hydrogen with 1 proton and 1 neutron. A D2 molecule would have 2 protons and 2 neutrons. This is a perfect match.\n        *   This clue strongly suggests the involvement of Deuterium.\n\n    *   **Clue 2: Substance X and Isotopes:** \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\". This aligns perfectly with the idea that Gas W is D2, meaning Substance X contains Deuterium (D).\n\n    *   **Clue 3: Reaction of X and Y:** \"Substance X ... reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W\". A classic violent reaction that produces hydrogen gas is the reaction of a metal hydride with water. Since D2 is produced, a plausible scenario is a metal deuteride (Substance X) reacting with water (Liquid Y). A very powerful reagent that fits this description is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD4). Let's test this hypothesis.\n        *   Proposed X = LiAlD4\n        *   Proposed Y = H2O (a common liquid)\n        *   Reaction: LiAlD4 + 4H2O → LiOH + Al(OH)3 + 4D2\n        *   This reaction is indeed violent, produces D2 gas (our identified Gas W), and proceeds with water (a liquid, Y).\n\n    *   **Clue 4: Precipitate G and Substance B:** \"a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B ... is very close to 277 K.\"\n        *   In our proposed reaction (LiAlD4 + 4H2O), Aluminum Hydroxide, Al(OH)3, is formed, which is a well-known white precipitate. So, **G = Al(OH)3**.\n        *   When Aluminum Hydroxide is heated, it decomposes: 2Al(OH)3(s) --(heat)--> Al2O3(s) + 3H2O(g). The substance released is water, H2O. So, **B = H2O**.\n        *   The melting point of water is 0 °C, which is 273.15 K. The value 277 K (3.85 °C) is stated to be \"very close\", which confirms that B is water.\n\n    *   **Clue 5: Organic Chemistry Context:** \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"\n        *   Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH4) is a famous and powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its deuterated version, LiAlD4 (our proposed Substance X), is its \"very close analog\" and is also used. This fits the description perfectly.\n        *   Keto acids contain both a ketone group (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). They have at least 3 oxygen atoms. LiAlH4 (and LiAlD4) reduces both functional groups to alcohols: the ketone becomes a secondary alcohol (-CH(OH)-) and the carboxylic acid becomes a primary alcohol (-CH2OH).\n        *   The final product is a diol (contains two alcohol groups, -OH). A diol has exactly **2 atoms of oxygen**. This confirms the chemical identity of X.\n\n2.  **Conclusion of Identification**\n\n    Based on all the evidence, we can confidently identify the substances:\n    *   **Substance X:** Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD4)\n    *   **Liquid Y:** Water (H2O)\n    *   **Gas W:** Deuterium gas (D2)\n    *   **Precipitate G:** Aluminum Hydroxide (Al(OH)3)\n    *   **Substance B:** Water (H2O)\n\n3.  **Calculate the Required Value**\n\n    The question asks to \"Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n\n    *   **Substance X:** LiAlD4\n    *   **Elements present:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), Hydrogen (as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Identify lightest and heaviest elements:** Based on atomic number or atomic mass, Hydrogen is the lightest element and Aluminum is the heaviest.\n    *   **Sum the masses as instructed:** The instruction \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... must be summed\" means we need the total mass contribution of all atoms of the lightest element and all atoms of the heaviest element in one formula unit. We will use integer mass numbers for the isotopes involved (D=2, Al=27).\n\n    *   **Mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 atoms of Deuterium (D) in LiAlD4.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8 amu.\n\n    *   **Mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is 1 atom of Aluminum (Al) in LiAlD4.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27 amu.\n\n    *   **Cumulative (Summed) Mass:**\n        *   Cumulative Mass = (Total mass from H) + (Total mass from Al) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe final calculated value is 35.\n\n<<<C>>>"
