    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2 (T_eq4 / T_eq2).\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    `T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))`\n    where:\n    *   `T_star` is the star's temperature.\n    *   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n3.  **Set up the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio `T_eq4 / T_eq2`.\n    `T_eq4 = T_star * (1 - A_4)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_4))`\n    `T_eq2 = T_star * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))`\n\n    The problem states that the planets orbit the same star, so `T_star` and `R_star` are the same for both. It also states that they have the same albedo, so `A_4 = A_2`. Therefore, these terms will cancel out in the ratio.\n\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = [sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_4))] / [sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))]`\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1 / a_4) / sqrt(1 / a_2)`\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_4)`\n\n    This shows that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is inversely proportional to the square root of the ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n4.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Orbital Period using Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (`a`).\n    `P² ∝ a³`\n    This can be rearranged to express `a` in terms of `P`:\n    `a ∝ P^(2/3)`\n\n5.  **Find the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** Using the relationship from Kepler's Third Law, we can find the ratio `a_2 / a_4`.\n    `a_2 / a_4 = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)`\n\n6.  **Substitute into the Temperature Ratio Equation:** Now, substitute the expression for `a_2 / a_4` back into our temperature ratio equation.\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3) )`\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = ( (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3) )^(1/2)`\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P_2 / P_4)^((2/3) * (1/2))`\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)`\n\n7.  **Use the Given Period Ratios:** The problem provides the ratio of orbital periods: `P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5`.\n    From this, we have:\n    *   `P_2` is proportional to 2.\n    *   `P_4` is proportional to 3.5.\n    The ratio `P_2 / P_4` is therefore `2 / 3.5`.\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Value:** Substitute the period ratio into the final equation and calculate the result.\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)`\n\nTo get a precise numerical value, we can use a short Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The ratio of orbital periods for Planet_2 and Planet_4\nP2_ratio = 2\nP4_ratio = 3.5\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is (P2/P4)^(1/3)\ntemp_ratio = (P2_ratio / P4_ratio)**(1/3)\n\nprint(temp_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.829984951111046\n</execute_result>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.83. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~0.75\nB) ~0.83\nC) ~0.57\nD) ~0.69\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The relationship between a planet's equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`), and its orbital semi-major axis (`a`) is given by:\n`T_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(a)`\n\nThis is because the flux of radiation received from the star decreases with the square of the distance (`Flux ∝ 1/a²`), and the temperature is related to the fourth root of the flux (`T ∝ Flux^(1/4)`), so `T ∝ (1/a²)^(1/4) = 1/a^(1/2) = 1/sqrt(a)`.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2 is:\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_4)`\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law, the square of the orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (`a`):\n`P² ∝ a³` or `a ∝ P^(2/3)`\n\nWe can express the ratio of the semi-major axes in terms of the ratio of the orbital periods:\n`a_2 / a_4 = (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3)`\n\nSubstituting this back into the temperature ratio equation:\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3) )`\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = ( (P_2 / P_4)^(2/3) )^(1/2)`\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)`\n\nThe problem states that the ratio of the orbital periods is `P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5`.\nFrom this, we get the ratio `P_2 / P_4 = 2 / 3.5`.\n\nNow, we can calculate the final temperature ratio:\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)`\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3)`\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.82998`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.83.\n\nBased on the calculation, the correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
