    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   Z is a hydrocarbon, so its formula is CxHy.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is given as 14.28%, which is equivalent to 0.1428.\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen can be expressed as: Mass Fraction (H) = (y * Ar(H)) / (x * Ar(C) + y * Ar(H)), where Ar(H) ≈ 1 and Ar(C) ≈ 12.\n*   So, 0.1428 ≈ y / (12x + y).\n*   Rearranging this gives: 1 / 0.1428 ≈ (12x + y) / y => 7.00 ≈ 12x/y + 1 => 6 ≈ 12x/y => y/x ≈ 2.\n*   This suggests an empirical formula of CH2.\n*   The general formula for a hydrocarbon with a y/x ratio of 2 is CnH2n.\n*   The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n*   Saturated hydrocarbons are alkanes (CnH2n+2) or cycloalkanes (CnH2n).\n*   The formula CnH2n corresponds to a cycloalkane. The mass fraction of hydrogen in any cycloalkane is (2n * 1) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857, which matches the given value perfectly.\n*   So, Z is a cycloalkane. The problem also states that Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane (C6H12). Let's assume Z is cyclohexane. This is consistent with all the information.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water.\n*   Mixture Y is formed by the disproportionation of mixture X. A disproportionation reaction in this context involves hydrogen transfer, where some molecules are hydrogenated (gain H) and others are dehydrogenated (lose H).\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane, C6H12).\n*   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one component of Y is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n*   Let the other component of Y be Y2. Hydrogenation of Y2 must also give cyclohexane. This means Y2 must have a C6 ring skeleton.\n*   Since Y is the product of disproportionation, and one product (cyclohexane) is the fully hydrogenated C6 ring, the other product (Y2) must be the dehydrogenated C6 ring. The ultimate dehydrogenated C6 ring is benzene (C6H6).\n*   Let's check if Y = {cyclohexane (C6H12), benzene (C6H6)} fits the description.\n    *   **Equimolar mixture of two liquids:** Yes, both are liquids at room temperature.\n    *   **Does not decolorize bromine water:** Correct. Cyclohexane is saturated. Benzene's aromatic ring is stable and does not react with bromine water in an addition reaction.\n    *   **Hydrogenation gives only Z:** Correct. Hydrogenation of benzene yields cyclohexane. Hydrogenation of cyclohexane yields itself. So the only product is cyclohexane (Z).\n*   Therefore, mixture Y consists of cyclohexane and benzene.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2.\n*   Mixture X undergoes a disproportionation reaction upon heating with platinum to form the equimolar mixture Y.\n*   The reaction can be written as: X1 + X2 → Y1 + Y2\n*   Substituting the components of Y, we get: X1 + X2 → Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6).\n*   Since the hydrogenation of mixture X also gives only cyclohexane, the components X1 and X2 must also be C6 compounds with a six-membered ring skeleton. Let their formulas be C6Hn and C6Hm.\n*   The reaction is: C6Hn + C6Hm → C6H12 + C6H6.\n*   According to the law of conservation of mass, the number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the reaction. Let's balance the hydrogen atoms:\n    *   Total H atoms on the left = n + m\n    *   Total H atoms on the right = 12 + 6 = 18\n*   Therefore, n + m = 18.\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This is the sum of the hydrogen atoms in one molecule of X1 and one molecule of X2, which is n + m.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. This corresponds to option C.\n\n*(For completeness, a plausible identity for mixture X would be cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). Neither has conjugated bonds. The total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. The disproportionation reaction C6H10 + C6H8 → C6H12 + C6H6 is balanced and chemically reasonable.)*\n\n<<<C>>>"
