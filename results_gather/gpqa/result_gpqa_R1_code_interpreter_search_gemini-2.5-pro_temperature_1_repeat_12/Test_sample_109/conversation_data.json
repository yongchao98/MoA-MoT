    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Determine the Observability Criteria for Both Observatories\n\nFor a star to be observable by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, it must satisfy the conditions for both location and brightness.\n\n**a) Location (Declination, DEC):**\n\n*   **Paranal Observatory:** Located in the Southern Hemisphere (Latitude ~24° S). It can observe the entire southern celestial hemisphere and the northern celestial hemisphere up to a declination of approximately +66°. So, its observable range is roughly -90° < DEC < +66°.\n*   **W. M. Keck Observatory:** Located in the Northern Hemisphere (Latitude ~20° N). It can observe the entire northern celestial hemisphere and the southern celestial hemisphere down to a declination of approximately -70°. So, its observable range is roughly -70° < DEC < +90°.\n*   **For a star to be seen by both observatories,** its declination must be within the overlapping range: **-70° < DEC < +66°**.\n\n**b) Brightness (Apparent V Magnitude, V):**\n\n*   **ESPRESSO:** Can observe stars with V < 17 mag.\n*   **HIRES:** Can observe stars with V < 16 mag.\n*   **For a star to be detected by both instruments,** it must be bright enough for the more restrictive limit. Therefore, the star's apparent V magnitude must be **V < 16 mag**.\n\n### 2. Analyze Each Star\n\nWe need to calculate the apparent V magnitude (V) for each star and check if its declination (DEC) and magnitude (V) meet the combined criteria.\n\nThe formula relating apparent magnitude (V), absolute magnitude (Mv), distance in parsecs (d), and extinction (Av) is:\n`V = Mv + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + Av`\n\nThe extinction in the V band (Av) is related to the color excess (E(B-V)) by:\n`Av = 3.1 * E(B-V)`\n\n---\n\n**Star 1:**\n*   DEC = -75°\n*   Mv = 15.5 mag, d = 10 pc\n*   **Declination Check:** -75° is not within the range [-70°, +66°]. It is too far south for the Keck Observatory.\n*   **Conclusion:** Star 1 cannot be observed by both.\n\n---\n\n**Star 2:**\n*   DEC = +55°\n*   V = 16.5 mag\n*   **Declination Check:** +55° is within the range [-70°, +66°].\n*   **Magnitude Check:** V = 16.5 mag. This is not brighter than 16 mag (16.5 is not < 16). It is too faint for HIRES.\n*   **Conclusion:** Star 2 cannot be observed by both.\n\n---\n\n**Star 3:**\n*   DEC = +48°\n*   V = 15.5 mag (This is the given observed apparent magnitude).\n*   **Declination Check:** +48° is within the range [-70°, +66°].\n*   **Magnitude Check:** V = 15.5 mag. This is brighter than 16 mag (15.5 < 16).\n*   **Conclusion:** Star 3 can be observed by both.\n\n---\n\n**Star 4:**\n*   DEC = -48°\n*   Mv = 15.5 mag, d = 10 pc, E(B-V) = 0.4 mag\n*   **Declination Check:** -48° is within the range [-70°, +66°].\n*   **Magnitude Check:** We need to calculate the apparent V magnitude.\n    *   Extinction (Av) = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag.\n    *   V = Mv + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + Av\n    *   V = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 + 1.24\n    *   V = 15.5 + 5 * 1 - 5 + 1.24\n    *   V = 16.74 mag.\n    *   This is not brighter than 16 mag (16.74 is not < 16). It is too faint for HIRES.\n*   **Conclusion:** Star 4 cannot be observed by both.\n\n---\n\n**Star 5:**\n*   DEC = +60°\n*   Mv = 16.5 mag, d = 5 pc\n*   **Declination Check:** +60° is within the range [-70°, +66°].\n*   **Magnitude Check:** We need to calculate the apparent V magnitude.\n    *   V = Mv + 5 * log10(d) - 5\n    *   V = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5) - 5\n    *   V = 16.5 + 5 * (0.699) - 5\n    *   V = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5\n    *   V = 14.995 mag.\n    *   This is brighter than 16 mag (14.995 < 16).\n*   **Conclusion:** Star 5 can be observed by both.\n\n### 3.

    "To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, we must first establish the common observability criteria based on the information provided.\n\n### 1. Observability Criteria\n\n**a) Location (Declination):**\n\nA star must be visible from both observatory locations.\n*   **Paranal Observatory (Southern Hemisphere, Latitude ~24° S):** Can observe stars in the southern sky and up to a certain declination in the northern sky.\n*   **Keck Observatory (Northern Hemisphere, Latitude ~20° N):** Can observe stars in the northern sky and down to a certain declination in the southern sky.\n\nA common rule of thumb is that an observatory at latitude *L* can observe declinations from -90°+*L* to +90°-*L*. However, for world-class observatories on high mountains with excellent atmospheric conditions, the observable range is wider.\n*   Paranal can observe from the south celestial pole (DEC = -90°) up to approximately DEC = +66°.\n*   Keck can observe from the north celestial pole (DEC = +90°) down to approximately DEC = -70°.\n\nTherefore, for a star to be observable by **both**, its declination must be in the overlapping range: **-70° < DEC < +66°**.\n\n**b) Brightness (Apparent Magnitude):**\n\nA star must be bright enough for the less sensitive of the two instruments.\n*   **ESPRESSO limit:** Apparent V magnitude (V) < 17 mag.\n*   **HIRES limit:** Apparent V magnitude (V) < 16 mag.\n\nTherefore, for a star to be detected by **both**, its apparent V magnitude must be brighter than the stricter limit: **V < 16.0 mag**.\n\n### 2. Star-by-Star Analysis\n\nWe will now check each star against these two criteria. We'll use the distance modulus formula to find the apparent magnitude (V) when the absolute magnitude (Mv) is given:\n`V = Mv + 5 * log10(d) - 5 + Av`\nwhere *d* is the distance in parsecs and *Av* is the extinction in the V band. Extinction is calculated as `Av = 3.1 * E(B-V)`.\n\n---\n\n**Star 1:**\n*   **Declination:** DEC = -75°. This is outside the common range of [-70°, +66°] as it is too far south for the Keck Observatory.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Not observable** by both.\n\n---\n\n**Star 2:**\n*   **Declination:** DEC = +55°. This is within the common range of [-70°, +66°].\n*   **Apparent Magnitude:** V = 16.5 mag. This is not brighter than 16.0 mag (i.e., 16.5 is not < 16.0).\n*   **Conclusion:** **Not observable** by both (too faint for HIRES).\n\n---\n\n**Star 3:**\n*   **Declination:** DEC = +48°. This is within the common range of [-70°, +66°].\n*   **Apparent Magnitude:** V = 15.5 mag. This is brighter than 16.0 mag (15.5 < 16.0).\n*   **Conclusion:** **Observable** by both.\n\n---\n\n**Star 4:**\n*   **Declination:** DEC = -48°. This is within the common range of [-70°, +66°].\n*   **Apparent Magnitude Calculation:**\n    *   Mv = 15.5 mag\n    *   d = 10 pc\n    *   Av = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag\n    *   V = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 + 1.24 = 15.5 + 5 - 5 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag\n*   The calculated apparent magnitude V = 16.74 mag is not brighter than 16.0 mag.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Not observable** by both (too faint for HIRES).\n\n---\n\n**Star 5:**\n*   **Declination:** DEC = +60°. This is within the common range of [-70°, +66°].\n*   **Apparent Magnitude Calculation:**\n    *   Mv = 16.5 mag\n    *   d = 5 pc\n    *   Av = 0 (since E(B-V) is not mentioned)\n    *   V = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 = 16.5 + 5 * (0.699) - 5 = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = 14.995 mag\n*   The calculated apparent magnitude V ≈ 15.0 mag is brighter than 16.0 mag.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Observable** by both.\n\n### Summary\n\n*   Star 1: No (Declination out of range)\n*   Star 2: No (Too faint)\n*   **Star 3: Yes**\n*   Star 4: No (Too faint)\n*   **Star 5: Yes**\n\nThe stars that can be detected with both spectrographs are Star 3 and Star 5.\n\n<<<B>>>"
