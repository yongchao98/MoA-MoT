    "*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    *   **Type of Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic addition reaction, specifically the formation of a cyanohydrin.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The reaction involves the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN on the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate. This intermediate is a strong base and needs to be protonated to form the final product, a cyanohydrin, which has a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺) to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. This is typically achieved by using a mineral acid. H₃O⁺ is the chemical notation for an aqueous acidic solution (like HCl(aq) or H₂SO₄(aq)). NaHSO₃ can form an adduct but is not the standard reagent for providing the proton in the final step of cyanohydrin synthesis. Therefore, A = H₃O⁺ is the correct choice.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reaction:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n    *   **Type of Reaction:** This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-C≡N) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   **Mechanism:** Nitrile hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either acid or base. The reaction shows water (H₂O) and a reagent 'B' are used. The product is a carboxylic acid, not a carboxylate salt, which suggests an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis or a base-catalyzed hydrolysis followed by an acidic workup. In acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, a strong acid is used to protonate the nitrile nitrogen, making the carbon more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by water. The reaction proceeds through an amide intermediate, which is then further hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B acts as a catalyst for the hydrolysis. Strong acids like HCl or H₂SO₄ are very effective for this transformation, and the reaction is typically heated. Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is a weak acid and is generally not effective enough for complete hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. Therefore, a strong acid like HCl is the appropriate choice for B.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   For the first reaction, reagent A should be H₃O⁺.\n    *   For the second reaction, reagent B should be HCl.\n    *   Combining these findings, we look for the option where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
