    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Calculate the concentration of the diluted acetic acid solution.**\n*   The initial solution of acetic acid has a volume (V₁) of 20.00 cm³ and a concentration (M₁) of 0.05 M.\n*   It is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water, so the final volume (V₂) is 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³.\n*   We use the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂ to find the new concentration (M₂).\n*   M₂ = (M₁V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M.\n*   The concentration of the acetic acid to be titrated is 0.025 M.\n\n**2. Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻), by the NaOH. This means 75% of the acetic acid remains.\n*   The solution at this point is a buffer, containing both the weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻).\n*   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]).\n*   First, calculate pKa from the given Ka:\n    *   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   At 25% titration, the ratio of [A⁻] to [HA] is 25/75 or 1/3.\n*   Now, substitute the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log(25/75)\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n    *   pH ≈ 4.256\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution contains only the weak base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻).\n*   First, we need to find the volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point. Moles of acid must equal moles of base (MₐVₐ = MₙVₙ).\n    *   Moles of acid = 0.025 M * 40.00 cm³ = 1.0 mmol\n    *   Volume of NaOH (Vₙ) = (Moles of acid) / (Concentration of NaOH) = 1.0 mmol / 0.1 M = 10.00 cm³\n*   The total volume of the solution at the equivalence point is the initial volume of the diluted acid plus the volume of NaOH added:\n    *   Total Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n*   Now, calculate the concentration of the acetate ion ([CH₃COO⁻]) at the equivalence point:\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] = (Initial moles of acid) / (Total Volume) = 1.0 mmol / 50.00 cm³ = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n*   The acetate ion hydrolyzes water, producing OH⁻ ions: CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq).\n*   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for the acetate ion. We can find it from Ka and Kw (Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25 °C).\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n*   We can set up an ICE table to find the [OH⁻] at equilibrium.\n    *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n*   Since Kb is very small, we can assume x is negligible compared to 0.02, so (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    *   5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / 0.02\n    *   x² = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 = 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   Now, calculate pOH and then pH:\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n\n**Summary of Results:**\n*   pH at 25% titration ≈ 4.26\n*   pH at equivalence point ≈ 8.52\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) 4.57; 6.92\nB) 4.26; 8.52\nC) 4.73; 7.00\nD) 3.17; 6.73\n\nThe calculated values match option B.\n\nTo verify the calculations, we can use a Python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nKa_acetic_acid = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\ninitial_conc_acid = 0.05  # M\ninitial_vol_acid = 0.020  # L (20 cm3)\nfinal_vol_acid_diluted = 0.040 # L (40 cm3)\nconc_NaOH = 0.1 # M\n\n# Step 1: Concentration of diluted acid\nconc_acid_diluted = (initial_conc_acid * initial_vol_acid) / final_vol_acid_diluted\n\n# --- pH at 25% titration ---\n# Use Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n# [A-]/[HA] = 0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3\npKa = -math.log10(Ka_acetic_acid)\npH_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# --- pH at equivalence point ---\n# Moles of acid = moles of base\nmoles_acid = conc_acid_diluted * final_vol_acid_diluted\nvol_NaOH_eq = moles_acid / conc_NaOH\ntotal_volume_eq = final_vol_acid_diluted + vol_NaOH_eq\n\n# Concentration of acetate [A-] at equivalence point\nconc_acetate = moles_acid / total_volume_eq\n\n# Kb for acetate\nKb_acetate = Kw / Ka_acetic_acid\n\n# [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [A-])\n# We assume [A-] - x is approximately [A-]\nOH_concentration = math.sqrt(Kb_acetate * conc_acetate)\n\n# pOH and pH\npOH_eq = -math.log10(OH_concentration)\npH_eq = 14 - pOH_eq\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_eq:.2f}\")\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "**Thinking Process:**\n\n**Part 1: Initial Dilution**\n1.  **Identify initial conditions:** We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n2.  **Identify dilution:** We add 20.00 cm³ of water.\n3.  **Calculate the new total volume:** V_total = 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³.\n4.  **Calculate the new concentration of acetic acid:** We use the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂.\n    *   M₁ = 0.05 M\n    *   V₁ = 20.00 cm³\n    *   V₂ = 40.00 cm³\n    *   M₂ = (M₁ * V₁) / V₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M.\n    *   So, the concentration of the acetic acid solution to be titrated is 0.025 M.\n\n**Part 2: pH at 25% Titration**\n1.  **Nature of the solution:** At 25% titration, 25% of the weak acid (CH₃COOH) has reacted with the strong base (NaOH) to form its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻). The remaining 75% is still unreacted CH₃COOH. This mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base constitutes a buffer solution.\n2.  **Relevant equation:** For a buffer solution, the pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    *   pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[weak acid])\n    *   pH = pKa + log([CH₃COO⁻]/[CH₃COOH])\n3.  **Calculate pKa:**\n    *   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKa = -log₁₀(Ka) = -log₁₀(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n4.  **Determine the ratio of conjugate base to weak acid:**\n    *   At 25% titration, [CH₃COO⁻]/[CH₃COOH] = 25% / 75% = 1/3.\n5.  **Calculate pH:**\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log₁₀(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.733 - log₁₀(3)\n    *   pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n    *   pH ≈ 4.256\n\n**Part 3: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n1.  **Nature of the solution:** At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by the NaOH. The reaction is: CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O. The solution now contains only sodium acetate (CH₃COONa), which is the salt of a weak acid and a strong base. The acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) will hydrolyze in water, acting as a weak base.\n    *   CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n2.  **Calculate the moles of acid:**\n    *   Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 M × 0.0400 L = 0.001 moles of CH₃COOH.\n3.  **Calculate the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point:**\n    *   At the equivalence point, moles of acid = moles of base.\n    *   Volume_NaOH = Moles / Concentration_NaOH = 0.001 moles / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n4.  **Calculate the total volume at the equivalence point:**\n    *   V_total = V_acid_diluted + V_NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n5.  **Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion ([CH₃COO⁻]):**\n    *   The moles of acetate formed are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 moles.\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / V_total = 0.001 moles / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n6.  **Calculate the concentration of OH⁻ from hydrolysis:**\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for the acetate ion.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰.\n    *   From the hydrolysis reaction, Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻].\n    *   Let [OH⁻] = x. Then [CH₃COOH] = x.\n    *   5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x).\n    *   Since Kb is very small, we can assume x is negligible compared to 0.02 M. So, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\n    *   5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.02\n    *   x² ≈ (5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 = 1.081 × 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] ≈ √(1.081 × 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 × 10⁻⁶ M.\n7.  **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀[OH⁻] = -log₁₀(3.288 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483.\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   The pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26.\n*   The pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52.\n\nThese calculated values correspond to option B. The provided code output confirms these results.\n\n<<<B>>>"
