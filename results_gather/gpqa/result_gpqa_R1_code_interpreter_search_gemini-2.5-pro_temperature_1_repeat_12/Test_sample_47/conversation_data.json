    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is the alpha-bromination of a ketone. The bromine atom substitutes a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon).\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone is a symmetrical six-membered ring ketone.\n*   **Product 1:** Since both α-positions are equivalent, the bromination occurs at one of them to form **2-bromocyclohexanone**.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic example of the **Favorskii rearrangement**. An α-halo ketone with an abstractable proton on the other α-carbon (the α'-carbon) undergoes a rearrangement in the presence of a strong base.\n    1.  The hydroxide ion (⁻OH) abstracts an acidic α'-proton (from C6) to form an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, where the carbanion attacks the carbon bearing the bromine (C2), displacing the bromide ion and forming a bicyclic intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one).\n    3.  The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of this strained intermediate.\n    4.  The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, and the bicyclic ring opens to relieve ring strain, forming a more stable cyclopentane ring. This results in a cyclopentanecarboxylate anion.\n    5.  Upon acidic workup (which is implied in such a sequence), the carboxylate is protonated.\n*   **Product 2:** The product is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n    *Note: An alternative reaction is E2 elimination to form cyclohex-2-enone. However, the subsequent reaction steps do not lead to any of the given answers, whereas the Favorskii rearrangement path does.*\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl). Pyridine is used as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** The product is **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild and sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** The product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n**Analysis of Chemically Distinct Hydrogens in Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of unique hydrogen environments in the final product, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n*   **Structure:** A five-membered cyclopentane ring is attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group, the C1 carbon it's attached to, and bisects the C3-C4 bond of the ring.\n*   **Counting the distinct hydrogen atoms:**\n    1.  **Aldehyde proton (H-C=O):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. (1 signal)\n    2.  **Methine proton (on C1):** The single proton on the carbon where the aldehyde group is attached is also unique. (1 signal)\n    3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** Due to the plane of symmetry, the C2 position is equivalent to the C5 position. However, the two protons on C2 are **diastereotopic**—one is 'cis' and one is 'trans' relative to the aldehyde group, making them chemically non-equivalent. The same applies to C5. The 'cis' proton on C2 is equivalent to the 'cis' proton on C5, and the 'trans' proton on C2 is equivalent to the 'trans' proton on C5. This gives two distinct signals for these four protons. (2 signals)\n    4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, the C3 position is equivalent to the C4 position. The two protons on C3 are also diastereotopic. Their relationship to the aldehyde group further down the ring makes them non-equivalent. The same applies to C4. This results in two more distinct signals for these four protons. (2 signals)\n\n*   **Total:** Summing them up, we have 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<C>>>"
