    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M⁺):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the most abundant isotopic form of the compound is 156 amu.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M⁺+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of 32% (compared to 100% for the M⁺ peak) is highly significant. The intensity ratio of the M⁺ peak to the M⁺+2 peak is approximately 100:32, which is very close to a 3:1 ratio. This pattern is the characteristic isotopic signature for a molecule containing a single chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of the isotopes ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl).\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom. Let's check the molecular formula for the options. All proposed structures (C₇H₅ClO₂) have a molecular weight of (7*12) + (5*1) + 35 + (2*16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol, which is consistent with the MS data.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This is a classic, unmistakable signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. A C=O stretch around 1720-1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a conjugated carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion:** The IR spectrum strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. This eliminates option **B) Phenyl chloroformate** (which lacks an O-H group) and **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde** (which has a phenolic O-H and an aldehyde C=O, a combination that doesn't produce this exact IR signature, especially the broadness down to 2700 cm⁻¹). We are now left with options A and D, which are both chlorobenzoic acids.\n\n**3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield ( > 10 ppm) is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**). It is a singlet as it does not couple with any other protons, and it integrates to one proton. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):**\n    *   The signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm).\n    *   We see two distinct signals: a doublet at 8.02 ppm and a doublet at 7.72 ppm.\n    *   Each signal integrates to 2H, meaning there are two pairs of chemically equivalent protons, for a total of four aromatic protons.\n    *   This simple \"two doublets, 2H each\" pattern is highly characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The symmetry of the para-substituted ring makes the protons at positions 2 and 6 equivalent, and the protons at positions 3 and 5 equivalent.\n*   **Conclusion:** The NMR data points to a para-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** is a para-substituted molecule. It would show exactly this NMR pattern.\n    *   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** is an ortho-substituted molecule. It has four unique aromatic protons, which would result in a much more complex splitting pattern (not two simple doublets).\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nBy combining all the evidence:\n*   **MS** shows a molecular weight of 156 and one chlorine atom.\n*   **IR** shows a carboxylic acid group.\n*   **¹H NMR** confirms the carboxylic acid and shows a *para*-substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\nOnly **4-chlorobenzoic acid** fits all the spectral data perfectly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
