    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Parent:** Benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromine atom (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are at positions 1, 3, and 5. This is a meta-meta relationship.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, the existing substituents on the ring direct incoming groups to specific positions.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromine atom (-Br):** Deactivating and an **ortho-, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Key Constraints in Synthesis**\n\nA crucial rule in aromatic synthesis is that **Friedel-Crafts reactions (acylation and alkylation) do not work on strongly deactivated rings**. Rings with substituents like -NO2, -SO3H, or -NR3+ are too deactivated for the reaction to proceed. This is a major constraint we must consider when evaluating the reaction sequences.\n\n**4. Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's analyze each proposed sequence step-by-step.\n\n*   **Option A:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...\n    1.  **Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitrobenzene.** The ring now has a strongly deactivating -NO2 group.\n    2.  **Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → Aniline.** The -NO2 group is reduced to an -NH2 group. Aniline is strongly activated.\n    3.  **Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Reaction Fails.** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation attempt on aniline. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2) to form a complex (-NH2+-AlCl3). This complex is extremely deactivating, preventing the acylation reaction on the ring. Therefore, **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; ...\n    1.  This sequence starts by nitrating benzene, reducing it to aniline, diazotizing it, and then removing the diazonium group with H3PO2.\n    2.  Benzene → Nitrobenzene → Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt → Benzene.\n    3.  These first four steps simply return the starting material, benzene. This is a nonsensical and inefficient pathway. Therefore, **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C:** i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...\n    1.  **Benzene + Br2/FeBr3 → Bromobenzene.** The ring has an ortho-, para-directing -Br group.\n    2.  **Bromobenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → p-Bromonitrobenzene (major product) + o-Bromonitrobenzene.** The target molecule requires a meta relationship between the bromo and nitro groups. This step produces para and ortho isomers, not the required meta isomer.\n    3.  Even if we proceed, the next step is Friedel-Crafts acylation on bromonitrobenzene. This ring has two deactivating groups (-Br and -NO2), making it strongly deactivated. The Friedel-Crafts acylation would fail.\n    Therefore, **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D:** i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...\n    1.  **Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.** This Friedel-Crafts acylation is performed on an activated benzene ring and works well. The product, acetophenone, has an acetyl group (-COCH3), which is a **meta-director**.\n    2.  **Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone.** Since the acetyl group is a meta-director, the incoming bromine atom will be directed to the meta position (position 3). This step correctly establishes the 1,3 relationship between the acetyl and bromo groups.\n    3.  **3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** Now we nitrate the ring which has two substituents:\n        *   The **-COCH3 group at position 1** is a **meta-director**, directing the new group to position 5.\n        *   The **-Br group at position 3** is an **ortho-, para-director**, directing the new group to positions 2, 4, and 5.\n        *   Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to **position 5**. This is a case of reinforcing directing effects, which leads to a clean reaction with a high yield of the desired product. The resulting molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThis three-step sequence is chemically sound and is the most logical way to synthesize the target molecule with high yield and selectivity among the choices. The subsequent steps listed in option D (iv through vii) are unnecessary and would chemically alter the desired product into something else, suggesting a possible flaw in the question's construction. However, the initial sequence is the only viable path presented.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe only sequence that correctly applies the principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution to produce the desired 1,3,5-substituted product is the one starting with Friedel-Crafts acylation, followed by bromination, and then nitration. This corresponds to the beginning of Option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
