    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Radiating Source and its Radiation Pattern\n\nThe problem describes an \"oscillating charge distribution\" with a \"spheroid in shape\" and symmetry along the z-axis. This source radiates electromagnetic waves. In the far-field (radiation zone), the radiation from any localized oscillating source can be described by a multipole expansion. The dominant term is typically the lowest-order non-zero multipole.\n\nThe most common and fundamental radiating system is the **oscillating electric dipole**. This corresponds to a time-varying separation of positive and negative charges. An \"oscillating charge distribution\" is the most general description for a source that has a time-varying electric dipole moment. The spheroid shape simply provides a physical picture for a non-point-like source with a well-defined axis of symmetry (the z-axis). Unless specific symmetries are invoked to cancel the dipole moment (e.g., a purely radial \"breathing\" mode or a shape oscillation like prolate-to-oblate), the electric dipole radiation will be the dominant term.\n\nTherefore, we will model the source as an oscillating electric dipole oriented along the z-axis.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Angular Dependence of Radiated Power\n\nFor an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) is given by:\n\n`dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)`\n\nwhere `θ` is the angle measured from the axis of the dipole (the z-axis).\nThe function `f` mentioned in the problem is this power per unit solid angle, so `f(λ, θ) = C(λ) * sin²(θ)`, where `C(λ)` contains all the other factors, including the dependence on wavelength `λ`.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Fraction of Maximum Power at θ = 30°\n\nThe maximum radiated power per unit solid angle, `A`, occurs when the angular term `sin²(θ)` is at its maximum. The maximum value of `sin(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n\nSo, `A = (dP/dΩ)_max = C(λ) * sin²(90°) = C(λ) * (1)² = C(λ)`.\n\nNow, we calculate the power radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`:\n\n`P_30 = (dP/dΩ)_at_30° = C(λ) * sin²(30°)`.\n\nWe know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\nTherefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\nSubstituting this back, we get:\n\n`P_30 = C(λ) * (1/4)`.\n\nSince `A = C(λ)`, we have `P_30 = A / 4`.\n\nThe question asks for the fraction of `A` that is radiated at `θ = 30°`. This fraction is:\n\nFraction = `P_30 / A = (A/4) / A = 1/4`.\n\nThis result eliminates options A and D.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power\n\nThe power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency of oscillation, `ω`.\n\n`P ∝ ω⁴`\n\nThe angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by the formula `ω = 2πf_freq = 2πc/λ`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n\nSubstituting this into the proportionality for power:\n\n`P ∝ (2πc/λ)⁴ ∝ 1/λ⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n\nSo, the function `f(λ, θ)` must be proportional to `λ⁻⁴`.\n\n### Step 5: Combine the Results and Choose the Correct Option\n\nWe have found two key pieces of information:\n1.  The fraction of the maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n2.  The radiated power has a wavelength dependence of **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nNow let's look at the given options:\nA) 3/4, λ⁻⁶\nB) 1/4, λ⁻³\nC) 1/4, λ⁻⁴\nD) 1/2, λ⁻⁴\n\nThe option that matches both of our findings is C.\n\n*(Self-check: Option A corresponds to electric quadrupole radiation, which has a `sin²(θ)cos²(θ)` angular dependence and a `λ⁻⁶` wavelength dependence. This would be the answer for a different physical situation, like a spheroid oscillating in shape from prolate to oblate, which has a zero dipole moment.)*\n\n<<<C>>>"
