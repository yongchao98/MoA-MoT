    "Answering this question requires understanding the relationship between a planet's mass, composition, and density. Density (ρ) is defined as mass (M) divided by volume (V). For a spherical planet, V = (4/3)πR³, where R is the radius.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.**\nThis is our reference point. Earth has an average density (ρ_Earth) of approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n**b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³.**\nThe density is given directly as ~5.5 g/cm³. This is essentially the same as Earth's density.\n\n**c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.**\nWhen a planet is more massive, its own gravity compresses its material more strongly. For a planet with the same composition (i.e., the same mix of iron, silicates, etc.), this increased gravitational compression leads to a higher overall density. A 5-Earth-mass planet (a \"Super-Earth\") will be significantly denser than Earth.\n\n**d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.**\nConversely, a less massive planet experiences weaker gravitational compression. With the same composition as Earth, its materials would be less compressed, resulting in a lower overall density compared to Earth.\n\n**Comparison:**\n*   Density(a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n*   Density(b) ≈ 5.50 g/cm³\n*   Density(c) > Density(a) because of greater gravitational compression.\n*   Density(d) < Density(a) because of lesser gravitational compression.\n\nFrom this reasoning, it is clear that planet (c) has the highest density.\n\nTo quantify this, we can use the approximate mass-radius relationship for rocky planets, which is R ∝ M^k, where the exponent k is less than 1/3 (the value for a constant density object) due to compression. A common approximation for k is about 0.27 to 0.3. Let's use k ≈ 0.3.\n\nThe density ratio relative to Earth can be calculated as:\nρ / ρ_Earth = (M / M_Earth) / (V / V_Earth)\nSince V ∝ R³, we have V / V_Earth = (R / R_Earth)³ = ((M / M_Earth)^k)³ = (M / M_Earth)^(3k).\nSo, ρ / ρ_Earth = (M / M_Earth) / (M / M_Earth)^(3k) = (M / M_Earth)^(1-3k).\nUsing k=0.3, we get ρ / ρ_Earth = (M / M_Earth)^0.1.\n\n*   For planet (c): M = 5 M_Earth. Density(c) ≈ ρ_Earth * (5)^0.1 ≈ 5.51 * 1.17 ≈ 6.47 g/cm³.\n*   For planet (d): M = 0.5 M_Earth. Density(d) ≈ ρ_Earth * (0.5)^0.1 ≈ 5.51 * 0.93 ≈ 5.13 g/cm³.\n\nComparing the calculated densities:\n*   a) ~5.51 g/cm³\n*   b) ~5.50 g/cm³\n*   c) ~6.47 g/cm³\n*   d) ~5.13 g/cm³\n\nThe planet in option (c) clearly has the highest density.\n\n<<<A>>>"
