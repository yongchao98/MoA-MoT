    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structural Information:**\n    *   The compound is a **di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring**. This indicates a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by two substituent groups. The core of this part of the molecule is therefore C6H4.\n    *   The FTIR spectrum shows an **ester group**, which has the functional group -COO-. This adds 1 carbon and 2 oxygen atoms to the formula.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:** The NMR spectrum gives us crucial information about the hydrogen environments and their connectivity.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons (C6H4). The fact that they appear as two signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely para-substitution (1,4-disubstituted), which would give two doublets. This confirms the C6H4 part of the structure.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a very characteristic splitting pattern. It strongly suggests a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) attached to the aromatic ring.\n        *   Let's label the group as Ar-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n        *   The vinyl proton H(a) is split by H(b), resulting in a **doublet**.\n        *   The vinyl proton H(b) is split by H(a) (a doublet) and by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (a quartet). This combined splitting results in a **doublet of quartets**.\n        *   This fragment is -CH=CH-CH3 and contributes 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** We have identified two separate methyl groups in the structure.\n        *   One methyl group is part of the propenyl substituent (-CH=CH-CH3). Its signal would be a doublet, as it is split by the adjacent vinyl proton H(b).\n        *   The second methyl group must be part of the ester functionality. To give a separate signal (and be consistent with having no -CH2- groups), it is most likely a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate group attached via oxygen (-O-CO-CH3). In either case, this methyl group would be a singlet as it has no adjacent protons to couple with. This fragment contributes 1 carbon and 3 hydrogens.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a key constraint that eliminates many possibilities, such as ethyl esters (-COOCH2CH3) or propyl substituents (-CH2CH2CH3). Our proposed fragments (-CH=CH-CH3 and -COOCH3) adhere to this rule.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Molecular Fragments and Determine the Formula:**\n    Now, let's sum the atoms from all the identified fragments to find the molecular formula.\n    *   **From the aromatic ring:** C6H4\n    *   **From the propenyl group:** C3H5 (-CH=CH-CH3)\n    *   **From the ester group:** C1O2 (-COO-)\n    *   **From the second methyl group:** C1H3 (-CH3)\n\n    Let's combine them. A possible structure is Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate.\n    *   Total Carbons (C): 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 1 (ester C=O) + 1 (ester CH3) = **11**\n    *   Total Hydrogens (H): 4 (ring) + 5 (propenyl) + 3 (ester CH3) = **12**\n    *   Total Oxygens (O): **2** (ester)\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    *   A) C12H14O2\n    *   B) C11H14O2\n    *   C) C11H12O2\n    *   D) C12H12O2\n\n    Our deduced formula, C11H12O2, matches option C.\n\n5.  **Verify the Consistency (Sanity Check):**\n    We can calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for our proposed structure and formula.\n    *   DoU = C - H/2 + 1\n    *   For C11H12O2: DoU = 11 - (12/2) + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = 6.\n    *   Our structure contains: 1 benzene ring (4 DoU) + 1 C=C double bond (1 DoU) + 1 C=O double bond (1 DoU) = 6 DoU.\n    *   The DoU is consistent. The other formulas either have a different DoU (C11H14O2 has DoU=5, C12H12O2 has DoU=7) or would require adding a -CH2- group (C12H14O2 has DoU=6, but is C11H12O2 + CH2), which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n\nTherefore, based on a logical interpretation of all the provided spectroscopic data, the correct chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
