    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThe substituents are in a 1,2,3-arrangement.\n*   -OEt and -tBu are ortho to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are ortho to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are meta to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze Directing Effects**\n\nUnderstanding the directing effects of each group in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS) is crucial:\n*   **-OEt (Ethoxy)**: Strongly activating, ortho/para director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-Butyl)**: Activating, ortho/para director. It is bulky, which can sterically hinder substitution at the ortho position.\n*   **-NO2 (Nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, meta director.\n*   **-NH2 (Amino)**: Strongly activating, ortho/para director. Can be converted to -OH.\n*   **-OH (Hydroxy)**: Strongly activating, ortho/para director. Can be converted to -OEt.\n*   **-SO3H (Sulfonic acid)**: Strongly deactivating, meta director. Crucially, it can be used as a \"blocking group\" because it can be added and later removed (desulfonation) with dilute acid and heat/steam.\n\n**3. Evaluate Simple Synthetic Strategies**\n\nA simple sequence of substitutions is unlikely to work due to the directing effects.\n*   **If nitration is the last step**: The precursor would be 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butylbenzene. The powerful -OEt group directs incoming electrophiles (like NO2+) to its ortho (position 6) and para (position 4) positions. The desired position 3 is not favored.\n*   **If alkylation (adding -tBu) is the last step**: The precursor would be 1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The ring is strongly deactivated by the -NO2 group, making Friedel-Crafts alkylation very difficult and low-yield.\n*   **If etherification (adding -OEt) is the last step**: The precursor would be 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol. Direct nitration of o-tert-butylphenol would not yield the required 3-nitro isomer.\n\nThis analysis strongly suggests that a more complex strategy involving blocking groups and functional group interconversions is required to force the substituents into the desired positions.\n\n**4. Devise a Plausible Advanced Synthesis**\n\nLet's try to construct a valid synthetic pathway that achieves the 1,2,3-pattern. The key is often to block the most reactive position (para) to force substitution into a less favored one (ortho).\nThe following sequence is a known strategy for complex trisubstituted benzenes:\n\n1.  **Alkylation**: Start with benzene and add the tert-butyl group.\n    *   Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 → **tert-butylbenzene**.\n2.  **Blocking**: Block the most reactive para position with a sulfonic acid group.\n    *   tert-butylbenzene + SO3/H2SO4 → **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n3.  **First Nitration**: Nitrate the blocked ring. The -tBu group (o,p-director) and the -SO3H group (m-director) both direct the incoming -NO2 group to the position ortho to the -tBu group.\n    *   → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. This nitro group will eventually be converted into the ethoxy group.\n4.  **Reduction**: Reduce the nitro group to an amino group.\n    *   + Fe/HCl → **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n5.  **Diazotization**: Convert the amino group into a diazonium salt, a versatile intermediate.\n    *   + NaNO2/HCl → **2-diazonium-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n6.  **Hydrolysis**: Convert the diazonium salt to a hydroxyl (phenol) group by warming in water.\n    *   + H2O/Heat → **2-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n7.  **Second Nitration**: Now, introduce the final nitro group. We nitrate the phenol derivative. The directing groups are -OH (strong o,p), -tBu (o,p), and -SO3H (m). All three groups direct an incoming electrophile to position 3 (ortho to -OH and -tBu, meta to -SO3H).\n    *   + HNO3/H2SO4 → **3-nitro-2-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This is the key regioselective step.\n8.  **Desulfonation (Unblocking)**: Remove the sulfonic acid blocking group.\n    *   + dilute H2SO4/Heat → **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n9.  **Etherification**: Convert the phenol to the final ethoxy ether using a Williamson ether synthesis.\n    *   + NaOH/EtBr → **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (TARGET!)\n\n**5. Match the Synthesis to the Options**\n\nNow, let's check which option provides the necessary set of reagents for this valid 9-step synthesis.\n\n*   **My derived reagent list**: (i) tBuCl/AlCl3, (ii) SO3/H2SO4, (iii) HNO3/H2SO4, (iv) Fe/HCl, (v) NaNO2/HCl, (vi) H2O/Heat, (vii) a second HNO3/H2SO4, (viii) dilute H2SO4/Heat, (ix) NaOH/EtBr.\n\nLet's examine the options:\n\n*   **A)**, **B)**, and **D)** do not follow the blocking group strategy from the start or have the reagents in an order that cannot lead to the target product. For instance, they don't use sulfonation as an initial blocking step.\n*   **C) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; viii) dilute H2SO4 ix) NaOH/EtBr**\n\nLet's analyze the reagents listed in Option C:\n*   (i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Matches step 1.\n*   (ii) `SO3/H2SO4`: Matches step 2.\n*   (iii) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Matches step 3.\n*   (iv) `Fe/HCl`: Matches step 4.\n*   (v) `NaNO2/HCl`: Matches step 5.\n*   (vi) `HNO3/H2SO4`: Matches step 7 (the second nitration).\n*   (vii) `H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Can perform step 6 (hydrolysis of diazonium salt).\n*   (viii) `dilute H2SO4`: Can be used for step 8 (desulfonation, often with heat from step vii).\n*   (ix) `NaOH/EtBr`: Matches step 9.\n\nAlthough the numeric ordering in option C is nonsensical and contains typos (e.g., placing a nitration step right after diazotization), it is the only option that contains the complete and correct *set of reagents* required for the logical, high-yield synthesis devised above. The question asks for the \"sequence of reactions,\" and option C lists all the necessary reactions.\n\n<<<C>>>"
