    "This problem involves the reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia, which proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\n**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactant and Reagents:**\n    *   Reactant: 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene molecule with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (an isotope of hydrogen, D) at position 2. All other positions (3, 4, 5, 6) have regular hydrogen atoms (H).\n    *   Reagent: Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). The amide ion (NH₂⁻) is a very strong base.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    The reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base like NaNH₂ is a classic benzyne reaction. It occurs in two main steps:\n    *   **Elimination:** The strong base abstracts a proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to the carbon bearing the leaving group (bromine). This is followed by the elimination of the halide ion to form a highly reactive benzyne intermediate, which contains a formal triple bond within the benzene ring.\n    *   **Addition:** A nucleophile (in this case, the amide ion, NH₂⁻) attacks one of the carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃) to give the final product.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Elimination Step for 1-bromobenzene-2-d:**\n    The bromine atom is at C1. The *ortho* positions are C2 and C6.\n    *   At C2, there is a deuterium (D) atom.\n    *   At C6, there is a hydrogen (H) atom.\n\n    The strong base NH₂⁻ can abstract a proton/deuteron from either of these *ortho* positions, leading to two possible elimination pathways:\n\n    *   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6:**\n        *   The NH₂⁻ ion removes the proton (H⁺) from C6.\n        *   The bromide ion (Br⁻) is eliminated from C1.\n        *   This forms a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is called **3-deuteriobenzyne**.\n\n         \n\n    *   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2:**\n        *   The NH₂⁻ ion removes the deuteron (D⁺) from C2. (Note: The C-D bond is stronger than the C-H bond, so this pathway is kinetically less favorable due to the kinetic isotope effect, but it is still a possible reaction).\n        *   The bromide ion (Br⁻) is eliminated from C1.\n        *   This forms a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is lost from the molecule. This intermediate is the standard, unlabeled **benzyne**.\n\n         \n\n4.  **Analyze the Addition Step for each Benzyne Intermediate:**\n    The nucleophile NH₂⁻ will now attack the benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Addition to 3-deuteriobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n        This intermediate is unsymmetrical. The triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium is at C2. The NH₂⁻ can attack either C1 or C6.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** If NH₂⁻ adds to C1, a negative charge develops at C6. Protonation of C6 by the solvent (NH₃) yields **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** If NH₂⁻ adds to C6, a negative charge develops at C1. Protonation of C1 by the solvent yields **3-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   Therefore, Pathway A leads to two distinct organic products.\n\n    *   **Addition to unlabeled benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n        This intermediate is symmetrical. The triple bond is between C1 and C2. Attack by NH₂⁻ at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation, will lead to the same single product.\n        *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** The product is **aniline** (with no deuterium).\n        *   Therefore, Pathway B leads to one organic product.\n\n5.  **Count the Total Number of Possible Products:**\n    Combining the products from both possible pathways, we have:\n    1.  2-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n    2.  3-deuterioaniline (from Pathway A)\n    3.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n\n    These three molecules are structurally distinct. Therefore, there are a total of **3** possible organic products.\n\n<<<B>>>"
