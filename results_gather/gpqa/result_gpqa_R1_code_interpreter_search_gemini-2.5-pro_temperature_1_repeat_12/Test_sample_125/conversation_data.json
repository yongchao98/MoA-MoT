    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a ketone with a pre-existing chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), which has the (S) configuration.\n    *   The structure is: CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃. The chiral center is the carbon with the methoxy group.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone group (C=O) at C3 to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Product:** 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the product:**\n    *   The reaction does not affect the original stereocenter at C5, so it remains (S).\n    *   The reduction of the ketone at C3 creates a new chiral center. The carbonyl carbon at C3 is prochiral. The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack from either the front face or the back face of the carbonyl group.\n    *   This non-selective attack creates both possible configurations at C3, i.e., (R) and (S).\n    *   Therefore, two products are formed:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two products have the same molecular formula and connectivity but are not mirror images of each other (because one center is the same (S) while the other is different (R vs. S)). They are **diastereomers**.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   This is a symmetric diketone: CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃. It is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups.\n*   **Product:** Pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   Structure: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the product:**\n    *   The reduction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   Let's analyze these possibilities:\n        *   **(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S):** These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the starting material is achiral, they will be formed in equal amounts, resulting in a racemic mixture.\n        *   **(2R, 4S):** This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry passing through the C3 atom. A molecule with chiral centers and an internal plane of symmetry is a **meso compound**.\n        *   **(2S, 4R):** This is identical to the (2R, 4S) meso compound (you can confirm this by rotating the molecule).\n    *   Therefore, three stereoisomers are formed:\n        1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (the enantiomer of the above)\n        3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the two enantiomers.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the combined products with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It is an **achiral** technique.\n*   **Key principle:** Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and **cannot** be separated (they co-elute as a single peak).\n*   The combined mixture contains 5 total compounds from the two reactions.\n    *   **From Reaction I:** Two diastereomers. Since they have different properties, they will separate into **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II:** A meso compound and a pair of enantiomers. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will have a different retention time. The two enantiomers will co-elute. This results in **2 peaks** (one for the meso compound, one for the racemic pair of enantiomers).\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇ methoxy-alcohols) and Reaction II (C₅ diols) are structurally very different molecules. It is extremely unlikely that any product from Reaction I would co-elute with a product from Reaction II.\n*   **Total peaks in normal-phase HPLC** = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the combined products with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. It can separate molecules that differ in their three-dimensional structure.\n*   **Key principle:** Chiral HPLC can separate **both diastereomers and enantiomers**.\n*   The combined mixture contains 5 distinct stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   A chiral column can distinguish between all of these. The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated. The two enantiomers from Reaction II will be separated. The meso compound from Reaction II is a diastereomer to all the other chiral products and will also have a unique retention time.\n*   Therefore, each of the 5 compounds will produce its own peak.\n*   **Total peaks in chiral HPLC** = **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the combined product mixture will exhibit:\n*   **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n*   **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
