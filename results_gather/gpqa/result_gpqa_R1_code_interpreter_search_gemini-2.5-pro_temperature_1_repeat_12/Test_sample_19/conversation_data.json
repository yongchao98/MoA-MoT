    "An analysis of the assumptions is as follows:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.** This is the primary tenet of the impulse approximation. It assumes that the interaction with the nucleus can be described as a sum of interactions with its individual constituent nucleons. This neglects more complex phenomena like meson-exchange currents, where the interaction probe interacts with the particles (mesons) that mediate the force between nucleons. This assumption is essential.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.** This assumption deals with what happens before and after the primary interaction. It posits that the incoming probe and the outgoing struck nucleon do not interact with the other \"spectator\" nucleons in the nucleus. This is known as neglecting \"initial-state interactions\" (ISI) and \"final-state interactions\" (FSI). This is a crucial part of making the calculation resemble a free-nucleon interaction, as a truly free nucleon would not have its outgoing path distorted by a nuclear medium. This is a core component of the simplified \"Plane Wave Impulse Approximation\" (PWIA), which is often what is meant by the impulse approximation in a general context.\n\n3.  **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.** This assumption concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself. The impulse approximation is about the nucleon's behavior *within the nucleus*, not its own internal dynamics. One can apply the impulse approximation using either a relativistic or non-relativistic description of the nucleon's structure. Therefore, this is not a necessary assumption for the impulse approximation.\n\n4.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.** This is the \"impulse\" part of the name. It assumes the interaction happens over a very short timescale, so short that the nucleon's state within the nucleus (its momentum and position) is effectively \"frozen.\" During this brief interaction, the potential that binds the nucleon to the nucleus can be ignored. This is a fundamental part of treating the nucleon as a free particle at the moment of interaction.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation (treating a bound nucleon as a free one) are:\n*   The interaction happens with a single nucleon (Assumption 1).\n*   The nucleon is treated as unbound during the short interaction (Assumption 4).\n*   The probe and the struck nucleon do not interact with the rest of the nucleus on their way in or out (Assumption 2).\n\nTherefore, the correct assumptions are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
