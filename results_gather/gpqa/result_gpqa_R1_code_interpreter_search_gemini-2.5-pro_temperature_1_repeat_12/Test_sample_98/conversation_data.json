    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this data confirms the class of compound but doesn't distinguish between the options.\n\n### **2. Analyze the General 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C-H). Their absence means the molecule is saturated (contains no C=C double bonds). All four candidate structures are saturated, so this information is consistent with all of them.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Specific 1H NMR Splitting Patterns**\n\nThis is the key to differentiating the structures. The splitting of a proton's signal is determined by the number of non-equivalent protons on adjacent carbons (the n+1 rule). When a proton is coupled to multiple, different sets of neighboring protons, we observe complex multiplets.\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   This means the proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One adjacent proton (1+1 = 2 lines, a **d**oublet)\n        *   A set of two equivalent adjacent protons (2+1 = 3 lines, a **t**riplet)\n        *   A set of three equivalent adjacent protons (3+1 = 4 lines, a **q**uartet)\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    *   This means the proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One adjacent proton (1+1 = 2 lines, a **d**oublet)\n        *   A set of two equivalent adjacent protons (2+1 = 3 lines, a **t**riplet)\n        *   *Another, different* set of two equivalent adjacent protons (2+1 = 3 lines, a **t**riplet)\n\nNow, let's predict the complex splitting patterns for the methine (CH) protons in each candidate structure.\n\n---\n\n**A) CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2-COOH**\n\nLet's label the key protons: `CH3 - CHa(Et) - CHb(Et) - CH2 - COOH`\n\n*   **Proton Ha:** It is on a carbon adjacent to:\n    *   A `CH3` group (3 protons) -> coupling gives a **quartet**.\n    *   The `CHb` group (1 proton) -> coupling gives a **doublet**.\n    *   The `CH2` of its ethyl substituent (2 protons) -> coupling gives a **triplet**.\n    *   Therefore, the signal for **Ha** will be a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first signal.\n\n*   **Proton Hb:** It is on a carbon adjacent to:\n    *   The `CHa` group (1 proton) -> coupling gives a **doublet**.\n    *   The `CH2` of its ethyl substituent (2 protons) -> coupling gives a **triplet**.\n    *   The `CH2-COOH` group (2 protons) -> coupling gives a **triplet**.\n    *   Therefore, the signal for **Hb** will be a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second signal.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** This structure is expected to show both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal. It is a perfect match.\n\n---\n\n**B) CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH**\n\nLet's label the key protons: `CH3 - CHa(Me) - CHb(Me) - CH2 - COOH`\n\n*   **Proton Ha:** Adjacent to `CH3` (3H), `CHb` (1H), and another `CH3` (3H). This would result in a doublet of quartets of quartets (dqq). This does not match `dtt`.\n*   **Proton Hb:** Adjacent to `CHa` (1H), `CH3` (3H), and `CH2-COOH` (2H). This would result in a doublet of triplets of quartets (`dtq`). This matches one signal, but the other signal (`dqq`) does not match `dtt`.\n\n**Conclusion for B:** Incorrect. Does not have a `dtt` signal.\n\n---\n\n**C) CH3CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH**\n\nLet's label the key protons: `CH3CH2 - CHa(Me) - CHb(Me) - COOH`\n\n*   **Proton Ha:** Adjacent to `CH2` of the ethyl group (2H), `CHb` (1H), and `CH3` (3H). This gives a doublet of triplets of quartets (`dtq`). This matches one signal.\n*   **Proton Hb:** Adjacent to `CHa` (1H) and `CH3` (3H). This gives a doublet of quartets (`dq`). This does not match `dtt`.\n\n**Conclusion for C:** Incorrect. Does not have a `dtt` signal.\n\n---\n\n**D) CH3CH2-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-COOH**\n\nLet's label the key protons: `CH3CH2 - CHa(Et) - CHb(Et) - COOH`\n\n*   **Proton Ha:** Adjacent to `CH2` of the main chain ethyl group (2H), `CHb` (1H), and the `CH2` of its ethyl substituent (2H). This gives a doublet of triplets of triplets (`dtt`). This matches one signal.\n*   **Proton Hb:** Adjacent to `CHa` (1H) and the `CH2` of its ethyl substituent (2H). This gives a doublet of triplets (`dt`). This does not match `dtq`.\n\n**Conclusion for D:** Incorrect. Does not have a `dtq` signal.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nOnly structure **A** is predicted to have two different methine (CH) protons that give a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** and a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**, respectively. This perfectly matches the experimental 1H NMR data provided.\n\n<<<A>>>"
