    "This problem requires us to calculate the distribution of cobalt(II) species in a solution containing thiocyanate ions. We need to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species.\n\n**1. Identify all cobalt-containing species:**\nIn the presence of thiocyanate (SCN⁻, which we'll denote as L⁻), the Co²⁺ ion can form a series of complexes. The species present in the solution are:\n*   Free Co²⁺ ion: `[Co²⁺]`\n*   Monothiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)⁺]` or `[CoL⁺]`\n*   Dithiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)₂]` or `[CoL₂]`\n*   Trithiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻` or `[CoL₃]⁻`\n*   Tetrathiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻` or `[CoL₄]²⁻`\n\n**2. Express concentrations using stability constants (β):**\nThe overall stability constants (βₙ) are given for the formation reaction: `Co²⁺ + nL⁻ ⇌ [CoLₙ]²⁻ⁿ`.\nThe expression for each βₙ is: `βₙ = [CoLₙ] / ([Co²⁺][L⁻]ⁿ)`.\nWe can rearrange these to express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free Co²⁺ concentration, `[Co²⁺]`, and the free ligand concentration, `[L⁻]`:\n*   `[CoL⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [L⁻]`\n*   `[CoL₂] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [L⁻]²`\n*   `[CoL₃]⁻ = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [L⁻]³`\n*   `[CoL₄]²⁻ = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [L⁻]⁴`\n\n**3. Define the total cobalt concentration:**\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [CoL⁺] + [CoL₂] + [CoL₃]⁻ + [CoL₄]²⁻`\n\nSubstituting the expressions from step 2:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][L⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][L⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][L⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][L⁻]⁴`\n\nFactoring out `[Co²⁺]`:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[L⁻] + β₂[L⁻]² + β₃[L⁻]³ + β₄[L⁻]⁴)`\n\n**4. Calculate the fraction (α₂) of the desired species:**\nThe fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, `[CoL₂]`, which we denote as α₂, is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration:\n`α₂ = [CoL₂] / c(Co)`\n\nSubstitute the expressions for `[CoL₂]` and `c(Co)`:\n`α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][L⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[L⁻] + β₂[L⁻]² + β₃[L⁻]³ + β₄[L⁻]⁴))`\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, simplifying the expression:\n`α₂ = (β₂[L⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[L⁻] + β₂[L⁻]² + β₃[L⁻]³ + β₄[L⁻]⁴)`\n\nNote that the total cobalt concentration, `c(Co) = 10⁻² M`, is not needed for this calculation, as we are asked for the relative percentage. The problem states the thiocyanate concentration `[SCN⁻]` is 0.1 M, which we use as the equilibrium free ligand concentration `[L⁻]`.\n\n**5. Substitute the given values and calculate:**\n*   `[L⁻]` = `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nLet's calculate the terms for the denominator:\n*   `β₁[L⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9`\n*   `β₂[L⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   `β₃[L⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n*   `β₄[L⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\nNow, calculate the denominator (sum of all terms):\nDenominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nThe numerator is the term for the `[CoL₂]` species:\nNumerator = `β₂[L⁻]² = 0.4`\n\nNow, calculate the fraction α₂:\n`α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo get the percentage, multiply the fraction by 100:\nPercentage = `0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThis value corresponds to option C.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nL = 0.1  # Concentration of [SCN-]\n\n# The denominator of the fraction formula, often called the alpha-function denominator\ndenominator = 1 + beta1*L**1 + beta2*L**2 + beta3*L**3 + beta4*L**4\n\n# The numerator for the species [Co(SCN)2]\nnumerator = beta2 * L**2\n\n# Calculate the fraction (alpha2)\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"{percentage=}\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
