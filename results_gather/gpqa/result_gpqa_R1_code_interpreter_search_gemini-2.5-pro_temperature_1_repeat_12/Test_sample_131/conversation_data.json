    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Initial Clues**\n\n*   The molecular formula for all compounds is given as C10H14. Let's verify this for the four options.\n    *   Tetramethylbenzene: C6H2(CH3)4 = C6H2 * C4H12 = C10H14. This is correct for 1,2,4,5-, 1,2,3,5-, and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n    *   Diethylbenzene: C6H4(C2H5)2 = C6H4 * C4H10 = C10H14. This is also correct for 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n*   The spectrum is of a 1:1 mixture of two of these compounds.\n*   The key information is from the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nWe need to predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each individual compound to see how they would combine in a mixture. We are looking for the number of signals, their multiplicity (singlet, doublet, etc.), and their integration (number of protons).\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The mixture shows two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   Since it's a 1:1 molar mixture, this means each compound contributes one aromatic singlet, and both singlets correspond to the same number of protons.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** The mixture shows three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n    *   The signals are all singlets, which means there is no proton-proton coupling for the alkyl groups. This rules out any ethyl groups (-CH2CH3), as they would produce a quartet and a triplet.\n    *   This immediately eliminates **1,4-diethylbenzene**, which would show a quartet and a triplet in the alkyl region. Therefore, option **A) is incorrect**.\n    *   The total number of alkyl protons (methyl groups) in a 1:1 mixture of any two tetramethylbenzenes is 12 + 12 = 24 protons.\n    *   The integration ratio is 2:1:1. The sum of the ratios is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.\n    *   We can calculate the number of protons for each signal:\n        *   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24 protons = 12H\n        *   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24 protons = 6H\n        *   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24 protons = 6H\n    *   So, we are looking for a pair of compounds that, when mixed 1:1, produce three alkyl singlets with integrations corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n**3. Predict the Spectra for the Remaining Candidate Compounds**\n\nLet's predict the number and integration of signals for each of the three tetramethylbenzene isomers. We use symmetry to determine chemical equivalence.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three sets of non-equivalent methyl groups:\n        *   The methyls at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl at C5 is unique (3H).\n        *   This produces **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. Although they are adjacent, the coupling is often not resolved for such symmetrical systems, leading to **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of non-equivalent methyl groups:\n        *   The methyls at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyls at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   This produces **two singlets (6H, 6H)**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Remaining Options**\n\nNow we test the combinations in options B, C, and D to see which one produces the observed spectrum {Aromatic: two 1:1 singlets; Alkyl: three singlets with 12H, 6H, 6H integration}.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Alkyl signals from 1,2,3,4-TMB: {6H, 6H}\n    *   Alkyl signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB: {6H, 3H, 3H}\n    *   Combined: {6H, 6H, 6H, 3H, 3H}. This is five signals unless there is overlap. No combination of these produces the required {12H, 6H, 6H} pattern.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Alkyl signals from 1,2,4,5-TMB: {12H}\n    *   Alkyl signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB: {6H, 3H, 3H}\n    *   Combined: {12H, 6H, 3H, 3H}. This is four signals. To get three signals, we would have to assume the two 3H signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB accidentally have the same chemical shift. This would result in signals of {12H, 6H, 6H}, matching the required pattern. However, this relies on an assumption of accidental equivalence between chemically different methyl groups (one is between two methyls, the other is between two hydrogens), which is less likely than a solution that requires no such assumptions.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives a 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives a 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this will result in **two singlets of equal intensity (1:1 ratio)**. This perfectly matches the data.\n    *   **Alkyl Region:**\n        *   Signals from 1,2,4,5-TMB: **one singlet (12H)**.\n        *   Signals from 1,2,3,4-TMB: **two singlets (6H, 6H)**.\n        *   Combined signals in the mixture: **three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n        *   The ratio of these integrations is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the data.\n\nThis combination explains all features of the NMR spectrum directly, without requiring any assumptions about accidental signal overlap.\n\n<<<D>>>"
