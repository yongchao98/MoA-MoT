    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Metric and the Area Element**\n\nThe given metric is:\n$ds^{2}=\\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}(dx^{2}+dy^{2})$\n\nIn Riemannian geometry, for a 2-dimensional surface with coordinates $(x, y)$, the metric tensor $g_{ij}$ is a 2x2 matrix. The line element is given by $ds^2 = g_{xx}dx^2 + 2g_{xy}dxdy + g_{yy}dy^2$.\n\nBy comparing this with the given metric, we can identify the components of the metric tensor:\n$g_{xx} = \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}$\n$g_{yy} = \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}$\n$g_{xy} = g_{yx} = 0$\n\nSo, the metric tensor is:\n$g = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe area element $dA$ on the surface is given by the formula $dA = \\sqrt{\\det(g)} \\, dx \\, dy$.\n\n**2. Calculate the Area Element**\n\nFirst, we calculate the determinant of the metric tensor, $\\det(g)$:\n$\\det(g) = g_{xx}g_{yy} - g_{xy}^2 = \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\\right) - 0^2 = \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\\right)^2$\n\nNow, we find the square root to get the area element:\n$\\sqrt{\\det(g)} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\\right)^2} = \\left|\\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\\right|$\n\n**3. Determine the Domain of Integration**\n\nThe metric is physically meaningful only when the components are real and the metric is positive-definite. The term $4-x^2-y^2$ in the denominator indicates a singularity when $x^2+y^2=4$. For the metric to be positive, we must have $4-x^2-y^2 > 0$, which means $x^2+y^2 < 4$.\nThis inequality defines the domain of our coordinates $(x,y)$, which is an open disk $D$ of radius 2 centered at the origin.\nWithin this domain, $4-x^2-y^2$ is always positive, so we can drop the absolute value.\n\nThe area element is:\n$dA = \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} \\, dx \\, dy$\n\n**4. Set Up the Area Integral**\n\nThe total area $A$ is found by integrating the area element $dA$ over the entire domain $D$:\n$A = \\iint_{D} \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} \\, dx \\, dy$\n\n**5. Evaluate the Integral using Polar Coordinates**\n\nThe integral is much easier to evaluate in polar coordinates. Let's make the substitution:\n$x = r \\cos\\theta$\n$y = r \\sin\\theta$\n\nThis implies $x^2+y^2 = r^2$. The differential area element in Cartesian coordinates relates to polar coordinates by $dx \\, dy = r \\, dr \\, d\\theta$.\n\nThe domain of integration $D$, which is the disk $x^2+y^2 < 4$, becomes:\n$0 \\le r < 2$\n$0 \\le \\theta \\le 2\\pi$\n\nSubstituting these into the area integral:\n$A = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32}{4-r^2} \\cdot r \\, dr \\, d\\theta$\n\nWe can separate the integrals with respect to $\\theta$ and $r$:\n$A = \\left(\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32r}{4-r^2} \\, dr\\right)$\n\nThe first integral is straightforward:\n$\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta = [\\theta]_{0}^{2\\pi} = 2\\pi$\n\nSo, the area is:\n$A = 2\\pi \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32r}{4-r^2} \\, dr$\n\n**6. Evaluate the Improper Integral**\n\nThe integral with respect to $r$ is an improper integral because the integrand $\\frac{32r}{4-r^2}$ becomes infinite as $r$ approaches 2. We must evaluate it using a limit:\n$A = 64\\pi \\lim_{b \\to 2^{-}} \\int_{0}^{b} \\frac{r}{4-r^2} \\, dr$\n\nTo solve the integral, we use the substitution $u = 4-r^2$. Then $du = -2r \\, dr$, or $r \\, dr = -\\frac{1}{2} du$.\nThe limits of integration for $u$ are:\nWhen $r=0$, $u = 4-0^2 = 4$.\nWhen $r=b$, $u = 4-b^2$.\n\nThe integral becomes:\n$\\int_{4}^{4-b^2} \\frac{1}{u} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} du\\right) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\int_{4}^{4-b^2} \\frac{1}{u} du = -\\frac{1}{2} [\\ln|u|]_{4}^{4-b^2}$\n$= -\\frac{1}{2} (\\ln|4-b^2| - \\ln|4|)$\n\nNow we take the limit as $b \\to 2^{-}$:\n$\\lim_{b \\to 2^{-}} \\left[-\\frac{1}{2} (\\ln(4-b^2) - \\ln(4))\\right]$\n\nAs $b \\to 2^{-}$, the term $4-b^2$ approaches $0^{+}$. The natural logarithm $\\ln(z)$ approaches $-\\infty$ as $z \\to 0^{+}$.\nSo, $\\lim_{b \\to 2^{-}} \\ln(4-b^2) = -\\infty$.\n\nThe value of the integral is:\n$-\\frac{1}{2} (-\\infty - \\ln(4)) = +\\infty$\n\nTherefore, the total area is:\n$A = 64\\pi \\times (+\\infty) = +\\infty$\n\nThe area of the pseudosphere is infinite.\n\n<<<C>>>"
