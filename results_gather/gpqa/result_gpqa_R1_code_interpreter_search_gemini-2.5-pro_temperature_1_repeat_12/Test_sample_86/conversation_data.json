    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular structure from the given information.**\n\n1.  **Core Structure:** The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring,\" which means it's a benzene ring with two substituents. A benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n2.  **Total Carbons:** The compound has \"8 carbon atoms in total.\" This means the two substituents together must contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n3.  **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   A \"carbonyl group\" (C=O) is present.\n    *   An \"aromatic-halogen bond\" (Ar-X) is present. This means one of the substituents is a halogen atom (like Cl, Br, I) directly attached to the benzene ring.\n4.  **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X). Halogens do not contain carbon.\n    *   Therefore, the other substituent must contain both of the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group.\n    *   A substituent with 2 carbons and a carbonyl group is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   Thus, the compound is a haloacetophenone. The structure consists of a benzene ring substituted with a halogen atom and an acetyl group.\n5.  **Isomerism:** Since the ring is di-substituted, there are three possible isomers: ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), and para (1,4). The 1H NMR data, particularly the pattern in the aromatic region, will help distinguish between them. A highly symmetric pattern, like two doublets, strongly suggests the para isomer.\n\n**Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for the most likely structure (para-haloacetophenone).**\n\n*   **Structure:** A para-substituted benzene ring with -X at position 4 and -COCH3 at position 1.\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry along the axis passing through the two substituents. This simplifies the NMR spectrum.\n*   **Aromatic Protons (Ar-H):** There are 4 protons on the ring. Due to symmetry, they are of two types:\n    *   Two protons are ortho to the acetyl group (and meta to the halogen). They are chemically equivalent. They will be split by their single neighbor, resulting in a doublet. These protons are adjacent to the strongly electron-withdrawing carbonyl group, so they will be shifted significantly downfield (typically > 7.7 ppm).\n    *   Two protons are ortho to the halogen (and meta to the acetyl group). They are also chemically equivalent and will appear as a doublet. They will be less downfield than the other pair.\n    *   So, we expect to see **two doublets, each integrating to 2H**, in the aromatic region (7.0-8.0 ppm).\n*   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):** The acetyl group has three protons. These protons are not adjacent to any other protons, so they will appear as a **singlet, integrating to 3H**. Because they are attached to a carbonyl carbon, their chemical shift will be around 2.5-2.7 ppm.\n\n**Summary of Predicted Spectrum:**\n*   A doublet (2H) in the aromatic region.\n*   A doublet (2H) in the aromatic region.\n*   A singlet (3H) in the alkyl region (~2.6 ppm).\n\n**Step 3: Compare the prediction with the given options.**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The 9.9 ppm signal is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone. The structure would have to be a halo-phenylacetaldehyde. For that structure, the signal at 3.7 ppm (CH2) should be a doublet and the signal at 9.9 ppm (CHO) should be a triplet (or a broad singlet due to small coupling), not singlets as listed. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d):** This pattern perfectly matches the expected two doublets for a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n    *   **2.3 (3H, s):** This is a singlet integrating to 3H, which perfectly matches the acetyl methyl group. The chemical shift of 2.3 ppm is slightly lower than the typical ~2.6 ppm but is entirely plausible and the most reasonable fit.\n    *   This option is an excellent match for para-haloacetophenone.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum lacks any signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). This cannot be correct for a compound containing a benzene ring.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows only one aromatic proton (1H at 6.9 ppm). A di-substituted benzene ring must have four aromatic protons. This is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, the compound is a para-haloacetophenone. The 1H NMR data in option B is the only one that correctly represents the number of signals, their multiplicities, integration, and approximate chemical shifts for this structure.\n\n<<<B>>>"
