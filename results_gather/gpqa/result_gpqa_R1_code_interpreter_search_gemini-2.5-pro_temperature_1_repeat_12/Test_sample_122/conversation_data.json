    "This is a problem of special relativity, specifically involving time dilation.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the reasoning and calculation:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference:**\n    *   **Ejecta's frame:** This is the moving frame of reference where time passes \"normally\" for the ejecta. The time given in this frame is the *proper time* ($t_0$).\n    *   **Galaxy's frame:** This is the stationary frame of reference from which we are observing the ejecta's motion. Time in this frame will appear dilated (to run slower) for the moving ejecta.\n\n2.  **List the known values:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames, `v` = 60,000 km/s.\n    *   The proper time elapsed in the ejecta's frame, `t_0` = 50 s.\n    *   The speed of light, `c` ≈ 300,000 km/s.\n\n3.  **Determine the goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's frame of reference (`d_galaxy`). The formula for this distance is `d_galaxy = v * t_galaxy`, where `t_galaxy` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n4.  **Apply the time dilation formula:**\n    *   The relationship between time in the stationary frame (`t_galaxy`) and the proper time in the moving frame (`t_0`) is given by the time dilation formula:\n        `t_galaxy = γ * t_0`\n    *   `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n    *   First, find the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Next, square this ratio:\n        `(v/c)^2 = (0.2)^2 = 0.04`\n    *   Now, calculate `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the time in the Galaxy's frame (`t_galaxy`):**\n    *   `t_galaxy = γ * t_0 = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n7.  **Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (`d_galaxy`):**\n    *   `d_galaxy = v * t_galaxy`\n    *   `d_galaxy = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n    *   Rearranging the terms for easier calculation:\n        `d_galaxy = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96)`\n        `d_galaxy = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\nTo get the final numerical value, let's use a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # km/s\nt0 = 50  # proper time in seconds\nc = 300000 # speed of light in km/s (using the common approximation as the values are round)\n\n# Calculate the distance\n# d = v * t_galaxy = v * (gamma * t0)\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\n# d = v * t0 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\n\ndistance = (v * t0) / math.sqrt(1 - (v/c)**2)\n\nprint(distance)\n```\n>>>\n3061862.1784783633\n\nThe calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km. Comparing this result with the given options:\nA) 3,060,000 km\nB) 2,940,000 km\nC) 2,880,000 km\nD) 3,000,000 km\n\nThe value 3,061,862 km is closest to 3,060,000 km. The small difference is likely due to rounding in the problem's intended values or the options. Option A is the clear choice.\n\nNote: If we were to ignore relativity (incorrectly), the distance would be `d = v * t = 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km`, which is option D. However, the velocity is a significant fraction of the speed of light (20%), so relativistic effects must be considered.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem requires us to calculate the distance traveled by the supernova ejecta as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame. Since the ejecta is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light (20%), we must use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n**1. Identify the given information:**\n*   Relative velocity, `v` = 60,000 km/s.\n*   Proper time (time in the ejecta's frame), `t₀` = 50 s.\n*   Speed of light, `c` ≈ 300,000 km/s.\n\n**2. Understand the physics:**\n*   From the perspective of an observer in the Galaxy's frame, time for the moving ejecta will appear to pass more slowly than their own time. This effect is called time dilation.\n*   The distance measured in the Galaxy's frame is the velocity of the ejecta (`v`) multiplied by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`t_galaxy`), not the proper time (`t₀`).\n*   The relationship between the two times is given by the time dilation formula:\n    `t_galaxy = γ * t₀`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n**3. Step-by-step calculation:**\n\n*   **Step A: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n    *   First, find the ratio of the ejecta's velocity to the speed of light:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Next, square this ratio:\n        `(v/c)² = 0.2² = 0.04`\n    *   Now, calculate gamma:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n        `γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`\n\n*   **Step B: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`t_galaxy`).**\n    *   Using the time dilation formula:\n        `t_galaxy = γ * t₀ ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n\n*   **Step C: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (`d_galaxy`).**\n    *   `d_galaxy = v * t_galaxy`\n    *   `d_galaxy ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\nAlternatively, we can combine the formulas:\n`d_galaxy = v * t_galaxy = v * (γ * t₀) = (v * t₀) / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n`d_galaxy = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(1 - (0.2)²) = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96)`\n`d_galaxy ≈ 3,000,000 / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\nThis calculated value is very close to option A. The slight difference is due to rounding in the provided options.\n\n*   Option A: 3,060,000 km\n*   Option D (3,000,000 km) would be the answer if relativity were ignored (`d = v * t₀ = 60,000 * 50`), which is incorrect at this speed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
