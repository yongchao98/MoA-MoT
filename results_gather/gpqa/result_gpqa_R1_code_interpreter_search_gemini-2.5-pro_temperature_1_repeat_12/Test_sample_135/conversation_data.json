    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the problem and relevant theorem:**\n    The problem asks to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field, which is expressed as ∫_V (∇ ⋅ **f**) dV. This form strongly suggests the use of the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem). The Divergence Theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the net flux of the field through the closed surface that encloses the volume. The theorem is stated as:\n    ∫_V (∇ ⋅ **f**) dV = ∮_S (**f** ⋅ d**S**)\n    Where:\n    *   V is the volume.\n    *   S is the closed surface enclosing the volume V.\n    *   **f** is the vector field.\n    *   ∇ ⋅ **f** is the divergence of the vector field.\n    *   d**S** is the outward-pointing differential surface area vector.\n\n2.  **Define the vector field and the surface:**\n    *   **Vector Field (f):** The problem states that the field has a magnitude of 1/r² and is directed radially. In spherical coordinates, this can be written as:\n        **f** = (1/r²) **r̂**\n        where **r̂** is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n    *   **Volume (V) and Surface (S):** The volume is a sphere of radius R centered at the origin. The enclosing surface S is the surface of this sphere.\n\n3.  **Set up the surface integral:**\n    To use the Divergence Theorem, we need to calculate the surface integral ∮_S (**f** ⋅ d**S**).\n    *   First, we evaluate the vector field **f** on the surface S. On the surface of the sphere, the radius r is constant and equal to R. So, the field on the surface is:\n        **f**_surface = (1/R²) **r̂**\n    *   Next, we define the differential surface area vector d**S** for the sphere. For a sphere, the outward normal is always in the radial direction. Therefore, the vector d**S** is parallel to **r̂**. Its magnitude is dS = R² sin(θ) dθ dφ in spherical coordinates. So, the vector is:\n        d**S** = R² sin(θ) dθ dφ **r̂**\n    *   Now, we compute the dot product **f** ⋅ d**S**:\n        **f** ⋅ d**S** = ( (1/R²) **r̂** ) ⋅ ( R² sin(θ) dθ dφ **r̂** )\n        Since **r̂** ⋅ **r̂** = 1, the expression simplifies:\n        **f** ⋅ d**S** = (1/R²) * R² * sin(θ) dθ dφ = sin(θ) dθ dφ\n\n4.  **Evaluate the integral:**\n    Now we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for spherical coordinates for a full sphere are from θ = 0 to π and from φ = 0 to 2π.\n    ∮_S (**f** ⋅ d**S**) = ∫(from φ=0 to 2π) ∫(from θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ dφ\n\n    We can solve the integral in two parts:\n    *   The integral over θ:\n        ∫(from 0 to π) sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)](from 0 to π) = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   The integral over φ:\n        ∫(from 0 to 2π) dφ = [φ](from 0 to 2π) = 2π - 0 = 2π\n\n    Multiplying the results of the two parts gives the final value of the surface integral:\n    ∮_S (**f** ⋅ d**S**) = (2π) * (2) = 4π\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    According to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence of **f** is equal to the surface integral we just calculated.\n    ∫_V (∇ ⋅ **f**) dV = 4π\n\n    *Note on the singularity:* The field **f** = (1/r²) **r̂** is singular at the origin (r=0). A direct calculation of the divergence ∇⋅**f** gives 0 for r ≠ 0, but it is undefined at r=0. In fact, the divergence is a Dirac delta function at the origin, ∇⋅(**r̂**/r²) = 4πδ³(**r**). Integrating this over the volume of the sphere also yields 4π. The Divergence Theorem provides a more straightforward method by avoiding the direct calculation at the singularity.\n\nThe calculated value is 4π, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
