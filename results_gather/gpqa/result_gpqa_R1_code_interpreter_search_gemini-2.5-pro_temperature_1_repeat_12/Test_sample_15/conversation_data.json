    "This problem requires us to determine which of the seven given compounds are optically active. A compound is optically active if and only if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. We will analyze each compound for elements of chirality.\n\n### Analysis of Each Compound\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule is an alkene. The atoms of the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H, the carbon of the methyl group, the first carbon of the ethyl group) all lie in the same plane. Essentially, the entire molecule is planar. A planar molecule possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself). Any molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The core is a norbornane-like system.\n    *   **Analysis:** The IUPAC name itself provides the crucial information. The prefixes `(3aR,7aS)` specify the absolute configuration at two chiral centers (the bridgehead carbons 3a and 7a). The designation of a specific enantiomer with (R) and (S) configurations implies that the molecule is chiral. If it were an achiral meso compound, it would not be named as a single (R,S) enantiomer in this manner. The molecule lacks any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule has two stereocenters at C2 and C3. The configuration is given as (2R, 3S), meaning the two stereocenters have opposite configurations. In molecules with two stereocenters and identical substituents on both centers (like this one), the (R,S) isomer is a meso compound. A meso compound has a center of symmetry or a plane of symmetry in at least one of its conformations. For (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, the staggered conformation possesses a center of inversion, and the eclipsed conformation has a plane of symmetry. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a diastereomer of the compound above. It has two stereocenters with the same configuration, (2R, 3R). This molecule does not have any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which is the (2S, 3S) isomer. Therefore, it is a chiral molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an alcohol group at C1.\n    *   **Analysis:** We need to check for chiral centers. Carbon C1 is bonded to four different groups: (1) -H, (2) -OH, (3) -CH2-CH= (path towards C2), and (4) -CH2-CH2-CH= (path towards C6). Since the two paths around the ring are different, C1 is a chiral center. The name also specifies the (R) configuration, indicating it is a single enantiomer of a chiral compound. The molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The descriptor `(1s,3s,5s)` implies that the three substituents are on the same side of the ring (all *cis*).\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's consider the chair conformation. In the all-*cis* isomer, the three -OH groups can be either all axial or all equatorial. In both cases, the molecule is highly symmetrical. It possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three planes of symmetry. Each plane of symmetry passes through one C-OH group and the opposite C-H bond on the ring. The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral, even though carbons C1, C3, and C5 are stereocenters. This is a meso compound.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)2`\n    *   **Analysis:** We must check for any chiral centers. The cyclopentyl ring has only -CH2- groups. The carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized. The chain is an isobutyl group attached to a methylene: -CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)2. The carbon `CH(CH3)2` is bonded to a hydrogen, a -CH2- group, and two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. There are no chiral centers in the molecule. The molecule also lacks any other element of chirality like axial or planar chirality. Therefore, it is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n### Summary\n\nLet's tally the results:\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>"
