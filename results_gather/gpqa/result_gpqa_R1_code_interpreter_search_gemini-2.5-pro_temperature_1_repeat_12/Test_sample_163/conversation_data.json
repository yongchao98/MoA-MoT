    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M1) to the total mass of system_2 (M2). The total mass of a system is the sum of the masses of its two stars (M = m1 + m2).\n\n2.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K1a, K1b) = 10 km/s and 5 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Orbital Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   Radial Velocity Amplitudes (K2a, K2b) = 15 km/s and 10 km/s\n    *   **Crucial Detail:** Both systems exhibit eclipses. This implies that their orbital planes are viewed edge-on, meaning the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°. For `i = 90°`, `sin(i) = 1`.\n\n3.  **Recall the Relevant Physics Formula:**\n    For a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, the total mass (M = m1 + m2) is related to the orbital period (P) and the orbital velocities (v1, v2) by a combination of Kepler's Third Law and the definition of orbital velocity. The formula for the total mass is:\n    M = (P * (v1 + v2)³) / (2 * π * G)\n    where G is the gravitational constant.\n\n4.  **Relate Observed Quantities to the Formula:**\n    The observed quantities are the amplitudes of the radial velocities (K1, K2), not the true orbital velocities (v1, v2). The relationship is `v_radial = v * sin(i)`. The maximum radial velocity is the amplitude K, so `K = v * sin(i)`.\n    This gives `v = K / sin(i)`.\n    Therefore, `v1 + v2 = (K1 + K2) / sin(i)`.\n\n    Substituting this into the mass formula:\n    M = (P * ((K1 + K2) / sin(i))³) / (2 * π * G)\n    M = (P * (K1 + K2)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))\n\n    Since the systems are eclipsing, we take `sin(i) ≈ 1`, which simplifies the formula to:\n    M ≈ (P * (K1 + K2)³) / (2 * π * G)\n\n5.  **Formulate the Ratio:**\n    We need to find the ratio M1 / M2.\n    M1 / M2 = [ (P1 * (K1a + K1b)³) / (2 * π * G) ] / [ (P2 * (K2a + K2b)³) / (2 * π * G) ]\n\n    The constant term `(2 * π * G)` cancels out, leaving:\n    M1 / M2 = (P1 * (K1a + K1b)³) / (P2 * (K2a + K2b)³)\n\n6.  **Calculate the Values for Each System:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   P1 = 2 years\n        *   K1_total = K1a + K1b = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   P2 = 1 year\n        *   K2_total = K2a + K2b = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n7.  **Compute the Final Ratio:**\n    Substitute the values into the ratio formula. Note that as long as the units are consistent (years for period, km/s for velocity), they will cancel out in the ratio.\n    M1 / M2 = (2 * (15)³) / (1 * (25)³)\n    M1 / M2 = 2 * (15 / 25)³\n    M1 / M2 = 2 * (3 / 5)³\n    M1 / M2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\n    M1 / M2 = 54 / 125\n\n8.  **Final Calculation:**\n    To find the decimal value and compare it with the options, we can use a simple python script.\n\n```python\n# System 1 parameters\nP1 = 2.0  # years\nK1_total = 10.0 + 5.0  # km/s\n\n# System 2 parameters\nP2 = 1.0  # year\nK2_total = 15.0 + 10.0  # km/s\n\n# Calculate the ratio M1 / M2\n# M_ratio = (P1 * K1_total**3) / (P2 * K2_total**3)\nM_ratio = (P1 / P2) * (K1_total / K2_total)**3\n\nprint(M_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.432\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated ratio is 0.432. Comparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.4\nB) ~ 1.2\nC) ~ 0.6\nD) ~ 0.7\n\nThe value 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The reasoning and calculation are as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical law.** For a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, the total mass (M = m₁ + m₂) can be determined from the orbital period (P) and the amplitudes of the radial velocities (K₁ and K₂). The formula, derived from Kepler's Third Law, is:\n    M₁ + M₂ = (P / (2πG)) * ( (K₁ + K₂) / sin(i) )³\n    where G is the gravitational constant and `i` is the inclination of the orbit.\n\n2.  **Use the information about eclipses.** The problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. This means we are viewing the orbits edge-on, so the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°. For `i = 90°`, `sin(i) = 1`, which simplifies the formula significantly.\n\n3.  **Set up the mass ratio.** We need to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 (M_sys1) to the total mass of system_2 (M_sys2).\n    M_sys1 = (P₁ / (2πG)) * (K₁ₐ + K₁ₑ)³\n    M_sys2 = (P₂ / (2πG)) * (K₂ₐ + K₂ₑ)³\n\n    The ratio M_sys1 / M_sys2 is:\n    (M_sys1 / M_sys2) = [ (P₁ / (2πG)) * (K₁ₐ + K₁ₑ)³ ] / [ (P₂ / (2πG)) * (K₂ₐ + K₂ₑ)³ ]\n\n    The constant term `1 / (2πG)` cancels out, leaving:\n    (M_sys1 / M_sys2) = (P₁ / P₂) * [ (K₁ₐ + K₁ₑ) / (K₂ₐ + K₂ₑ) ]³\n\n4.  **Plug in the given values.**\n    *   For system_1: P₁ = 2 years, K₁ₐ + K₁ₑ = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s.\n    *   For system_2: P₂ = 1 year, K₂ₐ + K₂ₑ = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s.\n\n5.  **Calculate the ratio.**\n    (M_sys1 / M_sys2) = (2 / 1) * [ 15 / 25 ]³\n    (M_sys1 / M_sys2) = 2 * [ 3 / 5 ]³\n    (M_sys1 / M_sys2) = 2 * (27 / 125)\n    (M_sys1 / M_sys2) = 54 / 125\n    (M_sys1 / M_sys2) = 0.432\n\n6.  **Compare with the options.** The calculated ratio is 0.432. This value is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
