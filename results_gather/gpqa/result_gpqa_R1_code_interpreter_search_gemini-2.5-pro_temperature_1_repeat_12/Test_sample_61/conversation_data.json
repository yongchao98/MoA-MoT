    "Here is a detailed step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Product**\n\nThe target product is \"1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde\". Let's break down this IUPAC name to understand its structure.\n*   **Parent structure:** `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`. This consists of a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (-CHO) attached to it. Let's denote the cyclohexane ring as 'Cy', so the structure is Cy-CHO. The carbon atom of the ring attached to the -CHO group is C1.\n*   **Substituent:** `(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)`. This group has the structure -CH(OH)-Cy.\n*   **Position:** The prefix `1-` indicates that the substituent is attached to the C1 position of the parent cyclohexane ring.\n\nThis leads to a structure where both the -CHO group and the -CH(OH)-Cy group are attached to the same carbon atom of the cyclohexane ring. This would require that carbon atom to have five bonds, which is impossible.\n\nThere is likely a typo in the name. Let's consider what the intended product might be. The structure contains a β-hydroxy aldehyde moiety (`-CH(OH)-C-CHO`), which is the characteristic product of an **aldol addition reaction**.\n\nLet's assume the reaction is the self-condensation of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (Cy-CHO).\n*   One molecule of Cy-CHO acts as the nucleophile (after being deprotonated by a base to form an enolate). The α-proton is on the cyclohexane ring, at the C2 position.\n*   The enolate attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of Cy-CHO.\n*   The product formed has the substituent `-CH(OH)-Cy` attached to the C2 position of the first cyclohexane ring.\n*   The correct IUPAC name for this product would be **2-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**.\n\nIt is a common occurrence in chemistry problems for there to be a typo in the numbering. Given the context, we will assume the target is the self-aldol product of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Goal of the Synthesis:**\n1.  Synthesize cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (Cy-CHO) from the starting material, ethynylcyclohexane (Cy-C≡CH).\n2.  Perform a self-aldol addition reaction on cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Material and the Intermediate**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane (C6H11-C≡CH). It has 8 carbon atoms.\n*   **Key Intermediate:** Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (C6H11-CHO). It has 7 carbon atoms.\n\nTo get from the 8-carbon starting material to the 7-carbon intermediate, we need to remove one carbon atom. A common way to cleave a carbon-carbon bond and form a carbonyl group is through ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of the starting material (Cy-C≡CH) would cleave the C≡C bond, giving cyclohexanecarboxylic acid (Cy-COOH), not the desired aldehyde.\n\nTherefore, we need a different strategy. Let's analyze the reaction sequences provided in the options.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option**\n\n**Option A:**\n1.  **NaNH2, methyl chloride (CH3Cl):**\n    *   Ethynylcyclohexane is a terminal alkyne and has an acidic proton. NaNH2 is a strong base that deprotonates it to form the sodium acetylide salt: `C6H11-C≡C⁻Na⁺`.\n    *   This acetylide then acts as a nucleophile and reacts with methyl chloride in an SN2 reaction (alkylation).\n    *   Product: `C6H11-C≡C-CH3` (1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne). The carbon chain is extended to 9 carbons.\n2.  **H2/Pd-calcium carbonate (Lindlar's catalyst):**\n    *   This reagent is used for the stereoselective reduction of an alkyne to a *cis*-alkene.\n    *   Product: `cis-C6H11-CH=CH-CH3` (*cis*-1-cyclohexylprop-1-ene).\n3.  **O3/ (CH3)2S (Ozonolysis with reductive workup):**\n    *   Ozonolysis cleaves the C=C double bond.\n    *   Reductive workup with dimethyl sulfide ((CH3)2S) converts the cleaved fragments into aldehydes or ketones.\n    *   Products: `C6H11-CHO` (cyclohexanecarbaldehyde) and `CH3CHO` (acetaldehyde). This step successfully generates our key intermediate.\n4.  **Ba(OH)2 (Barium hydroxide):**\n    *   This is a base that catalyzes the aldol reaction.\n    *   In the presence of Ba(OH)2, the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde produced in the previous step can undergo self-condensation to form the desired target product, `2-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`.\n    *   Although other aldol products will also form from acetaldehyde and through crossed reactions, this pathway *does* produce the target molecule. In a multiple-choice context, this is a valid synthetic route.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** This sequence is chemically sound and leads to the target product (assuming the name correction).\n\n**Option B:**\n1.  **NaNH2, methanol (CH3OH):** NaNH2 is a very strong base and will react with the acidic proton of methanol (`CH3OH`) preferentially, rather than deprotonating the alkyne. This step is ineffective for the intended alkylation. The sequence fails here.\n\n**Option C:**\n1.  **NaNH2, ethyl chloride:** This would produce `C6H11-C≡C-CH2CH3`.\n2.  **Li/liq. NH3:** This reduces the alkyne to a *trans*-alkene.\n3.  **O3/ H2O (Ozonolysis with oxidative workup):** The oxidative workup converts the initial aldehyde fragments into carboxylic acids. The products would be `C6H11-COOH` (cyclohexanecarboxylic acid) and `CH3CH2COOH` (propanoic acid). This does not produce the required aldehyde intermediate. The sequence fails here.\n\n**Option D:**\n1.  **NaNH2, methyl chloride:** Forms `C6H11-C≡C-CH3`.\n2.  **H2/Pd:** This is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the alkyne all the way to an alkane: `C6H11-CH2-CH2-CH3` (propylcyclohexane). This is a dead end. The subsequent steps are irrelevant and the reagent `H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O` (for Markovnikov hydration of alkynes) is listed illogically as a fourth separate step. The sequence is incorrect.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nBy analyzing all the options, Option A is the only chemically plausible sequence that can be used to synthesize the target molecule from the given starting material. The steps involve a logical progression of chain extension, partial reduction, oxidative cleavage to an aldehyde, and finally an aldol condensation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
