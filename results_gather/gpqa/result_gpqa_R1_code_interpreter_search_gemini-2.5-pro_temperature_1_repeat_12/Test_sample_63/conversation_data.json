    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the experimental data and identify the gaseous products.**\n\n*   An equimolar mixture of salts A and B (total mass = 7.20 g) is heated and decomposes completely into a mixture of gases.\n*   The gas mixture is passed through three tubes sequentially.\n    1.  **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H2O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of H2O produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H2O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H2O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n    2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)2 solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO2 or SO2. The mass did not change, which means no acidic gases were formed during the decomposition.\n    3.  **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O2) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The reaction is 2Cu + O2 → 2CuO. The mass increase of the tube is equal to the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n        *   Mass of O2 = 0.80 g.\n        *   Molar mass of O2 = 32.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O2 = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through the three tubes, 2.24 liters of a gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   This gas did not react with a drying agent, a base, or hot copper, indicating it is a relatively inert gas. Nitrogen (N2) is a common product of the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume at STP / Molar volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol. Let's assume Gas C is N2.\n\n**Step 2: Verify the products with the Law of Conservation of Mass.**\n\nLet's calculate the total mass of the gaseous products we have identified:\n*   Mass of H2O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O2 = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of N2 = moles × molar mass = 0.1 mol × 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g\n*   Total mass of gases = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\nThis total mass is equal to the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g). This confirms that our identification and calculation of the products (H2O, O2, N2) are correct.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the elemental composition of the salt mixture.**\n\nThe atoms in the product gases (N, H, O) must have come from the original salts A and B. Let's calculate the total moles of each element.\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** from 0.2 mol of H2O → 0.2 mol × 2 = 0.4 mol H.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** from 0.1 mol of N2 → 0.1 mol × 2 = 0.2 mol N.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** from 0.2 mol of H2O and 0.025 mol of O2 → (0.2 mol × 1) + (0.025 mol × 2) = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol O.\n\nThe molar ratio of the elements in the combined mixture of A and B is N : H : O = 0.2 : 0.4 : 0.25. To get a simple integer ratio, we can multiply all values by 20:\nN : H : O = (0.2 × 20) : (0.4 × 20) : (0.25 × 20) = 4 : 8 : 5.\nSo, the combined empirical formula for the equimolar mixture (one unit of A + one unit of B) is N4H8O5.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the individual salts A and B.**\n\nWe need to split the combined formula N4H8O5 into two plausible salt formulas.\n*   The salts contain N, H, and O. The formation of N2 and H2O upon heating suggests ammonium (NH4+) salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions.\n*   The H8 part of the formula corresponds exactly to two ammonium ions: 2 × NH4+ = N2H8.\n*   If we take away N2H8 from N4H8O5, we are left with the atoms for the two anions: N(4-2)H(8-8)O5 = N2O5.\n*   We need to split N2O5 into two common nitrogen-containing oxyanions. The most common ones are nitrite (NO2⁻) and nitrate (NO3⁻).\n    *   NO2⁻ + NO3⁻ = N(1+1)O(2+3) = N2O5. This is a perfect match.\n*   Therefore, the two salts are Ammonium Nitrite (NH4NO2) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH4NO3).\n\n**Step 5: Verify the moles and decomposition reactions.**\n\nThe molar ratio of the products N2 : O2 : H2O was found to be 0.1 : 0.025 : 0.2, which simplifies to 4 : 1 : 8.\nLet's check if the decomposition of an equimolar mixture of NH4NO2 and NH4NO3 yields this ratio.\n*   Decomposition of NH4NO2: NH4NO2 → N2 + 2H2O\n*   Decomposition of NH4NO3: 2NH4NO3 → 2N2 + O2 + 4H2O (or simplified per mole: NH4NO3 → N2 + 0.5O2 + 2H2O)\nFor an equimolar mixture (e.g., 1 mole of each):\n*   From 1 mole of NH4NO2: 1 mole N2, 2 moles H2O\n*   From 1 mole of NH4NO3: 1 mole N2, 0.5 mole O2, 2 moles H2O\n*   Total products: (1+1) moles N2, 0.5 moles O2, (2+2) moles H2O = 2 moles N2, 0.5 moles O2, 4 moles H2O.\n*   The molar ratio is N2 : O2 : H2O = 2 : 0.5 : 4, which simplifies to 4 : 1 : 8. This matches the experimental results, confirming the identities of salts A and B.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in their chemical formulas).\n*   **Salt A (NH4NO2):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 1 (in NH4+) + 1 (in NO2-) = 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in NH4NO2 = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH4NO3):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 1 (in NH4+) + 1 (in NO3-) = 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in NH4NO3 = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms in both salts = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
