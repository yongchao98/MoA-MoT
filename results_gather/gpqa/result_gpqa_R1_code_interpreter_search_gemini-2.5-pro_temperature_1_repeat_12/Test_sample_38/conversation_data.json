Understand the Wave Function and Probability Density**\n\nThe wave function is given by:\nΨ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the probability of finding a particle in a given region of space is determined by the square of the magnitude of its wave function, |Ψ(x)|². This is called the probability density function.\n\nA complex number is of the form z = real + i * imaginary. Its magnitude squared is |z|² = (real)² + (imaginary)².\n\nFor our wave function:\n-   Real part: Re(Ψ) = a / sqrt(1 + x)\n-   Imaginary part: Im(Ψ) = -0.5\n\nSo, the probability density function is:\n|Ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (-0.5)²\n|Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n**2. Apply the Normalization Condition**\n\nWe are told that the particle is always found between x=1 and x=3. This means the total probability of finding the particle in this interval is 1. This is the normalization condition, which is expressed mathematically as:\n\n∫[from 1 to 3] |Ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n\n**3. Set up and Solve the Integral**\n\nSubstitute the expression for |Ψ(x)|² into the integral:\n\n∫[from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\nNow, we solve the integral:\n∫ (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = a² * ∫ (1 / (1 + x)) dx + ∫ 0.25 dx\nThe antiderivative is: a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25 * x\n\nNow, we evaluate this at the limits of integration (from 1 to 3):\n= [a² * ln(1 + 3) + 0.25 * 3] - [a² * ln(1 + 1) + 0.25 * 1]\n= [a² * ln(4) + 0.75] - [a² * ln(2) + 0.25]\n= a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + (0.75 - 0.25)\n\nUsing the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B):\n= a² * ln(4/2) + 0.5\n= a² * ln(2) + 0.5\n\n**4. Solve for 'a'**\n\nWe set the result of the integral equal to 1:\na² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\na² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\na = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))\n\n**5.

Principle of Normalization:**\nIn quantum mechanics, the total probability of finding a particle somewhere in the space it can exist is 1. This is represented by the normalization condition:\n∫ |Ψ(x)|² dx = 1\nwhere the integral is taken over all possible positions.\n\n**3. Calculate the Probability Density Function |Ψ(x)|²:**\nThe wave function Ψ(x) is a complex number of the form `real + i*imaginary`.\n*   Real part: Re(Ψ) = a / sqrt(1 + x)\n*   Imaginary part: Im(Ψ) = -0.5\n\nThe square of the magnitude of a complex number is `(real)² + (imaginary)²`.\nSo, |Ψ(x)|² = [a / sqrt(1 + x)]² + (-0.5)²\n|Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n**4.
