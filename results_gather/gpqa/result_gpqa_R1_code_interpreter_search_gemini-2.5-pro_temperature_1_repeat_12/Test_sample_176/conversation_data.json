    "Here's my thinking process to solve this astronomical problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Goal:** The main objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to Star_2 ($L_1/L_2$).\n\n2.  **Identify the Relevant Physics Principles:**\n    *   **Luminosity of a Star:** The luminosity of a star, assuming it behaves as a perfect black body, is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:\n        $L = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n        where $L$ is luminosity, $R$ is the radius, $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the surface temperature.\n    *   **Peak Wavelength and Temperature:** The relationship between a star's surface temperature and the wavelength at which it emits the most light ($\\lambda_{max}$) is given by Wien's Displacement Law:\n        $\\lambda_{max} = b / T$\n        where $b$ is Wien's displacement constant. This law applies to the light as it is emitted by the star (its rest frame).\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** When a light source is moving relative to an observer, the observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) is shifted compared to the emitted wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$). For non-relativistic speeds, this is given by:\n        $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{rest} (1 + v_r / c)$\n        where $v_r$ is the radial velocity (positive for moving away, negative for moving towards) and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:**\n    *   Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law for both stars, the ratio of their luminosities is:\n        $L_1 / L_2 = (4 \\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4) / (4 \\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4)$\n    *   The constants $4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$ cancel out, leaving:\n        $L_1 / L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 * (T_1/T_2)^4$\n\n4.  **Incorporate the Given Information:**\n    *   **Radius Ratio:** The problem states $R_1 = 1.5 * R_2$, so $(R_1/R_2) = 1.5$.\n        Therefore, $(R_1/R_2)^2 = 1.5^2 = 2.25$.\n    *   **Temperature Ratio:** This is the most complex part. I need to find $(T_1/T_2)$.\n        *   The problem states the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda_{max,1,obs} = \\lambda_{max,2,obs}$.\n        *   Let's apply the Doppler shift formula to each star's peak wavelength.\n            *   For Star_1: $v_{r1} = 0$ km/s. So, $\\lambda_{max,1,obs} = \\lambda_{max,1,rest} (1 + 0/c) = \\lambda_{max,1,rest}$.\n            *   For Star_2: $v_{r2} = 700$ km/s. So, $\\lambda_{max,2,obs} = \\lambda_{max,2,rest} (1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n        *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal:\n            $\\lambda_{max,1,rest} = \\lambda_{max,2,rest} (1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n        *   Now, I'll use Wien's Law ($T = b / \\lambda_{max,rest}$) to relate this back to temperature.\n            $T_1 = b / \\lambda_{max,1,rest}$\n            $T_2 = b / \\lambda_{max,2,rest}$\n        *   The ratio of temperatures is:\n            $T_1/T_2 = (b / \\lambda_{max,1,rest}) / (b / \\lambda_{max,2,rest}) = \\lambda_{max,2,rest} / \\lambda_{max,1,rest}$.\n        *   Substitute the expression for $\\lambda_{max,1,rest}$ from the Doppler shift analysis:\n            $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{max,2,rest} / [\\lambda_{max,2,rest} (1 + v_{r2}/c)] = 1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)$.\n    *   **Other Information:** The mass information is not needed for this calculation method, which relies on the properties of black body radiation.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:**\n    *   Now I have all the components for the luminosity ratio formula:\n        $L_1 / L_2 = (R_1/R_2)^2 * (T_1/T_2)^4$\n        $L_1 / L_2 = (1.5)^2 * [1 / (1 + v_{r2}/c)]^4$\n        $L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 * (1 + v_{r2}/c)^{-4}$\n    *   The radial velocity of Star 2 ($v_{r2} = 700$ km/s) causes a redshift. For the observed peak wavelength to match Star 1's, Star 2 must be intrinsically hotter (i.e., its rest-frame peak wavelength is shorter). This means $T_2 > T_1$, so the ratio $T_1/T_2$ is less than 1. Consequently, the final luminosity ratio $L_1/L_2$ will be slightly less than 2.25. This allows me to predict that option C is the most likely answer.\n\n6.  **Perform the Numerical Calculation:**\n    To get the precise value, I'll use a Python script to compute the result.\n\n```python\n# Values from the problem statement\nR1_over_R2 = 1.5\nvr2_kms = 700  # in km/s\n\n# Constants\nvr2_ms = vr2_kms * 1000  # convert to m/s\nc_ms = 299792458  # speed of light in m/s\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the temperature ratio (T1/T2)\n# T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + vr2/c)\nT1_over_T2_ratio = 1 / (1 + vr2_ms / c_ms)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the luminosity ratio (L1/L2)\n# L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\nluminosity_ratio = (R1_over_R2)**2 * (T1_over_T2_ratio)**4\n\nprint(luminosity_ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n2.229048386377755\n</execute_code>\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The calculated luminosity ratio is approximately 2.229. This value is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe primary objective is to determine the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to the luminosity of Star_2 ($L_1 / L_2$).\n\n**2. Identify the Relevant Physical Principles:**\n*   **Luminosity and the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** For a star that radiates as a perfect black body, its total luminosity ($L$) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:\n    $L = A \\sigma T^4 = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n    where $R$ is the star's radius, $T$ is its surface temperature, and $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n*   **Peak Wavelength and Wien's Displacement Law:** The surface temperature ($T$) of a star is related to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation ($\\lambda_{rest}$). This is described by Wien's Displacement Law:\n    $T = b / \\lambda_{rest}$\n    where $b$ is Wien's displacement constant and $\\lambda_{rest}$ is the wavelength emitted by the star in its own reference frame (i.e., not affected by its motion relative to us).\n\n*   **Doppler Effect for Light:** The wavelength we observe ($\\lambda_{obs}$) from a moving star is shifted from its emitted wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$) due to the Doppler effect. For speeds much less than the speed of light ($c$), the relationship is:\n    $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{rest} (1 + v_r / c)$\n    where $v_r$ is the radial velocity (positive if moving away, negative if moving toward).\n\n**3. Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:**\nUsing the Stefan-Boltzmann law for both stars, we can write the ratio of their luminosities:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4 \\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4 \\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} $\n\nThe constants ($4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$) cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 (\\frac{T_1}{T_2})^4 $\n\n**4. Determine the Known Ratios from the Problem Statement:**\n*   **Radius Ratio:** We are given $R_1 = 1.5 \\times R_2$, so $(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}) = 1.5$.\n    This means $(\\frac{R_1}{R_2})^2 = 1.5^2 = 2.25$.\n    *Note: The mass information is not required for this calculation and can be ignored.*\n\n*   **Temperature Ratio:** This is the most complex part. We must use the information about the peak wavelengths.\n    *   From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is related to the rest-frame wavelengths:\n        $ \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{b / \\lambda_{rest,1}}{b / \\lambda_{rest,2}} = \\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}} $\n    *   Now, we use the Doppler effect and the fact that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same ($\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$).\n        *   For Star_1 ($v_{r,1} = 0$):  $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{rest,1}(1 + 0/c) = \\lambda_{rest,1}$\n        *   For Star_2 ($v_{r,2} = 700$ km/s): $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{rest,2}(1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n    *   Since $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$, we have:\n        $\\lambda_{rest,1} = \\lambda_{rest,2}(1 + v_{r,2}/c)$\n    *   We can now find the ratio of the rest-frame wavelengths needed for our temperature ratio:\n        $ \\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}} = \\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,2}(1 + v_{r,2}/c)} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r,2}/c} $\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n        $ \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_{r,2}/c} $\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Result:**\nNow substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\times (\\frac{1}{1 + v_{r,2}/c})^4 $\n\nLet's plug in the numbers:\n*   $v_{r,2} = 700 \\text{ km/s} = 700,000 \\text{ m/s}$\n*   $c = 299,792,458 \\text{ m/s}$ (speed of light)\n\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times (\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{700,000}{299,792,458}})^4 $\n\nThe calculation gives:\n$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} \\approx 2.25 \\times (0.99766)^{-4} \\approx 2.25 \\times 0.99071 \\approx 2.2291 $\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~2.32\nB) ~2.25\nC) ~2.23\nD) ~2.35\n\nThe calculated value is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
