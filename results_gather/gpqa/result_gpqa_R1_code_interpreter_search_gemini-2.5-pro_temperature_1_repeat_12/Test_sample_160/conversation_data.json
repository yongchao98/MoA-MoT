    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Definitions of Mean Free Path (MFP)\n\nThe problem involves two different mean free paths (MFPs):\n\n*   **λ1**: The mean free path of the gas molecules themselves. This is the average distance a gas molecule travels before it collides with another gas molecule.\n*   **λ2**: The mean free path of the electrons from the microscope's beam. This is the average distance an electron travels before it scatters off a gas molecule.\n\nThe general formula for mean free path is λ = 1 / (n * σ), where 'n' is the number density of the target particles and 'σ' is the collision cross-section.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Mean Free Path for Gas-Gas Collisions (λ1)\n\n*   **Moving Particle**: A gas molecule.\n*   **Target Particles**: Other gas molecules.\n*   **Number Density (n)**: The number of gas molecules per unit volume. This value is constant for both scenarios since the vacuum state and temperature are fixed.\n*   **Collision Cross-Section (σ_gg)**: This represents the effective area for a collision between two gas molecules. Let's model the gas molecules as hard spheres with a diameter 'd'. When two such molecules collide, a collision occurs if their centers come within a distance 'd' of each other. The effective target area is therefore σ_gg = πd².\n*   **Formula**: For a gas of identical particles in thermal motion, the relative velocity is higher than the average velocity. This introduces a factor of √2 into the denominator.\n    λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg) = 1 / (√2 * n * πd²)\n\n### 3. Analyze the Mean Free Path for Electron-Gas Collisions (λ2)\n\n*   **Moving Particle**: An electron from the beam. The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, meaning they travel at near the speed of light.\n*   **Target Particles**: The stationary gas molecules.\n*   **Number Density (n)**: The same 'n' as before.\n*   **Collision Cross-Section (σ_eg)**: This represents the effective area for a collision between an electron and a gas molecule. An electron is, for scattering purposes, essentially a point particle (its physical size is negligible compared to a molecule). It collides with a gas molecule of diameter 'd' (and radius r = d/2). The effective target area is determined by the size of the molecule alone: σ_eg = πr² = π(d/2)² = (1/4)πd².\n*   **Formula**: Because the electrons are moving so much faster than the gas molecules, the molecules can be considered stationary. The √2 factor, which accounts for the relative motion of targets, is not needed.\n    λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg) = 1 / (n * (1/4)πd²) = 4 / (nπd²)\n\n### 4. Compare λ1 and λ2\n\nNow we can find the ratio of λ2 to λ1 using the formulas derived above.\n\nλ2 / λ1 = [ 4 / (nπd²) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * πd²) ]\n\nThe terms 'n', 'π', and 'd²' cancel out:\n\nλ2 / λ1 = 4 * √2\n\nCalculating the value:\n\nλ2 / λ1 ≈ 4 * 1.414 = 5.656\n\nSo, λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1.\n\n### 5. Evaluate the Options\n\nThe result of our analysis is that the mean free path of an electron (λ2) is approximately 5.66 times larger than the mean free path of a gas molecule (λ1). Let's check this against the given options:\n\n*   A) λ2 < λ1  (Incorrect)\n*   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 (Incorrect, our result 5.66 is not in this range)\n*   C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 (Correct, since 5.66 is indeed greater than or equal to 1.22)\n*   D) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation (Incorrect)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe physical reason for this difference is that the collision cross-section is much smaller for a point-like electron hitting a molecule than for two molecules of significant size hitting each other. A smaller cross-section leads to a longer mean free path. Our calculation, based on a standard hard-sphere model, shows λ2 is significantly larger than λ1. The inequality λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 is therefore the correct conclusion. More advanced physics models show that for high-energy electrons, the scattering cross-section is even smaller, making the ratio λ2/λ1 even larger, which further strengthens this conclusion.\n\n<<<C>>>"
