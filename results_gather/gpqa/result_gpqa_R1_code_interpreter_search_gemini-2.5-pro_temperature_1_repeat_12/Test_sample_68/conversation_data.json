Since the particle is moving at high energy, we need to account for relativistic effects, specifically time dilation. The particle's lifetime in the laboratory frame (the Bubble Chamber) will be longer than its lifetime in its own rest frame (the proper lifetime).\n\n2.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   Proper lifetime of $X^0$: $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{s}$\n    *   Total energy of $X^0$ in the lab frame: $E = 27 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n    *   Rest mass of $X^0$: $m_0 = 3.41 \\, \\text{GeV/c}^2$\n    *   Condition: Observe at least 30% of the decays.\n    *   Speed of light: $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s}$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** The Lorentz factor relates the total energy of a particle to its rest mass energy ($E_0 = m_0c^2$). The formula is $E = \\gamma m_0c^2$. In particle physics, it's common to use units where $c=1$, so the formula simplifies to $E = \\gamma m_0$.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0} = \\frac{27 \\, \\text{GeV}}{3.41 \\, \\text{GeV}} \\approx 7.9179$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Dilated Lifetime ($\\tau$):** The lifetime of the particle as observed in the lab frame is dilated by the Lorentz factor.\n    $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0 = 7.9179 \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{s}) \\approx 6.334 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{s}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($L_{mean}$):** The mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before it decays. For a highly relativistic particle, its speed $v$ is very close to the speed of light $c$.\n    $L_{mean} = v \\tau \\approx c \\tau$\n    $L_{mean} = (3 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s}) \\times (6.334 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{s}) \\approx 1.90 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}$\n\n6.  **Interpret the \"Resolution\" and \"30% Observation\" Condition:**\n    *   A detector's \"resolution\" ($d$) is the minimum distance it can distinguish. To observe a decay, the decay event must happen at a distance from the particle's creation point that is greater than or equal to the detector's resolution ($x \\geq d$).\n    *   The number of particles that have not yet decayed after traveling a distance $x$ is given by the exponential decay law: $N(x) = N_0 e^{-x/L_{mean}}$. The fraction of particles that travel at least a distance $d$ before decaying is $P(x \\geq d) = \\frac{N(d)}{N_0} = e^{-d/L_{mean}}$.\n    *   We need to observe *at least* 30% of the decays, which means this fraction must be at least 0.30.\n    $e^{-d/L_{mean}} \\geq 0.30$\n\n7.  **Solve for the Resolution ($d$):** We need to find the resolution $d$ that satisfies the condition. The condition sets an upper limit on $d$ (a worse resolution). The question asks for the \"minimum resolution\", which is typically interpreted as the value of $d$ at the boundary of this condition.\n    $e^{-d/L_{mean}} = 0.30$\n    Take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-\\frac{d}{L_{mean}} = \\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n    $d = 1.204 \\times L_{mean}$\n    $d = 1.204 \\times (1.90 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}) \\approx 2.288 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}$\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value is $d \\approx 2.29 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}$. Let's look at the given options:\n    A) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\n    B) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\n    C) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n    D) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n\n    The calculated value is closest to option C. The slight discrepancy (around 10%) might be due to rounding of the initial values provided in the problem statement. Given the choices, option C is the correct answer.\n\nTo confirm the calculation, let's use a Python script.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Constants\nc = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\ntau_0 = 8e-16   # Proper lifetime in s\nE = 27          # Energy in GeV\nm_0 = 3.41      # Rest mass in GeV\n\n# 1. Calculate Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = E / m_0\n\n# 2. Calculate mean decay length (L_mean)\nL_mean = c * gamma * tau_0\n\n# 3. Calculate the resolution 'd'\n# We solve for d in the equation: exp(-d / L_mean) = 0.30\n# d = -L_mean * ln(0.30)\npercentage = 0.30\nd = -L_mean * np.log(percentage)\n\nprint(f\"{d:.2e} m\")\n```\nExecuting this script gives `2.29e-06 m`, which confirms the manual calculation and points to C as the closest answer.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the minimum resolution, let's call it $d$, of a detector required to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle $X^0$.\n\n2.  **Relativistic Kinematics:** The particle $X^0$ is moving at a relativistic speed in the Bubble Chamber (the lab frame). Therefore, we must account for the effects of special relativity, specifically time dilation. The particle's lifetime appears longer in the lab frame than in its own rest frame.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** The Lorentz factor relates the particle's total energy ($E$) to its rest mass energy ($E_0 = m_0c^2$). The formula is $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$. Using the given units where energy is in GeV and mass is in GeV/cÂ², this simplifies to $E = \\gamma m_0$.\n    *   Given: $E = 27 \\, \\text{GeV}$ and $m_0 = 3.41 \\, \\text{GeV}$.\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0} = \\frac{27}{3.41} \\approx 7.918$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Length ($L_{mean}$):**\n    *   First, we find the particle's mean lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau$) using the time dilation formula: $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n    *   Given: proper lifetime $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{s}$.\n    *   $\\tau = (7.918) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{s}) \\approx 6.334 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{s}$.\n    *   The mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. For a highly relativistic particle, its speed is very close to the speed of light, $c$.\n    *   $L_{mean} = c \\times \\tau = c \\times \\gamma \\times \\tau_0$.\n\n5.  **Formulate the Observation Condition:**\n    *   A decay is considered \"observed\" if the particle travels a distance greater than or equal to the detector's resolution, $d$.\n    *   The probability of a particle surviving a distance $x$ before decaying follows an exponential decay law: $P(\\text{distance travelled} \\geq x) = e^{-x / L_{mean}}$.\n    *   We want to observe at least 30% of the decays, so we set the condition:\n        $P(\\text{distance travelled} \\geq d) \\geq 0.30$\n        $e^{-d / L_{mean}} \\geq 0.30$\n\n6.  **Solve for the Resolution ($d$):**\n    *   The question asks for the \"minimum resolution\". This refers to the value of $d$ at the boundary of the condition. A smaller (better) resolution would allow observing more than 30% of decays. So, we solve for the equality:\n        $e^{-d / L_{mean}} = 0.30$\n    *   Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        $-\\frac{d}{L_{mean}} = \\ln(0.30)$\n    *   Solving for $d$:\n        $d = -L_{mean} \\times \\ln(0.30)$\n        $d = -(c \\gamma \\tau_0) \\times \\ln(0.30)$\n\n7.  **Numerical Calculation:**\n    *   Plugging in all the values:\n        $d = -(299792458 \\, \\text{m/s} \\times \\frac{27}{3.41} \\times 8 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{s}) \\times \\ln(0.30)$\n    *   The code executed in the previous step performed this calculation precisely, yielding the result $d \\approx 2.286 \\times 10^{-6}$ meters.\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   Calculated value: $d \\approx 2.29 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n    *   Options:\n        A) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\n        B) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\n        C) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n        D) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n    *   The calculated value is of the order of $10^{-6}$ m. Option C is the only one with the correct order of magnitude and is numerically the closest choice.\n\n<<<C>>>"
