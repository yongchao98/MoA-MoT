    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the fundamental assumption:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (rho), is constant throughout the volume of space.\n\n2.  **Relate the number of stars to volume:** The number of stars (`dN`) in a small volume of space (`dV`) is given by `dN = ρ * dV`.\n\n3.  **Consider a thin spherical shell of space:** We are interested in how the number of stars changes with distance (`d`) from the observer. Let's consider a thin spherical shell of radius `d` and thickness `dd`. The volume of this shell (`dV`) is its surface area multiplied by its thickness:\n    `dV = (4 * π * d²) * dd`\n\n4.  **Find the number of stars in this shell:** Substituting the volume `dV` into our first equation, the number of stars `dN` in this thin shell is:\n    `dN = ρ * 4 * π * d² * dd`\n\n5.  **Introduce parallax (plx):** The question asks about the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`plx`), not distance (`d`). Parallax is inversely proportional to distance:\n    `d = 1 / plx`\n\n6.  **Relate the differential thickness `dd` to the differential parallax `d(plx)`:** To change our expression from being in terms of `d` and `dd` to `plx` and `d(plx)`, we need to find the relationship between `dd` and `d(plx)`. We can do this by differentiating the parallax-distance relation with respect to `plx`:\n    `dd / d(plx) = d/d(plx) * (1 / plx)`\n    Using the power rule of differentiation, this gives:\n    `dd / d(plx) = -1 / plx²`\n    Therefore, `dd = (-1 / plx²) * d(plx)`.\n\n7.  **Substitute `d` and `dd` into the equation for `dN`:** Now we replace `d` with `1/plx` and `dd` with `(-1 / plx²) * d(plx)` in our equation for the number of stars in the shell (`dN = ρ * 4 * π * d² * dd`):\n    `dN = ρ * 4 * π * (1 / plx)² * ((-1 / plx²) * d(plx))`\n    `dN = - (4 * π * ρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n8.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax:** The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is the quantity `dN / d(plx)`. From the equation above, we can rearrange to find this:\n    `dN / d(plx) = - 4 * π * ρ / plx⁴`\n\n9.  **Interpret the result:** The number of stars in a given parallax range must be a positive quantity. The negative sign simply indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. We are interested in the magnitude or the density of stars in a parallax bin. Therefore, we take the absolute value:\n    `|dN / d(plx)| = 4 * π * ρ / plx⁴`\n    Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are constants, we can see the proportionality:\n    `Number of stars per unit parallax range ∝ 1 / plx⁴`\n\nThis means that the number of stars found in a small, fixed-width parallax interval drops very rapidly as we look at smaller and smaller parallaxes (which correspond to greater and greater distances).\n\n<<<A>>>"
