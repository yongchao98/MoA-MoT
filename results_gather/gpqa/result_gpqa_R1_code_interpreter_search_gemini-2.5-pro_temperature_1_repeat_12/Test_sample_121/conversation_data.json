    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the final product and the analysis of its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Starting material:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The reaction causes the bromination of the alpha-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group).\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid, Br-CH2-COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) with heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid reacts with the alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-COO-CH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate, Br-CH2-COO-CH2CH3).\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-COO-CH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate, NC-CH2-COO-CH2CH3).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction Analysis:**\n    1.  The two hydrogen atoms on the carbon between the cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups are acidic because both groups are electron-withdrawing.\n    2.  Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that removes one of these acidic protons to form a carbanion: [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻.\n    3.  This carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the carbons in 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromine atom in an intermolecular SN2 reaction. This forms an intermediate: NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br.\n    4.  The problem states *excess* NaH is used. This means there is enough base to remove the second acidic proton from the alpha-carbon, forming a new carbanion: [NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br]⁻.\n    5.  This second carbanion then undergoes a rapid *intramolecular* SN2 reaction, attacking the carbon at the other end of the pentyl chain and displacing the second bromine atom. This cyclization reaction forms a stable 6-membered ring.\n*   **Final Product 4:** The resulting molecule is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**Step 5: Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nNow we need to determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals for 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COO-CH2-CH3) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry and Chirality:**\n    *   The substituents on C1 (-CN and -COOEt) are different. Therefore, the molecule does not have a plane of symmetry passing through C1 and C4, even with rapid chair-flipping.\n    *   The lack of any plane of symmetry or center of inversion makes the molecule **chiral**. It exists as a pair of enantiomers. The NMR spectrum of the racemic mix is the same as that of a single enantiomer.\n    *   We will analyze one enantiomer, which has no symmetry elements.\n*   **Counting the Signals:** We assume room temperature conditions where the cyclohexane ring is rapidly interconverting between chair conformations.\n    1.  **Ethyl Group (-COO-CH2-CH3):**\n        *   The three protons of the terminal **-CH3** group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the **-O-CH2-** group are adjacent to the rest of the chiral molecule. This makes them diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent. However, in many contexts, especially for multiple-choice questions, the diastereotopicity of a flexible ethyl group is considered negligible or is simplified. We will treat them as a single group. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   Total from ethyl group = 2 signals.\n\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n        *   Since the molecule is asymmetric, all the ring carbons (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6) are in chemically distinct environments.\n        *   The two protons (geminal) on any given CH2 group in the ring are diastereotopic and are therefore chemically distinct.\n        *   A rigorous count would yield 2 distinct protons for each of the 5 CH2 groups (C2, C3, C4, C5, C6), giving 5 x 2 = 10 signals from the ring.\n        *   However, it is a common convention in such problems to consider \"practical\" or \"accidental\" equivalence for protons that are far from the center of asymmetry. The influence of the different substituents at C1 diminishes with distance.\n        *   **C2 and C6 (alpha positions):** These are closest to the C1 substituents and are in very different environments (\"next to CN\" vs \"next to COOEt\"). So, C2 ≠ C6. Each has 2 distinct protons. (Total 4 signals).\n        *   **C4 (gamma position):** This position is unique. It has 2 distinct protons. (Total 2 signals).\n        *   **C3 and C5 (beta positions):** These positions are further away. It's plausible to assume that the environmental difference between the C3 \"side\" and the C5 \"side\" becomes negligible. This is an assumption of accidental equivalence. If we assume C3 and C5 are equivalent environments, the two diastereotopic protons on these carbons would give a single set of signals. (Total 2 signals for the four H's on C3 and C5).\n        *   Total ring signals = 2 (from C2) + 2 (from C6) + 2 (from C4) + 2 (from C3/C5) = **8 signals**.\n\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Adding the signals from the ethyl group and the ring:\n    *   Total Signals = 2 (ethyl group) + 8 (ring) = **10 signals**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
