    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation**\n\n*   Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2\n*   The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated using the formula:\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n    DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: 3 double bonds + 1 ring) and one additional double bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in this region (3500-3300 cm-1) is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH2) group. The two bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations, respectively.\n*   **1720 cm-1:** This strong absorption band is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency of 1720 cm-1 is typical for a conjugated ester. An unconjugated ester would be slightly higher (~1735-1750 cm-1), while a conjugated ketone or aldehyde would also be in this range. The conjugation with the benzene ring lowers the frequency.\n\n**3. Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal is a triplet (t) integrating to 3 protons (3H). This pattern is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH3) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-). This strongly suggests the presence of an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal is a quartet (q) integrating to 2 protons (2H). It is coupled to the methyl group at 1.20 ppm, confirming the ethyl group. The significant downfield chemical shift (4.5 ppm) indicates that this methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom, as in an ester linkage (R-O-CH2CH3).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a broad singlet (bs) integrating to 2 protons. The broadness is typical for protons that can undergo chemical exchange, such as -OH or -NH protons. Combined with the IR data, this signal is confidently assigned to the two protons of the primary amine (-NH2) group. The chemical shift is appropriate for an amino group attached to an aromatic ring.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. They are both doublets (d), each integrating to 2 protons. This symmetrical pattern is characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two substituents on the ring are electronically different, causing the two sets of aromatic protons to have different chemical shifts. The amino group (-NH2) is an electron-donating group (EDG), which shields the ortho protons, shifting them upfield (lower ppm value). The ester group (-COOR) is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG), which deshields its ortho protons, shifting them downfield (higher ppm value).\n    *   The doublet at **7.0 ppm** is assigned to the two protons ortho to the electron-donating -NH2 group.\n    *   The doublet at **8.0 ppm** is assigned to the two protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating the Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, the molecule consists of:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   A primary amine group (-NH2).\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n\nPutting these pieces together results in the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check the given options:\n\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine, and it has a formyl proton (CHO). This is inconsistent with the IR and NMR data.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted (1,3-disubstituted) ring, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two simple doublets.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure is a 1,4-disubstituted ring with a primary amine and an ethyl ester group. It perfectly matches all the data: the IR bands for -NH2 and conjugated ester, and all the signals in the 1H NMR spectrum (ethyl group, NH2 protons, and the para-substituted aromatic pattern).\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is a phenyl ester (Ar-O-C=O), not an ethyl ester (R-C(=O)-O-Et). In this case, the ethyl group would be part of a propionyl group (-COCH2CH3), and its -CH2- signal would appear around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe evidence from the IR and 1H NMR spectra overwhelmingly supports the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
