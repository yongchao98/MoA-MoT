    "This problem requires the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, which describe the classical electromagnetic field generated by a moving point charge.\n\n### Reasoning and Derivation\n\n1.  **Identify the physical setup:** We have a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$. We want to find the scalar potential `V` and vector potential `\\vec{A}` at a specific observation point $\\vec{r}$ and time `t`.\n\n2.  **Concept of Retarded Time:** The electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light, `c`. Therefore, the field observed at point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` was generated by the charge at an earlier time, called the *retarded time* `tr`. This retarded time is such that the time it took for the signal to travel from the charge's position at `tr` to the observation point $\\vec{r}$ is exactly `t - tr`.\n\n3.  **Define Key Vectors and Quantities:**\n    *   $\\vec{s}(tr)$: The position of the charge `q` at the retarded time `tr`.\n    *   $\\vec{r}$: The position of the observation point (field point).\n    *   $\\vec{d}$: The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n        $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)$\n    *   $d$: The magnitude of this vector, $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr)|$.\n    *   $\\vec{v}$: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time, $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt'}|_{t'=tr}$.\n    *   The condition for the retarded time is given by the light travel time:\n        $t - tr = \\frac{d}{c}$\n\n4.  **Retarded Potentials for Continuous Distributions:** The general formulas for the potentials in terms of charge density $\\rho$ and current density $\\vec{J}$ are the retarded potentials:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    where $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$.\n\n5.  **Applying to a Point Charge (Liénard-Wiechert Potentials):** For a point charge, the densities are given by Dirac delta functions:\n    $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q\\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\n    Substituting these into the integral formulas and evaluating them is a standard, though non-trivial, procedure in electrodynamics. The integration over the spatial delta function picks out the value at the charge's position, but the complication is that the retarded time `tr` itself depends on the integration variable `r'`. The result of this integration yields a correction factor in the denominator, which accounts for the fact that the \"effective\" amount of charge contributing to the potential at the observation point is modified by the charge's motion relative to the observer.\n\n6.  **The Liénard-Wiechert Formulas:** The result of the integration gives the Liénard-Wiechert potentials:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d(1 - \\frac{\\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} \\right]_{ret}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d(1 - \\frac{\\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} \\right]_{ret}$\n    where the subscript `ret` means all quantities in the brackets (`d`, $\\hat{d}$, $\\vec{v}$) are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`. $\\hat{d}$ is the unit vector $\\vec{d}/d$.\n\n7.  **Simplifying the Expressions:** Let's rewrite the denominator to match the form in the options.\n    The denominator term is $d(1 - \\frac{\\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}) = d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{dc}) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$.\n    To remove the `c` from the denominator of the second term, we can multiply the numerator and denominator of the whole fraction by `c`:\n    $d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n    Substituting this back into the potential formulas:\n\n    For the scalar potential `V`:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n    For the vector potential `A`:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})/c} = \\frac{\\mu_o qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n8.  **Comparing with the Options:**\n    *   A) Incorrect. These are static potentials and an incorrect relation for A.\n    *   B) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n        This exactly matches our derived expressions.\n    *   C) Incorrect. The sign in the denominator is wrong. A plus sign would correspond to advanced potentials, which violate causality.\n    *   D) Incorrect. The scalar potential `V` is the static Coulomb potential, not the full retarded potential.\n\nAlso, note that the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are related by $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V$. Let's check this for option B:\n$\\frac{\\vec{A}}{V} = \\frac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\bigg/ \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})} = \\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v}$\nSince $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_o \\epsilon_o)$, we have $\\mu_o \\epsilon_o = 1/c^2$.\nSo, $\\frac{\\vec{A}}{V} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}$, which confirms the consistency of the expressions in option B.\n\nThe correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
