    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the structure of the molecule to count the number of atoms and bonds. The name given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let's break this down to draw the structure and determine its formula.\n\n-   `(CH3)2C=` : A carbon atom double-bonded to the next carbon in the chain and also single-bonded to two methyl (CH3) groups.\n-   `=CH-` : The next carbon in the chain, single-bonded to the next part.\n-   `-CH2-` : A methylene group.\n-   `-CH(CH3)-` : A carbon atom with one hydrogen and one methyl group attached.\n-   `-CH2-` : Another methylene group.\n-   `-CH=` : A carbon atom, double-bonded to the final carbon.\n-   `=C(CH3)2` : The final carbon, double-bonded to the previous carbon and single-bonded to two methyl groups.\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n      CH3      CH3                         CH3\n      |        |                           |\n  C = CH - CH2 - CH - CH2 - CH = C - CH3\n      |\n     CH3\n```\nLet's count the atoms:\n-   **Carbon (C) atoms:** There are 7 carbons in the main chain and 5 carbons in the methyl groups, for a total of **12 Carbon atoms**.\n-   **Hydrogen (H) atoms:**\n    -   From the five CH3 groups: 5 * 3 = 15 H\n    -   From the two CH groups in the chain: 2 * 1 = 2 H\n    -   From the two CH2 groups in the chain: 2 * 2 = 4 H\n    -   From the one CH group with a methyl branch: 1 H\n    -   Total H atoms = 15 + 2 + 4 + 1 = 22 H. Wait, let's recount from the structure directly.\n    -   (CH3)2: 6 H\n    -   CH: 1 H\n    -   CH2: 2 H\n    -   CH(CH3): 1 H + 3 H = 4 H\n    -   CH2: 2 H\n    -   CH: 1 H\n    -   (CH3)2: 6 H\n    -   Total = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 H.\n    -   So, the molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n### **2. Count the Number of Each Type of Bond**\n\nFrom the structure, we can count the bonds:\n-   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n-   **C=C double bonds:** There are two double bonds in the structure. So, **2 C=C bonds**.\n-   **C-C single bonds:** We can count them from the structure:\n    -   2 bonds from the first `(CH3)2C` part.\n    -   4 bonds in the main chain backbone (`-CH-CH2-CH-CH2-CH-`).\n    -   1 bond for the methyl branch `-CH(CH3)-`.\n    -   2 bonds from the final `C(CH3)2` part.\n    -   Total C-C bonds = 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the following formula, which is an application of Hess's Law:\n\n**ΔHf = [Σ (Enthalpy of atomization of elements)] - [Σ (Bond energies of the molecule)]**\n\nLet's calculate each part.\n\n**Part A: Enthalpy of atomization of the elements**\nThis is the energy required to turn the elements in their standard states (C as solid graphite, H as H2 gas) into individual gaseous atoms.\n-   We have 12 moles of Carbon atoms and 22 moles of Hydrogen atoms.\n-   Enthalpy of atomization of Carbon, ΔH_atom(C) = **1000 kJ/mol** (given).\n-   Enthalpy of atomization of Hydrogen, ΔH_atom(H), needs to be calculated from the H-H bond energy. The reaction is 1/2 H2(g) -> H(g). The energy required is half the bond energy of H-H.\n    ΔH_atom(H) = (1/2) * BE(H-H) = (1/2) * 100 kJ/mol = **50 kJ/mol**.\n\nTotal enthalpy of atomization for the elements in C12H22:\nΣ ΔH_atom(elements) = (12 * ΔH_atom(C)) + (22 * ΔH_atom(H))\nΣ ΔH_atom(elements) = (12 * 1000) + (22 * 50)\nΣ ΔH_atom(elements) = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ/mol**\n\n**Part B: Sum of bond energies of the molecule**\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the gaseous molecule to form gaseous atoms (enthalpy of atomization of the compound).\n-   Number of C-C bonds = 9\n-   Number of C=C bonds = 2\n-   Number of C-H bonds = 22\n-   Bond energy of C-C = 200 kJ/mol\n-   Bond energy of C=C = 300 kJ/mol\n-   Bond energy of C-H = 400 kJ/mol\n\nΣ Bond Energies = (9 * BE(C-C)) + (2 * BE(C=C)) + (22 * BE(C-H))\nΣ Bond Energies = (9 * 200) + (2 * 300) + (22 * 400)\nΣ Bond Energies = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol** (Note: This corresponds to option C, but it's not the final answer).\n\n**Part C: Final calculation of ΔHf**\nΔHf = [Σ ΔH_atom(elements)] - [Σ Bond Energies]\nΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol\n**ΔHf = 1900 kJ/mol**\n\n### **4. Convert Units to Match Options**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. Looking at the options, we have answers in both kJ/mol and kJ/g. Option D is in kJ/g, so let's convert our answer to kJ/g.\n\n-   **Molar Mass of C12H22:**\n    -   Using approximate atomic masses: C=12 g/mol, H=1 g/mol.\n    -   Molar Mass = (12 * 12) + (22 * 1) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n\n-   **Convert ΔHf to kJ/g:**\n    ΔHf (kJ/g) = ΔHf (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\n    ΔHf (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166\n    ΔHf (kJ/g) ≈ **11.44 kJ/g**\n\nThis value matches option D.\n\nWe can use a Python script to verify the calculations.\n```python\n# Given values from the problem\nenthalpy_atom_C = 1000  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_H_H = 100    # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_C_C = 200    # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_C_eq_C = 300 # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_C_H = 400    # kJ/mol\n\n# Atom and bond counts from our analysis of the molecule C12H22\nnum_C = 12\nnum_H = 22\nnum_C_C = 9\nnum_C_eq_C = 2\nnum_C_H = 22\n\n# Calculate the total enthalpy of atomization for the elements\nenthalpy_atom_H = 0.5 * bond_energy_H_H\ntotal_atomization_energy_elements = (num_C * enthalpy_atom_C) + (num_H * enthalpy_atom_H)\n\n# Calculate the total bond energy for the molecule\ntotal_bond_energy_molecule = (num_C_C * bond_energy_C_C) + \\\n                             (num_C_eq_C * bond_energy_C_eq_C) + \\\n                             (num_C_H * bond_energy_C_H)\n\n# Calculate the enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol\nenthalpy_formation_mol = total_atomization_energy_elements - total_bond_energy_molecule\n\n# Calculate the molar mass and convert the enthalpy of formation to kJ/g\nmolar_mass = (num_C * 12.0) + (num_H * 1.0)\nenthalpy_formation_gram = enthalpy_formation_mol / molar_mass\n\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of Formation (kJ/mol): {enthalpy_formation_mol}\")\nprint(f\"Molar Mass (g/mol): {molar_mass}\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of Formation (kJ/g): {enthalpy_formation_gram}\")\n```\n> Enthalpy of Formation (kJ/mol): 1900.0\n> Molar Mass (g/mol): 166.0\n> Enthalpy of Formation (kJ/g): 11.44578313253012\n\nThe calculated value is approximately 11.44 kJ/g, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
