    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules. While alcohols also have a broad O-H stretch, it's typically centered higher (around 3300-3500 cm⁻¹) and is less broad than that of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group. The position is consistent with the carbonyl stretch in a carboxylic acid (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n\n    *   **FTIR Conclusion:** The combination of a very broad O-H stretch, a C=O stretch, and a C=C stretch strongly suggests that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. A carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. Their presence confirms the existence of an alkene functional group, which supports the conclusion drawn from the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a key piece of evidence. We need to identify a common fragment with this mass-to-charge ratio. The mass of the carboxyl group (-COOH) is calculated as:\n        *   Mass = (1 × Mass of C) + (2 × Mass of O) + (1 × Mass of H)\n        *   Mass = (1 × 12) + (2 × 16) + (1 × 1) = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45 amu.\n    *   This m/z = 45 peak is a characteristic fragment for carboxylic acids, corresponding to the [COOH]⁺ ion. This provides very strong confirmation that the molecule is a carboxylic acid.\n\n4.  **Combine the Evidence and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   From the analysis, we know the compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n    *   A carboxylic acid contains two oxygen atoms. This immediately eliminates options **C) C6H10O** and **D) C6H12O**, as they only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with **A) C6H10O2** and **B) C6H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Use the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The degree of unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - H/2 (for compounds with C, H, and O).\n    *   Our spectroscopic data tells us we have:\n        *   One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid). This contributes 1 to the DoU.\n        *   One C=C double bond (from the alkene). This contributes another 1 to the DoU.\n    *   Therefore, the total required Degree of Unsaturation for our molecule is 1 + 1 = **2**.\n\n6.  **Calculate the DoU for the remaining options:**\n    *   **For A) C6H10O2:**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (10 / 2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This matches our requirement.\n    *   **For B) C6H12O2:**\n        DoU = 6 + 1 - (12 / 2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This would correspond to a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which only has the C=O double bond. It does not account for the C=C double bond confirmed by FTIR and NMR.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to a molecule with a carboxylic acid group and a carbon-carbon double bond. This requires two oxygen atoms and a degree of unsaturation of 2. Only the formula **C6H10O2** satisfies all these conditions.\n\n<<<A>>>"
