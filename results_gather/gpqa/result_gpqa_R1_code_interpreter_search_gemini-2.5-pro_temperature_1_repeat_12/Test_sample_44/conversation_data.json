    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the System and Principles**\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin are called fermions.\n*   **Potential Well:** The particles are confined to a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n*   **Energy Levels:** The energy levels for a single particle in such a well are quantized and given by the formula:\n    E_n = (n^2 * pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2mL^2)\n    where *n* is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n*   **Energy Unit:** The problem conveniently defines a base energy unit E = (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2mL^2). Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as:\n    E_n = n^2 * E\n    *   E_1 = 1^2 * E = 1E\n    *   E_2 = 2^2 * E = 4E\n    *   E_3 = 3^2 * E = 9E\n    *   E_4 = 4^2 * E = 16E\n    *   and so on.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Since the particles are identical fermions, they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state is defined by all its quantum numbers. In this case, the quantum numbers are the principal quantum number *n* and the spin magnetic quantum number *m_s* (which can be +1/2 for \"spin up\" or -1/2 for \"spin down\"). This means that for any given energy level *n*, we can place at most two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n### **2. Determine the Ground State Energy**\n\nThe ground state is the state of the lowest possible total energy for the system. To find this, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **Level n=1 (E_1 = 1E):** We can place two of the four particles here (one spin up, one spin down).\n*   **Level n=2 (E_2 = 4E):** We place the remaining two particles here (one spin up, one spin down).\n\nThe total energy of the ground state (E_ground) is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\nE_ground = (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_2)\nE_ground = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 4E)\nE_ground = 2E + 8E = **10E**\n\n### **3. Determine the First Excited State Energy**\n\nThe first excited state is the state with the next lowest possible energy after the ground state. We create it by promoting one particle from the ground state configuration to the next available energy level, in a way that requires the least amount of energy.\n\n*   **Ground State Configuration:** Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=2.\n*   **Lowest Energy Excitation:** The least energy is required to move a particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied level (n=3).\n*   **New Configuration:**\n    *   Level n=1: Two particles\n    *   Level n=2: One particle\n    *   Level n=3: One particle\n*   The total energy of the first excited state (E_1st) is:\n    E_1st = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_3)\n    E_1st = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 9E)\n    E_1st = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**\n\n### **4. Determine the Second Excited State Energy**\n\nThe second excited state is the state with the next lowest energy after the first excited state. We need to consider different possible excitations from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy.\n\nLet's analyze the possible single-particle excitations from the ground state (2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2):\n\n*   **Excitation 1 (already found):** Move one particle from n=2 to n=3. Total energy = 15E. This is the first excited state.\n*   **Excitation 2:** Move one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n    *   New Configuration: One particle in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3.\n    *   Total Energy = (1 * E_1) + (2 * E_2) + (1 * E_3) = (1 * 1E) + (2 * 4E) + (1 * 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n*   **Excitation 3:** Move both particles from n=2 to n=3 (a two-particle excitation).\n    *   New Configuration: Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=3.\n    *   Total Energy = (2 * E_1) + (2 * E_3) = (2 * 1E) + (2 * 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n*   **Excitation 4:** Move one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n    *   New Configuration: Two particles in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4.\n    *   Total Energy = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_4) = (2 * 1E) + (1 * 4E) + (1 * 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n\nComparing the energies of the excited states (15E, 18E, 20E, 22E...), the lowest is 15E (the first excited state), and the next lowest is 18E. Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is **18E**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe energies for the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
