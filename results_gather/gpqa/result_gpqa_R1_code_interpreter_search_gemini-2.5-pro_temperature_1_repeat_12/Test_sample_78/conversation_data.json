    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the product's NMR spectra to determine its structure.**\n\n    The molecular formula of the starting material, Compound X, is C11H12O. The reaction described is a rearrangement catalyzed by a base (DABCO) at high temperature. Therefore, the product of the reaction will have the same molecular formula, C11H12O.\n\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** For C11H12O, DoU = C + 1 - H/2 = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 6. This indicates a combination of rings and/or pi bonds.\n\n    *   **13C NMR Analysis:**\n        *   **δ 197.7 (1C):** This chemical shift is characteristic of a ketone carbonyl carbon (C=O). This accounts for one degree of unsaturation.\n        *   **δ 126.9 (2C), 127.1 (1C), 129.1 (2C), 130.3 (1C), 141.5 (1C), 144.1 (1C):** These eight carbons are in the sp2 hybridized region (110-160 ppm). A benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons and 4 degrees of unsaturation. The remaining two sp2 carbons must belong to an alkene (C=C), which accounts for the final degree of unsaturation. (DoU = 1 from C=O + 4 from ring + 1 from C=C = 6).\n        *   **δ 21.3 (1C) and δ 28.4 (1C):** These are two aliphatic sp3 carbons, likely belonging to methyl groups.\n\n    *   **1H NMR Analysis:**\n        *   **δ 7.71 (2H, d) and δ 7.08 (2H, d):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n        *   **δ 7.68 (1H, d) and δ 6.75 (1H, d):** These two doublets, each for one proton, are in the alkene region. Their coupling suggests they are on adjacent carbons (-CH=CH-). The high chemical shifts indicate conjugation with both the aromatic ring and the carbonyl group. The large difference in shift suggests a trans configuration across the double bond.\n        *   **δ 2.31 (3H, s):** A singlet for three protons is a methyl group with no adjacent protons. This is likely the methyl group attached to the para-substituted benzene ring, forming a p-tolyl group.\n        *   **δ 2.28 (3H, s):** Another methyl singlet. This must be a methyl group attached to a carbon with no protons, such as the ketone's carbonyl carbon. This indicates a methyl ketone (-C(=O)-CH3).\n\n    *   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n        Based on the fragments identified (p-tolyl group, a trans-CH=CH- group, and a methyl ketone group), the only structure that fits all the data is **(E)-4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\n        Structure: CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3\n\n        Let's verify this structure against the NMR data:\n        *   `CH3`-C6H4-: 1H singlet at ~2.3 ppm (matches 2.31 ppm).\n        *   -`C6H4`-CH=CH: para-substituted ring protons (matches 7.71 and 7.08 ppm).\n        *   -`CH=CH`-C=O: Alkene protons, trans-coupled doublets (matches 7.68 and 6.75 ppm).\n        *   -C(=O)-`CH3`: 1H singlet for the acetyl methyl group (matches 2.28 ppm).\n        *   -`C=O`-: Ketone carbon at ~198 ppm (matches 197.7 ppm).\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the starting material (Compound X) that would yield this product.**\n\n    The reaction converts an epoxide (oxirane), Compound X, into the ketone product identified above. We must find which of the given options corresponds to Compound X. The reaction is an isomerization, so the starting material must have the same carbon skeleton as the product.\n\n    *   Product skeleton: A p-tolyl group attached to a four-carbon chain (`C-C6H4-C-C-C-C`).\n    *   Let's examine the options:\n        *   A) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane: Has a phenyl group (C6H5-), not a p-tolyl group. Incorrect.\n        *   B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane: Has a phenyl group and the wrong carbon skeleton. Incorrect.\n        *   C) 2-styrylepoxide: Has the wrong molecular formula (C10H10O). Incorrect.\n        *   D) **2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane**: The name \"4-methylstyryl\" corresponds to a `CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-` group (a p-tolylvinyl group). The structure is `CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-CH(O)CH2`. This compound has the correct formula (C11H12O) and the correct carbon skeleton to be the precursor.\n\n*   **Step 3: Verify the reaction mechanism.**\n\n    The transformation required is from a terminal epoxide to a methyl ketone:\n    `R-CH(O)CH2` → `R-C(=O)-CH3`\n\n    In our case, R = `CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-` (p-tolylvinyl).\n    Starting material (D): `(CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-)-CH(O)CH2`\n    Product: `(CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-)-C(=O)-CH3`\n\n    This specific type of rearrangement is known to be catalyzed by bases like DABCO at high temperatures. The mechanism involves the base removing a proton from the terminal `CH2` of the epoxide ring. The resulting carbanion rearranges, opening the epoxide ring to form an enolate, which is then protonated (e.g., by the protonated base) to give the final methyl ketone product. The conditions given in the problem (DABCO, nonpolar solvent, 403 K) are consistent with this epoxide-ketone isomerization.\n\n    Therefore, Compound X is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<D>>>"
