    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method**\n\nThe RV method detects exoplanets by measuring the periodic Doppler shift of the light from their host star. As the planet orbits the star, it gravitationally tugs on the star, causing the star to \"wobble\" around their common center of mass. This wobble results in a periodic shift in the star's spectral lines.\n\nThe magnitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r) towards or away from us. The maximum observed shift (the amplitude of the periodic signal) corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as K.\n\nTherefore, we can establish a relationship between the RV semi-amplitudes (K₁ and K₂) and the given wavelength shifts (Δλ₁ and Δλ₂):\nK₁ ∝ Δλ₁ = 5 milliangstroms\nK₂ ∝ Δλ₂ = 7 milliangstroms\n\nThis gives us the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes:\nK₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5\nor\nK₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7\n\n**2. Relate RV Semi-Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (P)**\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is:\n\nK = ( (2πG) / P )^(1/3) * ( (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3)) )\n\nWhere:\n*   P = Orbital Period\n*   m_p = Planet's mass\n*   M_star = Star's mass\n*   G = Gravitational constant\n*   i = Orbital inclination (angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane)\n\n**3. Analyze the Given Information and Simplify the Formula**\n\nThe problem provides the following key information:\n*   The stars have the same mass: M_star1 = M_star2\n*   The planets have the same mass: m_p1 = m_p2\n*   The term `sin(i)` represents the unknown orbital inclination. In such comparative problems, it is a standard and necessary assumption that the conditions are comparable, so we assume `sin(i₁)` = `sin(i₂)`. Without this assumption, the problem is unsolvable.\n\nGiven these equalities, the entire second part of the formula is a constant for both systems:\nC = ( (2πG)^(1/3) ) * ( (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3)) )\n\nSo, the formula for K simplifies to:\nK = C * P^(-1/3)\n\nThis shows that the RV semi-amplitude (K) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period (P):\nK ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)\n\n**4. Solve for the Ratio of the Orbital Periods**\n\nWe need to find the ratio P₂ / P₁. Let's rearrange the proportionality:\nFrom K ∝ P^(-1/3), we can write P^(1/3) ∝ 1/K.\nBy cubing both sides, we get:\nP ∝ (1/K)³ or P ∝ 1/K³\n\nNow we can set up the ratio for the two planets:\nP₂ / P₁ = (1/K₂³) / (1/K₁³)\nP₂ / P₁ = K₁³ / K₂³\nP₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)³\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Value**\n\nSubstitute the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes (K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7) into the equation:\nP₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³\n\nNow, we perform the calculation.\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the periods\n# P2 / P1 = (K1 / K2)^3\n# We know K1/K2 is proportional to the wavelength shifts, so K1/K2 = 5/7.\nratio = (5/7)**3\nprint(ratio)\n```\n```output\n0.3644314868804665\n```\nThe result is approximately 0.364.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.85\nB) ~ 0.36\nC) ~ 1.96\nD) ~ 1.40\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.36 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method**\n\nThe RV method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift of light from their host star. The planet's gravity causes the star to \"wobble,\" leading to a change in the star's velocity relative to us. This change in velocity causes a shift in the wavelength of the star's spectral lines.\n\nThe magnitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r). The maximum observed shift, which is given in the problem, corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as K.\n\nTherefore, we can establish a relationship between the RV semi-amplitudes (K₁ and K₂) and the given wavelength shifts (Δλ₁ and Δλ₂):\n*   K₁ is proportional to Δλ₁ = 5 milliangstroms.\n*   K₂ is proportional to Δλ₂ = 7 milliangstroms.\n\nThis gives us the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes:\nK₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7\n\n**2.

Simplify the Formula Based on the Given Information**\n\nThe problem states that:\n*   The stars have the same masses: M_star1 = M_star2\n*   The planets have similar masses: m_p1 ≈ m_p2\n*   For a comparative problem like this, we assume other factors are comparable, so we assume the orbital inclinations are the same: sin(i₁) = sin(i₂)\n\nWith these conditions, the second part of the formula becomes a constant for both systems:\nC = ( (2πG)^(1/3) ) * ( (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3)) )\n\nThe formula for K simplifies to:\nK = C * P^(-1/3)\n\nThis shows that the RV semi-amplitude (K) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period (P):\nK ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)\n\n**4.

Calculate the Final Value**\n\nSubstitute the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes (K₁ / K₂ = 5 / 7) into the equation:\nP₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³\n\nThe Python code execution confirmed the calculation:\n(5/7)³ ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.85\nB) ~ 0.36\nC) ~ 1.96\nD) ~ 1.40\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
