    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the terms and the question:**\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** An apparent shift in the position of a star due to the Earth's orbit. It is inversely proportional to the star's distance (r). The relationship is `plx = 1/r` (when plx is in arcseconds and r is in parsecs).\n    *   **Number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5:** This statement describes the distribution of stars as a function of their parallax. In physics and astronomy, when a quantity is said to \"vary with\" a variable, it typically refers to the density or differential distribution. So, this means the number of stars per unit interval of parallax, `dN/d(plx)`, is proportional to `1/plx^5`.\n    *   **The question asks:** How does the number of stars per unit range of distance, `dN/dr`, change with distance `r`?\n\n2.  **Set up the mathematical relationships:**\n    *   From the problem statement, we have the number distribution with respect to parallax:\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5` or `dN/d(plx) = k * plx⁻⁵` for some constant `k`.\n    *   We want to find the proportionality for `dN/dr`.\n    *   We can relate `dN/dr` and `dN/d(plx)` using the chain rule from calculus:\n        `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n3.  **Calculate the derivative `d(plx)/dr`:**\n    *   We know the relationship `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`.\n    *   Differentiating plx with respect to r gives:\n        `d(plx)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n\n4.  **Substitute the expressions into the chain rule equation:**\n    *   Now substitute the expressions for `dN/d(plx)` and `d(plx)/dr` into the chain rule formula:\n        `dN/dr = (k * plx⁻⁵) * (-1/r²)`\n\n5.  **Express the final result in terms of `r`:**\n    *   The current expression has both `plx` and `r`. We need to express it solely in terms of `r` to answer the question. Substitute `plx = 1/r` into the equation:\n        `dN/dr = k * (1/r)⁻⁵ * (-1/r²)`\n    *   Simplify the expression:\n        `dN/dr = k * (r⁵) * (-r⁻²)`\n        `dN/dr = -k * r⁽⁵⁻²⁾`\n        `dN/dr = -k * r³`\n\n6.  **Determine the proportionality:**\n    *   The result `dN/dr = -k * r³` shows that the number of stars per unit range of distance (`dN/dr`) is proportional to `r³`. The negative sign indicates that the variables `N` and `r` change in opposite directions in the context of the specific integration direction, but for the purpose of proportionality of the magnitudes, we consider the power of `r`.\n    *   Therefore, `dN/dr ~ r³`.\n\n7.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) ~ r^4\n    *   B) ~ r^2\n    *   C) ~ r^5\n    *   D) ~ r^3\n    *   Our result matches option D."
