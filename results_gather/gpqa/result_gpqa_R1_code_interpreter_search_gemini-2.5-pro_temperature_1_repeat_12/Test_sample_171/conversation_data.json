    "This problem requires applying the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of atoms among various energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Principle:** The problem states that the stellar photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This is a crucial piece of information as it allows us to use the Boltzmann equation to relate the population of atomic energy levels to the temperature.\n\n2.  **The Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms (N) in two different energy levels, say a higher energy level `j` and a lower energy level `i`:\n\n    N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T)]\n\n    Where:\n    *   `N_j` and `N_i` are the number of atoms in levels `j` and `i`.\n    *   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels. For a given atom (iron in this case), these are constant for specific energy levels.\n    *   `E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the levels, which we'll call `ΔE`.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.3806 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Apply to the Two Stars:** We need to write the Boltzmann equation for each star, star_1 with temperature `T_1` and star_2 with temperature `T_2`. Let's denote the ratio `N_j / N_i` as the \"excitation ratio\", `R`.\n\n    *   For star_1:  R_1 = (N_j / N_i)_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n    *   For star_2:  R_2 = (N_j / N_i)_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n4.  **Use the Given Condition:** The problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2\". This translates to the mathematical relationship:\n\n    R_1 = 2 * R_2\n\n5.  **Set up the Equation:** Now, we substitute the Boltzmann expressions into this relationship:\n\n    (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * [ (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] ]\n\n    The statistical weight term `(g_j / g_i)` is the same for both stars (it's a property of the iron atom's energy levels) and cancels out:\n\n    exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n6.  **Solve for the Temperatures:** To solve this exponential equation, we can take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\n    ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n\n    Using the logarithm properties `ln(exp(x)) = x` and `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`:\n\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\n    Now, we rearrange the equation to group the temperature terms:\n\n    ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)\n\n    Factor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n\n    (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n\n    Combine the fractions in the parenthesis using a common denominator (`T_1 * T_2`):\n\n    (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\n7.  **Incorporate the Numerical Values:** The problem provides the energy difference `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J`. We know the Boltzmann constant is `k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K`. The problem is set up so that the ratio `ΔE / k` simplifies nicely.\n\n    ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K\n\n    Note: The unit of the ratio `ΔE/k` is Kelvin (K). Let's check the units in our equation:\n    (K) * [ (K) / (K²) ] = (K) * [1/K] = dimensionless.\n    `ln(2)` is also dimensionless. The units are consistent.\n\n8.  **Final Equation:** Substitute `ΔE / k = 1` into our derived equation:\n\n    1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\n    This simplifies to:\n\n    ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n9.  **Compare with Options:** This result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
