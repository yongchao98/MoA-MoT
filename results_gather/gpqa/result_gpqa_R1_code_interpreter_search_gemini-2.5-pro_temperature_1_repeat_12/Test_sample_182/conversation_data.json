    "Here's a step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactant:**\n    The starting material is \"2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\". Let's break down this name to determine its structure and molecular formula.\n    *   **cyclohex**: This indicates a six-membered carbon ring.\n    *   **-3-ene**: There is a double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4 of the ring.\n    *   **carboxylic acid**: There is a -COOH group. By convention, this is at position C1.\n    *   **2-formyl**: There is a -CHO (aldehyde) group at position C2.\n    *   **5-vinyl**: There is a -CH=CH2 group at position C5.\n\n2.  **Determine the Molecular Formula of the Reactant:**\n    Let's count the atoms:\n    *   **Carbons (C):**\n        *   6 in the cyclohexane ring.\n        *   1 in the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n        *   1 in the formyl group (-CHO).\n        *   2 in the vinyl group (-CH=CH2).\n        *   Total Carbons = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10.\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):**\n        *   H on C1: 1 (bonded to C2, C6, and -COOH)\n        *   H on C2: 1 (bonded to C1, C3, and -CHO)\n        *   H on C3: 1 (part of C=C, bonded to C2)\n        *   H on C4: 1 (part of C=C, bonded to C5)\n        *   H on C5: 1 (bonded to C4, C6, and vinyl group)\n        *   H on C6: 2 (bonded to C1, C5)\n        *   H in -COOH: 1\n        *   H in -CHO: 1\n        *   H in -CH=CH2: 3\n        *   Total Hydrogens = 1+1+1+1+1+2+1+1+3 = 12.\n    *   **Oxygens (O):**\n        *   2 in the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n        *   1 in the formyl group (-CHO).\n        *   Total Oxygens = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\n    The molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Reagents and the Reaction:**\n    The reagents are **red phosphorus (Red P) and excess of HI (hydroiodic acid)**. This combination is a very strong reducing agent. It is known for the complete reduction of almost all oxygen-containing functional groups and unsaturations (double/triple bonds) to their corresponding saturated alkane forms.\n    *   Carboxylic acid (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   Aldehyde (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   Alkene (C=C) is reduced to an alkane (C-C).\n    *   Crucially, this reaction does not break the carbon-carbon single bonds of the skeleton, so the ring structure will remain intact.\n\n4.  **Determine the Structure and Formula of the Product:**\n    The reaction will perform the following transformations on the reactant:\n    *   The carboxylic acid group at C1 becomes a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The formyl group at C2 becomes a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The double bond in the cyclohexene ring is saturated (becomes a single bond).\n    *   The vinyl group (-CH=CH2) at C5 is reduced to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n\n    The resulting product is a saturated, substituted cyclohexane. Since the carbon skeleton is preserved, the product will still have 10 carbon atoms. All oxygen atoms are removed, and all double bonds are converted to single bonds by adding hydrogen. The product is a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon.\n\n    A saturated hydrocarbon with `C` carbon atoms and `R` rings has the general formula **CₙH₂ₙ₊₂₋₂R**.\n    *   In our product, the number of carbon atoms `n` = 10.\n    *   The number of rings `R` = 1 (the cyclohexane ring).\n    *   Plugging these values into the formula:\n        *   Number of Hydrogens = 2 * 10 + 2 - 2 * 1 = 20 + 2 - 2 = 20.\n\n    So, the molecular formula of the product is **C10H20**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product:**\n    The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (also known as the degree of unsaturation) represents the number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule. The formula for IHD is:\n    IHD = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n    Where C is the number of carbons, H is hydrogens, X is halogens, and N is nitrogens.\n\n    For the product with the formula **C10H20**:\n    *   C = 10\n    *   H = 20\n    *   X = 0\n    *   N = 0\n\n    IHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\n    Alternatively, we can determine the IHD by inspecting the structure of the product. The product is a substituted cyclohexane. It contains one ring and no double or triple bonds. Each ring contributes 1 to the IHD. Therefore, the IHD is 1.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$.\n<<<B>>>"
