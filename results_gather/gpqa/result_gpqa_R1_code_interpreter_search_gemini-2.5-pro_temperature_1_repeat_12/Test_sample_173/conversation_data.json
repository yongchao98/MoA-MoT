    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus is at rest.\n    *   Rest mass: M\n    *   Rest-mass energy: `E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`\n    *   Initial momentum: `p_initial = 0`\n\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments.\n    *   Rest mass of the more massive fragment: `m1`\n    *   Rest mass of the less massive fragment: `m2`\n    *   Relationship between masses: `m1 = 2 * m2`\n    *   Sum of final rest masses: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    *   The fragments are moving, possessing kinetic energies `T1` and `T2` and momenta `p1` and `p2`.\n\n**2. Apply Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the fission equals the total energy after. The total energy of a particle is the sum of its rest-mass energy and its kinetic energy (`E_total = m*c^2 + T`).\n    `E_initial = E_final`\n    `M * c^2 = (m1 * c^2 + T1) + (m2 * c^2 + T2)`\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum before equals the total momentum after.\n    `p_initial = p_final`\n    `0 = p1 + p2`\n    This implies the fragments move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum: `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n\n**3. Calculate Rest Masses and Q-value**\n\nFirst, let's find the rest-mass energies of the two fragments. We have a system of two equations:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2`\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n`2 * m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNow, we can find their rest-mass energies:\n*   `m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`\n*   `m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`\n\nThe energy released in the fission, known as the Q-value, is converted into the total kinetic energy of the fragments (`T_total = T1 + T2`).\n`Q_value = T_total = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n`Q_value = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n**4. Calculate Kinetic Energy `T1` using Classical Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is given by `T = p^2 / (2m)`. Since the momenta `p` are equal for both fragments:\n`T1_classical = p^2 / (2 * m1)`\n`T2_classical = p^2 / (2 * m2)`\n\nThe ratio of their kinetic energies is:\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1 = 1 / 2`\nSo, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nWe know the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV:\n`T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\n\n**5. Calculate Kinetic Energy `T1` using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)**\n\nIn relativity, the relationship between total energy (`E`), momentum (`p`), and rest mass (`m`) is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\nFrom this, we can write `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2`.\nSince the momentum `p` is the same for both fragments, `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n`E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n`E1^2 - E2^2 = (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\nUsing the difference of squares `a^2 - b^2 = (a-b)(a+b)`:\n`(E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (m1*c^2 - m2*c^2)(m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n\nFrom conservation of energy, the total final energy is `E1 + E2 = E_initial = 300 GeV`.\nWe know the rest-mass energies: `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV` and `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`.\nSubstitute these values into the equation:\n`(E1 - E2) * (300 GeV) = (198 GeV - 99 GeV) * (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`(E1 - E2) * 300 = 99 * 297`\n`E1 - E2 = (99 * 297) / 300 = 98.01 GeV`\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations for `E1` and `E2`:\n1.  `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`\n2.  `E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV`\n\nAdd the two equations to solve for `E1`:\n`2 * E1 = 398.01 GeV`\n`E1 = 199.005 GeV`\n\nThe kinetic energy `T1` is the total energy `E1` minus the rest-mass energy `m1*c^2`:\n`T1 = E1 - m1*c^2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n`T1 = 1005 MeV`\n\n**6. Find the Difference**\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\n`Difference = T1 - T1_classical`\n`Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nLet's use a Python script to verify the calculations.\n```python\n# Initial rest-mass energy in GeV\nM_c2 = 300.0\n\n# Calculate rest-mass energies of the fragments in GeV\n# m1 = 2 * m2 and m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M\n# This leads to m1 = 0.66 * M and m2 = 0.33 * M\nm1_c2 = 0.66 * M_c2\nm2_c2 = 0.33 * M_c2\n\n# Calculate total kinetic energy released (Q-value) in GeV\nQ_value = M_c2 - (m1_c2 + m2_c2)\n\n# Calculate T1 using the classical approximation\n# T1_c / T2_c = m2 / m1 = 1/2\n# T1_c + T2_c = Q_value => T1_c + 2*T1_c = Q_value\nT1_classical_GeV = Q_value / 3.0\n\n# Calculate the correct T1 using relativistic mechanics\n# (E1 - E2) * (E1 + E2) = (m1c^2 - m2c^2) * (m1c^2 + m2c^2)\n# E1 + E2 = M_c2 = 300 GeV\nE1_plus_E2 = M_c2\nE1_minus_E2 = ((m1_c2 - m2_c2) * (m1_c2 + m2_c2)) / E1_plus_E2\n# Solve for E1: 2*E1 = E1_plus_E2 + E1_minus_E2\nE1 = (E1_plus_E2 + E1_minus_E2) / 2.0\n# T1 is E1 minus the rest-mass energy of fragment 1\nT1_relativistic_GeV = E1 - m1_c2\n\n# Calculate the difference in MeV\ndifference_MeV = (T1_relativistic_GeV - T1_classical_GeV) * 1000\n\nprint(f\"Classical T1: {T1_classical_GeV:.3f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Relativistic T1: {T1_relativistic_GeV:.3f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Difference: {difference_MeV:.1f} MeV\")\n```\n\n>>>\nClassical T1: 1.000 GeV\nRelativistic T1: 1.005 GeV\nDifference: 5.0 MeV\n\nThe difference between the correct T1 value (1005 MeV) and the T1 value calculated using the classical approximation (1000 MeV) is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "An atomic nucleus with rest-mass energy `M*c^2 = 300 GeV` is initially at rest. It fissions into two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\n\n**1. Determine the rest masses of the fragments.**\nWe are given two conditions:\n*   `m1 = 2 * m2` (one fragment is twice as massive as the other)\n*   `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M` (the sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass)\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3*m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow, find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nWe can express their rest-mass energies in terms of the initial rest-mass energy:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m1`): `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (`m2`): `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n**2. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value).**\nThe Q-value is the initial rest-mass energy minus the final total rest-mass energy. This difference is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n`Q_value = T1 + T2 = (M*c^2) - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n`Q_value = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q_value = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n**3. Calculate the kinetic energy `T1` using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.**\nSince the initial nucleus was at rest, by conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of their momentum be `p`.\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   `T1_classical = p^2 / (2*m1)`\n*   `T2_classical = p^2 / (2*m2)`\n\nThe ratio of their kinetic energies is:\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 1/2`\nSo, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nThe total kinetic energy is 3 GeV:\n`T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T1_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\n\n**4. Calculate the correct kinetic energy `T1` using relativistic mechanics.**\nFrom conservation of momentum, `p1 = p2`, so `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\nThe relativistic energy-momentum relation is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\nTherefore, `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2`.\nThis gives us:\n`E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n`E1^2 - E2^2 = (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n\nFrom conservation of total energy, the sum of the final total energies equals the initial energy:\n`E1 + E2 = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`\n\nSubstitute the known values into the rearranged momentum equation:\n`(E1 - E2) * (E1 + E2) = (198 GeV)^2 - (99 GeV)^2`\n`(E1 - E2) * (300 GeV) = (198 - 99) * (198 + 99) GeV^2`\n`(E1 - E2) * 300 = 99 * 297`\n`E1 - E2 = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV`\n\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n1) `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`\n2) `E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV`\n\nAdding the two equations gives:\n`2 * E1 = 398.01 GeV`\n`E1 = 199.005 GeV`\n\nThe correct kinetic energy `T1` is the total energy `E1` minus the rest-mass energy `m1*c^2`:\n`T1_correct = E1 - m1*c^2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`\n\n**5.
