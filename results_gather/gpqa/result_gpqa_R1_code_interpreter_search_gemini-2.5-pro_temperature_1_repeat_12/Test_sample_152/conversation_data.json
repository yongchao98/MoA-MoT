These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning for each reaction:\n\n### **Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. In the presence of a strong base like sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic α-proton between the two carbonyl groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate anion, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (α,β-unsaturated compound):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, (p-CH₃C₆H₄)-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The p-tolyl group is a benzene ring with a methyl group at the para position.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The enolate of dimethyl malonate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate. The β-carbon is the one bonded to the p-tolyl group. This is a conjugate addition (1,4-addition).\n    *   The attack forms a new carbon-carbon bond between the α-carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate. An intermediate enolate is formed.\n    *   Protonation of the intermediate enolate (at the α-carbon of the original acrylate) by the solvent (EtOH) yields the final product.\n\n3.  **Draw and Name the Product (A):**\n    *   The nucleophile `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂` adds to the β-carbon of `(p-tolyl)-CH=CH-COOCH₃`.\n    *   The resulting structure is `(p-tolyl)-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n    *   To name this molecule systematically (IUPAC), we can consider it a substituted propane chain with three trimethyl carboxylate groups. The main chain is propane.\n        *   `C1 - C2 - C3`\n        *   Let's place the substituents to get the lowest possible numbers. If we number from the `CH(COOCH₃)₂` end, we have: `(MeOOC)₂CH¹-CH²(p-tolyl)-CH₂³-COOMe`.\n        *   This gives us a propane backbone.\n        *   Two methoxycarbonyl groups at C1.\n        *   One p-tolyl group at C2.\n        *   One methoxycarbonyl group that is part of a -CH₂COOMe group attached to C2. This numbering is incorrect.\n    *   Let's try naming it based on the name provided in the options: **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n        *   Propane backbone: C1-C2-C3.\n        *   -tricarboxylate at 1,1,3 means: C1 has two `-COOCH₃` groups, and C3 has one `-COOCH₃` group.\n        *   2-(p-tolyl) means a p-tolyl group is on C2.\n        *   The structure is: `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂-COOMe`.\n    *   This structure matches the one derived from the reaction mechanism. Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, which serves as a neutral, carbon-based nucleophile, analogous to an enolate. It is formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. The nucleophilic carbon is the α-carbon of the enamine (C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile), CH₃-CH=CH-CN.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism (Stork Enamine Alkylation):**\n    *   The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   This forms an iminium ion intermediate and a nitrile-stabilized carbanion.\n    *   The final step involves hydrolysis with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺). The acid hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a carbonyl group (ketone).\n\n3.  **Draw and Name the Product (B):**\n    *   The nucleophilic C2 of the enamine attacks the β-carbon (C3) of CH₃-CH=CH-CN.\n    *   A new bond forms between C2 of the cyclohexane ring and C3 of the butanenitrile chain. The substituent added to the ring is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂CN`.\n    *   After hydrolysis, the enamine part (`C=N⁺<`) reverts to a ketone (`C=O`) at C1 of the cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring with a `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂CN` group at position 2.\n    *   To name this molecule, we can consider it a substituted butanenitrile. The main chain is butanenitrile (`N≡C¹-C²H₂-C³H-C⁴H₃`).\n    *   The substituent on C3 is a `2-oxocyclohexyl` group.\n    *   Thus, the name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the major, most stable product, rather than its enol tautomer.\n\n### **Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Identify the Knowns and Unknowns (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃.\n    *   **Unknown:** Reactant C (the Michael Donor).\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of Reactant C:**\n    *   The reaction is a Michael addition. A new C-C bond is formed. Let's identify the bond and the fragments.\n    *   The product has a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` core and a `-(CH₂)₂-CO-CH₃` (3-oxobutyl) side chain at position 2.\n    *   The side chain `-(CH₂)₂-CO-CH₃` comes from the Michael acceptor, `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`, after the addition and protonation. The bond was formed to the β-carbon (the CH₂ group) of MVK.\n    *   This means the nucleophile must have been the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` molecule itself, which donated its C2 atom.\n    *   The protons at C2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione are highly acidic because they are located between two carbonyl groups (a β-dicarbonyl system).\n    *   The base, KOH, deprotonates cyclohexane-1,3-dione at C2 to form the nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   Therefore, reactant **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
