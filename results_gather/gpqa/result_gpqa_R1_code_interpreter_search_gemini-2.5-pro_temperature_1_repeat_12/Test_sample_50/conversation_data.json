    "This problem can be solved using the method of images.\n\n### 1. The Method of Images\n\nThe electric field and potential outside a grounded conducting sphere due to an external charge `q` are identical to the field and potential that would be produced by the original charge `q` and an \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location inside the sphere, with the sphere itself removed.\n\nThe conditions for the image charge are that the potential on the surface of the original sphere (at radius R) must be zero.\n\n*   **Original charge:** `q` at a distance `d` from the center.\n*   **Image charge:** Let the image charge be `q'` at a distance `b` from the center, along the same line as `q`.\n\nTo satisfy the condition V=0 on the surface of the sphere, the magnitude and position of the image charge must be:\n\n*   **Image charge magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Image charge position:** `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThe system of the charge `q` and the grounded sphere is now electrically equivalent to a system of two point charges: `q` and `q'`.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position at distance `d` from the center of the sphere. The force acting on the charge `q` during this process is the attractive force from the induced charges on the sphere, which is equivalent to the force from the image charge `q'`.\n\nThere are two common ways to calculate this energy:\n\n**Method A: Integrating the Force**\n\n1.  The force on the charge `q` when it is at a distance `x` from the center is the force exerted by its image charge `q'(x) = -qR/x` which is at a distance `b(x) = R^2/x`.\n2.  The distance between the charge `q` and its image `q'` is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n3.  The force is `F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (distance)^2 = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = - (k * q^2 * R * x) / (x^2 - R^2)^2`. The negative sign indicates an attractive force.\n4.  The potential energy `U` is the work done by an external agent to bring the charge from infinity to `d`, which is the negative of the work done by the electric field: `U = - ∫[∞, d] F(x) dx`.\n5.  `U = - ∫[∞, d] (- (k * q^2 * R * x) / (x^2 - R^2)^2) dx = k * q^2 * R * ∫[∞, d] (x / (x^2 - R^2)^2) dx`\n6.  Using the substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, `du = 2x dx`, the integral becomes `∫ (1/u^2) * (du/2) = -1/(2u) = -1/(2(x^2 - R^2))`.\n7.  Evaluating the definite integral:\n    `U = k * q^2 * R * [-1/(2(x^2 - R^2))]` from `∞` to `d`.\n    `U = k * q^2 * R * [(-1/(2(d^2 - R^2))) - (-1/(2(∞^2 - R^2)))]`\n    `U = k * q^2 * R * [-1/(2(d^2 - R^2)) - 0]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**Method B: Using Potential (with a factor of 1/2)**\n\nThe potential energy of interaction between a point charge and a conductor is `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` created by the induced charges on the conductor.\n\n1.  The potential at the location of `q` (distance `d` from the center) due to the induced charges is the same as the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that point.\n2.  `V_induced = V_image = k * q' / (distance between q and q')`\n3.  `q' = -qR/d`\n4.  Distance between `q` and `q'` is `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n5.  `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d) = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n6.  Now, calculate the potential energy:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced = (1/2) * q * [- k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n*Note: The factor of 1/2 is crucial. It arises because the source of the potential (the induced charge) is created by the field of the charge `q` itself. If we simply used `U = qV`, we would be double-counting the energy.*\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth methods yield the same result: `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\nComparing this with the given options:\n\nA) `U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)`\nB) `U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)`\nC) `U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)`\nD) `U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)`\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
