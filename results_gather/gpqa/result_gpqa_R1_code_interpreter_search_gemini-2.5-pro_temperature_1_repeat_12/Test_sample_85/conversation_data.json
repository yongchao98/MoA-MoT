    "*   **Analysis of the Starting Materials and Product**\n\n    1.  **Product Structure**: The product in both reactions is a lactone (cyclic ester) named 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered ring containing an oxygen atom and a carbonyl group. The chiral center is at carbon-4, which has an ethyl group attached. The (R) or (S) designation refers to the stereochemistry at this carbon.\n\n    2.  **Lactone Formation**: Six-membered lactones (Î´-lactones) are formed from 5-hydroxycarboxylic acids. In this case, the precursor that cyclizes to form the lactone is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n        `HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)OH`\n        Upon cyclization (intramolecular esterification), the chiral center at C-3 of the acid becomes the chiral center at C-4 of the lactone. The stereochemical configuration is retained during this step.\n\n    3.  **Starting Material Structure**: The options provided are all named `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This name, though slightly unconventional, describes a molecule that is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid).\n        The structure is:\n        `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu`\n        This molecule has two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COO-iBu). It also has a chiral center at carbon-3 (the carbon with the ethyl group).\n\n*   **Analysis of the Reactions and Reagents**\n\n    The core of the problem lies in understanding the chemoselectivity of the two different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3.\n\n    1.  **Reaction 1: Reduction with LiBH4 (Lithium Borohydride)**\n        *   **Reagent**: LiBH4 is a reducing agent that is more reactive than NaBH4 but less so than LiAlH4.\n        *   **Chemoselectivity**: LiBH4 selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid is first deprotonated by the hydride to form a carboxylate salt, which is resistant to reduction.\n        *   **Reaction Path for A**:\n            a.  Starting material A (`HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu`) is treated with LiBH4.\n            b.  The ester group (`-COOiBu`) is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`).\n            c.  The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) remains unchanged (after workup).\n            d.  This forms the intermediate `(R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n            e.  The acid workup (H+) then catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) of this intermediate to form the final product, `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n        *   **Stereochemistry**: The reduction and cyclization steps do not affect the chiral center at C-3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the product is the same as the starting material. Since the product is (R), the starting material A must be the (R) enantiomer.\n        *   **Conclusion for A**: A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n    2.  **Reaction 2: Reduction with BH3 (Borane)**\n        *   **Reagent**: BH3 (borane) is a highly selective reducing agent.\n        *   **Chemoselectivity**: BH3 is notable for its rapid reduction of carboxylic acids to primary alcohols. It reduces esters much more slowly. Therefore, in a molecule with both functional groups, BH3 will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid.\n        *   **Reaction Path for B**:\n            a.  Starting material B (`HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOiBu`) is treated with BH3.\n            b.  The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`).\n            c.  The ester group (`-COOiBu`) remains unchanged.\n            d.  This forms the intermediate `isobutyl (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`.\n            e.  The acid workup (H+) then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol and forming the cyclic ester (lactone). The final product is `(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n        *   **Stereochemistry**: This reaction sequence also does not affect the chiral center. The stereochemistry of the product is dictated by the starting material. Since the product is (S), the starting material B must be the (S) enantiomer.\n        *   **Conclusion for B**: B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n*   **Final Conclusion**\n\n    Based on the analysis:\n    *   Starting material **A** must be the **(R)** enantiomer.\n    *   Starting material **B** must be the **(S)** enantiomer.\n\n    This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
