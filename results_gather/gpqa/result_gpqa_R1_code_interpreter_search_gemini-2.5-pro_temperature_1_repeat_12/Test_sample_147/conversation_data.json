    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y**\n\nThe problem states that compound A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ωF) of 31.96%. Let's assume A2 has the general formula YF_n, where Y is the unknown element, n is the number of fluorine atoms, Ar(Y) is the atomic weight of Y, and Ar(F) is the atomic weight of fluorine (approximately 18.998 g/mol).\n\nThe formula for mass percentage is:\nωF = (n * Ar(F)) / (Ar(Y) + n * Ar(F))\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for Ar(Y):\n0.3196 = (n * 18.998) / (Ar(Y) + n * 18.998)\nAr(Y) + n * 18.998 = (n * 18.998) / 0.3196\nAr(Y) = (n * 18.998 / 0.3196) - (n * 18.998)\nAr(Y) = n * (59.443 - 18.998)\nAr(Y) ≈ n * 40.445\n\nNow, we test integer values for n to find a corresponding element Y with a close atomic weight.\n\n*   If n = 1, Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (Closest element is Calcium, Ca, Ar=40.08)\n*   If n = 2, Ar(Y) ≈ 80.89 g/mol (Closest is Bromine, Br, Ar=79.90)\n*   If n = 3, Ar(Y) ≈ 121.34 g/mol (Closest is Antimony, Sb, Ar=121.76)\n*   If n = 4, Ar(Y) ≈ 161.78 g/mol (Closest is Dysprosium, Dy, Ar=162.50)\n*   If n = 5, Ar(Y) ≈ 202.23 g/mol (Closest is Mercury, Hg, Ar=200.59)\n*   If n = 6, Ar(Y) ≈ 242.67 g/mol (Closest is Plutonium, Pu, Ar=244)\n\nLet's check the properties given in the problem:\n*   \"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\"\n*   \"A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.\" This points to Y being an element that forms a very powerful fluorinating agent.\n\nPlutonium (Pu) is a strong candidate. Let's verify the fluorine percentage in PuF₆ (assuming n=6).\nAr(Pu) = 244 g/mol.\nωF in PuF₆ = (6 * 18.998) / (244 + 6 * 18.998) = 113.988 / (244 + 113.988) = 113.988 / 357.988 ≈ 0.3184 or 31.84%. This is very close to the given 31.96%. The small discrepancy can be attributed to using a specific isotope of Plutonium or slight experimental error in the given percentage.\n\nLet's check the other properties for Plutonium:\n*   **Five binary fluorides:** While PuF₃, PuF₄, and PuF₆ are the most common, less stable or intermediate fluorides exist, and the problem statement that \"five are known\" is a plausible premise for a chemistry problem involving plutonium.\n*   **A1 oxidizes Xenon:** A1 decomposes into A2 (PuF₆) and fluorine. This suggests A1 is a higher, unstable fluoride of plutonium. A compound like PuF₈ (though hypothetical or extremely unstable) would be an incredibly strong oxidant, capable of oxidizing xenon. Even PuF₆ itself is a very strong oxidant. The decomposition would be: PuF₈ → PuF₆ + F₂. So, A1 could be PuF₈.\n*   **A3 interacts with Xenon:** A3 is formed by fluorinating Y (Pu). This typically forms the most stable higher fluoride, PuF₆. PuF₆ is known to react with xenon difluoride (XeF₂) to form complexes, so it \"interacts with xenon\".\n\nTherefore, it is highly probable that **Y is Plutonium (Pu)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Compounds A1-A5**\n\n*   **Y**: Plutonium (Pu)\n*   **A2**: PuF₆ (ωF ≈ 31.96%)\n*   **A1**: A higher, unstable fluoride that decomposes to PuF₆ and F₂. Let's assume PuF₈ for the reaction: PuF₈ → PuF₆ + F₂. It is bright-red and oxidizes Xe.\n*   **A3**: The product of fluorinating Pu, which is PuF₆.\n*   **A4 & A5**: The problem states: \"By adding Y (Pu) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" The term \"solution\" implies a solvent. For inorganic fluorine chemistry, a common non-aqueous solvent is hydrogen fluoride (HF). The reaction `Y + A4 -> A5` in a 1:1 ratio suggests a comproportionation reaction where plutonium in different oxidation states reacts. A common reaction in plutonium fluoride chemistry in HF is:\n    Pu + 3PuF₄ → 4PuF₃\n    This reaction fits the 1:3 stoichiometry. Another possibility involves plutonyl fluoride.\n    However, a simpler reaction fitting the 1:1 stoichiometry is:\n    Pu(VI) + Pu(IV) → 2Pu(V) or Pu(VI) + Pu(0) -> ...\n    A well-known reaction is the preparation of PuF₅:\n    PuF₆ + PuF₄ → 2PuF₅\n    This fits the `A4 + A3 -> 2A5` pattern, but the prompt says `Y + A4 -> A5` (1:1).\n    Let's reconsider the reaction: Pu + A4 -> A5.\n    If A4 is PuF₄, the reaction `Pu + PuF₄` does not proceed in a simple 1:1 manner to a single product.\n    If A4 is PuO₂F₂ (Plutonyl fluoride), which is a colorless solid soluble in HF, the reaction could be:\n    Pu + 3PuO₂F₂ + 8HF → 4PuF₄ + 4H₂O\n    This is not 1:1.\n\n    Let's re-examine the comproportionation `Pu + 3PuF₄ → 4PuF₃`. Maybe the wording \"adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a... solution of A4\" does not mean the reaction stoichiometry is 1:1, but that the reactants were mixed in that ratio. This is ambiguous.\n\n    Let's explore another possibility. If Y= Krypton(Kr), A2=KrF₂ (ωF=31.2%). A1 could be KrF₄ which decomposes. However, Kr does not form five fluorides.\n\n    Let's stick with Y=Pu. The set of compounds is likely among the known fluorides PuF₃, PuF₄, PuF₅, PuF₆, and the unstable A1 (e.g., PuF₈).\n    A4 is described as a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\". PuF₄ is a pinkish-brown solid. PuF₃ is purple. PuF₆ is a reddish-brown solid. None are described as colorless. However, plutonyl fluoride, PuO₂F₂, is a colorless solid and its solutions in HF could be considered colorless. Let's assume A4 is PuO₂F₂.\n    The reaction is Pu + PuO₂F₂ in a 1:1 ratio. This might form PuOF₂ or another mixed-oxidation state species, but the chemistry is complex.\n\n    Let's reconsider the possibility that A4 is one of the binary fluorides, and \"colorless solution\" refers to its solution in HF.\n    - If A4 is PuF₄: PuF₄ is a key intermediate. Its molecular weight is 244 + 4*19 = 320 g/mol.\n    - If A4 is PuF₃: Molecular weight is 244 + 3*19 = 301 g/mol.\n    - If A4 is PuF₅: Molecular weight is 244 + 5*19 = 339 g/mol.\n    - If A4 is PuF₆: Molecular weight is 244 + 6*19 = 358 g/mol.\n\n    None of these molecular weights fall into the provided answer ranges. This suggests a mistake in my identification of Y or A4. Let's revisit the initial calculation.\n\n    Ar(Y) ≈ n * 40.445\n\n    Let's check the elements around the calculated atomic weights again, paying close attention to the properties.\n    - n=3, Ar(Y)≈121.34. Element: Antimony (Sb, 121.76).\n      - ωF in SbF₃ = (3*19)/(121.76 + 3*19) = 57/178.76 = 31.88%. This is an excellent match.\n      - Let's check the properties for Antimony (Y=Sb).\n      - **Five binary fluorides**: This is a known point of contention. SbF₃ and SbF₅ are very well known. Mixed-valence compounds like Sb₂F₁₁ ([SbF₄]⁺[SbF₆]⁻) and polymeric forms exist. It's plausible in a problem context to refer to five species like SbF₃, (SbF₃)n, SbF₅, (SbF₅)n, and Sb₂F₁₁.\n      - **A1 oxidizes Xenon**: Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅) is an extremely strong Lewis acid and oxidant. It can react with XeF₂. Perhaps a higher fluoride or adduct (A1) exists that decomposes into A2=SbF₃.\n        A1 → SbF₃ + F₂. This would mean A1 is SbF₅. But SbF₅ is stable. The decomposition temperature is 149.5 °C, not 20 °C.\n        This path seems problematic.\n\nLet's reconsider the reaction `Y + A4 -> A5` (1:1). It is possible that Y is not an element but a compound. But the problem says \"fluorination of element Y\".\n\nLet's assume our initial identification of Y=Pu was correct and there is an issue with our assumption about A4. What if A4 is not a plutonium compound? The problem says \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". A5 is obtained from Y and A4. It decomposes in water. This might suggest A5 is a salt.\nA4 could be a fluoride salt of another element, e.g., CsF, in which Pu compounds are dissolved.\n\nLet's rethink the structure.\n1. A1 -> A2 + F2 (A2 = PuF6) -> A1 = PuF8 (hypothetical) or an adduct.\n2. Y = Pu\n3. A3 = PuF6\n4. Pu + A4 -> A5 (1:1 in HF)\n5. A5 + H2O -> two substances\n\nA common reaction in fluoride chemistry is the formation of complex salts. For example, A4 could be an alkali fluoride like CsF. Plutonium hexafluoride (A3) reacts with CsF:\nPuF₆ + CsF → CsPuF₇\nThis doesn't involve element Y (Pu) as a reactant.\n\nWhat if A4 is XeF₂? It is a colorless solid.\nPu + XeF₂ → PuF₂ + Xe.\nHere A5 is PuF₂, which decomposes in water. MW(XeF₂) = 131.29 + 2*19 = 169.29 g/mol. This falls in range C) 160-180.\nLet's check this hypothesis.\n- A4 = XeF₂ (MW = 169.3 g/mol)\n- A5 = PuF₂ (formed from Pu + XeF₂)\n- A5 decomposes in water: PuF₂ + 2H₂O → Pu(OH)₂ + 2HF. This forms two substances.\n- This seems very plausible. A4 is a colorless solid, it can be used to make a solution. The reaction with an active metal like Pu makes sense. Xenon is involved elsewhere in the problem (oxidized by A1/A3), making its presence as a compound plausible.\n\nTherefore, the most logical candidate for A4 is Xenon Difluoride (XeF₂).\nMolecular Weight of XeF₂ = Ar(Xe) + 2 * Ar(F) = 131.29 + 2 * 18.998 = 131.29 + 37.996 = **169.29 g/mol**.\n\nThis molecular weight falls within the range of 160-180.\n\nFinal check of all points with Y=Pu and A4=XeF₂:\n- Five binary fluorides of Y=Pu: Plausible for a problem statement.\n- A1 (e.g. PuF₈) decomposes at 293K to A2 (PuF₆, ωF≈31.9%) and F₂. Plausible.\n- A1 oxidizes Xe. A very high fluoride like PuF₈ would.\n- A3 (PuF₆) interacts with Xe. True, it reacts with XeF₂.\n- A4 is XeF₂. Its solution can be made.\n- Pu + XeF₂ (1:1) → PuF₂ + Xe. A5 = PuF₂. This works.\n- PuF₂ decomposes in water. True.\n\nThe logic holds together. The molecular weight of A4 (XeF₂) is ~169.3 g/mol.\n\nThe given ranges are:\nA) 110-130\nB) 220-240\nC) 160-180\nD) 140-160\n\nOur calculated value of 169.3 g/mol falls squarely in range C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
