    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the experimental setup and observations.**\n    *   **Antigen:** GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins of rotavirus. This is the substance the immune system will react to.\n    *   **Delivery Route:** Oral gavage. This targets the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.\n    *   **Antigen Fate:** Some is destroyed by stomach acid, some is trapped in mucus. This is expected. The crucial part is what successfully gets through.\n    *   **Immune Response Location:** Peyer's patches show fluorescence. Peyer's patches are secondary lymphoid organs, a key part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). This is where adaptive immune responses to intestinal antigens are initiated.\n    *   **Cellular Activity:** Proliferating cells are isolated from these Peyer's patches. Proliferation (clonal expansion) is a hallmark of an adaptive immune response, where lymphocytes that recognize the antigen are selected and multiply.\n    *   **Genetic Analysis:** The variable heavy chain gene of these proliferating cells is sequenced.\n    *   **Key Finding:** The sequence shows \"high variability.\" This means that within this population of proliferating cells, the gene segment responsible for antigen binding is not identical but has many variations.\n\n*   **Step 2: Evaluate the provided options in the context of the findings.**\n    *   The question centers on a process that generates high variability in the **variable heavy chain gene** of **proliferating B cells** within a **secondary lymphoid organ (Peyer's patch)** following an antigen encounter.\n\n    *   **A) Somatic Hypermutation (SHM):** This is a biological mechanism that occurs in activated B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). It introduces point mutations into the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes. The purpose is to fine-tune the antibodies and select for variants with higher affinity for the antigen. This process directly causes \"high variability\" in the variable heavy chain gene among a population of proliferating B cells. This perfectly matches the observation.\n\n    *   **B) Complement Activation:** This is a part of the innate immune system (and can be activated by the adaptive system) involving a cascade of proteins that help clear pathogens. It does not involve altering the genetic sequence of B cell receptors.\n\n    *   **C) VDJ Recombination:** This is the process that creates the initial diversity of B cell receptors. It occurs in the bone marrow (a primary lymphoid organ) during B cell development, *before* the B cell ever encounters an antigen. While the cells in the Peyer's patch did undergo VDJ recombination earlier in their life, this process is not what is actively causing the *new* variability among the *proliferating* population in the secondary lymphoid organ.\n\n    *   **D) Class Switching Recombination (CSR):** This process also occurs in activated B cells in germinal centers, often at the same time as somatic hypermutation. However, CSR changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain (e.g., from IgM to IgA), which determines the antibody's function and location. It does *not* affect the *variable* region, which is responsible for antigen binding and is the region described as having \"high variability.\"\n\n*   **Step 3: Conclude the most likely process.**\n    *   The experimental findings—proliferation of cells in a secondary lymphoid organ in response to an antigen, coupled with high variability specifically in the variable heavy chain gene—are the defining characteristics of a germinal center reaction, where somatic hypermutation is taking place to achieve affinity maturation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
