    "This problem requires us to calculate the concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) from the dissociation of a Ca-EDTA complex solution.\n\n1.  **Understand the chemical equilibrium.**\n    The formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is described by the following equilibrium reaction:\n    $Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$\n\n    The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the formation constant, $K_f$ (also given as KCa-EDTA).\n    $K_f = \\frac{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n2.  **Consider the dissociation of the complex.**\n    To find the concentration of free $Ca^{2+}$ ions, we need to look at the reverse reaction, which is the dissociation of the complex:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n    The equilibrium constant for this dissociation, $K_d$, is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table.**\n    We start with a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates at equilibrium. According to the stoichiometry of the dissociation reaction, for every 'x' moles of complex that dissociate, 'x' moles of $Ca^{2+}$ and 'x' moles of $EDTA^{4-}$ are formed.\n\n    | Species             | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n    | ------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----------------- |\n    | $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$  | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x          |\n    | $Ca^{2+}$           | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n    | $EDTA^{4-}$         | 0           | +x         | x                 |\n\n    *(Note: The problem assumes an \"ideal pH,\" which simplifies the problem by allowing us to use the total concentration of free EDTA in the equilibrium expression, without considering its various protonated forms. We treat it as if all free EDTA is in the $EDTA^{4-}$ form).*\n\n4.  **Write the equilibrium expression for dissociation and solve for x.**\n    $K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}$\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{(0.02 - x)}$\n\n5.  **Apply an approximation.**\n    Because the formation constant $K_f$ is very large, the complex is very stable, and the dissociation constant $K_d$ is very small. This means that very little of the complex will dissociate, so 'x' will be much smaller than the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can therefore approximate $(0.02 - x) \\approx 0.02$.\n\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the value of x.**\n    To make the calculation easier and more precise, we can use a simple Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nKd = 1 / (5 * 10**10)\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02\n\n# We need to solve the equation: Kd = x**2 / (initial_complex_conc - x)\n# Using the approximation: Kd ≈ x**2 / initial_complex_conc\n# x**2 ≈ Kd * initial_complex_conc\n# x = sqrt(Kd * initial_complex_conc)\n\nx_squared = Kd * initial_complex_conc\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\n6.32e-07\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation shows that x is approximately $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion.**\n    The value of x represents the equilibrium concentration of free $Ca^{2+}$ ions.\n    $[Ca^{2+}] = x \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n    This value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This problem requires calculating the concentration of free calcium ions, $Ca^{2+}$, that result from the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex in solution.\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant chemical reaction:** We are starting with the Ca-EDTA complex and are interested in the free calcium ions. This means we should consider the dissociation of the complex. The reaction is:\n    $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n2.  **Determine the equilibrium constant for this reaction:** The problem provides the formation constant ($K_f$ or KCa-EDTA) for the complex, which is for the forward reaction ($Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$).\n    $K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n    The dissociation constant ($K_d$) is the equilibrium constant for the reverse reaction (dissociation). It is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    $K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:** We start with an initial concentration of the complex of 0.02 M. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates to reach equilibrium.\n\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| $[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}$ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| $Ca^{2+}$ | 0 | +x | x |\n| $EDTA^{4-}$ | 0 | +x | x |\n\n    The problem states an \"ideal pH,\" which is a simplification allowing us to assume that all free EDTA exists as the fully deprotonated $EDTA^{4-}$ form.\n\n4.  **Write the equilibrium expression and solve for x:** The equilibrium expression for the dissociation is:\n    $K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}{[[Ca(EDTA)]^{2-}]}$\n\n    Substitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table:\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{(0.02 - x)}$\n\n5.  **Apply an approximation:** The value of $K_d$ is extremely small ($2 \\times 10^{-11}$), which indicates that the equilibrium lies far to the left, and very little of the complex will dissociate. Therefore, 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can simplify the denominator:\n    $(0.02 - x) \\approx 0.02$\n\n    The expression becomes:\n    $2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n\n6.  **Calculate x:** Now we solve for x, which represents the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ ions.\n    $x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times 0.02$\n    $x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n    $x \\approx \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-14}}$\n    $x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7} M$\n\n    The Python code execution confirmed this calculation, yielding $6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$.\n\n7.  **Compare with the options:**\n    The calculated concentration of calcium ions is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
