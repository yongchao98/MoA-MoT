    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial State:**\n    The system of two electrons is in a coupled angular momentum state given by $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    *   $l_1 = 1$: orbital angular momentum quantum number of the first electron (p-orbital).\n    *   $l_2 = 1$: orbital angular momentum quantum number of the second electron (p-orbital).\n    *   $l = 2$: total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the two-electron system.\n    *   $m = -1$: the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum ($L_z$).\n\n    This state is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum squared operator, $L^2$, and the total z-component of angular momentum operator, $L_z$. A measurement of $L_z$ on this state will always yield the eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Final State (Measurement Outcome):**\n    We are interested in the joint probability of measuring the z-components of the individual angular momenta, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    *   The desired eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_1 = -1$ for the first electron. The state of the first electron would be $|l_1, m_1> = |1, -1>_1$.\n    *   The desired eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_2 = -1$ for the second electron. The state of the second electron would be $|l_2, m_2> = |1, -1>_2$.\n\n    The combined state corresponding to this measurement outcome is the uncoupled state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Total Z-Component of Angular Momentum for the Final State:**\n    The total z-component of angular momentum is the sum of the individual components: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    The corresponding quantum number for the total z-component is $m_{final} = m_1 + m_2$.\n    For the desired outcome, $m_{final} = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    So, if this measurement outcome were to occur, the system would be in a state with a total z-component of angular momentum eigenvalue of $-2\\hbar$.\n\n4.  **Compare the Initial and Final States:**\n    *   The initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ is an eigenstate of $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$.\n    *   The final state (the measurement outcome) $|1, -1; 1, -1>$ is an eigenstate of $L_z$ with eigenvalue $-2\\hbar$.\n\n    The initial state has a definite total z-component of angular momentum, characterized by $m=-1$. The state corresponding to the measurement outcome has a different total z-component, characterized by $m_{final}=-2$.\n\n5.  **Apply the Principles of Quantum Mechanics:**\n    The probability of measuring the system, initially in state $|\\psi_{initial}>$, to be in a particular final state $|\\psi_{final}>$ is given by the square of the magnitude of their inner product: $P = |<\\psi_{final}|\\psi_{initial}>|^2$.\n\n    In our case:\n    $|\\psi_{initial}> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$\n    $|\\psi_{final}> = |1, -1; 1, -1>$\n\n    The probability is $P = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2$.\n\n    The states $|1, 1, 2, -1>$ and $|1, -1; 1, -1>$ are eigenstates of the same Hermitian operator, $L_z$, but with different eigenvalues ($-1\\hbar$ and $-2\\hbar$, respectively). A fundamental theorem of linear algebra states that eigenvectors of a Hermitian operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal.\n\n    Therefore, the inner product is zero:\n    $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1> = 0$.\n\n    This can also be seen from the perspective of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The coupled state can be expanded in terms of the uncoupled states:\n    $|l, m> = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} <l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m> |l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2>$\n    The coefficients $<l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m>$ are the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, and they are non-zero only if $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n    In our case, we want the coefficient for the state where $m_1=-1$ and $m_2=-1$. So $m_1+m_2 = -2$.\n    However, the initial state has $m=-1$.\n    Since $m \\neq m_1+m_2$, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is zero. This means the state $|1, -1; 1, -1>$ is not a component of the state $|1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    Since the inner product is zero, the probability is $P = |0|^2 = 0$. It is impossible to obtain the specified measurement result because it would violate the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\n<<<D>>>"
