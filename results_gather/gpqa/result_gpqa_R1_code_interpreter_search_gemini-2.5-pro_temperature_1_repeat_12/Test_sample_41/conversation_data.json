    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance.**\n    The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet orbiting a star is given by the formula:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}} \\cdot (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    Where:\n    *   $T_{star}$ is the star's temperature.\n    *   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (orbital distance).\n    *   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\n    In this problem, all three planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constant. We are also told that the albedo ($A$) is the same for all three planets. Therefore, all terms except the semi-major axis ($a$) are constant. This simplifies the relationship to:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$ or $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\n\n2.  **Use the temperature ratios to find the ratio of orbital distances.**\n    From the relationship above, we can write the ratio of temperatures for any two planets (e.g., Planet X and Planet Y) as:\n    $\\frac{T_{eqX}}{T_{eqY}} = \\frac{a_X^{-1/2}}{a_Y^{-1/2}} = (\\frac{a_Y}{a_X})^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_Y}{a_X}}$\n\n    We need to find the ratio of the orbital distances of Planet 3 to Planet 1 ($a_3/a_1$). To do this, we first need the temperature ratio between Planet 1 and Planet 3 ($T_{eq1}/T_{eq3}$).\n    We are given:\n    *   $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = 1.4$\n    *   $\\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}} = 2.3$\n\n    We can find $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq3}}$ by multiplying these two ratios:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq3}} = \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} \\times \\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}} = 1.4 \\times 2.3 = 3.22$\n\n    Now, we can relate this temperature ratio to the orbital distance ratio:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq3}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_3}{a_1}}$\n    To find $\\frac{a_3}{a_1}$, we square both sides:\n    $\\frac{a_3}{a_1} = (\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq3}})^2 = (3.22)^2 = 10.3684$\n\n3.  **Relate the orbital distance ratio to the orbital period ratio using Kepler's Third Law.**\n    Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis ($a$):\n    $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    $P \\propto a^{3/2}$\n\n    The ratio of the orbital periods of Planet 3 and Planet 1 is therefore:\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (\\frac{a_3}{a_1})^{3/2}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the final ratio.**\n    Substitute the value of $\\frac{a_3}{a_1}$ we found in step 2:\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.3684)^{3/2}$\n\n    Alternatively, we can express the period ratio directly in terms of the temperature ratio:\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = ((\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq3}})^2)^{3/2} = (\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq3}})^3$\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (3.22)^3$\n\n    Now, let's compute the value.\n    ```python\n    # Given ratios of equilibrium temperatures\n    T_ratio_1_over_2 = 1.4\n    T_ratio_2_over_3 = 2.3\n    \n    # Calculate the ratio of equilibrium temperature between Planet 1 and Planet 3\n    T_ratio_1_over_3 = T_ratio_1_over_2 * T_ratio_2_over_3\n    \n    # The relationship between orbital period (P) and equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is P ∝ T_eq^(-3).\n    # Therefore, P3 / P1 = (T_eq3 / T_eq1)^3 = (1 / (T_eq1 / T_eq3))^3.\n    # A colder planet (lower T_eq) has a longer period.\n    # T_eq1 > T_eq3, so P3 > P1.\n    # The correct relationship is P3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)^3.\n    # Let's derive it again:\n    # T1/T3 = sqrt(a3/a1) => a3/a1 = (T1/T3)^2\n    # P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2) = ((T1/T3)^2)^(3/2) = (T1/T3)^3\n    \n    period_ratio_3_over_1 = T_ratio_1_over_3 ** 3\n    \n    print(period_ratio_3_over_1)\n    ```\n    <execute_output>\n    33.386248000000005\n    </execute_output>\n    The calculation gives approximately 33.4.\n\n5.  **Consider the extra information.**\n    The problem provides ratios of the planets' masses and mentions the TTV discovery method. This information is typically extraneous in such problems unless the planetary masses are a significant fraction of the star's mass. Assuming the star is much more massive than the planets (which is almost always the case), Kepler's simplified third law is a very good approximation. Therefore, the mass information is not needed for the calculation.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) ~ 4.4\nB) ~ 10.4\nC) ~ 33.4\nD) ~ 3.2\n\nOur calculated value of ~33.4 matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
