    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Principle:** The problem involves determining the speed of light in a moving medium as observed from a stationary frame. This is a classic application of the relativistic velocity addition formula, a core concept in Einstein's theory of special relativity. We cannot simply add the velocities as we would in classical (Galilean) mechanics.\n\n2.  **Define the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   Let **S** be the stationary laboratory frame where the observer is located.\n    *   Let **S'** be the moving frame that is at rest with respect to the glass.\n\n3.  **Identify the Velocities:**\n    *   **v**: The velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the laboratory (frame S). The problem states the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam.\n    *   **u'**: The velocity of the light beam relative to the glass (in frame S'). The speed of light in a medium with a refractive index `n` is given by `c/n`. Since the problem specifies that the speed of light in a vacuum `c = 1`, the speed of light within the glass is `u' = 1/n`. This velocity is in the same direction as `v`.\n    *   **u**: The velocity of the light beam relative to the laboratory (in frame S). This is the quantity we need to find.\n\n4.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    The formula for adding velocities that are in the same direction is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n5.  **Substitute the Known Values:**\n    We substitute `u' = 1/n` and `c = 1` into the formula:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + ((1/n) * v) / 1^2)`\n\n6.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    First, simplify the denominator:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To eliminate the fractions within the numerator and denominator, we can multiply both the top and bottom of the main fraction by `n`:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n\n    Distribute the `n` in both the numerator and the denominator:\n    `u = (n * (1/n) + n * v) / (n * 1 + n * (v/n))`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The derived expression `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)` matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
