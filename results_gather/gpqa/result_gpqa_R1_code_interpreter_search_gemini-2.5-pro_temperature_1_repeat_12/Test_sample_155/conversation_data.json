    "This problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the stereochemical outcomes of two reactions and the subsequent separation of the resulting products using two different types of HPLC.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. It is achiral.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction on the alkene. Epoxidation is a **syn-addition**, meaning the oxygen atom adds to both carbons of the double bond from the same face.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reagent catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The acid-catalyzed opening of an epoxide is an **anti-addition**, where the nucleophile (water) attacks from the side opposite to the epoxide ring, leading to the formation of a diol.\n\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step process (syn-epoxidation followed by anti-ring-opening) results in a net **anti-dihydroxylation** of the alkene.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 1:**\n    We are performing an anti-addition on a trans-alkene. A well-known stereochemical rule (often remembered by the mnemonic \"TAM\": Trans-Anti-Meso) states that the anti-addition to a trans-alkene results in a **meso compound**.\n\n    *Let's verify this mechanistically:*\n    1.  Epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene (trans) gives a trans-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is achiral, the reaction produces a racemic mixture of the two enantiomeric trans-epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of this racemic mixture:\n        *   The (4R,5R)-epoxide undergoes backside attack by water. Attack at C4 (inverting its configuration from R to S) yields (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   The (4S,5S)-epoxide undergoes backside attack by water. Attack at C4 (inverting its configuration from S to R) yields (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    3.  The products are (4S,5R)- and (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. For a molecule like octane-4,5-diol where the substituents on the two stereocenters (C4 and C5) are identical (H, OH, propyl), the (R,S) and (S,R) forms are the same achiral molecule—a meso compound. This is because it possesses a center of inversion, making it superimposable on its mirror image.\n\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single compound, **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is achiral.\n*   **Reagents:** Same as Reaction 1 (mCPBA, then H₃O⁺).\n*   **Overall Transformation:** This is also a net **anti-dihydroxylation**.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 2:**\n    We are performing an anti-addition on a cis-alkene. The stereochemical rule (mnemonic \"CAR\": Cis-Anti-Racemic) states that the anti-addition to a cis-alkene results in a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers.\n\n    *Let's verify this mechanistically:*\n    1.  Epoxidation of (Z)-oct-4-ene (cis) gives a cis-epoxide. The cis-epoxide has a plane of symmetry, so it is a single meso compound: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of this meso-epoxide:\n        *   The starting epoxide is symmetric. Attack by water can occur at C4 or C5 with equal probability.\n        *   Attack at C4 (which is R) inverts its configuration to S, leaving C5 as S. This forms **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n        *   Attack at C5 (which is S) inverts its configuration to R, leaving C4 as R. This forms **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n    3.  The two products, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are non-superimposable mirror images—they are a pair of enantiomers. Since both pathways are equally probable, they are formed in equal amounts.\n\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains three distinct chemical compounds:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationships between these compounds are:\n*   Compound 1 is achiral (meso).\n*   Compounds 2 and 3 are a pair of enantiomers.\n*   Compound 1 is a diastereomer of compound 2 and compound 3.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** (like compounds 2 and 3) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore **cannot be separated**. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** (like compound 1 and the pair 2/3) have different physical properties and **can be separated**.\n    *   Therefore, the achiral HPLC will show two peaks:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: The racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   **Total: 2 peaks**\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It can also separate diastereomers.\n    *   The chiral column will separate the enantiomeric pair (compounds 2 and 3) into two distinct peaks.\n    *   The meso compound (compound 1), being a diastereomer to the other two, will also be separated from them. As an achiral compound, it will produce a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC will show three peaks, one for each unique compound in the mixture:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 3: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   **Total: 3 peaks**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard HPLC chromatogram and **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<A>>>"
