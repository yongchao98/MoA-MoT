As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n\nA) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nB) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1\nC) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nD) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n",

    "*   **Analysis of Single Mutants:**\n    *   **g2 (0% resistance):** The knockout of gene G2 leads to a complete loss of resistance. This indicates that G2 plays a critical and essential role in the resistance pathway. A complete loss of function often points to a gene at the top of a regulatory hierarchy or an essential component of the core resistance machinery.\n    *   **g1 (75% resistance) and g3 (50% resistance):** The knockout of G1 or G3 leads to a partial loss of resistance. This means both genes contribute to the full resistance phenotype, but neither is absolutely essential on its own. G3 appears to have a more significant contribution than G1.\n\n*   **Analysis of Double Mutants (Gene Interactions):**\n    *   **g1g2 (0% resistance) and g2g3 (0% resistance):** In both cases, the phenotype of the double mutant is identical to the phenotype of the g2 single mutant (0% resistance). This is a classic case of **epistasis**. When the phenotype of a double mutant matches one of the single mutants, the gene corresponding to that phenotype is said to be epistatic to (i.e., it masks the effect of) the other gene. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3**. In a genetic pathway, this strongly implies that G2 acts upstream of G1 and G3. Since we are told one of the genes is a transcription factor, G2 is the most logical candidate, as it appears to regulate the entire pathway. If the master switch (G2) is off, it doesn't matter what the downstream genes (G1, G3) are doing.\n\n    *   **g1g3 (10% resistance):** Here, the phenotype is novel and more severe than either of the single mutants (g1=75%, g3=50%). Let's consider the loss of resistance:\n        *   Loss in g1: 25%\n        *   Loss in g3: 50%\n        *   Expected additive loss: 25% + 50% = 75% (leading to 25% resistance).\n        *   Observed loss in g1g3: 90% (leading to 10% resistance).\n    The fact that the observed loss of resistance (90%) is greater than the sum of the individual losses (75%) is known as a **synergistic interaction** (or synthetic enhancement). This typically occurs when two genes function in parallel or compensatory pathways. The term **gene redundancy** is used to describe situations where two or more genes perform similar functions, so the loss of one can be at least partially compensated for by the other(s). The severe phenotype of the g1g3 double mutant supports the idea that G1 and G3 have redundant functions.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:**\n        *   *G2 is a transcription factor:* This aligns perfectly with our finding that G2 is an upstream epistatic regulator. (Correct)\n        *   *G1 and G3 show gene redundancy:* The synergistic effect of the g1g3 double mutant is strong evidence for this. (Correct)\n        *   *G1 is epistatic towards G3:* This is incorrect. The g1g3 phenotype (10%) is not the same as the g1 phenotype (75%).\n\n    *   **B) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1:**\n        *   *G1 is a transcription factor:* Incorrect. G2 is the clear candidate.\n        *   *G2 and G3 show pleiotropy:* Incorrect. Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. We only have data for one trait (resistance). The interaction observed is synergy/redundancy, not pleiotropy.\n        *   *G2 is epistatic towards G1:* This part is correct, but the other statements are wrong.\n\n    *   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:**\n        *   *G2 is a transcription factor:* Correct.\n        *   *G1 and G3 show pleiotropy:* Incorrect, as explained above.\n\n    *   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:**\n        *   *G2 is a transcription factor:* Correct.\n        *   *G1 and G3 has the same promoter:* This is a possible molecular mechanism, but it cannot be concluded from this genetic data alone.\n        *   *G3 is epistatic towards G1:* Incorrect. The g1g3 phenotype (10%) is not the same as the g3 phenotype (50%).\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    Option A contains two strongly supported conclusions drawn directly from the experimental data: that G2 is the upstream transcription factor and that G1 and G3 act redundantly. Although the third statement in option A (\"G1 is epistatic towards G3\") is factually incorrect based on the data, Option A is still the best choice because the other options contain more significant errors and misinterpretations of the core genetic interactions.\n\n<<<A>>>"
