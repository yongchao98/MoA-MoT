    "*   **Analysis of Tautomerism (Compound A)**\n\n    *   **Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two structural isomers (tautomers) that are readily interconvertible. The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group).\n\n    *   **Benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone):** The structure consists of a six-membered ring with two C=C double bonds and two C=O double bonds. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the alpha-carbons) are part of the C=C double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n         ![Structure of Benzoquinone](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/1%2C4-Benzoquinone.svg/1200px-1%2C4-Benzoquinone.svg.png) \n\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This is a cyclic compound with three carbonyl groups. The carbons between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are alpha-carbons. Each of these alpha-carbons has two hydrogen atoms. The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it readily tautomerizes to form its enol, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is an aromatic and very stable compound.\n         ![Tautomerism of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione](https://www.chem.ucla.edu/~harding/IGOC/P/phloroglucinol01.png) \n\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Benzoquinone is the compound that does not show tautomerism. So, **A = benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism (Compound B)**\n\n    *   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common source of chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2), which is bonded to the -OH group.\n        *   Group 1: -H (Hydrogen)\n        *   Group 2: -OH (Hydroxyl group)\n        *   Group 3: -CH₃ (Methyl group)\n        *   Group 4: -COOCH₃ (Methoxycarbonyl group)\n        Since all four groups attached to C2 are different, this carbon is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the arrangement around the C=C double bond is *trans*. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that lies in the plane of the molecule and a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C bond. It does not have any chiral centers. Therefore, it is an achiral molecule and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the compound that will show optical isomerism. So, **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer Formulation**\n    *   Compound A (no tautomerism) is benzoquinone.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n    *   This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
