    "This problem can be solved using the energy-time uncertainty principle, which states that the uncertainty in the energy of a quantum state (ΔE) is inversely proportional to its lifetime (Δt or τ). The relationship is given by:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nFor order-of-magnitude calculations, this is often approximated as:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy (also known as the natural linewidth).\n*   τ is the lifetime of the state.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant, which is approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each of the two quantum states.\n\n**For the first state:**\n*   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n*   Energy uncertainty ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\n*   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**For the second state:**\n*   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n*   Energy uncertainty ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂\n*   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" these two energy levels, the difference in their energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be greater than the broadening of the energy levels. A common criterion for resolvability (the Rayleigh criterion for spectral lines) is that the energy difference should be at least as large as the sum of the individual energy uncertainties (or their half-widths, but using the full widths provides a safe margin).\n\nThe total energy uncertainty we need to overcome is the sum of the individual uncertainties:\nΔE_total = ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\nΔE_total ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\nΔE_total ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\nΔE_total ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nSo, for the energy levels to be clearly resolved, their energy difference must be significantly larger than this value:\n|E₁ - E₂| > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nNow, let's examine the given options:\nA) 10⁻⁸ eV < 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV (Not resolvable)\nB) 10⁻⁴ eV > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV (Resolvable)\nC) 10⁻⁹ eV < 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV (Not resolvable)\nD) 10⁻¹¹ eV < 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV (Not resolvable)\n\nOnly option B provides an energy difference that is substantially larger than the combined energy uncertainty of the two states.\n\nLet's confirm the calculation with a python script.\n```python\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nh_bar_eVs = 6.582119569e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states\ntau1 = 1e-9  # seconds\ntau2 = 1e-8  # seconds\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state\ndelta_E1 = h_bar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = h_bar_eVs / tau2\n\n# The total linewidth is the sum of the individual linewidths\ntotal_linewidth = delta_E1 + delta_E2\n\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty for state 1 (ΔE1): {delta_E1:.4e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty for state 2 (ΔE2): {delta_E2:.4e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Total uncertainty (minimum energy difference for resolution): {total_linewidth:.4e} eV\")\n\n# Check the options\noptions = {\n    'A': 1e-8,\n    'B': 1e-4,\n    'C': 1e-9,\n    'D': 1e-11\n}\n\nprint(\"\\nChecking options against the required minimum energy difference:\")\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    if value > total_linewidth:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is resolvable.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is not resolvable.\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "The reasoning and calculations performed are correct. Let's summarize the process:\n\n1.  **Uncertainty Principle:** The core principle is the energy-time uncertainty principle, which states that a quantum state with a finite lifetime (τ) has an inherent uncertainty or \"width\" in its energy (ΔE). The relationship is approximately ΔE ≈ ħ/τ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\n2.  **Calculate Energy Widths:**\n    *   For the first state (τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s), the energy width is ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   For the second state (τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s), the energy width is ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV.\n\n3.  **Resolution Condition:** To clearly resolve two energy levels, the difference in their energies must be significantly larger than their energy widths. A good rule of thumb is that the energy difference should be greater than the sum of the individual widths: |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂.\n    *   Total required separation ≈ ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ (6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.658 x 10⁻⁷ eV) ≈ 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Options:** We need to find an option that is greater than ~7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   A) 10⁻⁸ eV is too small.\n    *   B) 10⁻⁴ eV is much larger than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   C) 10⁻⁹ eV is too small.\n    *   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV is too small.\n\nThe Python code executed and confirmed these calculations, showing that the minimum energy difference for resolution is approximately 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Only option B (10⁻⁴ eV) satisfies this condition.\n\n<<<B>>>"
