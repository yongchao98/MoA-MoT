    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Acid/Anhydride:** The problem describes the dehydration of a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid to an anhydride.\n        *   ¹H NMR of the anhydride: A single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates two chemically equivalent vinylic protons (a chemical shift of ~7 ppm is characteristic of vinylic protons deshielded by adjacent carbonyl groups).\n        *   ¹³C NMR of the anhydride: Two peaks at 137 ppm (vinylic carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons).\n        *   The only structure that fits this data is **maleic anhydride**, which is formed from *cis*-butenedioic acid (maleic acid). It is a planar molecule with a C₂v symmetry axis, making the two vinylic protons equivalent and the two vinylic carbons equivalent, as well as the two carbonyl carbons equivalent.\n\n    *   **Diene:** The problem explicitly names the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene system at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4, each bearing a methyl group, and a CH₂ group at position 5.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction**\n    *   The reaction between the anhydride (dienophile) and the diene is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative. The product's molecular formula is C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which is the sum of the reactants' formulas (C₄H₂O₃ for maleic anhydride and C₉H₁₄ for the diene).\n\n3.  **Determine the Stereochemistry of the Major and Minor Products**\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can form two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   The **endo rule** predicts that the major product is typically the *endo* adduct, due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions.\n    *   However, this rule can be overridden by significant steric hindrance. The diene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, has bulky methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions, which are involved in the new bond formation. These methyl groups sterically hinder the *endo* approach of the dienophile.\n    *   Therefore, in this specific case, the **major product is the *exo* adduct**, and the **minor product is the *endo* adduct**. This is a known exception to the endo rule, confirmed by literature.\n        *   **Major Product = Exo Adduct:** The anhydride ring is on the *exo* face of the bicyclic system (on the same side as the C7 methylene bridge).\n        *   **Minor Product = Endo Adduct:** The anhydride ring is on the *endo* face (on the opposite side of the C7 bridge).\n\n4.  **Analyze the Product Structure and Proton NMR Signals**\n    *   The product has a plane of symmetry passing through the C7 bridge and the center of the C=C and anhydride bonds.\n    *   This symmetry makes pairs of protons and methyl groups equivalent. We expect the following signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum:\n        *   **Vinylic Methyls (`Me_alkene`):** Two methyl groups on the C=C double bond (at C2, C3). They are equivalent. Signal: **6H singlet**. Chemical shift for vinylic methyls is typically ~1.6-2.0 ppm.\n        *   **Bridgehead Methyls (`Me_bridgehead`):** Two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (C1, C4). They are equivalent. Signal: **6H singlet**. Chemical shift for saturated methyls is typically lower, ~1.0-1.5 ppm.\n        *   **Anhydride Protons (`H_anhydride`):** Two protons on the carbons from maleic anhydride (at C5, C6). They are equivalent. Signal: **2H singlet**. Being alpha to carbonyl groups, they are deshielded, with a typical shift of ~3.0-4.0 ppm.\n        *   **Bridge Protons (`H_bridge`):** Two non-equivalent protons on the C7 methylene bridge. They would likely appear as two separate signals (e.g., two doublets), but are not central to the options provided.\n\n5.  **Interpret the NOESY Spectrum**\n    *   A NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) cross-peak indicates that two sets of protons are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent/weak in the minor product**.\n    *   We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *exo* adduct (major) but far apart in the *endo* adduct (minor).\n\n    *   **In the Exo Adduct (Major Product):**\n        *   The anhydride ring is *exo*. The two `H_anhydride` protons are on the *endo* face. This means they point \"down\" towards the C2=C3 double bond.\n        *   The `Me_alkene` groups are also on the \"bottom\" part of the structure.\n        *   Therefore, the *endo* `H_anhydride` protons are **spatially close** to the `Me_alkene` protons. A strong NOE is expected.\n\n    *   **In the Endo Adduct (Minor Product):**\n        *   The anhydride ring is *endo*. The two `H_anhydride` protons are on the *exo* face. This means they point \"up\" away from the C2=C3 double bond and towards the C7 bridge.\n        *   Therefore, the *exo* `H_anhydride` protons are **spatially far** from the `Me_alkene` protons. The NOE would be absent or very weak.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** The distinguishing cross-peak in the major product's spectrum connects the `H_anhydride` protons and the `Me_alkene` protons.\n\n6.  **Match with the Given Options**\n    *   We are looking for the signals corresponding to `H_anhydride` and `Me_alkene`.\n    *   `H_anhydride` = 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n    *   `Me_alkene` = 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.\n\n    Let's evaluate the options:\n    *   **A) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This perfectly matches the signals for `Me_alkene` and `H_anhydride`, which are the protons that show proximity in the major (*exo*) product.\n    *   B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: This describes an interaction between a bridge proton and the anhydride protons, which is not the key differentiating interaction.\n    *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm: Describes an interaction between the bridgehead methyls and a bridge proton.\n    *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm: Describes an interaction between the two different types of methyl groups, which are not uniquely close in the major product.\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
