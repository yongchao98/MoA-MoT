    "*   **Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material (Compound X) from the provided spectral data.**\n\n    *   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This very broad signal is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid dimer.\n        *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption corresponds to the C=O stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n        *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These absorptions are typical for C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** The presence of both a broad O-H and a C=O stretch strongly indicates that Compound X is a carboxylic acid containing an aromatic ring.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet (bs) in this downfield region (typically 10-13 ppm) is definitive for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the IR analysis.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The doublet at 8.0 ppm is significantly downfield, indicating it is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group. The doublet at 7.2 ppm is further upfield, suggesting it is adjacent to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n        *   **Alkyl Group Analysis (Putting the remaining pieces together):**\n            *   We have four signals corresponding to the second substituent on the benzene ring: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons means a -CH₃ group is next to a -CH₂ group (`-CH₂-CH₃`).\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons means a -CH₃ group is next to a -CH group (`-CH-CH₃`).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons is consistent with the -CH₂- group from the `-CH₂-CH₃` fragment, which would be split by both the adjacent -CH₃ (3H) and the -CH group (1H).\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton is consistent with the -CH group from the `-CH-CH₃` fragment. Its chemical shift (2.9 ppm) indicates it is a benzylic proton (directly attached to the aromatic ring). This CH is split by the adjacent -CH₃ (3H) and the -CH₂- (2H).\n            *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** Connecting these fragments (`-CH₂-CH₃` and `-CH-CH₃`) via the benzylic CH gives the structure: `Ar-CH(CH₂CH₃)(CH₃)`. This is a **sec-butyl** group.\n        *   **Conclusion from NMR:** Combining all the information, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (B).\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the reaction and predict the product.**\n\n    *   **Reaction:** Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) is reacted with **red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI)**.\n    *   **Reagent Function:** The combination of red P and HI is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The aromatic ring and the saturated alkyl chain (sec-butyl group) are unaffected by these conditions.\n    *   **Transformation:**\n        *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n        *   Reaction: The -COOH group is reduced to a -CH₃ group.\n        *   Final Product: The resulting molecule has a methyl group and a sec-butyl group in a para (1,4) arrangement on the benzene ring. The IUPAC name for this product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Compare the predicted product with the given options.**\n\n    *   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure and functional group.\n    *   B) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material, not the final product.\n    *   C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This perfectly matches our predicted final product.\n    *   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - This has an isobutyl group, not the sec-butyl group from the starting material.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
