    "The user wants to find the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical quantities:**\n    *   Production energy of X: $E_{X} = 8$ GeV = 8000 MeV\n    *   Mass of X: $m_{X} = 1.2$ GeV. In particle physics units where c=1, this means the rest energy is $m_{X}c^2 = 1.2$ GeV = 1200 MeV.\n    *   Decay width of X: $\\Gamma_{X} = 320$ MeV.\n\n2.  **Recall the formula for the mean decay distance (or decay length):**\n    The mean decay distance $L$ is the average distance a particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. It is given by:\n    $L = v \\cdot T_{lab}$\n    where $v$ is the particle's velocity and $T_{lab}$ is its mean lifetime in the lab frame.\n\n3.  **Relate lab frame lifetime to proper lifetime:**\n    The lifetime is subject to time dilation. The mean lifetime in the lab frame, $T_{lab}$, is related to the proper lifetime $\\tau$ (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame) by the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$:\n    $T_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau$\n    The velocity can be written as $v = \\beta c$, where $\\beta$ is the velocity as a fraction of the speed of light $c$.\n    So, the formula for the decay distance becomes:\n    $L = (\\beta c) (\\gamma \\tau) = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau$\n\n4.  **Relate the proper lifetime $\\tau$ to the decay width $\\Gamma$:**\n    The Heisenberg uncertainty principle connects the decay width and the proper lifetime:\n    $\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_{X}}$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n5.  **Combine the formulas:**\n    Substituting the expression for $\\tau$ into the equation for $L$, we get:\n    $L = \\gamma \\beta c \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_{X}} = (\\gamma \\beta) \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_{X}}$\n    This form is convenient because the product $\\hbar c$ is a well-known constant in particle physics.\n\n6.  **Calculate the kinematic factor $\\gamma \\beta$:**\n    The factor $\\gamma \\beta$ can be determined from the particle's energy and mass. The relativistic energy-momentum relation is:\n    $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2$\n    And the relativistic momentum is:\n    $p = \\gamma m v = \\gamma m (\\beta c)$\n    So, $pc = \\gamma \\beta (m c^2)$.\n    Solving for $\\gamma \\beta$:\n    $\\gamma \\beta = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{mc^2}$\n    Now, we plug in the given values for $E_X$ and $m_X c^2$:\n    $\\gamma \\beta = \\frac{\\sqrt{(8000 \\text{ MeV})^2 - (1200 \\text{ MeV})^2}}{1200 \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{64,000,000 - 1,440,000}}{1200} = \\frac{\\sqrt{62,560,000}}{1200} \\approx 6.59124$\n\n7.  **Calculate the mean decay distance $L$:**\n    Now we can calculate $L$ using the combined formula.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to calculate the mean decay distance ($L$) of a particle in the laboratory frame. This is the average distance the particle travels before it decays.\n\n**2. Identify Key Formulas**\nThe mean decay distance ($L$) is given by the particle's velocity ($v$) multiplied by its mean lifetime in the lab frame ($T_{\\text{lab}}$):\n$L = v \\cdot T_{\\text{lab}}$\n\nDue to relativistic time dilation, the lifetime in the lab frame is longer than the particle's proper lifetime ($\\tau$, the lifetime in its own rest frame). The relationship is given by the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n$T_{\\text{lab}} = \\gamma \\tau$\n\nThe velocity can be expressed as a fraction of the speed of light, $v = \\beta c$. Substituting these into the first equation gives:\n$L = (\\beta c) (\\gamma \\tau) = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau$\n\nThe proper lifetime $\\tau$ is related to the decay width ($\\Gamma_X$) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:\n$\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\nwhere $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nCombining these formulas, we get a convenient expression for the mean decay distance:\n$L = (\\gamma \\beta) \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\n**3. Calculate the Kinematic Factor ($\\gamma \\beta$)**\nThe factor $\\gamma \\beta$ depends on the particle's energy and mass. We can derive it from the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$.\n\nThe relativistic momentum is $p = \\gamma m v = \\gamma m (\\beta c)$, which means $pc = \\gamma \\beta (mc^2)$.\n\nSolving for $\\gamma \\beta$:\n$\\gamma \\beta = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{mc^2}$\n\n**4.

Perform the Calculation**\nTo ensure accuracy, we will use a Python script to compute the final value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values in MeV\nE_X = 8000.0      # Production energy\nm_X_c2 = 1200.0   # Rest energy (mass)\nGamma_X = 320.0   # Decay width\n\n# Physical constant hbar*c in MeV*m\n# The value is approximately 197.3269804 MeV*fm, where 1 fm = 1e-15 m.\nhbar_c = 197.3269804e-15  # in MeV*m\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the kinematic factor (gamma * beta)\n# gamma_beta = sqrt(E^2 - (m*c^2)^2) / (m*c^2)\ngamma_beta = math.sqrt(E_X**2 - m_X_c2**2) / m_X_c2\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the mean decay distance L using the formula\n# L = gamma_beta * (hbar*c / Gamma_X)\nL = gamma_beta * (hbar_c / Gamma_X)\n\n# Print the result in scientific notation to compare with the options\nprint(f\"{L:.4e}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\n4.0645e-15\n</execute_result>\n**6.

    "The calculation you have performed is correct. Let's walk through the reasoning again to confirm the result and select the correct option.\n\n**1. Theoretical Framework**\n\nThe problem asks for the *mean decay distance* ($L$), which is the average distance a particle travels in the laboratory frame before decaying. The key formulas are:\n\n*   **Mean Decay Distance:** The distance is the particle's speed ($v$) multiplied by its mean lifetime in the lab frame ($T_{\\text{lab}}$). Using relativistic notation where $v = \\beta c$:\n    $L = v \\cdot T_{\\text{lab}} = (\\beta c) \\cdot T_{\\text{lab}}$\n\n*   **Time Dilation:** The lifetime measured in the lab frame ($T_{\\text{lab}}$) is longer than the lifetime in the particle's own rest frame (the proper lifetime, $\\tau$) by a factor of the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n    $T_{\\text{lab}} = \\gamma \\tau$\n\n*   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** The proper lifetime ($\\tau$) of an unstable particle is inversely proportional to its decay width ($\\Gamma_X$). The exact relation involves the reduced Planck constant, $\\hbar$.\n    $\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\n*   **Combined Formula:** Substituting the expressions for $T_{\\text{lab}}$ and $\\tau$ into the equation for $L$, we get:\n    $L = (\\beta c) \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau) = \\gamma \\beta c \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X} = (\\gamma \\beta) \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n    This is the most convenient form for calculation.\n\n*   **Relativistic Kinematics:** The term $\\gamma \\beta$ can be calculated from the particle's total energy ($E_X$) and its rest mass energy ($m_X c^2$). From the energy-momentum relation $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$ and the definition of relativistic momentum $pc = \\gamma \\beta (mc^2)$, we get:\n    $\\gamma \\beta = \\frac{pc}{m_X c^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2}$\n\n**2. Calculation**\n\nNow, we plug the given values into these formulas.\n\n*   $E_{X} = 8 \\, \\text{GeV} = 8000 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n*   $m_{X}c^2 = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV} = 1200 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n*   $\\Gamma_{X} = 320 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n*   The physical constant $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\, \\text{MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm} = 197.327 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{MeV} \\cdot \\text{m}$\n\nThe calculation was performed using the following Python script, which is the most reliable way to avoid manual arithmetic errors.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values in MeV\nE_X = 8000.0\nm_X_c2 = 1200.0\nGamma_X = 320.0\n\n# Physical constant hbar*c in MeV*m\nhbar_c = 197.3269804e-15\n\n# Calculate the kinematic factor (gamma * beta)\ngamma_beta = math.sqrt(E_X**2 - m_X_c2**2) / m_X_c2\n\n# Calculate the mean decay distance L\nL = gamma_beta * (hbar_c / Gamma_X)\n\nprint(f\"{L:.4e}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\n4.0645e-15\n</execute_result>\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe code output, `4.0645e-15`, represents the mean decay distance in meters: $4.0645 \\times 10^{-15}$ m.\n\nNow we compare this result to the given options:\n*   A) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\n*   B) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\n*   C) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\n*   D) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\n\nThe calculated value ($4.0645 \\times 10^{-15}$ m) is extremely close to option B ($4.0655 \\times 10^{-15}$ m). The small difference (about 0.025%) is negligible and is almost certainly due to a slight difference in the precision of the value of $\\hbar c$ used to generate the problem's options versus the high-precision value used in the calculation.\n\nThe logic and the calculation are sound. Therefore, B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>",
