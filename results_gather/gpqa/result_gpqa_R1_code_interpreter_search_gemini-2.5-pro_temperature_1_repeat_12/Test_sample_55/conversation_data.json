    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the process:** The problem describes a two-step radiative decay process in a hydrogen atom, from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This happens via two consecutive electric dipole transitions, which means two photons are emitted. The process can be written as:\n    $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\gamma_1} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\gamma_2} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    where $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ is an intermediate state.\n\n2.  **Apply Electric Dipole Selection Rules:** The rules for an electric dipole transition between an initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ and a final state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n = n' - n$ can be any integer. For emission (decay), the energy must decrease, which means $n' < n$.\n\n3.  **Determine the intermediate state(s) for the first transition:**\n    *   **Initial state:** $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$, so $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n    *   **Intermediate state:** $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n    *   Applying the selection rules for the first transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |n',l',m'\\rangle$):\n        *   $\\Delta l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l$ must be non-negative, we must have $l'=1$. So, the intermediate state is a p-state.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m' - 0 = m' = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m'$ are $-1, 0, 1$.\n        *   $\\Delta n = n' - 3$ must be negative, so $n' < 3$. The most probable transition is to the closest energy level, which is $n'=2$. The options provided also point to the intermediate state having $n'=2$.\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Check the second transition:**\n    *   Let's verify that a transition from these intermediate states to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed.\n    *   **Intermediate state:** $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ with $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   **Final state:** $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   Applying the selection rules:\n        *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m' = 0 - m'$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$. This condition is satisfied for all possible intermediate $m'$ values ($-1, 0, 1$).\n    *   So, all three cascade paths are allowed by the selection rules:\n        *   Path 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Path 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Path 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n5.  **Calculate the transition probabilities (Branching Ratios):**\n    *   The question asks for the probability of a specific route. This is the branching ratio for that route among all possible routes.\n    *   **First transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle$):**\n        The rate of transition to a specific final state $|f\\rangle$ from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle f | \\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2$.\n        The branching ratio for a transition to a specific substate $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is:\n        $B(m') = \\frac{|\\langle 2,1,m' | \\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2}{\\sum_{m''=-1,0,1} |\\langle 2,1,m'' | \\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2}$\n    *   A key physical principle is that the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (a 3s state) is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). This means there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the transitions to the different magnetic substates ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) of the $|2,1\\rangle$ level must be equally probable.\n    *   Mathematically, this can be shown using the Wigner-Eckart theorem. The matrix element $\\langle n'l'm'|T_q^{(k)}|nlm\\rangle$ is proportional to a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $C_{lm;kq}^{l'm'}$. For our transition ($l=0, m=0$ to $l'=1$), the coefficients $C_{00;1q}^{1m'}$ are non-zero only if $m'=q$, and their values are all 1. This means the magnitude of the matrix element is the same for each final $m'$ state.\n    *   Since there are three possible final states ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) and the probabilities are equal, the probability of transitioning to any one of them must be $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n    *   So, the probability of the first step being $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$. Likewise, the probability for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$, and for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle$ is also $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n6.  **Analyze the second transition's probability:**\n    *   Once the atom is in an intermediate state, say $|2,1,0\\rangle$, it will decay further. The only dipole-allowed transition to the $n=1$ shell is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. All other decays (e.g., to other shells) are either forbidden or have much smaller probabilities. Therefore, the probability of the second step, e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$, is essentially 1 (or 100%).\n\n7.  **Calculate the total probability for a given path:**\n    *   The total probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n    *   For the route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$:\n        $P = P(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle)$\n        $P = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n8.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches our calculation.\n    D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect.\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
