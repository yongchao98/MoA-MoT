    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the given 1H NMR data:**\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This signal represents 3 protons that are a singlet (s). A singlet means these protons have no adjacent non-equivalent protons. A chemical shift of ~2.1 ppm is characteristic of a methyl group (CH3) attached to a carbonyl group (C=O), which is an acetyl group (`CH3CO-`). All four potential compounds are acetates, so they all contain this group.\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This signal represents 3 protons that are a doublet (d). A doublet means these protons are adjacent to a single proton (-CH). This signal is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a double bond (`CH3-CH=`).\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This signal represents 1 proton that is a doublet of quartets (dq). This means the proton is coupled to one adjacent proton (giving the doublet) and three other adjacent protons (giving the quartet). This is consistent with the proton (`-CH=`) that is adjacent to both another proton on the double bond and the methyl group we identified at 1.6 ppm.\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This signal represents 1 proton that is a doublet (d), meaning it's coupled to one other proton. The chemical shift is in the vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond). The most critical piece of information here is the coupling constant, **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n\n**2. Interpret the Coupling Constant (J-value):**\nFor protons on a double bond, the magnitude of the coupling constant (J) reveals their stereochemical relationship:\n*   **trans-coupling:** J is typically in the range of 12-18 Hz.\n*   **cis-coupling:** J is typically in the range of 6-12 Hz.\n\nThe observed coupling constant of **16.0 Hz** falls squarely in the range for a **trans** configuration. This allows us to eliminate the *cis* isomers.\n*   **Eliminated:** B) Cis-propenyl acetate and C) Cis-butenyl acetate.\n\n**3. Differentiate between Propenyl and Butenyl Structures:**\nWe are left with Trans-propenyl acetate and Trans-butenyl acetate. Let's analyze the expected number of protons and signals.\n\n*   **Propenyl acetate (C5H8O2):** The formula is `CH3-CH=CH-O-CO-CH3`. This molecule has 3+1+1+3 = **8 protons**. The integration in the NMR data is 3H + 3H + 1H + 1H = **8H**. This matches.\n*   **Butenyl acetate (C6H10O2):** The formula would be something like `CH3-CH2-CH=CH-O-CO-CH3` or an isomer. This molecule has **10 protons**. The NMR data only accounts for 8 protons. Therefore, the compound cannot be butenyl acetate.\n*   **Eliminated:** D) Trans-butenyl acetate.\n\n**4. Confirm the Structure of Trans-propenyl acetate:**\nLet's assign the signals to the protons in Trans-propenyl acetate.\nStructure: `trans-CH3(c)-CH(b)=CH(a)-O-C(=O)-CH3(d)`\n\n*   **H(d):** The acetyl methyl group. No adjacent protons. This corresponds to the **2.1 ppm (3H, s)** signal.\n*   **H(c):** The methyl group on the double bond. It's adjacent to one proton, H(b). This corresponds to the **1.6 ppm (3H, d)** signal.\n*   **H(b):** The vinylic proton adjacent to both H(a) and H(c). It's split into a doublet by H(a) and a quartet by the three H(c) protons. This corresponds to the **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)** signal.\n*   **H(a):** The vinylic proton attached to the oxygen atom. It is highly deshielded by the electronegative oxygen, shifting it far downfield. It is coupled only to H(b). This corresponds to the **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz)** signal.\n\nAll pieces of the 1H NMR data perfectly match the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
