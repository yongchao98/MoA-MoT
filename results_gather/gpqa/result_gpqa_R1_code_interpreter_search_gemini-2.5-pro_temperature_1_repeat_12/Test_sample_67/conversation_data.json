    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Initial State (t < 0)\n\n*   The particle is spin-1/2, so its spin angular momentum operator is `S`. The magnetic moment is `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B_vec = B * z_hat` (in the +Z direction).\n*   The Hamiltonian for this situation is `H_initial = -μ · B_vec = -γS_z * B`.\n*   The problem states the particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with the field. This means the particle is in the lowest energy eigenstate of `H_initial`.\n*   The eigenstates of `S_z` are spin-up `|+z>` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z>` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n*   The corresponding energies are:\n    *   `E_up = -γ(ħ/2)B`\n    *   `E_down = -γ(-ħ/2)B = +γ(ħ/2)B`\n*   Assuming `γ` and `B` are positive, the lowest energy state is the spin-up state, `|+z>`.\n*   So, at `t=0`, the state of the system is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n### 2. The Sudden Change (at t = 0)\n\n*   The magnetic field is suddenly switched from the Z-direction to the Y-direction: `B_vec = B * y_hat`.\n*   The new Hamiltonian for `t > 0` is `H_new = -μ · B_vec = -γS_y * B`.\n*   The \"sudden approximation\" in quantum mechanics states that if the Hamiltonian changes instantaneously, the state vector of the system does not have time to change. Therefore, the state of the system just after the change (at `t=0+`) is the same as the state just before: `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n### 3. Time Evolution (t > 0)\n\nThe time evolution of the state is governed by the new Hamiltonian `H_new`. There are a few ways to find the oscillation frequency.\n\n#### Method 1: Using the Bohr Frequency Relation\n\nThis is the most direct method. The oscillation frequency of any observable is determined by the energy differences between the populated energy eigenstates.\n1.  The state at `t > 0` will evolve as a superposition of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian, `H_new = -γBS_y`.\n2.  The eigenstates of `H_new` are the eigenstates of `S_y`, which we'll call `|+y>` and `|-y>`. Their `S_y` eigenvalues are `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`, respectively.\n3.  The energy eigenvalues of `H_new` are:\n    *   `E_{+y} = -γB(+ħ/2) = -γBħ/2`\n    *   `E_{-y} = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γBħ/2`\n4.  The initial state `|+z>` needs to be expressed in this new energy eigenbasis (`|+y>`, `|-y>`). The relationship is:\n    *   `|+z> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`\n5.  Since our initial state `|ψ(0)>` is a superposition of the two energy eigenstates `|+y>` and `|-y>`, the system will oscillate.\n6.  The angular frequency of oscillation `ω` is given by the Bohr frequency relation: `ω = ΔE / ħ`, where `ΔE` is the energy difference between the two states in the superposition.\n7.  `ΔE = E_{-y} - E_{+y} = (+γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2) = γBħ`.\n8.  Therefore, the oscillation frequency is `ω = (γBħ) / ħ = γB`.\n\n#### Method 2: Heisenberg Picture (Precession)\n\nThis method provides a nice classical analogy.\n1.  The time evolution of the expectation value of an operator `A` is given by the Heisenberg equation of motion: `d<A>/dt = (1/iħ) <[A, H]>`.\n2.  Let's look at the expectation value of the spin components. The general equation of motion for the spin vector `S` in a magnetic field `B_vec` is `d<S>/dt = γ(<S> × B_vec)`. This is the equation for Larmor precession.\n3.  This equation describes the spin vector `<S>` precessing around the magnetic field vector `B_vec` with an angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n4.  In our problem, at `t=0`, the spin is pointing in the +Z direction (`<S> = (ħ/2) z_hat`) and the magnetic field is in the +Y direction (`B_vec = B y_hat`).\n5.  The spin vector will precess around the Y-axis in the X-Z plane.\n6.  The Z-component of the spin, `<S_z>`, will oscillate between `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2` as it rotates. The frequency of this rotation (and thus oscillation) is the Larmor frequency, `ω = γB`.\n7.  Since the magnetic moment `μ_z = γS_z`, its expectation value `<μ_z>` will also oscillate with the same frequency.\n\n#### Method 3: Schrödinger Picture (Direct Calculation)\n\n1.  Start with the initial state `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n2.  The time evolution is `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ) |ψ(0)>`.\n3.  `H = -γBS_y`, so `|ψ(t)> = exp(iγBS_y t/ħ) |+z>`.\n4.  Representing the operators and states as matrices in the `S_z` basis (`|+z>` is `[1, 0]T` and `|-z>` is `[0, 1]T`):\n    *   `S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n5.  The time evolution operator `U(t) = exp(iγBS_y t/ħ) = exp( iγBt/ħ * (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] ) = exp( (γBt/2) * [[0, 1], [-1, 0]] )`.\n6.  Using the series expansion `exp(θA) = cos(θ)I + sin(θ)A` for `A = [[0, 1], [-1, 0]]`, we get:\n    *   `U(t) = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]]`\n7.  Apply this to the initial state:\n    *   `|ψ(t)> = U(t) |+z> = [[cos(γBt/2), sin(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2), cos(γBt/2)]] * [[1], [0]] = [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`\n8.  Now calculate the expectation value of `μ_z = γS_z`:\n    *   `<μ_z>(t) = <ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)> = γ * [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [-sin(γBt/2)]]`\n    *   `<μ_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2) * [cos(γBt/2), -sin(γBt/2)] * [[cos(γBt/2)], [sin(γBt/2)]]`\n    *   `<μ_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2) * (cos²(γBt/2) - sin²(γBt/2))`\n9.  Using the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`:\n    *   `<μ_z>(t) = γ(ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`\n10. The expression `cos(ωt)` describes an oscillation with angular frequency `ω`. By comparison, the oscillation frequency is `ω = γB`.\n\nAll three methods yield the same result.\n\n<<<A>>>"
