    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the products of the given reactions.\n\n### **Reaction 1: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol + (THF, KH, H+) ---> A**\n\n1.  **Reactant and Reagents Analysis:**\n    *   The reactant is `1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol`. This is a tertiary alcohol. The carbon atom (C1) on the cyclobutane ring bears both a hydroxyl (-OH) group and a vinyl (-CH=CH2) group. The structure also contains a double bond within the cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The reagents are Potassium Hydride (KH) followed by an acidic workup (H+). KH is a very strong, non-nucleophilic base that will deprotonate the alcohol to form a potassium alkoxide. This intermediate is the key for the subsequent rearrangement.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The conditions strongly suggest an **anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement**. This is a powerful [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement that occurs in 3-alkoxy-1,5-dienes.\n    *   Let's identify the 1,5-diene system in our molecule. The system is `(vinyl C=C) - C(O-) - C(ring) - C(spiro) - C(ring C=C)`. Although the chain is not linear, the spatial arrangement of the atoms allows for the concerted [3,3] shift. Such rearrangements for vinylspirocycloalkanols are well-documented (e.g., by Leo Paquette).\n    *   The rearrangement involves breaking the strained cyclobutane ring and forming a new, larger ring structure. Specifically, the bond between the vinyl group's terminal carbon and a carbon in the cyclohexene ring is formed, while the bond connecting the cyclobutane to the spiro carbon is broken.\n    *   This complex rearrangement transforms the `spiro[3.5]` system into a `bicyclo[5.3.1]` system. The reactant has 9 carbons in the spiro system plus 2 in the vinyl group, totaling 11 carbons. The product, `bicyclo[5.3.1]undecenone`, also has 11 carbons, which is consistent. The acidic workup (H+) protonates the intermediate enolate to yield the final ketone.\n\n3.  **Product A:**\n    *   Based on this well-established rearrangement, product A is **(E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol + acetyl bromide (Base = LDA) ---> B**\n\n1.  **Reactant and Reagents Analysis:**\n    *   The reactant is `(E)-pent-2-en-1-ol`, which is an allylic alcohol.\n    *   The reagents are `acetyl bromide` and a strong, bulky base, `LDA` (Lithium diisopropylamide). This set of reagents is characteristic of the **Ireland-Claisen rearrangement**.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1:** The alcohol is deprotonated by LDA to form a lithium alkoxide.\n    *   **Step 2:** The alkoxide attacks acetyl bromide to form an allylic acetate ester: `(E)-pent-2-en-1-yl acetate`.\n    *   **Step 3:** A second equivalent of LDA deprotonates the α-carbon of the acetate group, forming a lithium ketene acetal (a specific type of enolate).\n    *   **Step 4:** This intermediate undergoes a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. The six-atom system involved is `CH₂(enolate)=C(O⁻)-O-CH₂-CH=CH-Et`. A C-C bond is formed between the two ends of this system, and the C-O ester bond is cleaved.\n    *   **Step 5:** The rearrangement results in a lithium carboxylate. Since no acidic workup is mentioned, the final product remains as the salt.\n\n3.  **Product B:**\n    *   Let's trace the connectivity of the product. The rearrangement yields a γ,δ-unsaturated carboxylate.\n    *   The product structure is `CH₂=CH-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH₂-COO⁻ Li⁺`.\n    *   The IUPAC name for this salt is **lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A:** (E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one\n*   **Product B:** lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate\n\nComparing these findings with the given choices, we can identify the correct option.\n\n```python\n# Analysis of the chemical reactions to determine the major products A and B.\n\n# Reaction 1: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol undergoes an anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement.\n# The substrate is a vinyl cyclobutanol, which upon treatment with a strong base (KH)\n# forms an alkoxide.
