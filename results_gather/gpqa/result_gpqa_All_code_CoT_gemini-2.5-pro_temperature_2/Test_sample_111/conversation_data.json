    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the quantum mechanics problem:\n\n1.  **Define and Normalize the State Vector**: The initial state `|alpha>` is proportional to `(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>`. In vector notation, this is `[1+i, 2-i]`. I will first normalize this vector to ensure the total probability is 1. The normalization factor is the reciprocal of the square root of the sum of the squared magnitudes of its components.\n\n2.  **Define the Operator Matrix**: The operator `A` has matrix elements `Aij` where `Aij = hbar/2` for `i != j` and `0` otherwise. For a 2-level system (spin up/down), this results in a 2x2 matrix. For calculation purposes, I will set `hbar = 1` and add it back to the final result for the average value.\n\n3.  **Find Eigenstates and Eigenvalues**: To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in specific states, we need to find the eigenstates of the operator `A`. This is done by finding the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the matrix `A`.\n\n4.  **Calculate Probabilities**: The probability of finding the particle in a particular eigenstate is the squared absolute value of the inner product (projection) of the normalized state vector `|alpha>` with that eigenstate.\n\n5.  **Calculate Average Value**: The average value, or expectation value, of the operator `A` for the state `|alpha>` is calculated as `<alpha|A|alpha>`. This can also be calculated by summing the products of each eigenvalue and its corresponding probability.\n\n6.  **Output Results**: Finally, the code will print the calculated probabilities (sorted in descending order) and the average value, formatted to match the style of the given options.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef solve_quantum_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the quantum mechanics problem as described.\n    1.
