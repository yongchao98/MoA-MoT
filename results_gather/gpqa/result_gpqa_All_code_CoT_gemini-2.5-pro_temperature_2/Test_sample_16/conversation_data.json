    "To determine the concentration of calcium ions, we need to analyze the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n**1. Set up the equilibrium reaction:**\nThe dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the following equilibrium:\n$Ca-EDTA^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + EDTA^{4-}$\n\n**2. Use the formation constant (K_f):**\nWe are given the formation constant, K_f, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex:\n$K_f = \\frac{[Ca-EDTA^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\n**3. Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:**\nLet 'x' be the concentration of Ca2+ ions that form when the complex dissociates.\n*   Initial concentration of [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M\n*   Initial concentration of [Ca2+] = 0 M\n*   Initial concentration of [EDTA4-] = 0 M\n\nAt equilibrium:\n*   [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x\n*   [Ca2+] = x\n*   [EDTA4-] = x\n\n**4. Solve for x:**\nSubstitute the equilibrium concentrations into the K_f expression:\n$5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x \\cdot x} = \\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}$\n\nSince K_f is very large, the dissociation is minimal, meaning 'x' will be very small compared to 0.02. We can make the approximation that `0.02 - x ≈ 0.02`.\n\n$5 \\times 10^{10} \\approx \\frac{0.02}{x^2}$\n\nNow, we solve for x:\n$x^2 = \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}$\n$x = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}}}$\n\nThe following Python code will calculate the value of 'x' and identify the correct choice.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nK_f = 5e10  # Formation constant for Ca-EDTA\ninitial_complex_concentration = 0.02  # Molar concentration of Ca-EDTA complex\n\n# Calculation based on the equilibrium expression approximation\n# x^2 = initial_complex_concentration / K_f\n# x represents the concentration of Ca2+ ions at equilibrium\nx = math.sqrt(initial_complex_concentration / K_f)\n\n# Options given in the problem\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 2.0e-2,\n    \"B\": 5.0e-3,\n    \"C\": 1.0e-2,\n    \"D\": 6.3e-7\n}\n\nprint(f\"The calculated concentration of Ca2+ ions is: {x:.2e} M\")\n\n# Find the closest option\nclosest_option = min(options.items(), key=lambda item: abs(item[1] - x))\n\nprint(\"\\n--- Choices ---\")\nprint(\"A) 2.0x10^-2 M\")\nprint(\"B) 5.0x10^-3 M\")\nprint(\"C) 1.0x10^-2 M\")\nprint(\"D) 6.3x10^-7 M\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing the result to the choices, the correct option is:\")\nprint(f\"Choice {closest_option[0]}\")\n```\n<<<D>>>"
