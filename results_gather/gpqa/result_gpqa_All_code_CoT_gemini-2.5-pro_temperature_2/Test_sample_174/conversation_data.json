    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the angular dependence:** The problem describes an oscillating charge distribution with a symmetry axis. The simplest and most dominant form of radiation from such a source (when its size is much smaller than the wavelength) is electric dipole radiation. The radiated power per unit solid angle for an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis is proportional to `sin²(θ)`, where `θ` is the angle with the z-axis.\n2.  **Calculate the power fraction:** The maximum power `A` occurs where `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1 (at `θ = 90°`). I will calculate the value of `sin²(θ)` for `θ = 30°`. This value will directly give the fraction of the maximum power `A`.\n3.  **Analyze the wavelength dependence:** The power radiated by an oscillating dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the oscillation frequency `ω` (i.e., `P ∝ ω⁴`). Since frequency and wavelength `λ` are inversely related (`ω = 2πc/λ`), I will determine how the power `P` depends on `λ`.\n4.  **Combine and select:** Based on the calculated fraction and the wavelength dependence, I will select the correct option from the given choices.\n\nI will now implement this plan in Python.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the problem parameters and options\ntheta_degrees = 30.0\noptions = {\n    'A': {'fraction': 1/2, 'form': 'lambda^(-4)'},\n    'B': {'fraction': 3/4, 'form': 'lambda^(-6)'},\n    'C': {'fraction': 1/4, 'form': 'lambda^(-4)'},\n    'D': {'fraction': 1/4, 'form': 'lambda^(-3)'},\n}\n\nprint(\"Thinking Process:\")\nprint(\"1.
