    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant:** The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n    *   The core is a cyclohexane ring (C6).\n    *   It contains one carboxylic acid group (-COOH), one formyl group (-CHO), one vinyl group (-CH=CH2), and a double bond within the ring.\n    *   The total number of carbon atoms is 10 (6 from the ring, 1 from -COOH, 1 from -CHO, and 2 from the vinyl group).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:** The reagent is red phosphorus (P) with an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   This combination is a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry.\n    *   It reduces all oxygen-containing functional groups (like aldehydes -CHO and carboxylic acids -COOH) completely to alkane parts (e.g., -CH3).\n    *   It also reduces (saturates) all carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n\n3.  **Determine the Product's Structure and Formula:**\n    *   The reaction will not change the carbon skeleton of the molecule. The product will still have 10 carbon atoms and maintain its single ring structure.\n    *   All functional groups and double bonds will be removed, resulting in a saturated cycloalkane.\n    *   A saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon has the general formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   Since the product has 10 carbon atoms (n=10), its molecular formula will be C₁₀H₂₀.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD):** The IHD (also known as the degree of unsaturation) tells us the sum of the number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   The formula for IHD is: IHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1, where C is the number of carbons, H is the number of hydrogens, and N is the number of nitrogens.\n    *   For the product C₁₀H₂₀, the IHD can be calculated. Alternatively, since we know the product is a saturated cycloalkane, it has 1 ring and 0 pi bonds, so its IHD is 1.\n\nThe following Python code will perform the final calculation.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the properties of the final product.\n# The reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI is a complete reduction.\n# It converts the reactant to its corresponding saturated hydrocarbon, retaining the carbon skeleton.\n# Reactant: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\n# - Carbons in cyclohexane ring: 6\n# - Carbon in -COOH group: 1\n# - Carbon in -CHO group: 1\n# - Carbons in vinyl group (-CH=CH2): 2\n# Total carbons (C) in the product = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10\n\n# The product is a saturated monocyclic alkane (a substituted cyclohexane).\n# The general formula for a monocyclic alkane is C(n)H(2n).\n# For n=10, the formula is C(10)H(20).\nnum_carbons = 10\nnum_hydrogens = 20\nnum_nitrogens = 0\nnum_halogens = 0\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD).\n# The formula for IHD is: IHD = C - H/2 + N/2 - X/2 + 1\n# Where C = carbons, H = hydrogens, N = nitrogens, X = halogens.\n\nihd = num_carbons - (num_hydrogens / 2) + (num_nitrogens / 2) - (num_halogens / 2) + 1\n\n# An alternative way to think about it is that the product is a saturated molecule with one ring.\n# IHD = (number of rings) + (number of pi bonds)\n# The product has 1 ring and 0 pi bonds. So, IHD = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n# Print the final calculated IHD. The problem gives four choices.\nprint(\"The chemical reaction involves a strong reduction of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\")\nprint(\"The carbon skeleton contains a 6-membered ring and 4 additional carbons from substituents, for a total of 10 carbons.\")\nprint(\"The reduction with red P and HI converts the molecule to the corresponding saturated monocyclic alkane, which has the general formula C(n)H(2n).\")\nprint(f\"The molecular formula of the product is C{num_carbons}H{int(num_hydrogens)}.\")\nprint(f\"The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) is calculated as C - H/2 + 1.\")\nprint(f\"IHD = {num_carbons} - ({int(num_hydrogens)}/2) + 1 = {int(ihd)}.\")\nprint(\"\\nThis value corresponds to the single ring in the product's structure.\")\nprint(\"The available choices are:\")\nprint(\"A) 0\")\nprint(\"B) 1\")\nprint(\"C) 3\")\nprint(\"D) 5\")\nprint(\"\\nThe correct choice is B, as the IHD is 1.\")\n\n<<<B>>>"
