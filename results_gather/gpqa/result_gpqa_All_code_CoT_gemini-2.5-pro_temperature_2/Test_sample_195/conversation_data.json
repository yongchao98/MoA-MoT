    "To solve this problem, we will apply the principle of conservation of energy. The total energy of a relativistic harmonic oscillator is the sum of its relativistic energy (which includes its rest energy) and its potential energy from the spring. This total energy must remain constant throughout the oscillation.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Define the total energy of the system, $E = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n2.  Calculate the total energy at the point of maximum amplitude ($x=A$), where the velocity is zero ($v=0$).\n3.  Calculate the total energy at the equilibrium position ($x=0$), where the speed is at its maximum ($v=v_{max}$).\n4.  Equate these two expressions for the total energy, since energy is conserved.\n5.  Solve the resulting equation for the maximum speed, $v_{max}$.\n6.  Compare the final expression with the given options to find the correct answer.\n\nThe following Python code implements these steps to derive the solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_relativistic_oscillator():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the step-by-step derivation of the maximum speed\n    of a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator using the conservation of energy.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Step-by-step derivation for the maximum speed (v_max):\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------------------------\\n\")\n\n    # Explain the energy conservation principle\n    print(\"The principle of conservation of energy states that the total energy of the system is constant.\")\n    print(\"Total energy E = Relativistic Energy + Potential Energy\")\n    print(\"E = γmc² + ½kx², where γ = 1/√(1 - v²/c²).\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Energy at maximum displacement\n    print(\"1.
