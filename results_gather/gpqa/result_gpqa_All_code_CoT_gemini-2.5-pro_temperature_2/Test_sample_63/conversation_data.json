    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** The core of the problem is to identify two salts, A and B, based on the products of their thermal decomposition. We are given the initial mass of the mixture, the fact that it's equimolar, and quantitative data about the gaseous products.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Experimental Data:**\n    *   **Initial state:** An equimolar mixture of salts A and B. Total mass = 7.20 g.\n    *   **Process:** Heated to 200°C. Only gases are formed. The gas mixture is passed through three tubes in sequence.\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a powerful drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂, NO₂). Its mass did *not* change. This is a critical clue: no acidic gases were produced.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) via `2Cu + O₂ -> 2CuO`. The mass increase of the tube is due to the substance reacting with the copper. The mass gain is 0.80 g. This gain is from the mass of oxygen.\n    *   **Final Gas (Gas C):** After all this, 2.24 L of a gas remains at STP. This gas must be inert to water, limewater, and hot copper. The most likely candidate is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n3.  **Perform Stoichiometric Calculations (The \"What does it mean in moles?\" step):**\n    *   **Moles of H₂O:**\n        *   Molar Mass of H₂O = 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol.\n    *   **Moles of O₂:**\n        *   The mass increase in the copper tube is due to oxygen. Mass increase = Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n        *   Molar Mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n        *   *Self-Correction/Alternative thought:* Could the reacting gas be N₂O? If so, `Cu + N₂O -> CuO + N₂`. The mass gain would be from the oxygen atom, not O₂ molecule. Mass(O) = 0.80 g -> Moles(O) = 0.80/16 = 0.05 mol. This would mean 0.05 mol of N₂O reacted. We will keep this in mind, but the O₂ assumption is more standard for this setup. Let's proceed with O₂ and see if it works.\n    *   **Moles of Gas C (N₂):**\n        *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\n4.  **Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Mixture:**\n    *   From the moles of products (H₂O, O₂, N₂), we can find the total moles of each element (H, O, N) in the original 7.20 g mixture.\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** All H comes from H₂O. Moles of H = 2 * Moles of H₂O = 2 * 0.2 mol = 0.4 mol.\n    *   **Nitrogen (N):** All N comes from N₂. Moles of N = 2 * Moles of N₂ = 2 * 0.1 mol = 0.2 mol.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in the produced H₂O and O₂. Moles of O = (1 * Moles of H₂O) + (2 * Moles of O₂) = (1 * 0.2) + (2 * 0.025) = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\n5.  **Verify the Composition:** Let's check if the mass of these elements adds up to the initial mass.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.4 mol * 1.0 g/mol = 0.4 g.\n    *   Mass of N = 0.2 mol * 14.0 g/mol = 2.8 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol * 16.0 g/mol = 4.0 g.\n    *   Total Mass = 0.4 + 2.8 + 4.0 = 7.2 g. This matches perfectly! This confirms our products (H₂O, O₂, N₂) are correct and the salts contain only H, N, and O.\n\n6.  **Identify the Salts (The \"Puzzle\" part):**\n    *   We have an equimolar mixture of two H-N-O salts, let's say `x` moles of Salt A and `x` moles of Salt B.\n    *   The total elemental composition of the mixture (`A + B`) has an atom ratio of H : N : O = 0.4 : 0.2 : 0.25. To get integers, we multiply by 20, giving a ratio of H : N : O = 8 : 4 : 5.\n    *   So, `x` moles of (A+B) gives us the formula `H₈N₄O₅`.\n    *   We need to find two common, simple ammonium salts (since they contain H and N) that add up to this formula. Let's try the most common ones:\n        *   Ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂ (Formula: H₄N₂O₂)\n        *   Ammonium nitrate: NH₄NO₃ (Formula: H₄N₂O₃)\n    *   Let's add their formulas:\n        *   (H₄N₂O₂) + (H₄N₂O₃) = H₈N₄O₅\n    *   This is an exact match! So, Salt A is ammonium nitrite and Salt B is ammonium nitrate (or vice versa).\n\n7.  **Answer the Final Question:**\n    *   The question asks for the *total number of all atoms* in salts A and B. This means the number of atoms in one formula unit of A plus one formula unit of B.\n    *   Atoms in NH₄NO₂ = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n    *   Atoms in NH₄NO₃ = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n    *   Total atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n8.  **Construct the Python Code:** The code will formalize the calculations from steps 3, 4, 6, and 7 to present the solution clearly.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the stoichiometry problem step-by-step.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Step 1: Define given values and constants ---\n    mass_mixture = 7.20  # g\n    mass_gain_tube1 = 3.60  # g (H2O)\n    mass_gain_tube3 = 0.80  # g (O2)\n    volume_gas_c = 2.24  # L at STP\n\n    MOLAR_MASS_H2O = 18.0  # g/mol\n    MOLAR_MASS_O2 = 32.0   # g/mol\n    MOLAR_VOLUME_STP = 22.4  # L/mol\n\n    # --- Step 2: Calculate moles of each product gas ---\n    # Tube 1 absorbs H2O\n    moles_h2o = mass_gain_tube1 / MOLAR_MASS_H2O\n    print(f\"1.
