    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as a local, relativistic quantum field theory that serves as an extension of the Standard Model (SM). Its operators are built from the SM fields and respect a certain set of fundamental symmetries. Let's analyze each symmetry:\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry:** SMEFT is a relativistic theory, meaning it must be consistent with the principles of special relativity. This requires that the laws of physics are the same for all inertial observers. Consequently, all operators in the SMEFT Lagrangian must be Lorentz scalars (invariant under rotations and boosts). Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.\n\n2.  **Poincaré Symmetry:** This is an extension of Lorentz symmetry that also includes spacetime translations. As a fundamental symmetry of spacetime in quantum field theory, it is a prerequisite for constructing a consistent theory. Therefore, Poincaré symmetry must be respected.\n\n3.  **CP Symmetry (Charge-Parity):** The Standard Model itself contains sources of CP violation, notably in the weak sector. SMEFT is designed to parameterize all possible deviations from the SM, including potential new sources of CP violation from physics beyond the Standard Model. Therefore, SMEFT operators are *not* required to respect CP symmetry; in fact, writing down CP-violating operators is one of the key goals of SMEFT.\n\n4.  **CPT Symmetry (Charge-Parity-Time Reversal):** The CPT theorem is a cornerstone of quantum field theory. It states that any theory that is local, Lorentz-invariant, and has a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be CPT-invariant. Since the construction of SMEFT adheres to these principles, all of its operators must respect CPT symmetry.\n\nBased on this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz, Poincaré, and CPT. This corresponds to options 1, 2, and 4.\n\n```python\ndef solve_smeft_symmetry_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT\n    and determines the correct multiple-choice option.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the fundamental assumptions of SMEFT regarding symmetries.\n    # - SMEFT is a local, relativistic (Lorentz & Poincaré invariant) Quantum Field Theory.\n    # - The CPT theorem applies to any theory with these properties.\n    # - CP symmetry is known to be violated in the Standard Model, and SMEFT\n    #   is designed to parameterize this and other potential new sources of violation.\n    \n    symmetries = {\n        1: (\"Lorentz Symmetry\", \"Must be respected\"),\n        2: (\"Poincare symmetry\", \"Must be respected\"),\n        3: (\"CP symmetry\", \"Can be violated\"),\n        4: (\"CPT symmetry\", \"Must be respected\")\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analysis of Symmetries in SMEFT:\")\n    print(\"-----------------------------------\")\n    for num, (name, status) in symmetries.items():\n        print(f\"{num}. {name}: {status}\")\n    print(\"-----------------------------------\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Identify the set of indices corresponding to the required symmetries.\n    required_symmetries_indices = {num for num, (name, status) in symmetries.items() if status == \"Must be respected\"}\n    \n    print(f\"The set of symmetries that must be respected by all SMEFT operators is: {sorted(list(required_symmetries_indices))}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Define the multiple-choice options.\n    options = {\n        'A': {1, 3, 4},\n        'B': {3, 4},\n        'C': {1, 2},\n        'D': {1, 2, 4}\n    }\n    \n    print(\"Evaluating the given choices:\")\n    print(\"1.
