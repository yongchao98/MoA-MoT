    "This is a classic organic chemistry problem involving a Diels-Alder reaction, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition. The reaction is between a diene (5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride). To determine the major product, we need to consider the stereoselectivity of the reaction.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition. Cyclopentadiene is a highly reactive diene because it is locked in the required s-cis conformation. Maleic anhydride is a good dienophile.\n\n2.  **The Endo Rule:** Diels-Alder reactions, especially with cyclic dienes, kinetically favor the formation of the *endo* product over the *exo* product. This is due to favorable secondary orbital overlap in the transition state. In the product, an *endo* configuration means the substituent from the dienophile (the anhydride ring) is on the same side as the double bond in the starting diene or, more clearly in the bicyclic product, it is on the opposite side of the shorter (C8-methano) bridge.\n    *   Let's analyze the stereochemistry in the options. The stereodescriptors `(4S,7R)` and `(4R,7S)` describe the relative configuration of the anhydride part of the molecule. Based on IUPAC naming for this system:\n        *   The **endo** adducts have the stereochemistry `(...,4S,7R,...)` or their enantiomer `(...,4R,7S,...)`. Options B and D match this.\n        *   The **exo** adducts have the stereochemistry `(...,4R,7S,...)` or their enantiomer `(...,4S,7R,...)` combined with a different bridgehead stereochemistry. A detailed look at the full names confirms that options A and C describe the exo-adduct.\n    *   Since the *endo* product is favored, we can eliminate options A and C.\n\n3.  **Facial Selectivity (Syn/Anti Attack):** The diene has a fluorine substituent at the C5 position (which becomes the C8 bridge in the product). This substituent creates steric hindrance on one face of the diene. The dienophile (maleic anhydride) will preferentially approach from the less hindered face, which is the face *opposite* to the fluorine atom. This is known as *anti*-attack.\n\n4.  **Resulting Product Stereochemistry:** The major product results from an *endo* approach with *anti*-attack. This means:\n    *   The anhydride ring is in the *endo* position.\n    *   The fluorine atom on the C8 bridge is *anti* (on the opposite side) to the anhydride ring.\n\n5.  **Assigning the Final Structure:** We are left with options B and D, which are both *endo* adducts. They differ in the stereochemistry at the C8 position, designated `8r` or `8s`. We assume `r` stands for R and `s` for S configuration.\n    *   **Option B:** `(...,8r)-...`\n    *   **Option D:** `(...,8s)-...`\n    *   We need to determine the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) configuration for the C8 atom in the product of *anti*-attack.\n    *   Let's consider the `(3aR,4S,7R,7aS)` enantiomer (from options B and D). In the `endo` adduct, the anhydride ring is on one face of the bicyclic system. The product from *anti*-attack will have the fluorine on the opposite face.\n    *   Assigning CIP priorities at C8: F is highest priority (1). The lowest priority is H (4). We then compare the two paths around the ring: C8 -> C7a and C8 -> C3a. The path through C7a connects to C7 (which has R configuration in this enantiomer), and the path through C3a connects to C4 (which has S configuration). By the CIP tie-breaking rules, R precedes S. Thus, the C7a path has higher priority than the C3a path. The priority order is: F > C7a > C3a > H.\n    *   In the *anti*-attack product, the highest priority group (F) and lowest priority group (H) are on opposite faces of the bicyclic ring plane. Orienting the molecule so the lowest priority group (H) is pointing away from the viewer, the sequence from priority 1 to 2 to 3 (F -> C7a -> C3a) is clockwise.\n    *   A clockwise sequence corresponds to an **R** configuration.\n    *   Therefore, the major product has the C8-R stereochemistry.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The major product is the *endo* adduct resulting from *anti*-attack, which has the stereochemistry `(endo, C8-R)`. This corresponds to option B.\n\n```python\ndef solve_diels_alder():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the Diels-Alder reaction between 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene and maleic anhydride\n    to determine the major product.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The reaction is a Diels-Alder reaction.
