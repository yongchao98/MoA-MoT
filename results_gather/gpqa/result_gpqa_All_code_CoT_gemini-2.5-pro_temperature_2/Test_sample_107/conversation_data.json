    "Of course, let's solve this problem step-by-step.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Calculate the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy ($\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle$)**: This is the energy associated with the Zeeman effect. The formula for this energy is $ \\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = m \\mu_B B $, where:\n    *   $m$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number. The problem specifies to use small values, so we'll use $m=1$ for the order of magnitude calculation.\n    *   $\\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton, a physical constant ($ \\approx 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/T} $).\n    *   $B$ is the magnetic field strength, given as $B=1$ T.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Transition Energy ($\\Delta E$)**: This is the energy of a photon corresponding to the given wavelength. The formula is $ \\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} $, where:\n    *   $h$ is Planck's constant.\n    *   $c$ is the speed of light.\n    *   $\\lambda$ is the wavelength, given as $0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m}$.\n    A convenient formula is $ \\Delta E (\\text{eV}) = \\frac{1240 \\text{ eV}\\cdot\\text{nm}}{\\lambda (\\text{nm})} $.\n\n3.  **Compare the Two Energies**: Compare the numerical values of $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle$ and $\\Delta E$ to determine their relative magnitudes and select the correct option from the list.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations and print the results for comparison.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef compare_energies():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and compares the paramagnetic coupling energy with a specific\n    atomic transition energy in Hydrogen.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Constants ---\n    # Bohr Magneton in eV/T\n    MU_B_EV_PER_T = 5.7883818012e-5\n    # Product of Planck's constant and speed of light in eV*nm\n    HC_EV_NM = 1240.0\n\n    # --- Given Values ---\n    # Magnetic field strength in Tesla\n    B_T = 1.0\n    # Orbital magnetic quantum number (small integer for order of magnitude)\n    m = 1\n    # Wavelength in micrometers\n    lambda_um = 0.4861\n    # Convert wavelength to nanometers\n    lambda_nm = lambda_um * 1000\n\n    # --- Step 1: Calculate the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy <H> ---\n    # Formula: <H> = m * mu_B * B\n    H_paramagnetic_eV = m * MU_B_EV_PER_T * B_T\n\n    # --- Step 2: Calculate the Transition Energy Delta E ---\n    # Formula: Delta_E = hc / lambda\n    Delta_E_eV = HC_EV_NM / lambda_nm\n\n    # --- Step 3: Compare the energies ---\n    print(f\"Calculating the paramagnetic coupling energy <H>:\")\n    print(f\"Formula: <H> = m * mu_B * B\")\n    print(f\"<H> = {m} * {MU_B_EV_PER_T:.4e} eV/T * {B_T} T\")\n    print(f\"<H> = {H_paramagnetic_eV:.4e} eV\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"Calculating the transition energy Delta E:\")\n    print(f\"Formula: Delta E = hc / lambda\")\n    print(f\"Delta E = {HC_EV_NM} eV*nm / {lambda_nm} nm\")\n    print(f\"Delta E = {Delta_E_eV:.4f} eV\\n\")\n\n    print(\"--- Comparison ---\")\n    print(f\"Paramagnetic energy <H>: {H_paramagnetic_eV:.4e} eV\")\n    print(f\"Transition energy Delta E: {Delta_E_eV:.4f} eV\")\n\n    # Determine the relationship\n    ratio = H_paramagnetic_eV / Delta_E_eV\n    print(f\"The ratio <H> / Delta E is {ratio:.4e}\")\n\n    # A very small ratio indicates that <H> is much smaller than Delta E.\n    # We define 'much smaller' as a ratio less than 0.01 (i.e., by at least two orders of magnitude)\n    if ratio < 0.01:\n        result = \"B\"\n        print(\"Conclusion: The paramagnetic coupling energy is much smaller than the transition energy.\")\n        print(\"This corresponds to option B: <H> << Delta E\")\n    elif ratio > 100:\n        result = \"D\"\n        print(\"Conclusion: The paramagnetic coupling energy is much larger than the transition energy.\")\n        print(\"This corresponds to option D: <H> >> Delta E\")\n    elif math.isclose(ratio, 1.0, rel_tol=0.1):\n        result = \"C\"\n        print(\"Conclusion: The paramagnetic coupling energy is approximately equal to the transition energy.\")\n        print(\"This corresponds to option C: <H> = Delta E\")\n    elif H_paramagnetic_eV > Delta_E_eV:\n        result = \"A\"\n        print(\"Conclusion: The paramagnetic coupling energy is greater than the transition energy.\")\n        print(\"This corresponds to option A: <H> > Delta E\")\n    else: # Should not be reached in this problem but for completeness\n        result = \"None of the above fit perfectly, but B is the closest description.\"\n\n# Execute the function\ncompare_energies()\n```\n<<<B>>>"
