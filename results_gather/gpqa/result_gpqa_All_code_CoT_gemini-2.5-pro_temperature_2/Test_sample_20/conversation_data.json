    "This problem requires us to apply our knowledge of two types of isomerism: tautomerism and optical isomerism.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze Tautomerism (for Compound A):**\n    *   Tautomerism, specifically keto-enol tautomerism, involves the interconversion between a keto form (containing a C=O group) and an enol form (containing a C=C-OH group). This process requires a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an alpha-hydrogen).\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This molecule has alpha-hydrogens on the carbons between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6). It can and does undergo tautomerism to form phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is a highly stable aromatic compound. So, this compound *shows* tautomerism.\n    *   **Benzoquinone:** This molecule is a conjugated cyclic ketone. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups do not have the typical sp3 hybridization needed for easy keto-enol tautomerism. A rearrangement is not favorable. Therefore, benzoquinone *does not* show tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Compound A, which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Optical Isomerism (for Compound B):**\n    *   Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A common feature of a chiral molecule is the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). Such molecules can exist as non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers).\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). Since it has a chiral center, this molecule *will show* optical isomerism.\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃ (in a trans configuration). There are no chiral centers. The molecule is planar and possesses a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, it *does not* show optical isomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** Compound B, which shows optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n3.  **Combine the Results:**\n    *   A = benzoquinone\n    *   B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n    *   This combination matches option D.\n\n4.  **Final Code:**\n    *   The Python code will formalize this logic to select the correct choice from the provided options.\n\n```python\ndef solve_isomerism_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the correct option based on the properties of tautomerism and optical isomerism for the given compounds.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Part A: Tautomerism Analysis\n    # Benzoquinone lacks the necessary structure (sp3 alpha-carbons) for typical keto-enol tautomerism.\n    # Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has alpha-hydrogens and readily tautomerizes to the stable aromatic compound phloroglucinol.\n    compound_A = \"benzoquinone\"  # The compound that does not show tautomerism\n\n    # Part B: Optical Isomerism Analysis\n    # Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center (C2 is bonded to H, OH, CH3, and COOCH3).\n    # Dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule with a plane of symmetry.\n    compound_B = \"methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\" # The compound that shows optical isomerism\n\n    # Define the provided options\n    options = {\n        \"A\": {\"A\": \"cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione\", \"B\": \"dimethyl fumarate\"},\n        \"B\": {\"A\": \"cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione\", \"B\": \"methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\"},\n        \"C\": {\"A\": \"benzoquinone\", \"B\": \"dimethyl fumarate\"},\n        \"D\": {\"A\": \"benzoquinone\", \"B\": \"methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\"}\n    }\n\n    # Find the correct option by matching our findings\n    correct_option = None\n    for option_key, compounds in options.items():\n        if compounds[\"A\"] == compound_A and compounds[\"B\"] == compound_B:\n            correct_option = option_key\n            break\n\n    # Print the reasoning and the final answer\n    print(\"Step 1: The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is benzoquinone.\")\n    print(\"Step 2: The compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\")\n    print(f\"Step 3: This combination corresponds to choice {correct_option}.\")\n    print(f'Final Answer is D: A = {options[\"D\"][\"A\"]}, B = {options[\"D\"][\"B\"]}')\n    print(f'A) {options[\"A\"][\"A\"]}, {options[\"A\"][\"B\"]}')\n    print(f'B) {options[\"B\"][\"A\"]}, {options[\"B\"][\"B\"]}')\n    print(f'C) {options[\"C\"][\"A\"]}, {options[\"C\"][\"B\"]}')\n    print(f'D) {options[\"D\"][\"A\"]}, {options[\"D\"][\"B\"]}')\n\n\n    print(f'The correct choice is: {correct_option}')\n    # The final output format as requested\n    print(f\"<<<{correct_option}>>>\")\n\n# Execute the function to find and print the answer\nsolve_isomerism_question()\n```"
