    "The user wants to solve a quantum mechanics problem regarding a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the system and potential:** The potential is $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$, which corresponds to a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator.\n2.  **Recall the energy eigenvalues formula:** The energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by the formula $E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n = n_x + n_y + n_z = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the principal quantum number.\n3.  **Identify the state:**\n    *   The ground state corresponds to n = 0.\n    *   The first excited state corresponds to n = 1.\n    *   The second excited state corresponds to n = 2.\n    *   The **third excited state** corresponds to **n = 3**.\n4.  **Calculate the energy:** Substitute n = 3 into the energy formula:\n    $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = (\\frac{6}{2} + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n5.  **Recall the degeneracy formula:** The degeneracy, $g_n$, for the n-th energy level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is $n$. The formula for this is:\n    $g_n = \\frac{(n+3-1)!}{n!(3-1)!} = \\frac{(n+2)!}{n!2!} = \\frac{(n+2)(n+1)}{2}$.\n6.  **Calculate the degeneracy:** Substitute n = 3 into the degeneracy formula:\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+2)(3+1)}{2} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 10$.\n7.  **Compare results with the given options:**\n    *   The calculated energy is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n    *   The calculated degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) is 10.\n    *   This matches option B.\n8.  **Write Python code:** The code will perform these calculations for `n=3` and identify the correct option among the choices provided.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_harmonic_oscillator():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the energy and degeneracy of the third excited state of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The principal quantum number 'n' for the energy levels of a 3D isotropic\n    # harmonic oscillator is n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...\n    # n=0 is the ground state.\n    # n=1 is the first excited state.\n    # n=2 is the second excited state.\n    # n=3 is the third excited state.\n    n = 3\n\n    # The energy eigenvalue is given by E_n = (n + 3/2) * h_bar * omega.\n    # We will calculate the numerical factor (n + 3/2).\n    energy_factor_numerator = 2 * n + 3\n    energy_factor_denominator = 2\n    # So the energy is (9/2) * h_bar * omega\n\n    # The degeneracy of the n-th energy level is given by g_n = (n+2)(n+1)/2.\n    degeneracy = (n + 2) * (n + 1) // 2\n\n    print(f\"For the third excited state (n={n}):\")\n    print(f\"Energy E = ({energy_factor_numerator}/{energy_factor_denominator}) * h_bar * omega\")\n    print(f\"Degeneracy g = {degeneracy}\")\n\n    # The options given in the problem\n    options = {\n        \"A\": {\"energy\": \"11 * pi^2 * hbar^2 / (2*m*r^2)\", \"degeneracy\": 3},\n        \"B\": {\"energy\": \"(9/2) * h_bar * omega\", \"degeneracy\": 10},\n        \"C\": {\"energy\": \"11 * pi^2 * hbar^2 / (2*m*r^2)\", \"degeneracy\": 10},\n        \"D\": {\"energy\": \"(9/2) * h_bar * omega\", \"degeneracy\": 3}\n    }\n    \n    # Determine the correct choice\n    correct_choice = None\n    for choice, values in options.items():\n        # Check if the calculated degeneracy matches\n        if values[\"degeneracy\"] == degeneracy:\n            # Check if the energy expression matches. \n            # We are doing a simple string comparison for the form.\n            # (9/2) * h_bar * omega matches our calculation.\n            if f\"({energy_factor_numerator}/{energy_factor_denominator}) * h_bar * omega\" == values[\"energy\"]:\n                correct_choice = choice\n                break\n\n    print(f\"\\nComparing with the options, the correct choice is {correct_choice}.\")\n    print(f'<<<B>>>')\n\nsolve_harmonic_oscillator()\n```"
