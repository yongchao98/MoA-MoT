    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Anhydride:** The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene, which dehydrates to an anhydride. The ¹H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm (vinylic region), and the ¹³C NMR shows two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene C) and 165 ppm (carbonyl C). The high symmetry (single ¹H peak, two ¹³C peaks) and chemical shifts are characteristic of maleic anhydride. The two vinylic protons are equivalent, as are the two carbonyl carbons and two alkene carbons.\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. This is a cyclic diene with four methyl groups on the `sp²` carbons of the diene system and a `CH₂` group at the 5-position.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition, a [4+2] reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile (the anhydride). This reaction is stereospecific and typically follows the \"endo rule\".\n\n3.  **Predict the Products and their Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction produces a bicyclic adduct. Two stereoisomeric products can be formed: the *endo* and the *exo* adduct.\n    *   According to the *endo rule*, the kinetic product (which is usually the major product) is the *endo* adduct. In the *endo* transition state, the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the carbonyls of the anhydride) are oriented under the π system of the diene.\n    *   In the resulting product, this means the anhydride moiety is *syn* (on the same side) to the larger bridge of the bicyclic system. In this case, the larger bridge is the newly formed `C(Me)=C(Me)` bond. The smaller bridge is the `CH₂` group from the original diene.\n    *   Therefore:\n        *   **Major Product = *endo* adduct:** The protons on the anhydride part (let's call them `H_a`) are spatially close to the methyl groups on the double bond (`Me_c`).\n        *   **Minor Product = *exo* adduct:** The anhydride part is oriented away from the `C(Me)=C(Me)` bridge. The `H_a` protons are far from the `Me_c` groups.\n\n4.  **Analyze the NOESY Spectra:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å), regardless of their bonding connectivity.\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is present in the major product's spectrum but absent (or weak) in the minor product's spectrum.\n    *   Based on our stereochemical analysis, the spatial proximity between the anhydride protons (`H_a`) and the vinylic methyl protons (`Me_c`) exists *only* in the *endo* (major) product.\n    *   Therefore, the distinguishing cross-peak connects the signals for `H_a` and `Me_c`.\n\n5.  **Assign the ¹H NMR Signals:**\n    *   The product molecule (C₁₃H₁₆O₃) has a plane of symmetry, making pairs of protons and methyl groups equivalent.\n    *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** Saturated alkyl methyl groups have shifts around 1 ppm. These are the two methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n    *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** Vinylic methyl groups (attached to a C=C double bond) typically have shifts around 1.6-2.0 ppm. These are the two methyl groups on the double bond (`Me_c`).\n    *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** Protons on a carbon adjacent to two carbonyl groups in a strained ring system are significantly deshielded. This signal corresponds to the two equivalent anhydride protons (`H_a`).\n    *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** The two protons of the `CH₂` bridge are diastereotopic (not equivalent) and would likely form a complex multiplet (an AB quartet). This description likely refers to one half of that multiplet for one of those protons.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The unique cross-peak in the major product connects `H_a` and `Me_c`.\n    *   `H_a` corresponds to the \"2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\".\n    *   `Me_c` corresponds to the \"6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\".\n    *   This pair matches option D.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_chemistry_nmr_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the Diels-Alder reaction and the resulting NMR data to determine the correct answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Identify reactants and reaction\n    reactant_1 = \"Maleic Anhydride\"\n    reactant_2 = \"1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene\"\n    reaction_type = \"Diels-Alder [4+2] Cycloaddition\"\n    \n    # Step 2: Determine major and minor products\n    # The endo rule predicts the major product is the kinetically favored endo adduct.\n    # The minor product is the thermodynamically favored exo adduct.\n    major_product = \"endo adduct\"\n    minor_product = \"exo adduct\"\n    \n    # Step 3: Analyze spatial proximity for NOESY based on stereochemistry\n    # In the endo (major) product, the anhydride protons (Ha) are close to the vinylic methyl groups (Mc).\n    # In the exo (minor) product, the anhydride protons (Ha) are far from the vinylic methyl groups (Mc).\n    major_product_noe = \"Cross-peak between anhydride protons (Ha) and vinylic methyl protons (Mc).\"\n    minor_product_noe = \"No (or very weak) cross-peak between Ha and Mc.\"\n    \n    # The problem states a cross-peak is present in the major product and absent in the minor.\n    # This confirms the cross-peak is between Ha and Mc.\n    \n    # Step 4: Assign the proton signals from the options\n    signal_ha = \"2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (protons on anhydride backbone, deshielded by carbonyls)\"\n    signal_mc = \"6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinylic methyls on C=C bond)\"\n    signal_md = \"6H singlet at ~1 ppm (alkyl methyls on bridgehead carbons)\"\n    signal_hb = \"A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (likely one of the two non-equivalent CH2 bridge protons)\"\n\n    # Step 5: Match the required cross-peak (Ha <=> Mc) with the options\n    # The cross-peak connects the signal for Ha (~3.5 ppm) and the signal for Mc (~1.7 ppm).\n    options = {\n        'A': \"A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (Hb) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Ha)\",\n        'B': \"A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Md) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Mc)\",\n        'C': \"A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Md) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (Hb)\",\n        'D': \"A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Mc) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Ha)\"\n    }\n    \n    # The cross peak is between Mc and Ha.
