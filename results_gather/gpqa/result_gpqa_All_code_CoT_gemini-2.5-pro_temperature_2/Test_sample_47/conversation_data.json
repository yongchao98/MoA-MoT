    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction Sequence**: I will deduce the structure of the product at each of the four steps of the chemical synthesis.\n2.  **Identify the Final Product**: Determine the final chemical structure of product 4.\n3.  **Count Distinct Hydrogens**: I will analyze the symmetry of the final product to determine the number of chemically non-equivalent hydrogen atoms. This is equivalent to the number of unique signals that would appear in a proton NMR spectrum.\n4.  **Provide the Final Answer**: I will select the correct option based on the count.\n\nHere is the python code that executes the plan:\n```python\ndef solve_chemical_reaction_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves a multi-step synthesis problem and determines the number of\n    chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Trace the reaction sequence step by step.\n    reaction_step_1 = \"Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine (Br2).
