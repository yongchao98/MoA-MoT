    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics**\n\nThe problem revolves around the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time. This principle states that it's impossible to know both the exact energy of a quantum state and its exact lifetime simultaneously. The relationship is given by:\n\n$\\Delta E \\cdot \\Delta t \\ge \\hbar/2$\n\nwhere:\n*   $\\Delta E$ is the uncertainty in energy.\n*   $\\Delta t$ is the uncertainty in time (which we can take as the lifetime of the state, $\\tau$).\n*   $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant ($\\approx 6.582 \\times 10^{-16}$ eV·s).\n\nThis energy uncertainty, $\\Delta E$, is often called the \"energy width\" or \"linewidth\" of the state.\n\n**2. Formulate the Condition for Resolution**\n\nTo \"clearly resolve\" or distinguish between two energy levels, the difference in their energies ($\\delta E$) must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties. This ensures that the energy distributions (linewidths) of the two states don't overlap too much.\n\nSo, the condition is:\n$\\delta E > \\Delta E_1 + \\Delta E_2$\n\nWhere $\\Delta E_1 \\approx \\hbar / \\tau_1$ and $\\Delta E_2 \\approx \\hbar / \\tau_2$.\n\n**3. Plan the Code**\n\n1.  Define the reduced Planck constant in units of eV·s.\n2.  Define the lifetimes $\\tau_1$ and $\\tau_2$.\n3.  Calculate the energy uncertainty for each state, $\\Delta E_1$ and $\\Delta E_2$.\n4.  Calculate the total minimum energy difference required for resolution by summing the uncertainties.\n5.  Compare this required minimum energy difference with the given options (A, B, C, D) to find the one that satisfies the condition.\n6.  Print the result.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these calculations and find the answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define constants and given values\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nhbar_eVs = 6.582119569e-16 \n# Lifetime of state 1 in seconds\ntau1 = 1e-9  \n# Lifetime of state 2 in seconds\ntau2 = 1e-8  \n\n# Step 2: Calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state\n# The uncertainty relation is Delta_E * tau approx hbar\ndelta_E1 = hbar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = hbar_eVs / tau2\n\n# Step 3: Determine the condition for the energy levels to be clearly resolved\n# The energy difference must be greater than the sum of the individual energy uncertainties.\nmin_energy_difference = delta_E1 + delta_E2\n\nprint(f\"The lifetime of state 1 is {tau1:.1e} s.\")\nprint(f\"The corresponding energy uncertainty (linewidth) is Delta_E1 = {delta_E1:.4e} eV.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 50)\nprint(f\"The lifetime of state 2 is {tau2:.1e} s.\")\nprint(f\"The corresponding energy uncertainty (linewidth) is Delta_E2 = {delta_E2:.4e} eV.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 50)\nprint(\"To clearly resolve the two states, their energy difference must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties.\")\nprint(f\"Minimum required energy difference = Delta_E1 + Delta_E2 = {min_energy_difference:.4e} eV.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 50)\n\n# Step 4: Compare the required difference with the given options\noptions = {\n    'A': 1e-4,\n    'B': 1e-8,\n    'C': 1e-9,\n    'D': 1e-11\n}\n\nprint(\"Let's check the options:\")\ncorrect_option = None\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    is_resolvable = value > min_energy_difference\n    print(f\"Option {option}: {value:.1e} eV.
