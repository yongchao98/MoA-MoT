    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct statement regarding the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation.\n\n**1. Understand the Mott-Gurney Equation and Space-Charge-Limited Current (SCLC):**\nThe Mott-Gurney equation describes the current in a specific regime called Space-Charge-Limited Current (SCLC). This regime occurs when a large number of charge carriers are injected into a semiconductor from a contact, and this injected \"space charge\" itself limits the flow of further current.\n\n**2. Core Assumptions of the Mott-Gurney Law:**\nThe derivation of the Mott-Gurney equation rests on several key assumptions about the device and operating conditions:\n*   **Single-Carrier Device:** The model assumes that only one type of charge carrier (either electrons or holes) is mobile and contributes to the current. This simplifies the physics by ignoring effects like electron-hole recombination.\n*   **Trap-Free Insulator/Semiconductor:** The classic equation assumes there are no trap states within the material's bandgap that could immobilize the injected carriers. The presence of traps would alter the V-J relationship.\n*   **Ohmic Contact (No Injection Barrier):** For the current to be limited by the space charge in the bulk material (and not by the contact itself), the contact must be able to supply an essentially unlimited number of carriers. This type of contact is called an Ohmic contact, which has no energy barrier for carrier injection. A Schottky contact, in contrast, has a rectifying barrier and would limit the current by a different mechanism (e.g., thermionic emission).\n*   **Drift-Dominated Current (Negligible Diffusion):** The model assumes that the dominant mechanism for carrier transport is drift (movement due to the electric field). It neglects the contribution from diffusion (movement due to concentration gradients). This is a valid assumption for devices that are not excessively short and are under a sufficiently high applied voltage.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options:**\n*   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.**\n    *   This is incorrect. The Mott-Gurney current *is* a drift current. Therefore, drift current cannot be negligible; it must be the dominant mechanism.\n*   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.**\n    *   This statement aligns perfectly with the core assumptions. \"No carrier injection barrier\" is synonymous with an ideal Ohmic contact. \"Trap-free,\" \"single-carrier,\" and \"negligible diffusion current\" are all correct assumptions.\n*   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n    *   This is incorrect because a Schottky contact provides a barrier to injection, which violates the requirement for an unlimited supply of carriers needed to establish the space-charge limited condition.\n*   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n    *   This is incorrect. The Mott-Gurney equation is a single-carrier model. The presence of a second carrier type would introduce recombination, which is not accounted for in the equation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOption B is the only one that correctly lists all the necessary conditions for the validity of the classic Mott-Gurney equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_mott_gurney_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the conditions for the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation\n    and selects the correct statement from the given options.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The Mott-Gurney equation J = (9/8) * epsilon * mu * (V^2 / L^3)\n    # describes Space-Charge-Limited Current (SCLC).\n    # Let's analyze the key assumptions for this equation's validity.\n\n    # Assumption 1: Carrier Type\n    # The model simplifies the physics by considering only one type of mobile charge carrier\n    # (either electrons or holes), ignoring recombination.\n    # This means it applies to a \"single-carrier device\".\n    # Options A, B, C are consistent.
