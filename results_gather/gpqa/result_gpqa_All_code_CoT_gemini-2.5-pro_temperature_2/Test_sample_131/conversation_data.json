    "Here is a thinking process to solve this NMR puzzle.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Spectrum:** First, I'll break down the information given about the 1:1 mixture's 1H NMR spectrum.\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14.\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The mixture shows two singlets with a 1:1 integral ratio.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** The mixture shows three singlets with a 2:1:1 integral ratio.\n\n2.  **Predict Spectra for Individual Compounds:** Next, I'll analyze the structure of each of the four possible compounds to predict their individual 1H NMR spectra, focusing on the number of signals, their splitting (multiplicity), and the number of protons (integration) for both aromatic and aliphatic regions.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Mixture Option:** I will simulate the spectrum of a 1:1 mixture for each of the given options (A, B, C, D) by combining the predicted spectra of the two constituent compounds.\n\n4.  **Compare and Conclude:** Finally, I'll compare the predicted spectrum for each mixture with the target spectrum from the problem. The option whose predicted spectrum matches the data in both the aromatic and aliphatic regions will be the correct answer.\n\n### Execution\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef analyze_spectrum():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the NMR problem by analyzing the predicted spectra of candidate compounds\n    and comparing their mixtures to the experimental data provided.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Deconstruct the NMR data for the 1:1 mixture.\")\n    print(\"  - Molecular Formula: C10H14 for both compounds.\")\n    print(\"  - Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm): 2 singlets with a 1:1 integral ratio.\")\n    print(\"  - Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm): 3 singlets with a 2:1:1 integral ratio.\\n\")\n\n    # Store predicted spectra as a dictionary for clarity\n    # Data: {'aromatic': [protons_per_signal], 'aliphatic': [protons_per_signal]}\n    # For non-singlets, we'll note them but the problem states all signals are singlets.\n    predicted_spectra = {\n        '1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene': {\n            'aromatic_H': [2], 'aliphatic_H': [12],\n            'notes': 'High symmetry.
