    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the puzzle and determine the final value.\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of B is ~277 K, which is approximately 4°C. This is very close to the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) at 3.82°C (276.97 K). Therefore, we can deduce that **B is D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Heavy Isotope and Substance G:** Since B is D₂O, the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the description of substance X must be Deuterium (D, or ²H). G is a precipitate which, when heated, releases D₂O. This means G is likely a deuterated metal hydroxide, which decomposes upon heating to a metal oxide and D₂O.\n\n3.  **Identify Gas W:** W is a gas whose molecules contain an equal number of neutrons and protons. Given that the system clearly involves Deuterium, the most logical candidate for gas W is diatomic deuterium (D₂). A single deuterium atom (D) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fitting the description.\n\n4.  **Identify Substance X and Y:**\n    *   We know X contains Deuterium. The clues \"its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry\" and its reaction with a keto acid strongly suggest X is a deuterated version of a common, powerful reducing agent. The prime candidates are Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) and Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄). Thus, X is likely LiAlD₄ or NaBD₄.\n    *   The reaction is X + Y → W (D₂) + G (precipitate). Let's test X = LiAlD₄. A violent reaction occurs with water. Since D₂ is produced, the liquid Y must be heavy water, D₂O.\n    *   Let's check the reaction: **LiAlD₄ (X) + 4D₂O (Y) → Al(OD)₃ (G) + LiOD + 4D₂ (W)**.\n    *   This reaction is violent.\n    *   Y is D₂O, a liquid.\n    *   W is D₂, a gas where protons equal neutrons.\n    *   G is Al(OD)₃, aluminum deuteroxide, which would be a precipitate just like its analog Al(OH)₃. Heating Al(OD)₃ gives Al₂O₃ and D₂O (B).\n    *   This confirms that **Substance X is LiAlD₄** (Lithium Aluminum Deuteride). The keto acid clue also fits, as LiAlH₄ is strong enough to reduce both the keto and carboxylic acid groups, resulting in a product with two oxygen atoms from an initial three.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic mass of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n    *   The lightest element is **Hydrogen**, present as 4 atoms of its isotope Deuterium (D). The atomic mass of a Deuterium isotope is approximately 2.\n    *   The heaviest element is **Aluminum**, present as 1 atom. The atomic mass of the stable Aluminum isotope (²⁷Al) is approximately 27.\n    *   The cumulative mass is the sum of the masses of all atoms of these two elements: (4 × mass of D) + (1 × mass of Al).\n    *   Calculation: (4 × 2) + (1 × 27) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Identify the elements and isotopes in Substance X, which is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD4).\n# The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n# The isotopes are Li, Al, and Deuterium (D or 2H).\n\n# Step 2: Identify the lightest and heaviest elements.\n# Lightest element: Hydrogen (atomic number 1)\n# Heaviest element: Aluminum (atomic number 13)\n\n# Step 3: Find the number of atoms and atomic masses for the specific isotopes present.\n# For the lightest element (Hydrogen), the isotope is Deuterium (D).\nnum_atoms_lightest = 4\nmass_of_deuterium = 2  # Atomic mass of Deuterium (2H) is approx. 2.\n\n# For the heaviest element (Aluminum), the stable isotope is 27Al.\nnum_atoms_heaviest = 1\nmass_of_aluminum = 27 # Atomic mass of Aluminum (27Al) is approx. 27.\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the cumulative mass as requested.\n# Cumulative mass = (number of lightest atoms * mass of lightest isotope) + (number of heaviest atoms * mass of heaviest isotope)\ncumulative_mass = (num_atoms_lightest * mass_of_deuterium) + (num_atoms_heaviest * mass_of_aluminum)\n\n# Step 5: Print the result.\nprint(\"The lightest element is Hydrogen, present as 4 atoms of Deuterium (mass ~2 each).\")\nprint(\"The heaviest element is Aluminum, present as 1 atom (mass ~27).\")\nprint(\"Total mass of Deuterium atoms = 4 * 2 =\", 4 * 2)\nprint(\"Total mass of Aluminum atoms = 1 * 27 =\", 1 * 27)\nprint(\"Cumulative atomic mass = (4 * 2) + (1 * 27) =\", cumulative_mass)\n\n# Final answer choices\nprint(\"A) 25\")\nprint(\"B) 31\")\nprint(\"C) 29\")\nprint(\"D) 35\")\nprint(f\"The calculated value is {cumulative_mass}, which corresponds to choice D.\")\n```\n<<<D>>>"
