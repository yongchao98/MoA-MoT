    "This is a multi-step organic chemistry synthesis and spectroscopy problem. To solve it, we need to identify the structure of the final product, Product 3, and then analyze its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Determine the structure of Product 1:** Analyze the reactants, conditions, and spectroscopic data (IR, NMR) for the first reaction. The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. It's heated with strong base (KOH). The IR shows a ketone (1720 cm⁻¹), and the proton NMR shows 14 protons. The high chemical shift (4.79 ppm) and the later ozonolysis step are problematic if we assume a simple structure. There appears to be a contradiction in the provided data (14H count vs. implied unsaturation for a later step). A common approach for such advanced problems is to assume a known, plausible, albeit complex, reaction pathway that might contain a typo in the provided data.\n2.  **Determine the structure of Product 2:** Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide, a classic Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction reagent, which reduces ketones to alcohols. The conditions also mention heating, which can cause subsequent dehydration of the alcohol product to an alkene.\n3.  **Determine the structure of Product 3:** Product 2 (or its dehydration product) undergoes ozonolysis (O₃ followed by DMS), a reaction that cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds to form carbonyl compounds. This confirms that an alkene must have been formed in step 2.\n4.  **Analyze the 1H NMR of Product 3:** Once the structure of Product 3 is established, we will identify the most deshielded, non-exchangeable proton and determine its coupling pattern (multiplicity) based on the number of adjacent protons (n) and the n+1 rule, considering potential long-range couplings.\n\n**Step-by-step Derivation:**\n\n*   **Step 1 & 2: Formation of an Alkene.**\n    *   The reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane under harsh basic conditions is complex. A simple substitution followed by oxidation would yield adamantan-2-one. Let's assume this is the initial ketone (Product 1).\n    *   Product 1 (Adamantan-2-one) is reduced by Al(i-PrO)₃ to Adamantan-2-ol.\n    *   Crucially, the problem states this mixture is **heated**. Heating an alcohol with a Lewis acid like Al(i-PrO)₃ can catalyze dehydration (elimination of water).\n    *   Dehydration of adamantan-2-ol does not form a simple adamantene (which would violate Bredt's rule). Instead, it undergoes a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement to form a more stable, less strained alkene: **protoadamantene**. This will be the substrate for ozonolysis.\n\n*   **Step 3: Ozonolysis to form Product 3.**\n    *   The ozonolysis of protoadamantene cleaves its double bond. This ring-opening reaction is known to produce **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde**.\n    *   This molecule (Product 3) has a bicyclic framework with two aldehyde (-CHO) groups. It possesses a high degree of symmetry (C₂ᵥ).\n\n*   **Step 4: NMR Analysis of Product 3.**\n    *   We need to find the coupling pattern for the \"most deshielded hydrogen atom\". In Product 3, the aldehyde protons (-CHO) are by far the most deshielded, typically resonating at δ 9-10 ppm.\n    *   Due to the molecule's symmetry, both aldehyde protons are chemically equivalent. We only need to analyze one of them.\n    *   Let's analyze the coupling for the aldehyde proton on carbon C3. This proton is coupled to other protons through sigma bonds.\n        1.  **3-bond coupling (³J):** The aldehyde proton is coupled to the single proton on C3 of the ring skeleton (H-C(O)-C3-H). This coupling to one proton (n=1) will split the signal into a **doublet**.\n        2.  **4-bond coupling (⁴J):** Aldehyde protons can also show long-range coupling to protons four bonds away, especially if the atoms form a 'W' or planar zig-zag arrangement. In the stable chair-chair conformation of the bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ring, the aldehyde proton has a potential W-coupling pathway to the equatorial protons on the adjacent C2 and C4 positions. Due to the molecule's symmetry, the two protons (H₂-eq and H₄-eq) are equivalent. Coupling to these two equivalent protons (n=2) will split the signal into a **triplet**.\n    *   **Combining the couplings:** The main coupling to the C3 proton creates a doublet. Each line of this doublet is then further split into a triplet by the two equivalent equatorial protons.\n    *   Therefore, the final pattern is a **doublet of triplets**.\n\n```python\ndef solve_coupling_pattern():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the multi-step reaction and determines the coupling pattern of the most deshielded proton in the final product.\n\n    Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH. This likely forms a ketone through a complex rearrangement, such as adamantan-2-one. Let's assume Product 1 is adamantan-2-one.\n\n    Step 2: The ketone (Product 1) is reduced with aluminum isopropoxide to an alcohol (adamantan-2-ol). The heating mentioned causes dehydration of this alcohol via a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement to form an alkene, protoadamantene. This is Product 2 that reacts in the next step.\n\n    Step 3: Protoadamantene is subjected to ozonolysis (O3, then DMS). This reaction cleaves the C=C bond and yields a dicarbonyl compound. The known product of this reaction is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde. This is Product 3.\n\n    Step 4: We analyze the 1H NMR of Product 3, bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde.\n    The most deshielded non-exchangeable protons are the two equivalent aldehyde protons (-CHO).\n    Let's analyze the coupling (splitting) of one of these aldehyde protons:\n    - It is coupled to the single proton on the carbon to which the aldehyde group is attached (C3 or C7). This is a 3-bond coupling (³J) to one proton, which splits the signal into a doublet.\n    - Aldehyde protons can exhibit long-range 4-bond coupling (⁴J). In the bicyclic system, the aldehyde proton shows significant coupling to the two equivalent equatorial protons on the neighboring methylene groups (e.g., at C2 and C4). This coupling to two equivalent protons splits the signal into a triplet.\n    - Combining these effects, the signal for the aldehyde proton is split into a doublet by the C3-proton, and each line of the doublet is split into a triplet by the two C2/C4 protons.\n\n    The resulting coupling pattern is a doublet of triplets.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The final answer is determined by the logic above.\n    # A) doublet of triplets\n    # B) triplet\n    # C) pentet\n    # D) triplet of triplets\n\n    # Based on the analysis, the aldehyde proton signal is split into a doublet by one proton,\n    # and then into a triplet by two other equivalent protons.\n    final_choice = \"A\"\n    pattern = \"doublet of triplets\"\n    \n    print(f\"The structure of the final product (Product 3) is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde.\")\n    print(f\"The most deshielded protons are the aldehyde protons.\")\n    print(f\"An aldehyde proton couples to the single adjacent methine proton (on C3), causing a 'doublet' splitting.\")\n    print(f\"It also couples through long-range coupling to two equivalent equatorial protons on the neighboring carbons (C2 and C4), causing a 'triplet' splitting.\")\n    print(f\"The combined pattern is a {pattern}.\")\n    print(f\"This corresponds to choice {final_choice}.\")\n\nsolve_coupling_pattern()\n\n# The final step is to provide the answer in the required format.\nprint(\"<<<A>>>\")\n```"
