    "To determine the color of light absorbed by the textile dye, we first need to calculate the wavelength of the light that is *emitted*, and then find its complementary color, which will be the color that was absorbed.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Calculate the Wavelength of Emitted Light**: The energy of the emitted light is given (E = 2.3393 eV). We can use the formula E = hc/λ, rearranged as λ = hc/E, to find the wavelength (λ). We must first convert the energy from electron-volts (eV) to Joules (J).\n    *   `h` (Planck's constant) = 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   `c` (speed of light) = 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   1 eV = 1.602 x 10⁻¹⁹ J\n2.  **Determine the Emitted Color**: Based on the calculated wavelength (which we will convert to nanometers, nm), we can identify the color of the emitted light using the visible light spectrum.\n3.  **Determine the Absorbed Color**: The color of light a substance absorbs is the complementary color to the one it emits. For example, if a substance emits green light, it is because it absorbed red light. We will find the complementary color of the emitted light.\n4.  **Match with Options**: Finally, we will match our result for the absorbed color with the given choices.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations and identify the correct option.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_dye_color():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the absorbed color of a textile dye based on its emitted light energy.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define constants and given energy\n    h = 6.626e-34  # Planck's constant in J·s\n    c = 3.00e8     # Speed of light in m/s\n    eV_to_J = 1.602e-19 # Conversion factor for eV to Joules\n    E_eV = 2.3393  # Energy of emitted light in eV\n\n    # Convert energy from eV to Joules\n    E_J = E_eV * eV_to_J\n\n    # Calculate wavelength in nanometers (λ = hc/E)\n    wavelength_m = (h * c) / E_J\n    wavelength_nm = wavelength_m * 1e9\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the emitted color from the wavelength\n    emitted_color = \"\"\n    if 495 <= wavelength_nm < 570:\n        emitted_color = \"Green\"\n    elif 570 <= wavelength_nm < 590:\n        emitted_color = \"Yellow\"\n    elif 590 <= wavelength_nm < 620:\n        emitted_color = \"Orange\"\n    elif 620 <= wavelength_nm <= 750:\n        emitted_color = \"Red\"\n    elif 380 <= wavelength_nm < 450:\n        emitted_color = \"Violet\"\n    elif 450 <= wavelength_nm < 495:\n        emitted_color = \"Blue\"\n    else:\n        emitted_color = \"Outside visible spectrum\"\n\n    # Step 3: Determine the absorbed color (complementary color)\n    complementary_colors = {\n        \"Green\": \"Red\",\n        \"Yellow\": \"Violet\",\n        \"Orange\": \"Blue\",\n        \"Red\": \"Green\",\n        \"Violet\": \"Yellow\",\n        \"Blue\": \"Orange\"\n    }\n    absorbed_color = complementary_colors.get(emitted_color, \"Unknown\")\n    \n    # Step 4: Match with options\n    options = {\"A\": \"Yellow\", \"B\": \"Red\", \"C\": \"Violet\", \"D\": \"Blue\"}\n    final_choice = \"\"\n    for choice, color in options.items():\n        if color == absorbed_color:\n            final_choice = choice\n            break\n\n    # Print the detailed analysis\n    print(f\"The energy of the emitted light is {E_eV} eV.\")\n    print(f\"The calculated wavelength of the emitted light is {wavelength_nm:.2f} nm.\")\n    print(f\"A wavelength of {wavelength_nm:.2f} nm corresponds to the color: {emitted_color}.\")\n    print(f\"The color absorbed by a substance is the complementary color to the one it emits.\")\n    print(f\"The complementary color of {emitted_color} is {absorbed_color}.\")\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, the color of light absorbed by the organic compound is {absorbed_color}.\")\n    \n    # Print the choices and the final answer\n    print(\"\\nChoices:\")\n    print(\"A) Yellow\")\n    print(\"B) Red\")\n    print(\"C) Violet\")\n    print(\"D) Blue\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe correct option is: {final_choice}\")\n\n\nsolve_dye_color()\n<<<B>>>\n```"
