    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Goal:** The primary goal is to compute the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which is $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star. The formula is $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2d} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A)^{1/4}$, where $T_{star}$ is the star's temperature, $R_{star}$ is the star's radius, $d$ is the orbital distance (semi-major axis), and $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n    When we take the ratio for two planets around the same star with the same albedo, the terms $T_{star}$, $R_{star}$, and $(1-A)$ cancel out:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2d_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2d_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A_2)^{1/4}} = \\left( \\frac{d_2}{d_1} \\right)^{1/2}$\n    So, the problem boils down to finding the ratio of the orbital distances.\n\n3.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity:** The radial velocity (RV) method gives us information about the orbital parameters. The semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity ($K$) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_{star}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{star}}{d}}$, where $M_p$ is the planet's mass, $M_{star}$ is the star's mass, $i$ is the orbital inclination, and $d$ is the orbital distance.\n    We can rearrange this formula to solve for the orbital distance, $d$:\n    $d \\propto \\frac{M_p^2 \\sin^2(i)}{K^2}$\n    Since both planets are detected via the transit method, their orbits must be edge-on to our line of sight, meaning their inclinations are nearly identical and close to 90° ($i_1 \\approx i_2 \\approx 90^\\circ$). Therefore, the $\\sin(i)$ term can be considered equal for both and will cancel out in the ratio.\n    The ratio of the orbital distances is then:\n    $\\frac{d_1}{d_2} = \\left(\\frac{M_1}{M_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^2$\n\n4.  **Connect RV Amplitude to Doppler Shift:** The observed Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the radial velocity ($v_r$), where the maximum shift corresponds to the RV amplitude ($K$): $K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0}$.\n    Thus, the ratio of the RV amplitudes is simply the ratio of their maximum Doppler shifts:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\n5.  **Combine Formulas and Calculate:** Now we substitute the relationships from steps 3 and 4 back into the temperature ratio formula from step 2:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left( \\frac{d_2}{d_1} \\right)^{1/2} = \\left( \\frac{1}{(d_1/d_2)} \\right)^{1/2} = \\left( \\frac{1}{(\\frac{M_1}{M_2})^2 (\\frac{K_2}{K_1})^2} \\right)^{1/2} = \\left( \\frac{M_2}{M_1} \\right) \\left( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\right)$\n    Substituting the Doppler shift ratio for the K ratio:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left( \\frac{M_2}{M_1} \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} \\right)$\n    Now, we plug in the given values:\n    *   Mass ratio: $M_1/M_2 = 7/5 \\implies M_2/M_1 = 5/7$\n    *   Doppler shift ratio: $\\Delta\\lambda_1/\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4$\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{3}{4} \\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** The final step is to calculate the numerical value of this fraction and compare it with the given options.\n\n```python\n# Given data from the problem\n# Planet 1 mass in Earth masses\nm1 = 7.0\n# Planet 2 mass in Earth masses\nm2 = 5.0\n# Maximum Doppler shift for Planet 1 in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda1 = 0.03\n# Maximum Doppler shift for Planet 2 in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda2 = 0.04\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the ratio of the planet masses (M2/M1)\n# The equilibrium temperature ratio is proportional to (M2/M1).\nmass_ratio_M2_over_M1 = m2 / m1\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the ratio of the Doppler shifts (delta_lambda1/delta_lambda2)\n# The ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K1/K2) is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts.\n# The equilibrium temperature ratio is proportional to (K1/K2).\ndoppler_shift_ratio_l1_over_l2 = delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the final ratio of the equilibrium temperatures\n# The derivation shows T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M2/M1) * (K1/K2)\n# T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M2/M1) * (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2)\ntemp_ratio = mass_ratio_M2_over_M1 * doppler_shift_ratio_l1_over_l2\n\n# Print the result along with the choices\nprint(\"The calculated ratio of equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2) is:\", temp_ratio)\nprint(\"Let's compare this to the given options:\")\nprint(\"A) ~ 0.98\")\nprint(\"B) ~ 1.05\")\nprint(\"C) ~ 1.30\")\nprint(\"D) ~ 0.53\")\nprint(\"The calculated value {:.2f} matches option D.\".format(temp_ratio))\n\n```\n<<<D>>>"
