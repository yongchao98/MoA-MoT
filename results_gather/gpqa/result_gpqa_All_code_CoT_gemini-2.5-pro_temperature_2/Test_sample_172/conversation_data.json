    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Principle:** The problem relates the uncertainty in an electron's position (Δx) to the uncertainty in its energy (ΔE). This is a direct application of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\n2.  **Choose the Correct Formulas:**\n    *   The position-momentum uncertainty principle states: Δx ⋅ Δp ≥ ħ/2, where Δp is the uncertainty in momentum and ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h/2π).\n    *   We need to relate the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) to the uncertainty in energy (ΔE). The relationship between energy and momentum for a particle is given by its velocity, v = dE/dp. For small uncertainties, we can approximate this as ΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp.\n\n3.  **Combine the Formulas to Find ΔE:**\n    *   First, we'll calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp) using the position-momentum principle: Δp = ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx).\n    *   Then, we'll substitute this Δp into the energy-momentum relation to find the minimum uncertainty in energy: ΔE = v ⋅ (ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx)).\n\n4.  **Implement in Python:**\n    *   Define all the given values and physical constants in SI units: the electron's speed (v), the uncertainty in position (Δx), and Planck's constant (h).\n    *   Calculate the reduced Planck constant, ħ.\n    *   Execute the combined formula from step 3 to calculate ΔE.\n    *   Print the result and compare it to the given options to find the best estimate.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the given values and constants in SI units.\n# Speed of the electron (v)\nv = 2e8  # m/s\n# Uncertainty in position (Δx)\ndelta_x = 0.1e-9  # 0.1 nm = 0.1 * 10^-9 m\n\n# Physical constants\n# Planck's constant (h)\nh = 6.62607015e-34  # J·s\n# Reduced Planck's constant (ħ = h / 2π)\nhbar = h / (2 * math.pi)\n\n# Step 2: Use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle to find the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp).\n# The principle is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2.\n# The minimum uncertainty is therefore Δp_min = ħ / (2 * Δx).\ndelta_p_min = hbar / (2 * delta_x)\n\n# Step 3: Use the relationship between energy and momentum uncertainty (ΔE ≈ v * Δp).\n# Calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE).\ndelta_E_min = v * delta_p_min\n\n# Step 4: Print the result and compare with the options.\nprint(f\"Given information:\")\nprint(f\"Speed of electron (v) = {v:.1e} m/s\")\nprint(f\"Uncertainty in position (Δx) = {delta_x:.1e} m\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(f\"Calculations:\")\nprint(f\"Reduced Planck constant (ħ) = {hbar:.4e} J·s\")\nprint(f\"Minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp) = {delta_p_min:.4e} kg·m/s\")\nprint(f\"Estimated minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE) = {delta_E_min:.4e} J\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(\"Comparing with the options:\")\nprint(\"A) ~10^(-17) J\")\nprint(\"B) ~10^(-16) J\")\nprint(\"C) ~10^(-18) J\")\nprint(\"D) ~10^(-19) J\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value ~1.0546e-16 J is closest to 10^-16 J.\")\nprint(\"Therefore, the correct option is B.\")\n```\n<<<B>>>"
