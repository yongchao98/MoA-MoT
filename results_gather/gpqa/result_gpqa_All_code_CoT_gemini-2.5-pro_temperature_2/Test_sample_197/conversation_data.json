    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Identify the goal:** The task is to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, which is `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to all other cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n2.  **Define the system:** We have a series of complexation equilibria. The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co(II) ion and all its thiocyanato complexes:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]^+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]^-] + [[Co(SCN)4]^2-]`\n3.  **Use the stability constants (β):** The overall stability constants allow us to express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co^2+]` and the free ligand concentration `[SCN-]`:\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)]^+] = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)2]] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)3]^-] = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)4]^2-] = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4`\n4.  **Formulate the fraction:** The fraction (α₂) of the `[Co(SCN)2]` complex is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration `c(Co)`. By substituting the expressions from step 3 into the equation from step 2, we can derive a formula for α₂ that only depends on the known stability constants and the ligand concentration `[SCN-]`. The `[Co^2+]` term will cancel out.\n    `α₂ = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4)`\n    *Note: Since the ligand concentration (0.1 M) is ten times higher than the total metal concentration (0.01 M), we can approximate the free ligand concentration `[SCN-]` as its initial concentration, 0.1 M.*\n5.  **Calculate the value:** I will plug the given values (`β1=9`, `β2=40`, `β3=63`, `β4=16`, and `[SCN-]=0.1 M`) into this formula, calculate the fraction α₂, and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n6.  **Generate the Python code:** The code will perform the calculation described in step 5 and print the result.\n\n```python\n# Given values\n# Concentration of thiocyanate ions [SCN-]\nconc_SCN = 0.1  # M\n\n# Overall stability constants for cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n\n# The fraction of a specific complex [Co(SCN)n] is given by:\n# α_n = (β_n * [SCN-]^n) / (1 + Σ(β_i * [SCN-]^i)) for i=1 to 4\n\n# We want to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)2].\n# This corresponds to α₂.\n\n# Calculate the terms for the denominator of the fraction formula\n# term0 corresponds to free Co^2+\nterm0 = 1\n# term1 corresponds to [Co(SCN)]+\nterm1 = beta1 * (conc_SCN**1)\n# term2 corresponds to [Co(SCN)2]\nterm2 = beta2 * (conc_SCN**2)\n# term3 corresponds to [Co(SCN)3]-\nterm3 = beta3 * (conc_SCN**3)\n# term4 corresponds to [Co(SCN)4]^2-\nterm4 = beta4 * (conc_SCN**4)\n\n# The numerator is the term corresponding to the species of interest, [Co(SCN)2].\nnumerator = term2\n\n# The denominator is the sum of all terms, representing all cobalt-containing species.\ndenominator = term0 + term1 + term2 + term3 + term4\n\n# Calculate the fraction (α₂)\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(\"Calculation Steps:\")\nprint(f\"Numerator (relative concentration of [Co(SCN)2]): {numerator:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Denominator (sum of relative concentrations of all species): {denominator:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Fraction of [Co(SCN)2] (α₂): {alpha2:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Percentage of [Co(SCN)2]: {percentage:.1f}%\")\n\nprint(\"\\nChoices:\")\nprint(\"A) 25.6%\")\nprint(\"B) 42.3%\")\nprint(\"C) 38.1%\")\nprint(\"D) 16.9%\")\n\n# Determine the correct choice\nchoices = {'A': 25.6, 'B': 42.3, 'C': 38.1, 'D': 16.9}\nfor choice, value in choices.items():\n    if abs(percentage - value) < 0.1:\n        print(f\"\\nThe calculated percentage {percentage:.1f}% matches choice {choice}.\")\n        final_answer = choice\n        break\n\n<<<D>>>\n```"
