    "In quantum field theory, particularly when dealing with loop integrals in four-dimensional spacetime, there is a standard convention that arises from the calculation. Each closed loop in a Feynman diagram requires an integration over the momentum flowing through that loop. After carrying out the integration in four dimensions, each loop systematically contributes a factor of `1/(4π)^2` to the final expression for the diagram's amplitude.\n\nYour colleague's note contains the term `1/(4pi)^6`. We can use this to determine the number of loops, which we'll call `L`.\n\nThe total factor from `L` loops is `(1/(4π)^2)^L = 1/(4π)^(2*L)`.\nBy comparing this with the term from the note, `1/(4π)^6`, we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n`2 * L = 6`\n\nSolving this simple equation gives us the number of loops. The following Python code performs this calculation.\n\n```python\n# The number of loops in a Feynman diagram can be determined from the power of the\n# (4*pi) factor that appears in the calculation of the diagram's amplitude.\n\n# In four-dimensional spacetime, each loop integral contributes a factor of 1/((4*pi)^2).\n# Let L be the number of loops. The total factor is (1/((4*pi)^2))^L = 1/((4*pi)^(2*L)).\n\n# From the given expression, the factor is 1/((4*pi)^6).\n# This means the total power in the denominator's (4*pi) term is 6.\ntotal_power = 6\n\n# The power contributed by a single loop is 2.\npower_per_loop = 2\n\n# We can find the number of loops (L) by dividing the total power by the power per loop.\n# Equation: 2 * L = 6\nnumber_of_loops = total_power // power_per_loop\n\nprint(f\"The calculation shows that the Feynman diagram contained {number_of_loops} loops.\")\n\n# The given choices are:\n# A) 1\n# B) 3\n# C) 2\n# D) 6\n# Based on our calculation, the correct choice is B.\nprint(\"The correct choice is B.\")\n```\n<<<B>>>"
