    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principle:** The core principle is the conservation of energy. In this annihilation process, the total initial energy of the proton and antiproton system is converted into the total final energy of the four A particles.\n2.  **Calculate the initial energy ($E_{initial}$):** The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible. We'll assume the proton is also at rest. Therefore, the total initial energy is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n    *   Rest energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938.27 MeV.\n    *   An antiproton has the same rest energy.\n    *   $E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times 938.27 \\text{ MeV}$.\n3.  **Define the final energy ($E_{final}$):** The final state consists of four particles (two $A^+$ and two $A^-$). Due to the symmetry of the annihilation from a state of rest, we can assume each of these four particles will have the same speed, $v$, and thus the same total energy, $E_A$.\n    *   The rest energy of a single particle A is given as $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   The total relativistic energy of a single particle A is $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The total final energy is the sum for all four particles: $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n4.  **Apply energy conservation:** Set the initial energy equal to the final energy:\n    *   $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    *   $2 \\times m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n5.  **Solve for the velocity (v):**\n    *   First, we'll solve the equation for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n    *   Then, we will use the relationship $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$ to solve for the velocity, $v$, expressed as a fraction of the speed of light, $c$.\n    *   Finally, we will compare the calculated value with the given options.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1 & 2: Define constants and calculate initial energy\n# Rest energy of a proton in MeV\nm_p_c2 = 938.27  # MeV\n# Total initial energy (proton + antiproton at rest)\ne_initial = 2 * m_p_c2\n\n# Step 3: Define final state parameters\n# Rest energy of one particle A in MeV\nm_A_c2 = 300.0  # MeV\n# Number of final particles\nnum_A_particles = 4\n\n# Step 4: Apply energy conservation to find the Lorentz factor (gamma)\n# E_initial = E_final  =>  e_initial = num_A_particles * gamma * m_A_c2\n# Solve for gamma\ngamma = e_initial / (num_A_particles * m_A_c2)\n\n# Step 5: Solve for velocity (v) from gamma\n# gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)\n# Rearranging for v/c (beta): beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)\nbeta_squared = 1 - (1 / (gamma**2))\nbeta = math.sqrt(beta_squared)\n\n# The velocity of particle A is beta * c\nvelocity_of_A = beta\n\n# Print the result and the choices\nprint(f\"The calculated Lorentz factor (gamma) is: {gamma:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"The calculated velocity of particle A is: {velocity_of_A:.2f}c\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\nprint(f\"A) 0.86c\")\nprint(f\"B) 0.96c\")\nprint(f\"C) 0.77c\")\nprint(f\"D) 0.91c\")\n\n# Determine the correct choice\noptions = {'A': 0.86, 'B': 0.96, 'C': 0.77, 'D': 0.91}\nbest_choice = min(options, key=lambda x: abs(options[x] - velocity_of_A))\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated value {velocity_of_A:.2f}c is closest to option {best_choice}.\")\nprint(f\"<<<{best_choice}>>>\")\n```"
