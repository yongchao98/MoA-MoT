    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Relevant Physics Principles**: The luminosity (L) of a star, treated as a black body, is governed by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: `L = 4 * π * R² * σ * T⁴`, where `R` is the radius and `T` is the surface temperature. The surface temperature is related to the wavelength of maximum emission (`λ_max`) by Wien's Displacement Law: `λ_max = b / T`, where `b` is a constant. Therefore, `T` is inversely proportional to `λ_max`.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio**: We need to find the ratio `L1 / L2`.\n    *   `L1 / L2 = (4 * π * R1² * σ * T1⁴) / (4 * π * R2² * σ * T2⁴)`\n    *   Canceling the constants (`4`, `π`, `σ`), we get: `L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)⁴`.\n    *   We are given `R1 / R2 = 1.5`. So, `L1 / L2 = (1.5)² * (T1/T2)⁴ = 2.25 * (T1/T2)⁴`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio (T1/T2)**:\n    *   From Wien's law, the temperature `T` is proportional to `1 / λ_emitted`, where `λ_emitted` is the peak wavelength emitted by the star in its own reference frame.\n    *   Therefore, `T1 / T2 = λ_emitted_2 / λ_emitted_1`.\n    *   The problem states the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same (`λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2`).\n    *   For Star_1, with zero radial velocity (`v1 = 0`), the observed and emitted wavelengths are the same: `λ_obs_1 = λ_emitted_1`.\n    *   For Star_2, with radial velocity `v2 = 700 km/s`, the observed wavelength is affected by the relativistic Doppler effect. By convention, a positive velocity indicates the object is receding, causing a redshift.\n    *   The formula for redshift is: `λ_obs = λ_emitted * sqrt((1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c))`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   So, `λ_obs_2 = λ_emitted_2 * sqrt((1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c))`.\n    *   Since `λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2`, we have `λ_emitted_1 = λ_emitted_2 * sqrt((1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c))`.\n    *   Rearranging this gives the ratio we need: `λ_emitted_2 / λ_emitted_1 = sqrt((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))`.\n    *   Thus, `T1 / T2 = sqrt((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))`.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation**: Substitute the expression for `T1/T2` back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    *   `L1 / L2 = 2.25 * (T1/T2)⁴ = 2.25 * [sqrt((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))]⁴`\n    *   `L1 / L2 = 2.25 * ((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))²`\n\n5.  **Code Implementation**: We will use Python to perform this final calculation with the given values. The mass information is irrelevant for this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given values and constants ---\n\n# Ratio of the radii (Star_1 / Star_2)\nR1_over_R2 = 1.5\n\n# Radial velocity of Star_2 in km/s\nv2_kms = 700\n\n# Speed of light in km/s\nc_kms = 299792.458\n\n# --- Calculations ---\n\n# 1. Calculate beta (v/c), which is a dimensionless velocity\nbeta = v2_kms / c_kms\n\n# 2. Calculate the term ((1-beta)/(1+beta))^2 which corresponds to (T1/T2)^4\n# This term accounts for the Doppler shift's effect on the inferred temperature of Star_2\ntemp_ratio_factor = ((1 - beta) / (1 + beta))**2\n\n# 3. Calculate the final luminosity ratio L1 / L2\n# L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\nluminosity_ratio = (R1_over_R2**2) * temp_ratio_factor\n\n# --- Output the result ---\n\nprint(f\"The luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of: {luminosity_ratio:.4f}\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this to the options:\")\nprint(f\"A) ~2.23 (Difference: {abs(luminosity_ratio - 2.23):.4f})\")\nprint(f\"B) ~2.32 (Difference: {abs(luminosity_ratio - 2.32):.4f})\")\nprint(f\"C) ~2.35 (Difference: {abs(luminosity_ratio - 2.35):.4f})\")\nprint(f\"D) ~2.25 (Difference: {abs(luminosity_ratio - 2.25):.4f})\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value is closest to option A.\")\n\n```\n<<<A>>>"
