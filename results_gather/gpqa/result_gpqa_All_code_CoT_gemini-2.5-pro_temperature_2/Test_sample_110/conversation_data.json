    "This problem requires us to determine the major products of two separate chemical reactions, which are both Michael additions. We will analyze each reaction step-by-step to identify the correct products, A and B, and then select the corresponding option.\n\n**Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) → A**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is a Michael addition. The strong base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), will create a nucleophile (an enolate) from the ketone. This enolate will then attack the Michael acceptor (ethyl acrylate).\n2.  **Determine the nucleophile:** The ketone, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two alpha-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl C=O group): C2 and C6.\n    *   C2 is quaternary (bonded to four other carbons: the carbonyl, C3, an ethyl group, and a methyl group). It has no alpha-hydrogens, so it cannot be deprotonated to form an enolate.\n    *   C6 is tertiary (bonded to three other carbons and one hydrogen). It has one acidic alpha-hydrogen.\n    *   Therefore, the base t-BuOK can only abstract the proton from C6, forming the enolate at this position.\n3.  **Determine the electrophile:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH−COOEt) is an α,β-unsaturated ester and will act as the Michael acceptor. The nucleophilic attack occurs at the β-carbon (the CH₂ group).\n4.  **Determine Product A:** The C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate. After protonation, a new alkyl chain (`-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`) is added to the C6 position of the cyclohexanone ring.\n5.  **Name Product A:** The resulting molecule is named `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`. The naming in options C and D correctly reflects this structure, while the names in options A and B imply an incorrect addition site.\n\n**Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) → B**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is also a Michael addition. The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), will deprotonate the alpha-carbon of 1-nitropropane. The resulting carbanion (nitronate) is the nucleophile.\n2.  **Determine the nucleophile:** The alpha-protons on the carbon attached to the electron-withdrawing nitro group in 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂C**H**₂−NO₂) are acidic. KOH removes one of these protons to form the carbanion [CH₃CH₂**C**H−NO₂]⁻.\n3.  **Determine the electrophile:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃−CH=CH−CN), also known as crotononitrile, is the Michael acceptor. The attack occurs at its β-carbon (the CH group next to the methyl).\n4.  **Determine Product B:** The nucleophilic carbanion from 1-nitropropane attacks the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. A new carbon-carbon bond is formed.\n5.  **Name Product B:** The structure of the product is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`. To name this according to IUPAC rules, we find the longest carbon chain containing the primary functional group (nitrile, -CN). The chain has 6 carbons, making it a hexanenitrile. Numbering from the nitrile carbon as C1, there is a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4. The correct name is `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`. This matches the name for B in options B and C.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nMatching these two products with the given choices, only option C is correct for both.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the two given reactions and determines the correct option.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Analysis for Reaction A\n    product_A_analysis = \"Reaction A is a Michael addition.
