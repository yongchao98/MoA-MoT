    "Of course! This is a fascinating problem involving the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation. Here is my plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Determine the Travel Time in Earth's Frame of Reference (`Δt`)**: First, I'll calculate how long the journey would take from the perspective of an observer on Earth. This is done using the classic formula `Time = Distance / Speed`. For the distance, I'll use the approximate distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud, which is about 163,000 light-years.\n2.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (`γ`)**: The core of time dilation is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the spacecraft's velocity. The formula is `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`. A higher speed results in a larger Lorentz factor.\n3.  **Calculate the Travel Time for the Astronaut (`Δτ`)**: Using the time dilation formula, `Δτ = Δt / γ`, I will calculate the time that passes for the astronaut on the spacecraft. This is the \"proper time\" and will be significantly shorter than the time measured from Earth.\n4.  **Check for Survival**: The astronaut starts the journey at 22 and has a lifespan of 150 years, meaning they have 128 years left. I will compare the calculated travel time for the astronaut with their remaining lifespan to see if they would survive.\n5.  **Select the Best Option**: Based on the calculated time, I will choose the closest answer from the given options.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these calculations and determine the answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given Data and Constants ---\n\n# The speed of the spacecraft as a fraction of the speed of light (c)\nv_ratio = 0.99999987\n\n# The approximate distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud in light-years.\n# Astronomical distances can vary slightly based on the source, but 163,000 ly is a common value.\ndistance_light_years = 163000.0\n\n# The alien astronaut's age and lifespan in solar years.\nastronaut_age = 22\nlifespan = 150\n\n# --- Calculations based on Special Relativity ---\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the journey time from Earth's perspective (observer time, Δt).\n# Since distance is in light-years and speed is a fraction of c, the time will be in years.\n# Δt = Distance / Speed = (distance_light_years * c) / (v_ratio * c)\ntime_on_earth = distance_light_years / v_ratio\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz Factor (gamma, γ).\n# γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)\nlorentz_factor = 1.0 / math.sqrt(1.0 - v_ratio**2)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the journey time from the astronaut's perspective (proper time, Δτ).\n# This is the time dilation formula: Δτ = Δt / γ\ntime_for_astronaut = time_on_earth / lorentz_factor\n\n# Step 4: Check if the astronaut will survive the journey.\nremaining_lifespan = lifespan - astronaut_age\n\n# --- Print the Results and Final Answer ---\n\nprint(f\"The distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud is {distance_light_years} light-years.\")\nprint(f\"The spacecraft's speed is {v_ratio * 100:.8f}% of the speed of light.\")\nprint(f\"From Earth's perspective, the journey would take {time_on_earth:.2f} years.\")\nprint(f\"From the astronaut's perspective, the journey will take: {time_for_astronaut:.2f} years.\")\n\n# The calculated time for the astronaut is ~83.11 years.\n# We compare this to the astronaut's remaining lifespan.\nif time_for_astronaut < remaining_lifespan:\n    print(f\"The astronaut's remaining lifespan is {remaining_lifespan} years, so they will survive the journey.\")\n    # Now we find the closest choice from the options.\n    # The options are 72, 81, Die, 77. The value 83.11 is closest to 81.\n    final_choice = 'B'\nelse:\n    print(f\"The astronaut's remaining lifespan is {remaining_lifespan} years, so they will not survive the journey.\")\n    final_choice = 'C'\n\nprint(\"\\n--- Available Choices ---\")\nprint(\"A) 72 years\")\nprint(\"B) 81 years\")\nprint(\"C) The astronaut will die before reaching to the Earth.\")\nprint(\"D) 77 years\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated journey time ({time_for_astronaut:.2f} years) is closest to 81 years.
