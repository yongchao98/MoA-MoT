    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine which stars can be detected by both observatories:\n\n1.  **Establish Observability Criteria:** A star must meet the conditions for both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs.\n    *   **Apparent Magnitude:** ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V=17 mag (`m_V < 17`), while HIRES can observe stars brighter than V=16 mag (`m_V < 16`). To be seen by both, a star must satisfy the stricter limit, so its apparent magnitude must be `m_V < 16.0`.\n    *   **Declination (Location in the Sky):** The problem states to disregard pointing limits, which is interpreted as ignoring effects like airmass, but still requires the star to be physically visible above the horizon. The Keck Observatory in the Northern Hemisphere (Latitude ~+20°) can observe stars down to a declination of approximately -70°. The Paranal Observatory in the Southern Hemisphere (Latitude ~-25°) can observe stars up to a declination of about +65°. Therefore, for a star to be visible from both, its declination must be in the overlapping range of roughly `-70° < DEC < +65°`.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Star:** Each star will be checked against these two criteria. We'll need the distance modulus formula, `m_V - M_V = 5 * log10(d) - 5`, and the extinction formula, `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`, to find the final observed apparent magnitude (`m_V`).\n\n3.  **Execute the Code:** The following Python code implements this logic to calculate the necessary values for each star and determine which ones are observable by both instruments.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_star_visibility():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines which stars are observable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES based on magnitude and declination.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Observability Criteria ---\n    # Combined magnitude limit (stricter of the two)\n    MAGNITUDE_LIMIT = 16.0\n    # Combined declination limits based on observatory latitudes\n    # Keck (Lat ~+20 deg) can see down to DEC > -70 deg\n    # Paranal (Lat ~-25 deg) can see up to DEC < +65 deg\n    DEC_LIMIT_SOUTH = -70.0\n    DEC_LIMIT_NORTH = +65.0\n\n    # --- Star Data ---\n    # RA is Right Ascension, DEC is Declination, M_V is absolute magnitude,\n    # m_V is apparent magnitude, d_pc is distance in parsecs, E(B-V) is color excess.\n    stars_data = {\n        'Star1': {'DEC': -75, 'M_V': 15.5, 'd_pc': 10, 'E(B-V)': 0},\n        'Star2': {'DEC': 55, 'm_V': 16.5}, # Apparent magnitude is given directly\n        'Star3': {'DEC': 48, 'm_V': 15.5, 'E(B-V)': 0.6}, # Apparent magnitude given; E(B-V) is extraneous\n        'Star4': {'DEC': -48, 'M_V': 15.5, 'd_pc': 10, 'E(B-V)': 0.4},\n        'Star5': {'DEC': 60, 'M_V': 16.5, 'd_pc': 5, 'E(B-V)': 0}\n    }\n\n    observable_stars = []\n\n    print(\"Evaluating each star's observability by both telescopes...\\n\")\n\n    for name, data in stars_data.items():\n        # --- Calculate final observed apparent magnitude (m_V_obs) ---\n        if 'm_V' in data:\n            # Case where apparent magnitude is given directly in the problem\n            m_V_obs = data['m_V']\n        else:\n            # Calculate apparent magnitude from absolute magnitude, distance, and extinction\n            M_V = data['M_V']\n            d_pc = data['d_pc']\n            E_B_V = data['E(B-V)']\n            \n            # Distance modulus formula: m - M = 5*log10(d) - 5\n            distance_modulus = 5 * math.log10(d_pc) - 5\n            # Interstellar extinction: A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)\n            extinction_A_V = 3.1 * E_B_V\n            # Final observed magnitude\n            m_V_obs = M_V + distance_modulus + extinction_A_V\n\n        # --- Check observability criteria ---\n        dec = data['DEC']\n        is_mag_ok = m_V_obs < MAGNITUDE_LIMIT\n        is_dec_ok = (dec > DEC_LIMIT_SOUTH) and (dec < DEC_LIMIT_NORTH)\n        is_observable = is_mag_ok and is_dec_ok\n        \n        # --- Print results for this star ---\n        print(f\"--- {name} ---\")\n        print(f\"Calculated Apparent V Magnitude: {m_V_obs:.2f}\")\n        print(f\"Declination: {dec}°\")\n        print(f\"Check 1 (Magnitude): Is m_V < {MAGNITUDE_LIMIT}? {'Yes' if is_mag_ok else 'No'}\")\n        print(f\"Check 2 (Declination): Is {DEC_LIMIT_SOUTH}° < DEC < {DEC_LIMIT_NORTH}°? {'Yes' if is_dec_ok else 'No'}\")\n        print(f\"Result: Observable by both? {'YES' if is_observable else 'NO'}\\n\")\n        \n        if is_observable:\n            observable_stars.append(name)\n\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"Final conclusion: The stars observable by both observatories are: {', '.join(observable_stars)}\")\n\n    # Match the result to the given options\n    if sorted(observable_stars) == ['Star3', 'Star5']:\n        print(\"This corresponds to option D.\")\n    elif sorted(observable_stars) == ['Star2', 'Star3']:\n        print(\"This corresponds to option A.\")\n    elif sorted(observable_stars) == ['Star4', 'Star5']:\n        print(\"This corresponds to option B.\")\n    elif sorted(observable_stars) == ['Star1', 'Star4']:\n        print(\"This corresponds to option C.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"The result does not match any of the provided options.\")\n\n# Execute the function to solve the problem\nsolve_star_visibility()\n```\n<<<D>>>"
