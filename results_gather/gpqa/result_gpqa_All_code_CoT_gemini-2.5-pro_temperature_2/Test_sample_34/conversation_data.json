    "Of course, I can help you with this quantum mechanics problem.\n\nHere is my plan to determine the correct statement:\n1.  First, I will construct the operator `Ay` as a 2x2 matrix using its definition `Ay = c∙S`. For the calculation, I can simplify by setting the constant `c = h/4π` to 1, as the fundamental properties we need to check do not depend on its specific value.\n2.  Next, I will use Python's `numpy` library to calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the `Ay` matrix.\n3.  The calculated eigenvalues will be printed. Since physical observables must have real eigenvalues, this result will allow us to immediately evaluate the validity of statements C and D.\n4.  I will then define the matrices for the related operators `A^2` (the total angular momentum squared) and `Az` (the Z-component of angular momentum).\n5.  I will programmatically test if an eigenvector of `Ay` is also an eigenvector of `A^2` and `Az`. This will directly verify or falsify the two parts of statement B.\n6.  Finally, I will check if the calculated eigenvectors of `Ay` form a basis, which will verify statement A.\n\nThe results printed by the code will clearly show which statements are correct, allowing for an informed final choice.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Define the operator matrix Ay.\n# The constant c = h/(4*pi) is a real scalar.
