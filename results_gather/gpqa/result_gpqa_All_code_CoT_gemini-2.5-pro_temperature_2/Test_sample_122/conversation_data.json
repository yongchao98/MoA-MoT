    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:** We have two frames of reference: the ejecta's frame and the Galaxy's frame. The problem gives us the time elapsed in the ejecta's frame (`Δt₀`), which is the \"proper time,\" and asks for the distance traveled as measured from the Galaxy's frame.\n2.  **Time Dilation:** An event that takes `Δt₀` time in a moving frame of reference will be observed to take a longer time, `Δt`, from a stationary frame. This phenomenon is called time dilation and is described by the formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n    `v` is the relative velocity between the frames (60,000 km/s), and `c` is the speed of light (approximately 299,792.458 km/s).\n3.  **Calculate Time in Galaxy Frame (`Δt`):** First, we will calculate the Lorentz factor `γ` using the given velocity. Then, we will use it to find the time `Δt` that passes in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n4.  **Calculate Distance in Galaxy Frame:** The distance traveled by the ejecta as observed from the Galaxy's frame is the product of its velocity (`v`) and the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`).\n    `Distance = v * Δt`\n5.  **Compare and Conclude:** We will compare our calculated distance with the given multiple-choice options to find the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_relativistic_distance():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the distance traveled by the supernova ejecta in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given values\n    # Velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy (v) in km/s\n    v = 60000.0\n    # Proper time: time passed in the ejecta's reference frame (Δt₀) in seconds\n    delta_t0 = 50.0\n    # Speed of light (c) in km/s\n    c = 299792.458\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the ratio v/c\n    beta = v / c\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\n    # gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)\n    gamma = 1.0 / math.sqrt(1 - beta**2)\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (Δt)\n    # Δt = γ * Δt₀\n    delta_t = gamma * delta_t0\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame\n    # Distance = v * Δt\n    distance = v * delta_t\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step calculation:\")\n    print(f\"Relative velocity (v): {v} km/s\")\n    print(f\"Proper time in ejecta's frame (Δt₀): {delta_t0} s\")\n    print(f\"Speed of light (c): {c} km/s\")\n    print(f\"Lorentz factor (γ): {gamma:.6f}\")\n    print(f\"Time in Galaxy's frame (Δt): {delta_t:.6f} s\")\n    print(f\"Calculated distance in Galaxy's frame: {distance:.0f} km\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(\"Comparing with the options:\")\n    print(f\"A) 2,940,000 km\")\n    print(f\"B) 3,000,000 km\")\n    print(f\"C) 3,060,000 km\")\n    print(f\"D) 2,880,000 km\")\n\n    # Determine the closest option\n    options = {\n        'A': 2940000,\n        'B': 3000000,\n        'C': 3060000,\n        'D': 2880000\n    }\n    \n    closest_option = min(options, key=lambda k: abs(options[k] - distance))\n    \n    # Final answer based on the calculation being closest to option C\n    final_answer = \"C\"\n    print(f\"\\nThe calculated distance ({distance:.0f} km) is closest to option {closest_option} ({options[closest_option]} km).\")\n\n\ncalculate_relativistic_distance()\n<<<C>>>\n```"
