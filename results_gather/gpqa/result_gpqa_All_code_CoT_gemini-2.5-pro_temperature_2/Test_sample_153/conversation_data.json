    "Here is my step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 is two mass units heavier. The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is 100% to 32%, or approximately 3:1. This is the characteristic isotopic signature for a molecule containing a single chlorine atom (³⁵Cl vs ³⁷Cl).\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The unknown compound has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol and contains one chlorine atom. Let's check which of the options match this.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad signal is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid, where extensive hydrogen bonding causes the peak to widen significantly.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. When seen with the broad O-H stretch, it confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** This highly deshielded signal is a classic chemical shift for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). Its integration of 1H confirms one such proton.\n*   **8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is highly indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of a para-substituted ring results in two sets of chemically equivalent protons.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options**\n*   **From MS:** The compound has a formula C₇H₅ClO₂ (MW = 156) and contains one chlorine atom. All four options match this.\n*   **From IR and NMR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This eliminates option (A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (an aldehyde and a phenol) and (C) Phenyl chloroformate (an acid formate). We are left with (B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid and (D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid.\n*   **From the NMR aromatic pattern:** We need a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring to produce the simple two-doublet pattern.\n    *   (B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid is para-substituted and would give this exact pattern.\n    *   (D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid is ortho-substituted, which would result in a much more complex splitting pattern with four unique aromatic signals.\n*   **Final Conclusion:** Only 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits all the spectral data provided.\n\nThe following Python code will programmatically walk through this logic to confirm the answer.\n\n```python\ndef identify_compound():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes spectral data to identify an unknown compound from a list of options.\n    \"\"\"\n    options = {\n        'A': {'name': '3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde', 'mw': 156.5, 'formula': 'C7H5ClO2', 'functional_group': ['aldehyde', 'phenol'], 'substitution': '1,2,3-trisubstituted'},\n        'B': {'name': '4-chlorobenzoic acid', 'mw': 156.5, 'formula': 'C7H5ClO2', 'functional_group': ['carboxylic acid'], 'substitution': '1,4-disubstituted (para)'},\n        'C': {'name': 'Phenyl chloroformate', 'mw': 156.5, 'formula': 'C7H5ClO2', 'functional_group': ['acid formate/ester'], 'substitution': 'monosubstituted derivative'},\n        'D': {'name': '2-chlorobenzoic acid', 'mw': 156.5, 'formula': 'C7H5ClO2', 'functional_group': ['carboxylic acid'], 'substitution': '1,2-disubstituted (ortho)'}\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing Mass Spectrometry Data (m/z = 156, M+2 = 158 at 32%)\")\n    print(\"The M+/M+2 ratio of ~3:1 strongly indicates the presence of one chlorine atom.\")\n    print(\"The molecular weight is 156 (using the 35Cl isotope).\")\n    \n    # All provided options have the formula C7H5ClO2, which has a MW of 156.5 g/mol on average,\n    # and 156 g/mol for the 35Cl isotope.
