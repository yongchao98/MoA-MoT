    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet orbiting a star is given by the formula:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\cdot (1 - A)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}}$\n    where $T_{star}$ is the star's temperature, $R_{star}$ is the star's radius, $A$ is the planet's albedo, and $a$ is the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis). Since all three planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, $T_{star}$, $R_{star}$, and $A$ are constant. This simplifies the relationship to:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n    This means the square of the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the orbital distance:\n    $a \\propto \\frac{1}{T_{eq}^2}$\n\n2.  **Understand the relationship between Orbital Period and Orbital Distance (Kepler's Third Law):** For planets orbiting the same star, Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of the orbital distance ($a$):\n    $P^2 \\propto a^3$ or $P \\propto a^{3/2}$\n\n3.  **Combine the relationships:** We can combine the two relationships to find how the orbital period ($P$) relates to the equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$).\n    Since $P \\propto a^{3/2}$ and $a \\propto \\frac{1}{T_{eq}^2}$, we can substitute the expression for $a$:\n    $P \\propto \\left(\\frac{1}{T_{eq}^2}\\right)^{3/2}$\n    $P \\propto \\frac{1}{T_{eq}^3}$\n    This gives us the ratio of the periods:\n    $\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq3}}\\right)^3$\n\n4.  **Calculate the required temperature ratio:** We are given the ratios $T_{eq1}/T_{eq2}$ and $T_{eq2}/T_{eq3}$. We can find $T_{eq1}/T_{eq3}$ by multiplying them:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq3}} = \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} \\cdot \\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the final period ratio:** Substitute the calculated temperature ratio into the period ratio formula from step 3 and solve. The information about the planet masses is not needed for this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Given ratios\nTeq1_div_Teq2 = 1.4\nTeq2_div_Teq3 = 2.3\n\n# The mass ratios and the specific albedo value are not needed for this calculation.\n# The relationship between the orbital period (P) and equilibrium temperature (Teq) for\n# planets around the same star with the same albedo is P ‚àù 1 / Teq^3.\n# Therefore, P3 / P1 = (Teq1 / Teq3)^3.\n\n# First, we need to find the ratio Teq1 / Teq3.\n# We can do this by multiplying the given ratios:\n# (Teq1 / Teq2) * (Teq2 / Teq3) = Teq1 / Teq3\nTeq1_div_Teq3 = Teq1_div_Teq2 * Teq2_div_Teq3\n\n# Now, we can calculate the ratio of the orbital periods P3 / P1.\n# P3 / P1 = (Teq1 / Teq3)^3\nperiod_ratio_P3_P1 = Teq1_div_Teq3 ** 3\n\nprint(\"Plan:\")\nprint(\"1.
