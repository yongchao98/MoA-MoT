    "To identify the issue with the protein expression, we need to analyze the provided DNA sequence. The most common reasons for a lack of protein expression based on a coding sequence are issues with the start codon, the presence of a premature stop codon, or a frameshift mutation.\n\nOur plan is to:\n1.  Take the provided DNA sequence.\n2.  Translate it into an amino acid sequence, codon by codon.\n3.  Examine the resulting peptide sequence to see if it is complete. We will pay close attention to any stop codons encountered before the end of the gene. A stop codon in the DNA is one of `TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`.\n\nLet's execute this plan by translating the sequence. We'll start from the `ATG` start codon and proceed three bases at a time.\n\n```python\ndef find_expression_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a DNA sequence to find the reason for failed protein expression.\n    \"\"\"\n    dna_sequence = \"ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA\"\n\n    codon_table = {\n        'ATA':'I', 'ATC':'I', 'ATT':'I', 'ATG':'M',\n        'ACA':'T', 'ACC':'T', 'ACG':'T', 'ACT':'T',\n        'AAC':'N', 'AAT':'N', 'AAA':'K', 'AAG':'K',\n        'AGC':'S', 'AGT':'S', 'AGA':'R', 'AGG':'R',\n        'CTA':'L', 'CTC':'L', 'CTG':'L', 'CTT':'L',\n        'CCA':'P', 'CCC':'P', 'CCG':'P', 'CCT':'P',\n        'CAC':'H', 'CAT':'H', 'CAA':'Q', 'CAG':'Q',\n        'CGA':'R', 'CGC':'R', 'CGG':'R', 'CGT':'R',\n        'GTA':'V', 'GTC':'V', 'GTG':'V', 'GTT':'V',\n        'GCA':'A', 'GCC':'A', 'GCG':'A', 'GCT':'A',\n        'GAC':'D', 'GAT':'D', 'GAA':'E', 'GAG':'E',\n        'GGA':'G', 'GGC':'G', 'GGG':'G', 'GGT':'G',\n        'TCA':'S', 'TCC':'S', 'TCG':'S', 'TCT':'S',\n        'TTC':'F', 'TTT':'F', 'TTA':'L', 'TTG':'L',\n        'TAC':'Y', 'TAT':'Y', 'TAA':'_', 'TAG':'_',\n        'TGC':'C', 'TGT':'C', 'TGA':'_', 'TGG':'W',\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the DNA sequence by translating it into a protein...\")\n    print(\"Reading frame starts at the first base 'A' of the ATG start codon.\")\n\n    # The HA tag sequence is YPYDVPDYA.
