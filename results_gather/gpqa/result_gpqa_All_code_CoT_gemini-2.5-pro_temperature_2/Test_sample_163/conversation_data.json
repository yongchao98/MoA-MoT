    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical law:** The total mass of a double-lined spectroscopic binary system is related to its orbital period (P) and the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes of its component stars (K_total = K1 + K2). The problem mentions that both systems are eclipsing, which is a key piece of information. For an eclipsing binary, the inclination angle `i` of the orbit is approximately 90 degrees, which means `sin(i)` is approximately 1.\n\n2.  **State the formula:** The total mass (M_total = m1 + m2) of an eclipsing double-lined spectroscopic binary system can be calculated using the formula derived from Kepler's Third Law:\n    `M_total = (P * (K1 + K2)^3) / (2 * pi * G)`\n    where `P` is the period, `K1` and `K2` are the radial velocity amplitudes, and `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n3.  **Formulate the mass ratio:** We need to find the ratio of the mass of system 1 (M1_total) to the mass of system 2 (M2_total).\n    `Ratio = M1_total / M2_total`\n    `Ratio = [ (P1 * (K1a + K1b)^3) / (2 * pi * G) ] / [ (P2 * (K2a + K2b)^3) / (2 * pi * G) ]`\n    The constant term `1 / (2 * pi * G)` cancels out, simplifying the formula to:\n    `Ratio = (P1 * (K1a + K1b)^3) / (P2 * (K2a + K2b)^3)`\n\n4.  **Plug in the given values:**\n    *   For System 1: `P1 = 2` years, `K1a = 10` km/s, `K1b = 5` km/s.\n    *   For System 2: `P2 = 1` year, `K2a = 15` km/s, `K2b = 10` km/s.\n    We don't need to convert the units to SI (seconds, meters/s) because we are calculating a ratio, and the conversion factors would cancel out.\n\n5.  **Calculate the final value** using Python and determine which option it corresponds to.\n\n```python\n# System 1 parameters\nP1 = 2.0  # Orbital period in years\nK1a = 10.0  # Velocity amplitude of star 1a in km/s\nK1b = 5.0  # Velocity amplitude of star 1b in km/s\n\n# System 2 parameters\nP2 = 1.0  # Orbital period in years\nK2a = 15.0 # Velocity amplitude of star 2a in km/s\nK2b = 10.0 # Velocity amplitude of star 2b in km/s\n\n# Calculate the sum of velocity amplitudes for each system\nK1_total = K1a + K1b\nK2_total = K2a + K2b\n\n# The ratio of the total masses M1/M2 is proportional to (P * K_total^3)\n# The constant factor (1 / (2 * pi * G)) cancels out in the ratio.\nnumerator = P1 * (K1_total ** 3)\ndenominator = P2 * (K2_total ** 3)\n\nmass_ratio = numerator / denominator\n\nprint(f\"The sum of velocity amplitudes for system 1 is: {K1_total} km/s\")\nprint(f\"The sum of velocity amplitudes for system 2 is: {K2_total} km/s\")\nprint(f\"The numerator for the ratio is (P1 * K1_total^3) = {numerator}\")\nprint(f\"The denominator for the ratio is (P2 * K2_total^3) = {denominator}\")\nprint(f\"The factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is: {mass_ratio:.3f}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nComparing the result with the given options:\")\nprint(\"A) ~ 1.2\")\nprint(\"B) ~ 0.6\")\nprint(\"C) ~ 0.4\")\nprint(\"D) ~ 0.7\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value of approximately 0.432 corresponds to option C.\")\n\n```\n<<<C>>>"
