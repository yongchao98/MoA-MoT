    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the structure of the final product (4) by following the reaction sequence and then analyze its symmetry to find the number of distinct proton environments for 1H NMR spectroscopy.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Reaction 1: Formation of Product 1**\n    *   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), bromine (Br2), pyridine/acetic anhydride (catalyst/conditions for Hell-Vollhard-Zelinsky reaction).\n    *   **Reaction:** The Hell-Vollhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction brominates the alpha-carbon of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Product 1:** Br-CH2-COOH (2-bromoacetic acid).\n\n2.  **Reaction 2: Formation of Product 2**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Br-CH2-COOH), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and sulfuric acid (H2SO4, acid catalyst).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid is converted into an ester.\n    *   **Product 2:** Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3 (ethyl 2-bromoacetate).\n\n3.  **Reaction 3: Formation of Product 3**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Br-CH2-COOCH2CH3) and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-) displaces the bromide ion (Br-).\n    *   **Product 3:** NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3 (ethyl cyanoacetate).\n\n4.  **Reaction 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n    *   **Reactants:** Product 3 (NC-CH2-COOCH2CH3), excess sodium hydride (NaH, a strong base), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a sequential double alkylation leading to a cyclic product.\n        *   First, NaH deprotonates the acidic α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate.\n        *   The resulting carbanion attacks one end of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n        *   A second molecule of NaH (since it's in excess) deprotonates the α-carbon again.\n        *   The new carbanion performs an intramolecular cyclization by attacking the other end of the pentane chain, forming a stable 6-membered ring.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** The structure is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n5.  **1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n    *   The structure of Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH2CH3) group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group. This plane makes C2 equivalent to C6, and C3 equivalent to C5.\n    *   **Counting the Signals:** We count the number of chemically distinct protons, remembering that protons that are diastereotopic are not chemically equivalent, even if they are on the same carbon.\n        *   **Ethyl group (-OCH2CH3):**\n            1.  The two -CH2- protons are chemically equivalent. (1 signal)\n            2.  The three -CH3 protons are chemically equivalent. (1 signal)\n        *   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:** Due to the plane of symmetry, we only need to consider one half of the ring. Axial and equatorial protons on the same carbon are diastereotopic and thus give distinct signals.\n            3.  Protons on C2/C6: The axial protons are equivalent to each other, and the equatorial protons are equivalent to each other, but the axial set is distinct from the equatorial set. (2 signals)\n            4.  Protons on C3/C5: Same logic as C2/C6. (2 signals)\n            5.  Protons on C4: The axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic and lie on the symmetry plane, making them distinct from each other. (2 signals)\n    *   **Total Signals:** 2 (from ethyl group) + 2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) + 2 (from C4) = 8 signals.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nmr_signals():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function outlines the step-by-step analysis to determine the number of 1H NMR signals for the final product.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Identify the final product structure.\n    # The reaction sequence is:\n    # 1.
