    "Of course, I can help with that chemistry calculation. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Calculate the Stoichiometric Volume:** First, I will determine the moles of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, from its given mass (0.1 g). To do this, I'll calculate its molar mass.\n2.  **Determine Moles of Acid:** Based on the balanced chemical equation for the dissolution reaction (`Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺ -> Fe³⁺ + 3H₂O`), I will find the number of moles of strong acid (H⁺) required to react completely with the Fe(OH)₃.\n3.  **Calculate Acid Volume:** Using the moles of acid needed and its concentration (0.1 M), I will calculate the minimum volume of the acid required in cm³. This should correspond to one of the options.\n4.  **Calculate Final pH:** After the reaction, the Fe(OH)₃ is converted to Fe³⁺ ions in a total volume of 100 cm³. These Fe³⁺ ions hydrolyze water, producing H⁺ and making the solution acidic. A good approximation for this scenario, which leads to one of the answers, is to assume the final concentration of H⁺ is equal to the concentration of the Fe³⁺ ions formed. I will calculate the pH based on this concentration.\n5.  **Compare and Conclude:** Finally, I will compare the calculated volume and pH to the given options to find the correct answer.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculations:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define initial values and constants\nmass_feoh3 = 0.1  # in grams\nconc_acid = 0.1  # in M (mol/L)\ntotal_volume_L = 100 / 1000  # in Liters\n\n# Molar masses in g/mol\nM_Fe = 55.845\nM_O = 15.999\nM_H = 1.008\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the molar mass and moles of Fe(OH)3\nmolar_mass_feoh3 = M_Fe + 3 * (M_O + M_H)\nmoles_feoh3 = mass_feoh3 / molar_mass_feoh3\n\n# Step 3: Use stoichiometry to find the moles of H+ needed for the reaction\n# Reaction: Fe(OH)3(s) + 3H+(aq) -> Fe^3+(aq) + 3H2O(l)\n# The ratio is 1 mole of Fe(OH)3 to 3 moles of H+.\nmoles_h_needed = 3 * moles_feoh3\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the minimum volume of the strong acid\nvolume_acid_L = moles_h_needed / conc_acid\nvolume_acid_cm3 = volume_acid_L * 1000\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the pH of the resulting solution\n# After reaction, the moles of Fe(OH)3 are converted to moles of Fe^3+.\n# Calculate the concentration of Fe^3+ in the final 100 cm3 solution.\nconc_fe3 = moles_feoh3 / total_volume_L\n\n# The Fe^3+ ion hydrolyzes in water, making the solution acidic.\n# The intended simplification for this problem is likely that [H+] ≈ [Fe^3+].\n# pH = -log10([H+])\nph = -math.log10(conc_fe3)\n\n# Step 6: Print the results to compare with the given options\nprint(\"Calculated Minimum Volume of Acid: {:.2f} cm^3\".format(volume_acid_cm3))\nprint(\"Calculated pH of the Resulting Solution: {:.2f}\".format(ph))\nprint(\"\\nComparing these results to the options:\")\nprint(\"A) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3\")\nprint(\"B) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3\")\nprint(\"C) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3\")\nprint(\"D) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated values (Volume ≈ 28.07 cm^3, pH ≈ 2.03) match option B most closely.\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>"
