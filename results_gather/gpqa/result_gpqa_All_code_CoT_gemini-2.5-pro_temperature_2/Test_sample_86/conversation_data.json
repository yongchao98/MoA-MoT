    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct compound and its corresponding 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Information:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This is a benzene ring (C6) with two other chemical groups (substituents) attached to it.\n    *   **8 carbon atoms in total:** The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, so the two substituents together must contain 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **FTIR indicates a carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents must contain a C=O double bond.\n    *   **FTIR indicates an aromatic-halogen bond:** A halogen atom (like Cl, Br, or I) is directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure:**\n    *   We have a halogen (-X) as one substituent on the benzene ring.\n    *   The second substituent must contain the remaining two carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. The most common and stable arrangement for this is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   Combining these pieces gives us a **haloacetophenone** molecule. The structure consists of a benzene ring with a halogen substituent and an acetyl substituent. This structure has 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 8 carbon atoms, a carbonyl group, and an aromatic-halogen bond, satisfying all given conditions.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Substitution Pattern and Expected 1H NMR:**\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring can be *ortho* (1,2-), *meta* (1,3-), or *para* (1,4-). The pattern of the signals in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum tells us which isomer it is.\n    *   The compound is **4-haloacetophenone** (para-substituted). Due to the symmetry of the para-isomer, the 4 protons on the benzene ring are divided into two sets of two equivalent protons. These two sets are adjacent to each other, so they split each other into two doublets. We expect to see two signals, each a doublet (`d`), and each integrating to two protons (`2H`).\n    *   The acetyl group (-COCH3) contains a methyl group (-CH3). Since this methyl group is not adjacent to any other protons, its signal will be a singlet (`s`) and will integrate to three protons (`3H`). Its chemical shift is typically around 2.3-2.6 ppm.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the NMR Data Options:**\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s):**\n        *   This spectrum shows two doublets in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm), each for 2 protons. This is the classic signature of a **para-substituted** benzene ring.\n        *   It also shows a singlet for 3 protons at 2.3 ppm, which is characteristic of the methyl group in an acetyl substituent.\n        *   This data perfectly matches the expected spectrum for 4-haloacetophenone.\n\n    *   **B) & C) 1H NMR:** These options lack the required signals in the 7-8 ppm aromatic proton region and are therefore incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR:** This option has a signal at 9.9 ppm, which indicates an aldehyde, not a ketone. Furthermore, the splitting patterns described are inconsistent with the proposed aldehyde structure.\n\n**Conclusion:** The only NMR data that matches the described compound (a para-substituted haloacetophenone) is option A.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Step 1: Define the problem information.\ncompound_info = {\n    'Total Carbons': 8,\n    'Core Structure': 'Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring',\n    'FTIR Peaks': ['Carbonyl (C=O)', 'Aromatic-Halogen Bond']\n}\n\n# Step 2: Propose the most likely structure based on the info.\n# Aromatic ring = 6 carbons. This leaves 2 carbons for the substituents.\n# Carbonyl (C=O) + 2 carbons -> Acetyl group (-COCH3) is the most likely.\n# Other substituent is a Halogen (-X).\n# Therefore, the compound is a haloacetophenone.\nstructure = \"Haloacetophenone\"\n\n# Step 3: Analyze the NMR options based on the proposed structure.\n# The structure is an aromatic ring with two different groups. Let's analyze the symmetry and expected signals for the para-isomer (4-haloacetophenone).\n# 4-haloacetophenone has a plane of symmetry.\n# Protons on the aromatic ring: 4 protons, split into two sets of two equivalent protons.\n# Each set is adjacent to the other, so they will appear as two doublets. Expected: two signals, each a doublet (d), each for 2H.\n# Protons on the acetyl group: 3 protons on the methyl. No adjacent protons, so it will be a singlet (s) for 3H.\nexpected_signals = \"Aromatic: Two doublets (2H each).
