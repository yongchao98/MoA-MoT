    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Define the State Vector and Operator**: The spin state is given by the unnormalized vector `|ψ⟩ = (3i, 4)`. The spin operator in the y-direction is `S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y`, where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant and `σ_y` is the Pauli matrix for spin-y.\n\n2.  **Recall the Expectation Value Formula**: The expectation value `⟨A⟩` of an operator `A` for a quantum state `|ψ⟩` is calculated as `⟨A⟩ = ⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩ / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩`. This formula is used for both normalized and unnormalized states.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Denominator `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`**: This is the inner product of the state vector with itself. For `|ψ⟩ = (c1, c2)`, `⟨ψ|` is the conjugate transpose `(c1*, c2*)`. So, `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = c1* * c1 + c2* * c2`.\n    *   `|ψ⟩ = (3i, 4)`\n    *   `⟨ψ| = (-3i, 4)`\n    *   `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = -9(i²) + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Numerator `⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩`**: This involves matrix-vector multiplication. We can pull the constant `ħ/2` out.\n    *   First, we calculate `σ_y|ψ⟩`:\n        `σ_y|ψ⟩ = [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [[3i], [4]] = [[-4i], [3i²]] = [[-4i], [-3]]`\n    *   Next, we calculate `⟨ψ|(σ_y|ψ⟩)`:\n        `⟨ψ|(σ_y|ψ⟩) = [-3i, 4] * [[-4i], [-3]] = (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) = 12i² - 12 = -12 - 12 = -24`.\n    *   Therefore, `⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * (-24) = -12ħ`.\n\n5.  **Compute the Final Expectation Value**:\n    *   `⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-12ħ) / 25`.\n\n6.  **Match with Options**: The calculated value `-12ħ/25` corresponds to option D.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations numerically.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Define the unnormalized spin state vector |psi> and the Pauli matrix sigma_y.\n# Note: In Python, the imaginary unit 'i' is represented as '1j'.\npsi = np.array([3j, 4], dtype=complex)\nsigma_y = np.array([[0, -1j], \n                    [1j,  0]], dtype=complex)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the numerator for the expectation value, <psi|sigma_y|psi>.\n# This is done by applying the operator to the ket (sigma_y @ psi)\n# and then taking the inner product with the bra <psi| (np.vdot).\n# np.vdot(a, b) computes the dot product of a.conj() and b, which is equivalent to <a|b>.\nnumerator = np.vdot(psi, np.dot(sigma_y, psi))\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the denominator, <psi|psi>, which is the squared norm of the state vector.\ndenominator = np.vdot(psi, psi)\n\n# Step 4: The expectation value of S_y is (hbar/2) * <sigma_y>.\n# We calculate the numerical coefficient of hbar.\n# <sigma_y> = numerator / denominator\n# The full expectation value is <S_y> = (hbar/2) * (numerator / denominator)\n# Note: The result of numerator and denominator should be real numbers for a physical observable.\ncoefficient = (numerator.real / denominator.real) / 2\n\n# Step 5: Print the results and find the correct option.\nprint(\"An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.\")\nprint(\"The options are:\")\nprint(\"A) -25*hbar/2\")\nprint(\"B) 25*hbar/2\")\nprint(\"C) 12*hbar/25\")\nprint(\"D) -12*hbar/25\")\nprint(\"\\n--- Calculation ---\")\nprint(f\"The spin state is |ψ> = {psi}\")\nprint(f\"The numerator <ψ|S_y|ψ> is proportional to <ψ|σ_y|ψ> = {numerator.real:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"The denominator <ψ|ψ> = {denominator.real:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"The expectation value <S_y> = (ħ/2) * ({numerator.real:.2f} / {denominator.real:.2f}) = {coefficient:.2f} * ħ\")\nprint(f\"This is equivalent to -12*hbar/25.\")\nprint(\"Therefore, the correct option is D.\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>"
