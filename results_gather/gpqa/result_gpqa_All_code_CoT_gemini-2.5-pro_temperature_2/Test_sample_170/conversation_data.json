    "To arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield, we need to analyze the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring during electrophilic substitution.\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Classify Substituents:** Each substituent is classified based on its directing effect (ortho/para vs. meta director).\n    *   **Ortho/para directors** guide the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. These are typically activating groups (like alkyl groups) or halogens.\n    *   **Meta directors** guide the incoming electrophile to the meta position. These are typically deactivating groups with double or triple bonds to an electronegative atom.\n2.  **Group the Substances:** We can separate the substances into two groups: those that will produce a significant amount of para-isomer (ortho/para directors) and those that will produce very little (meta directors). The meta-directing substances will have the lowest para-isomer yields.\n    *   **Meta Directors (very low para yield):** -NO2 (4), -COOC2H5 (2), -COOH (6).\n    *   **Ortho/Para Directors (high para yield):** -CH3 (1), -C2H5 (5), -Cl (3).\n3.  **Order within the Meta-Director Group:** All these substances produce very low amounts of the para-isomer. The strongest deactivating group, -NO2 (nitro), is the most strongly meta-directing and will result in the lowest para yield. The other two, -COOH and -COOC2H5, are also strongly meta-directing. We can place them after -NO2. So the sequence starts with substance 4, followed by 2 and 6 in some order.\n4.  **Order within the Ortho/Para-Director Group:** For these substances, the yield of the para-isomer relative to the ortho-isomer is primarily influenced by **steric hindrance**. A bulkier substituent group will physically block the ortho positions, making the para position more accessible.\n    *   The steric bulk of the substituents increases in the order: -Cl < -CH3 < -C2H5.\n    *   Therefore, the yield of the para-isomer increases in the same order: Chlorobenzene (3) < Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5).\n5.  **Combine the Orders:** By combining the two groups, we get the final sequence. The meta directors (4, 2, 6) come first, followed by the ortho/para directors in their determined order (3, 1, 5). This leads to the final order: `4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this logic to find the correct order.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem of ordering aromatic compounds by their para-isomer yield\n    in electrophilic bromination.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Define substances and their properties.\n    # We assign a 'para_rank' based on chemical principles.
