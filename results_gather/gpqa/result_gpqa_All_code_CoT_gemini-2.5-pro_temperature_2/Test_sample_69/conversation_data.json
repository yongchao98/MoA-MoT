    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to solve this chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Four Reactions:** My goal is to identify compound E and then determine its molecular symmetry. To do this, I must first identify the other unknown compounds (A, B, C, D, F, G, H).\n\n2.  **Start with the simplest reaction (Reaction 4):**\n    *   `D (gas) + B (gas) -> H (solvent)` in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   I need two common gases that react 1:1 to form a common solvent.\n    *   A very strong candidate is Carbon Monoxide (CO) and Chlorine (Cl₂).\n    *   `CO(g) + Cl₂(g) -> COCl₂(l/g)` (Phosgene).\n    *   Phosgene is indeed used as a solvent and is formed in a 1:1 ratio. It's also a gas at standard temperature but is easily condensed into a liquid. This seems like a very good fit.\n    *   So, let's hypothesize:\n        *   **B = Cl₂ (Chlorine)**\n        *   **D = CO (Carbon Monoxide)**\n        *   **H = COCl₂ (Phosgene)**\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 3 (Hydrolysis):**\n    *   `C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid while G is a weak acid.`\n    *   Since C is formed from A and B (Cl₂), it must be a chloride compound. The hydrolysis of a chloride typically produces Hydrochloric acid (HCl).\n    *   **F = HCl** (a strong acid). This fits the description.\n    *   The reaction also produces a weak acid, G. Where does it come from? A simple hydrolysis `(elemental chloride + water)` usually produces only one acid. The clue \"reforms A\" is crucial. It suggests that C might be an adduct or a complex where A is a stable component that is released. The reaction `Cl₂ + H₂O ⇌ HCl + HClO` shows that chlorine itself can hydrolyze to give a strong acid (HCl) and a weak acid (Hypochlorous acid, HClO).\n    *   This suggests C might be a complex containing A and elemental chlorine, like an adduct: **C = A·(Cl₂)ₓ**.\n    *   The hydrolysis would then be: `A·(Cl₂)ₓ + xH₂O -> A + xHCl (F) + xHClO (G)`. This perfectly matches the description: A is reformed, F is a strong acid, and G is a weak acid.\n\n4.  **Analyze Reaction 1 (Formation of C):**\n    *   `solid A + 8 equivalents of gas B (Cl₂) forms bright red product C.`\n    *   Based on our findings from step 3, this reaction is: `A(s) + 8Cl₂(g) -> A·(8Cl₂)(s)`.\n    *   So, **C = A·(8Cl₂)₂**, which is described as a \"bright red product\". While such clathrate/adduct compounds are not extremely common, this model provides a consistent explanation for the regeneration of A and the formation of two different acids.\n\n5.  **Analyze Reaction 2 (Formation of E):**\n    *   `C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D (CO), it produces the extremely hazardous product E.`\n    *   The reaction is: `A·(8Cl₂) + 2CO -> E`.\n    *   The most plausible reaction is that the guest molecules (Cl₂) react with the added carbon monoxide (CO). The well-known reaction is `CO + Cl₂ -> COCl₂`.\n    *   Let's see if the stoichiometry fits: `2CO + 2Cl₂ -> 2COCl₂`. Our reaction provides 8 Cl₂ molecules and 2 CO molecules. The reaction can proceed, consuming 2 of the 8 Cl₂ molecules.\n    *   So, the reaction could be: `A·(8Cl₂) + 2CO -> A·(6Cl₂) + 2COCl₂`.\n    *   The question states it \"produces the extremely hazardous product E\". Thus, **E = COCl₂ (Phosgene)**.\n    *   Phosgene is notoriously hazardous; it was used as a chemical weapon in WWI. This identification is very strong.\n\n6.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E:**\n    *   Now I need to find the molecular symmetry group for **E = COCl₂** (Phosgene).\n    *   The molecule has a central carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms. Its shape is trigonal planar.\n    *   Let's check for symmetry elements:\n        *   **C₂ axis:** Yes, one C₂ rotational axis passes through the C=O double bond.\n        *   **Mirror planes (σ):** Yes, there are two. One is the plane of the molecule itself (σᵥ). The second is perpendicular to the molecular plane, containing the C₂ axis (σᵥ').\n    *   A molecule with one C₂ axis and two perpendicular mirror planes containing that axis belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\n7.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n    *   The point group for E (Phosgene, COCl₂) is C₂v.\n    *   This corresponds to option C.\n\n```python\n# The chemical puzzle describes a series of reactions to identify an unknown compound E.\n# Step 1: Identify B, D, and H from reaction 4.\n# D(gas) + B(gas) -> H(solvent) in a 1:1 ratio.\n# This strongly suggests CO(g) + Cl2(g) -> COCl2(l), where Phosgene (COCl2) is the solvent H.\n# So, B = Cl2, D = CO, H = COCl2.\n\n# Step 2: Analyze the hydrolysis of C from reaction 3.\n# C + H2O -> A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).\n# Since B is Cl2, F is likely HCl (strong acid).\n# The formation of a second, weak acid (G) and the regeneration of A suggests C is an adduct.\n# The reaction Cl2 + H2O -> HCl + HClO fits the acid description (HClO is a weak acid).\n# This implies C is an adduct of A and Cl2, like A·(Cl2)x.\n\n# Step 3: Analyze the formation of C from reaction 1.\n# A(s) + 8B(g) -> C. This means C = A·(8Cl2).\n# C is described as a \"bright red product\".\n\n# Step 4: Identify E from reaction 2.\n# C + 2D -> E (extremely hazardous).\n# A·(8Cl2) + 2CO -> E.\n# The most likely reaction is between the guest chlorine and the added carbon monoxide:\n# 2Cl2 + 2CO -> 2COCl2.\n# This identifies the extremely hazardous product E as Phosgene, COCl2.\n\n# Step 5: Determine the molecular symmetry of E (COCl2).\n# Phosgene has a trigonal planar geometry.\n# It has one C2 rotation axis.\n# It has two vertical mirror planes (one in the plane of the molecule, one perpendicular to it).\n# A molecule with a C2 axis and two vertical mirror planes belongs to the C2v point group.\n\n# Choices are:\n# A) C2\n# B) D∞h\n# C) C2v\n# D) D4h\n\n# The molecular symmetry group of E (Phosgene, COCl2) is C2v.\nchoice = 'C'\n\nprint(f\"The identity of the extremely hazardous product E is likely Phosgene (COCl₂).\")\nprint(f\"The molecular geometry of COCl₂ is trigonal planar.\")\nprint(f\"Its symmetry elements are a C₂ axis and two perpendicular mirror planes (σv).\")\nprint(f\"This corresponds to the C₂v point group.\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, the correct choice is {choice}.\")\nprint(f\"<<<{choice}>>>\")\n```"
