    "My plan is to analyze the provided experimental data (NMR and LC-MS) and evaluate each of the four choices against these facts.\n\n1.  **Analyze the NMR Data:** The key observation is two distinct peaks for a single proton, with equal integrals summing to one. This indicates the proton exists in two different chemical environments in a 1:1 ratio. Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, these two environments must belong to two different, but very similar, molecules.\n2.  **Analyze the LC-MS Data:** The LC shows two separable compounds, again in a 1:1 ratio (equal intensities). The MS shows that both separated compounds have the identical mass, and this mass matches the expected product. This confirms we have a mixture of two isomers, not an impurity of a different chemical formula.\n3.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   **A) Enantiomers:** Standard NMR and LC cannot distinguish between or separate enantiomers. This option is inconsistent with the data.\n    *   **B) Diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers have different physical properties. They would give different signals in an NMR spectrum and would be separated by LC, resulting in two peaks. As isomers, they have the same mass. This is perfectly consistent with all observations. A common source of such diastereomers in peptides is the presence of *cis/trans* isomers (rotamers) due to the high barrier of rotation around the amide bond.\n    *   **C) Precursor Contamination:** A precursor would have a different molecular weight, which is contradicted by the mass spectrometry data showing both peaks have the same, expected mass.\n    *   **D) Double Coupling:** This is a term for a synthetic procedure and does not describe a stable isomeric product. It wouldn't lead to two stable species with the same mass.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The only explanation that fits all the data is a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Store original stdout\noriginal_stdout = sys.stdout\n# Redirect stdout to a string buffer\nsys.stdout = captured_output = io.StringIO()\n\ndef analyze_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function walks through the logic to solve the chemistry puzzle\n    by evaluating each option against the provided experimental data.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the observations from the problem description\n    observations = {\n        \"NMR_1\": \"Two peaks for one alpha-proton.\",\n        \"NMR_2\": \"Peaks have roughly equal integrals, summing to 1H.\",\n        \"NMR_3\": \"Spin-spin coupling is ruled out as the cause.\",\n        \"LCMS_1\": \"LC at elevated temp shows two clearly defined peaks of equal intensities.\",\n        \"LCMS_2\": \"Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, matching the expected molecule.\"\n    }\n\n    # Define the choices\n    choices = {\n        \"A\": \"The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers\",\n        \"B\": \"The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers\",\n        \"C\": \"The compound is contaminated with a precursor\",\n        \"D\": \"'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the provided experimental data.\")\n    print(f\" - From NMR, we see two distinct species in a 1:1 ratio ({observations['NMR_1']}, {observations['NMR_2']}).\")\n    print(f\" - From LC-MS, we can physically separate these two species, and they have the same molecular weight ({observations['LCMS_1']}, {observations['LCMS_2']}).\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Evaluating each option against the data.\\n\")\n\n    # Evaluation\n    print(\"--- Evaluation of Option A ---\")\n    print(f\"Choice: {choices['A']}\")\n    print(\"Reasoning: Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are mirror images.
