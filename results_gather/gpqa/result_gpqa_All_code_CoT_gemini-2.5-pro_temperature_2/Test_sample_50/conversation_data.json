    "To solve this problem, we will use the principles of electrostatics, specifically the **Method of Images**.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical System and Method**: The system consists of a point charge `q` and a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`. The charge is a distance `d` from the sphere's center. The grounded sphere implies its surface potential is zero. The \"Method of Images\" is the standard technique for this configuration.\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images**: We can replace the sphere with an \"image charge\" `q'` at a position `b` inside the sphere. The values of `q'` and `b` are chosen to perfectly replicate the electric field outside the sphere and maintain the zero potential on the spherical surface.\n    *   The image charge has a magnitude `q' = -q * (R/d)`.\n    *   It is located at a distance `b = R^2/d` from the center.\n3.  **Calculate the Potential Energy**: The potential energy `U` of the system is the work required to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d`. As `q` is brought in, it does work against the attractive force from the induced charges on the sphere's surface (which is the same as the force from the image charge `q'`).\n4.  **Derive the Formula**: We must integrate the force on charge `q` as it moves from infinity to `d`. The force at any position `x` is `F(x) = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`. The potential energy `U` is the negative integral of this force: `U = - ∫[∞, d] F(x) dx`.\n5.  **Final Result**: Performing the integration yields the formula: `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. A key detail is the factor of `1/2`, which arises because the induced charge is not a fixed source but changes as the real charge `q` moves.\n6.  **Select the Correct Option**: We will compare this derived formula with the given choices to find the match.\n\nThe Python code below will walk through these steps and identify the correct answer from the provided list.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_electrostatics_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the physics problem of a charge near a grounded\n    conducting sphere, derives the potential energy formula, and selects\n    the correct option from a given list.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Explanation and Derivation ---\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis to find the potential energy:\")\n    print(\"1.
