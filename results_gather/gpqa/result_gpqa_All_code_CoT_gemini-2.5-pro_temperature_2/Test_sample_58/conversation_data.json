    "To determine the pH of the final solution, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate Initial Moles:** We'll first calculate the number of moles of each reactant (CH3COOH, HCl, and Ba(OH)2) by multiplying their molarity by their volume in liters.\n2.  **Dissociation:** We will determine the moles of H+ ions from the strong acid (HCl) and OH- ions from the strong base (Ba(OH)2). Note that Ba(OH)2 releases two moles of OH- for every one mole of the compound. CH3COOH is a weak acid and its initial dissociation is negligible in the presence of a strong acid.\n3.  **Strong Acid-Base Neutralization:** The H+ ions from HCl will react with the OH- ions from Ba(OH)2 in a 1:1 ratio. We will calculate which one is in excess.\n4.  **Reaction with Weak Acid:** The excess substance from the previous step (in this case, OH-) will then react with the weak acid (CH3COOH). We will determine the final amount of reactants and products.\n5.  **Final pH Calculation:** After all reactions, the solution contains a significant amount of unreacted strong base (OH-). The pH will be determined by the concentration of this excess OH-. We'll calculate the final volume, the concentration of OH-, the pOH, and finally, the pH.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1 & 2: Calculate initial moles of H+, OH-, and CH3COOH\n# Moles = Molarity * Volume (in L)\n\n# For CH3COOH (weak acid)\nvol_ch3cooh = 0.500  # 500 mL in L\nconc_ch3cooh = 0.1   # M\nmoles_ch3cooh = conc_ch3cooh * vol_ch3cooh\n\n# For HCl (strong acid) -> H+\nvol_hcl = 0.400      # 400 mL in L\nconc_hcl = 0.2       # M\nmoles_h_strong = conc_hcl * vol_hcl\n\n# For Ba(OH)2 (strong base) -> 2 OH-\nvol_baoh2 = 0.300    # 300 mL in L\nconc_baoh2 = 0.3     # M\n# Note: 1 mole of Ba(OH)2 produces 2 moles of OH-\nmoles_oh_strong = conc_baoh2 * vol_baoh2 * 2\n\nprint(f\"Initial moles of CH3COOH: {moles_ch3cooh:.4f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Initial moles of H+ (from HCl): {moles_h_strong:.4f} mol\")\nprint(f\"Initial moles of OH- (from Ba(OH)2): {moles_oh_strong:.4f} mol\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 3: Strong acid-base neutralization (H+ + OH- -> H2O)\nmoles_oh_after_hcl_reaction = moles_oh_strong - moles_h_strong\nprint(f\"Moles of OH- after reacting with strong acid: {moles_oh_after_hcl_reaction:.4f} mol\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 4: Reaction of excess strong base (OH-) with weak acid (CH3COOH)\n# CH3COOH + OH- -> CH3COO- + H2O\nif moles_oh_after_hcl_reaction > moles_ch3cooh:\n    # All weak acid is consumed, and strong base (OH-) remains.\n    final_moles_oh = moles_oh_after_hcl_reaction - moles_ch3cooh\nelse:\n    # This case does not apply here, but if OH- was limiting, a buffer would form.\n    final_moles_oh = 0\n\nprint(f\"Final moles of excess OH- after reacting with weak acid: {final_moles_oh:.4f} mol\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 5: Final pH calculation\n# Calculate total volume\ntotal_volume = vol_ch3cooh + vol_hcl + vol_baoh2\n\n# Calculate the final concentration of OH-\nfinal_conc_oh = final_moles_oh / total_volume\n\n# Calculate pOH and then pH\npOH = -math.log10(final_conc_oh)\npH = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"Total Volume: {total_volume:.2f} L\")\nprint(f\"Final [OH-]: {final_conc_oh:.4f} M\")\nprint(f\"pOH: {pOH:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Final pH: {pH:.2f}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Print the choices and the final answer\nprint(\"A) 8.68\")\nprint(\"B) 1.38\")\nprint(\"C) 8.92\")\nprint(\"D) 12.62\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated pH is 12.62, which corresponds to choice D.\")\n```\n<<<D>>>"
