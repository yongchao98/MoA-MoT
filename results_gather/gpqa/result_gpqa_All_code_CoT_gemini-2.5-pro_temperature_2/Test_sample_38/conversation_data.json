    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Wave Function and Probability Density**: The wave function `ψ(x)` describes the state of a particle. The probability of finding that particle at a specific position `x` is related to the square of the modulus of the wave function, `|ψ(x)|^2`, which is called the probability density function.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Probability Density**: The wave function is given as a complex number `ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i`.\n    *   The real part is `Re(ψ) = a / sqrt(1 + x)`.\n    *   The imaginary part is `Im(ψ) = -0.5`.\n    *   The squared modulus is `|ψ(x)|^2 = (Re(ψ))^2 + (Im(ψ))^2`.\n    *   Substituting the parts, we get `|ψ(x)|^2 = (a / sqrt(1 + x))^2 + (-0.5)^2 = a^2 / (1 + x) + 0.25`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Normalization Condition**: The total probability of finding the particle anywhere it can exist must be equal to 1. This is the normalization principle. Mathematically, it means the integral of the probability density function over the allowed range is 1.\n    *   The problem states the particle is only found between `x=1` and `x=3`. So, our integration limits are from 1 to 3.\n    *   The normalization equation is: `∫[from 1 to 3] (a^2 / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1`.\n\n4.  **Solve the Integral**: We need to solve the definite integral and then solve for `a`.\n    *   `∫ (a^2 / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = a^2 * ln(1 + x) + 0.25*x`.\n    *   Evaluating this from `x=1` to `x=3`:\n        `[a^2 * ln(1+3) + 0.25*3] - [a^2 * ln(1+1) + 0.25*1]`\n        `= (a^2 * ln(4) + 0.75) - (a^2 * ln(2) + 0.25)`\n        `= a^2 * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.5`\n    *   Using the logarithm property `ln(b) - ln(c) = ln(b/c)`:\n        `= a^2 * ln(4/2) + 0.5 = a^2 * ln(2) + 0.5`.\n\n5.  **Solve for \"a\"**: Now we set the result of the integral equal to 1:\n    *   `a^2 * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1`\n    *   `a^2 * ln(2) = 0.5`\n    *   `a^2 = 0.5 / ln(2)`\n    *   `a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Numerical Value**: Finally, we'll use Python to compute the numerical value of `a` and compare it to the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 5 from the plan: We have the expression for 'a'.\n# a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))\n\n# Step 6: Calculate the numerical value\n# We use the math library for the square root (sqrt) and natural logarithm (log) functions.\nln_2 = math.log(2)\na_squared = 0.5 / ln_2\na = math.sqrt(a_squared)\n\n# The available options\noptions = {'A': 0.6, 'B': 0.35, 'C': 0.85, 'D': 1.1}\nbest_option = ''\nsmallest_difference = float('inf')\n\n# Find the closest option to our calculated value\nfor key, value in options.items():\n    difference = abs(a - value)\n    if difference < smallest_difference:\n        smallest_difference = difference\n        best_option = key\n\nprint(f\"The calculated value for 'a' is: {a:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"The options are: A) 0.6, B) 0.35, C) 0.85, D) 1.1\")\nprint(f\"The closest option is {best_option}, which has a value of {options[best_option]}.\")\n\n# The final answer in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{best_option}>>>\")\n\n```"
