    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the stereochemical outcome of each reaction and then understand how standard and chiral HPLC separates the resulting mixture of products.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, then H₃O⁺**\n    *   The reactant is (E)-oct-4-ene, a *trans*-alkene which is symmetrical.\n    *   The sequence of mCPBA followed by aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) results in *anti*-dihydroxylation (addition of two -OH groups across the double bond, one from above and one from below the original plane of the alkene).\n    *   A rule of thumb for this type of reaction is that an *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene produces a *meso* compound.\n    *   Let's verify: Epoxidation of the trans-alkene gives a racemic mixture of two trans-epoxides. Acid-catalyzed opening of each epoxide via backside attack by water leads to the *same* meso product, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, which has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Product of Reaction 1:** One single compound, a *meso*-diol.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, then H₃O⁺**\n    *   The reactant is (Z)-oct-4-ene, a *cis*-alkene which is symmetrical.\n    *   This is also an *anti*-dihydroxylation reaction.\n    *   The rule of thumb here is that an *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene produces a *racemic mixture* (a 50/50 mixture of two enantiomers).\n    *   Let's verify: Epoxidation of the cis-alkene gives a single meso-epoxide. Acid-catalyzed backside attack by water at the two equivalent carbons produces a 50:50 mixture of the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol. These two molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other (enantiomers).\n    *   **Products of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of two enantiomers.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n    *   The chemist combines the product from Reaction 1 (the *meso*-diol) and the products from Reaction 2 (the pair of enantiomers).\n    *   The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n        *   Isomer A: *meso*-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Isomer B: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Isomer C: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   Note that Isomer A is a *diastereomer* of Isomers B and C. Isomers B and C are *enantiomers* of each other.\n\n4.  **Predict HPLC Chromatograms**\n    *   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:** This technique separates compounds based on physical properties like polarity but cannot distinguish between enantiomers. Enantiomers (like Isomers B and C) have identical properties in an achiral environment and will co-elute as a single peak. Diastereomers (like Isomer A vs. Isomers B/C) have different properties and will be separated.\n        *   Peak 1: *meso*-diol (Isomer A)\n        *   Peak 2: The unresolved enantiomers (Isomers B + C)\n        *   **Total peaks in standard HPLC = 2**\n\n    *   **Chiral HPLC:** This technique uses a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It will separate all stereoisomers in the mixture.\n        *   Peak 1: *meso*-diol (Isomer A)\n        *   Peak 2: One enantiomer (e.g., Isomer B)\n        *   Peak 3: The other enantiomer (e.g., Isomer C)\n        *   **Total peaks in chiral HPLC = 3**\n\n**Conclusion:** The chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_hplc_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the products of two chemical reactions and determines\n    the number of peaks observed in standard and chiral HPLC chromatograms.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Analysis Summary\n    analysis_text = \"\"\"\nStep 1: Reaction 1 Analysis\nReactant: (E)-oct-4-ene (trans-alkene)\nReaction: Anti-dihydroxylation (mCPBA, then H3O+)\nProduct: A single meso compound (meso-octane-4,5-diol).\nStereochemical rule: trans-alkene + anti-addition -> meso compound.\n\nStep 2: Reaction 2 Analysis\nReactant: (Z)-oct-4-ene (cis-alkene)\nReaction: Anti-dihydroxylation (mCPBA, then H3O+)\nProduct: A racemic mixture of two enantiomers ((4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol).\nStereochemical rule: cis-alkene + anti-addition -> racemic mixture.\n\nStep 3: Combined Product Mixture\nThe final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.
