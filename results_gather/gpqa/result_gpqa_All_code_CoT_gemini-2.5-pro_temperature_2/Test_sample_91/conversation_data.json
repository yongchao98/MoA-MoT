    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Determine the Molecular Formula and Molar Mass:**\n    First, we'll determine the molecular formula of the compound `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2` by counting the number of carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms.\n    *   Carbon atoms: 2*(CH3) + C + CH + CH2 + CH + CH3 + CH2 + CH + C + 2*(CH3) = 12 Carbons.\n    *   Hydrogen atoms: 2*3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 2*3 = 22 Hydrogens.\n    *   Molecular Formula: `C12H22`.\n    *   Molar Mass: (12 * 12 g/mol) + (22 * 1 g/mol) = 166 g/mol.\n\n2.  **Count the Bonds in the Molecule:**\n    We need to count the number of C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds in one molecule.\n    *   **C=C bonds:** The structure clearly shows two double bonds: `C=C`. So, there are 2 `C=C` bonds.\n    *   **C-H bonds:** The number of hydrogen atoms is 22, so there are 22 `C-H` bonds.\n    *   **C-C bonds:** For a non-cyclic hydrocarbon, the total number of carbon-carbon bonds (single and double) is `(number of C atoms) - 1`. Here, it is `12 - 1 = 11`. Since there are 2 `C=C` bonds, the number of `C-C` single bonds is `11 - 2 = 9`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Enthalpy of Formation Formula:**\n    The enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) is calculated using the following formula, based on bond energies and enthalpies of atomization:\n    ΔHf = (Sum of enthalpies of atomization of reactants) - (Sum of bond energies of the product)\n\n4.  **Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants:**\n    The formation reaction is: `12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) -> C12H22(g)`.\n    The energy required to break the reactants into gaseous atoms is:\n    *   For 12 moles of Carbon (C(s) -> C(g)): `12 * (Enthalpy of atomization of C)`\n    *   For 11 moles of Hydrogen (H2(g) -> 2H(g)): `11 * (Bond energy of H-H)`\n    *   Total reactant enthalpy = `(12 * 1000) + (11 * 100)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Sum of Bond Energies of the Product:**\n    The energy released when forming one mole of the product `C12H22` from its gaseous atoms is the sum of all its bond energies:\n    *   Total product bond energy = `(9 * BE_C-C) + (2 * BE_C=C) + (22 * BE_C-H)`\n    *   = `(9 * 200) + (2 * 300) + (22 * 400)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf) in kJ/mol:**\n    Subtract the product's bond energy sum from the reactants' atomization enthalpy sum.\n\n7.  **Convert to kJ/g and Compare with Options:**\n    The final step is to convert the calculated enthalpy of formation from kJ/mol to kJ/g using the molar mass and compare the result with the given options.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the given energy values\nenthalpy_atomization_C = 1000  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_H_H = 100  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_C_C = 200  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_C_C_double = 300  # kJ/mol\nbond_energy_C_H = 400  # kJ/mol\n\n# Step 2: Define the composition and structure of the molecule C12H22\nnum_C = 12\nnum_H = 22\nnum_C_C_double_bonds = 2\n# For a non-cyclic molecule, total C-C framework bonds = num_C - 1\nnum_C_C_single_bonds = (num_C - 1) - num_C_C_double_bonds\nnum_C_H_bonds = num_H\n# The formation reaction involves num_C of C(s) and num_H/2 of H2(g)\nnum_H2_molecules = num_H / 2\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the total enthalpy required to atomize the reactants\n# Reactants are 12 C(s) and 11 H2(g)\ntotal_reactant_atomization_enthalpy = (num_C * enthalpy_atomization_C) + (num_H2_molecules * bond_energy_H_H)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the total bond energy of the product molecule\ntotal_product_bond_energy = (num_C_C_single_bonds * bond_energy_C_C) + \\\n                              (num_C_C_double_bonds * bond_energy_C_C_double) + \\\n                              (num_C_H_bonds * bond_energy_C_H)\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol\nenthalpy_formation_per_mol = total_reactant_atomization_enthalpy - total_product_bond_energy\n\n# Step 6: Calculate the molar mass of C12H22\nmolar_mass_C = 12  # g/mol\nmolar_mass_H = 1  # g/mol\nmolar_mass_molecule = (num_C * molar_mass_C) + (num_H * molar_mass_H)\n\n# Step 7: Convert the enthalpy of formation to kJ/g\nenthalpy_formation_per_gram = enthalpy_formation_per_mol / molar_mass_molecule\n\n# Step 8: Display the results and compare with the given options\nprint(f\"The molecular formula is C{num_C}H{num_H}.\")\nprint(f\"Number of C-C bonds: {num_C_C_single_bonds}\")\nprint(f\"Number of C=C bonds: {num_C_C_double_bonds}\")\nprint(f\"Number of C-H bonds: {num_C_H_bonds}\\n\")\n\nprint(f\"Enthalpy for atomizing reactants = {total_reactant_atomization_enthalpy} kJ\")\nprint(f\"Total bond energy of the product = {total_product_bond_energy} kJ/mol\\n\")\n\nprint(f\"Calculated Enthalpy of Formation = {enthalpy_formation_per_mol} kJ/mol\")\nprint(f\"Calculated Enthalpy of Formation = {enthalpy_formation_per_gram:.2f} kJ/g\\n\")\n\nprint(\"Comparing with the options:\")\nprint(f\"A) {enthalpy_formation_per_gram:.2f} kJ/g\")\nprint(f\"B) The calculated value is 1900 kJ/mol, not kJ/g.\")\nprint(f\"C) This option is 67.4 kJ/mol, which does not match.\")\nprint(f\"D) This value {total_product_bond_energy} kJ/mol corresponds to the total bond energy of the product, not the enthalpy of formation.\")\nprint(\"\\nConclusion: Option A matches our calculation.\")\n\n<<<A>>>"
