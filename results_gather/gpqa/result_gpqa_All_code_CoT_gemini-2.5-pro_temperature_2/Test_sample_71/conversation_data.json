    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Reaction Sequence**: I will analyze each step of the synthesis to understand the transformation and determine the structure of the intermediate and final products.\n\n    *   **Step 1: Product 1 Formation**. The reaction involves 7-(tert-butoxy)norbornadiene, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, and NaI. The dibromo compound with NaI is known to generate a highly reactive species. In this context, it will form 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene *in situ*. This molecule is a conjugated triene and will act as a diene in a Diels-Alder reaction with the norbornadiene derivative, which acts as the dienophile. Norbornadiene has two double bonds. The problem states \"2 equivalents\" of the dibromo compound are used, suggesting both double bonds of the norbornadiene could react. However, this would lead to a product that is unlikely to undergo the specified final reaction cleanly. A more plausible path for these types of problems is a mono-addition followed by an intramolecular reaction. Therefore, I will assume Product 1 is the result of one Diels-Alder reaction, leaving one double bond on the norbornane framework and a diene system on the newly attached group.\n\n    *   **Step 2: Product 2 Formation**. Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid. This is a standard condition for the acid-catalyzed cleavage of a tert-butyl ether protecting group. The `tBu-O-` group is converted into a hydroxyl (`HO-`) group. Product 2 is the same as Product 1, but with an alcohol at the C7 position.\n\n    *   **Step 3: Product 3 Formation**. Product 2 (the alcohol) is treated with SO3/pyridine/DMSO. This is a Parikh-Doering oxidation, which is a mild method to oxidize a secondary alcohol to a ketone. Product 3 will therefore have a carbonyl group (`C=O`) at the C7 position of the norbornane skeleton.\n\n    *   **Step 4: Product 4 Formation**. Product 3 is heated to 150 °C. For a complex Diels-Alder adduct like Product 3, heating typically induces a pericyclic reaction. There are two main possibilities:\n        a)  **Retro-Diels-Alder**: This would break Product 3 back into its constituents: 7-ketonorbornadiene and the diene from step 1. The 7-ketonorbornadiene is known to be unstable at this temperature and would extrude carbon monoxide (CO) to form stable benzene. This pathway leads to multiple products, and it's hard to justify what \"final product 4\" would be, and none of the simple options (like benzene or rearranged diene isomers) fit the multiple-choice answers for the number of distinct hydrogens.\n        b)  **Intramolecular Diels-Alder**: Product 3 contains both a diene (the cyclohexadiene part of the adduct) and a dienophile (the remaining double bond on the norbornene skeleton). It is highly likely that heating will cause these two parts to react with each other, forming a single, complex, polycyclic cage molecule. This is Product 4. This route yields a single major product as implied by the question.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure and Symmetry of Product 4**: Product 4 is the result of the intramolecular Diels-Alder reaction. The key to counting the number of chemically distinct hydrogens is to analyze the molecule's symmetry. The reaction pathway suggests that a plane of symmetry is maintained throughout. This plane passes through C1, C4, and C7 of the original norbornane.\n\n3.  **Count the Chemically Distinct Hydrogens**: Using the plane of symmetry, I can group equivalent hydrogens. Hydrogens that are on the plane are unique unless another symmetry element makes them equivalent. Hydrogens not on the plane exist in pairs, reflected across the plane.\n\n    *   **On the symmetry plane**: H at C1 and H at C4. These two are in different environments relative to the rest of the complex cage. So, they are distinct. (2 signals)\n    *   **Equivalent Pairs**:\n        *   H on C2 and H on C3 are a symmetric pair. (1 signal)\n        *   H on C5 and H on C6 are a symmetric pair. (1 signal)\n        *   The two CH₂ \"linker\" groups from the initial adduct are a symmetric pair. Within each CH₂, the two protons are diastereotopic (non-equivalent). So these four protons give two signals. (2 signals)\n        *   In the part that was the cyclohexadiene, the two CH groups that are now saturated (were at the ends of the diene) form a symmetric pair. (1 signal)\n        *   Similarly, the two CH groups that are now on a double bond (were in the middle of the diene) form a symmetric pair. (1 signal)\n\n4.  **Final Calculation**: Adding up the distinct sets of hydrogens: 2 (from H1, H4) + 1 (from H2/H3 pair) + 1 (from H5/H6 pair) + 2 (from the four CH₂ linker protons) + 1 (from the new saturated CH pair) + 1 (from the new vinyl CH pair) = 8.\n\nTherefore, there are 8 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product 4.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1. Understand the reaction sequence to propose a structure for the final product, \"4\".\n#    - Step 1: Diels-Alder reaction to form product 1. A mono-adduct is assumed.\n#    - Step 2: Deprotection of tert-butyl ether to an alcohol (product 2).\n#    - Step 3: Oxidation of the alcohol to a ketone (product 3).\n#    - Step 4: An intramolecular Diels-Alder reaction upon heating to form the final caged product 4.\n# 2. Analyze the symmetry of the final product 4. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry.\n# 3. Count the number of sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms based on this symmetry.\n\n# Detailed count of distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4:\n# The molecule has a plane of symmetry running through the C1-C4 axis and the C7-carbonyl group of the original norbornane skeleton.\n# We count the unique protons by considering this symmetry.\n\n# - Protons on the plane of symmetry:\n#   - H attached to C1: This bridgehead proton is unique. (Signal 1)\n#   - H attached to C4: This bridgehead proton is in a different environment from H1, so it is also unique. (Signal 2)\n\n# - Protons existing in symmetric pairs (reflected across the plane):\n#   - H's on C2 and C3: These are equivalent. (Signal 3)\n#   - H's on C5 and C6 (part of the intramolecular dienophile): These are equivalent. (Signal 4)\n#   - H's on the two linker CH2 groups: The two groups are equivalent. The two protons on each group are diastereotopic (non-equivalent). So, these 4 protons result in two signals. (Signal 5 and Signal 6)\n#   - H's from the reacted cyclohexadiene (intramolecular diene): The two H's on the newly formed saturated carbons are equivalent. (Signal 7)\n#   - H's from the reacted cyclohexadiene: The two H's on the newly formed double bond are equivalent. (Signal 8)\n\n# Total number of distinct hydrogen signals = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 8.\n\nfinal_count = 8\nprint(f\"The number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product 4 is {final_count}.\")\n# Based on the analysis, the correct option corresponds to the number 8.\n\n# Options:\n# A) 4\n# B) 10\n# C) 8\n# D) 7\nprint(\"The correct option is C.\")\n\n```\n<<<C>>>"
