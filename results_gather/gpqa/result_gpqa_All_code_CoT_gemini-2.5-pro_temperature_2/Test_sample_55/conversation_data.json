    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the correct transition route and its probability.\n\n**1. Understanding Electric Dipole Transitions**\n\nThe decay of an excited atomic state primarily occurs through the emission of photons, governed by electric dipole transitions. The rules that determine whether a transition between an initial state |n, l, m⟩ and a final state |n', l', m'⟩ is \"allowed\" are called selection rules:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, **Δl = l' - l**, must be **±1**.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number, **Δm = m' - m**, must be **0** or **±1**.\n*   The change in the principal quantum number, **Δn = n' - n**, can be any integer, but for emission (decay), n' < n.\n\n**2. Analyzing the First Transition: |3,0,0⟩ → intermediate state**\n\n*   **Initial state:** |i⟩ = |3, 0, 0⟩ (n=3, l=0, m=0).\n*   Applying the selection rules for the intermediate state |k⟩ = |n<sub>k</sub>, l<sub>k</sub>, m<sub>k</sub>⟩:\n    *   Δl = l<sub>k</sub> - l<sub>i</sub> = l<sub>k</sub> - 0 = ±1  =>  **l<sub>k</sub> = 1**.\n    *   Δm = m<sub>k</sub> - m<sub>i</sub> = m<sub>k</sub> - 0 = 0, ±1  =>  **m<sub>k</sub> ∈ {-1, 0, 1}**.\n    *   n<sub>k</sub> < 3. The options suggest n<sub>k</sub> = 2.\n*   Thus, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩. All routes presented in the options (A, B, D) use one of these valid intermediate states.\n\n**3. Analyzing the Second Transition: intermediate state → |1,0,0⟩**\n\n*   **Final state:** |f⟩ = |1, 0, 0⟩ (n=1, l=0, m=0).\n*   Let's check the transition from each possible intermediate state |k⟩ = |2, 1, m<sub>k</sub>⟩:\n    *   Δl = l<sub>f</sub> - l<sub>k</sub> = 0 - 1 = **-1**. This is allowed.\n    *   Δm = m<sub>f</sub> - m<sub>k</sub> = 0 - m<sub>k</sub>. Since m<sub>k</sub> can be -1, 0, or 1, Δm can be 1, 0, or -1 respectively. This is also allowed.\n*   Conclusion: All three proposed cascade routes, via |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, or |2,1,1⟩, are allowed by the selection rules.\n\n**4. Determining the Probability**\n\nThe \"probability\" of a specific decay route corresponds to the branching ratio for that channel.\nThe process is:\n|3,0,0⟩ → emits photon 1 → |2,1,m<sub>k</sub>⟩ → emits photon 2 → |1,0,0⟩.\n\n*   **Step 1 Probability (Branching Ratio):** The initial state |3,0,0⟩ is a '3s' state, which is spherically symmetric (l=0). Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the decay must populate each of the available magnetic sublevels (m<sub>k</sub> = -1, 0, 1) of the |2,1⟩ ('2p') state with equal probability. Since there are three such sublevels, the total transition rate is split equally among them.\n    *   Probability of transitioning to |2,1,-1⟩ = 1/3\n    *   Probability of transitioning to |2,1,0⟩ = 1/3\n    *   Probability of transitioning to |2,1,1⟩ = 1/3\n\n*   **Step 2 Probability:** Once the atom is in an intermediate state |2,1,m<sub>k</sub>⟩, it must decay to a lower energy state. The only state reachable via an electric dipole transition is the |1,0,0⟩ state (as Δl must be -1, leading to l=0). Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1 (or 100%).\n\n*   **Total Probability:** The total probability for a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n    *   P(route via |2,1,0⟩) = P(step 1 is to |2,1,0⟩) × P(step 2) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3.\n    *   P(route via |2,1,1⟩) = P(step 1 is to |2,1,1⟩) × P(step 2) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3.\n    *   P(route via |2,1,-1⟩) = P(step 1 is to |2,1,-1⟩) × P(step 2) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3.\n\n**5. Comparing with Options**\n\nNow we evaluate the given options based on our findings:\n*   A) Route: |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩. Probability: 1/3. This matches our calculation.\n*   B) Route: |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩. Probability: 1/4. The probability is incorrect.\n*   C) Route: →|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩. Probability: 2/3. The probability is incorrect.\n*   D) Route: |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩. Probability: 1/4. The probability is incorrect.\n\nOnly option A is fully consistent with the principles of quantum mechanics.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Define quantum states and symbols for clarity in the output\n# Using strings for LaTeX formatting\nstate_300 = r'|3,0,0\\rangle'\nstate_210 = r'|2,1,0\\rangle'\nstate_211 = r'|2,1,1\\rangle'\nstate_21m1 = r'|2,1,-1\\rangle'\nstate_100 = r'|1,0,0\\rangle'\n\n# Options provided in the problem\noptions = {\n    'A': f\"{state_300} \\\\rightarrow {state_210} \\\\rightarrow {state_100} \\t and \\t {sympy.latex(sympy.S(1)/3)}\",\n    'B': f\"{state_300} \\\\rightarrow {state_211} \\\\rightarrow {state_100} \\t and \\t {sympy.latex(sympy.S(1)/4)}\",\n    'C': f\"\\\\rangle \\\\rightarrow {state_210} \\\\rightarrow {state_100} \\t and \\t {sympy.latex(sympy.S(2)/3)}\", # Original had a typo\n    'D': f\"{state_300} \\\\rightarrow {state_21m1} \\\\rightarrow {state_100} \\t and \\t {sympy.latex(sympy.S(1)/4)}\",\n}\n\n# The determined correct choice based on physics principles\ncorrect_choice = 'A'\n\n# Print the analysis and the final answer\nprint(\"Analysis of the H-atom decay cascade:\")\nprint(\"-\" * 40)\nprint(\"1.
