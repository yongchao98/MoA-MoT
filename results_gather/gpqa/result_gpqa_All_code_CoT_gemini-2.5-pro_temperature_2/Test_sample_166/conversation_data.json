    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Simplify the State:** The problem provides the state `|psi> =( cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> )/ N`. With the given `phi = -pi/4`, we have `cos(-pi/4) = 1/sqrt(2)` and `sin(-pi/4) = -1/sqrt(2)`. The state simplifies to the \"odd Schrödinger cat state,\" which is proportional to `|alpha> - |-alpha>`.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Non-Gaussianity Formula:** The non-Gaussianity (`nG`) is given by `del_b = trace(rho*ln(rho)) - trace(tau*ln(tau))`. Since `S(x) = -trace(x*ln(x))` is the von Neumann entropy, this can be written as `nG = S(tau) - S(rho)`. The state `rho` is a pure state (`rho = |psi><psi|`), and the entropy of any pure state is zero. Thus, `S(rho) = 0`, and the formula simplifies to `nG = S(tau)`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Reference State `tau`:** The state `tau` is a reference Gaussian state. A common approach in these problems is to use a thermal state as the reference. A thermal state is Gaussian, and its entropy is determined solely by its average photon number, `n`. We will assume `tau` is a thermal state with the same average photon number as `rho`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Average Photon Number `n`:** For the odd cat state, the average photon number `n = <psi|a†a|psi>` is given by the formula `n = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2)`, where `coth` is the hyperbolic cotangent. We will calculate this value using `alpha = 0.5`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Entropy `S(tau)`:** The entropy of a thermal state with an average photon number `n` is `S(tau) = (n+1)ln(n+1) - nln(n)`. We will compute this value to find the non-Gaussianity.\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:** Finally, we will compare our calculated result with the given choices to find the closest match.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Define the given parameters.\nalpha = 0.5\nphi = -np.pi / 4 # This defines the state as an odd Schrödinger cat state.\n\n# Step 2: The non-Gaussianity (nG) simplifies to the entropy of the reference Gaussian state tau.\n# nG = S(tau) - S(rho)\n# For our pure state |psi>, the density matrix rho has entropy S(rho) = 0.\n# So, nG = S(tau).\n\n# Step 3: Assume the reference state 'tau' is a thermal state.\n# We choose a thermal state with the same average photon number 'n' as our state rho.\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the average photon number 'n' for the odd cat state.\n# The formula is n = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2).\nalpha_sq = alpha**2\n# Hyperbolic cotangent coth(x) is 1/tanh(x).\nmean_photon_number_n = alpha_sq / np.tanh(alpha_sq)\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the entropy of the thermal state 'tau'.\n# The von Neumann entropy for a thermal state is S = (n+1)ln(n+1) - n*ln(n).\n# np.log is the natural logarithm (ln).\nnG = (mean_photon_number_n + 1) * np.log(mean_photon_number_n + 1) - mean_photon_number_n * np.log(mean_photon_number_n)\n\n# Step 6: Print the result and compare with the options.\nprint(\"Calculated Non-Gaussianity (nG):\", nG)\nprint(\"Option A:\", 0)\nprint(\"Option B:\", 2.48)\nprint(\"Option C:\", 0.25)\nprint(\"Option D:\", 1.38)\nprint(\"The calculated value is closest to option D.\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>"
