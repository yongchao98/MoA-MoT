  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n\nA) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1\nB) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\nC) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nD) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>",

    "Based on the experimental data, we can deduce the genetic pathway and the roles of the genes G1, G2, and G3. Here is a step-by-step plan to analyze the results:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Role of G2:** I will first examine the phenotypes of the `g2` single mutant and the double mutants involving `g2` (`g1g2` and `g2g3`). This will help determine if G2 is epistatic (i.e., its phenotype masks the phenotype of other genes), which is a key indicator of an upstream gene in a pathway, such as a transcription factor.\n2.  **Analyze the Relationship between G1 and G3:** Next, I will look at the phenotypes of the `g1` and `g3` single mutants compared to the `g1g3` double mutant. This will reveal their interaction. Specifically, I'll check for epistasis between them or for a synergistic relationship (where the double mutant's effect is greater than the sum of the single mutants' effects), which suggests gene redundancy.\n3.  **Evaluate All Options:** Using the conclusions from the first two steps, I will evaluate each multiple-choice option to find the one that best fits the evidence. The final conclusion will be selected based on the option that is most consistent with the genetic analysis.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_gene_interaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes genetic interaction data to determine the relationship between G1, G2, and G3.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Resistance data from the experiment\n    resistance = {\n        'g1': 75,\n        'g2': 0,\n        'g3': 50,\n        'g1g2': 0,\n        'g1g3': 10,\n        'g2g3': 0,\n    }\n\n    print(\"--- Analysis of Gene Interactions ---\")\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze G2's role\n    print(\"\\nAnalyzing the role of G2...\")\n    is_g2_epistatic = (resistance['g2'] == resistance['g1g2']) and \\\n                     (resistance['g2'] == resistance['g2g3'])\n    \n    if is_g2_epistatic:\n        print(f\"The g2 mutant phenotype (0% resistance) is identical to the g1g2 and g2g3 double mutants.\")\n        print(\"This means G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, indicating it likely acts upstream in the pathway.\")\n        print(\"Conclusion 1: G2 is the transcription factor.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Could not confirm G2's upstream role via epistasis.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze G1 and G3's relationship\n    print(\"\\nAnalyzing the relationship between G1 and G3...\")\n    \n    # Check for epistasis between G1 and G3\n    is_g1g3_epistatic = (resistance['g1g3'] == resistance['g1']) or \\\n                        (resistance['g1g3'] == resistance['g3'])\n\n    if not is_g1g3_epistatic:\n        print(f\"The g1g3 double mutant ({resistance['g1g3']}%) has a novel phenotype, different from g1 ({resistance['g1']}%) and g3 ({resistance['g3']}%).\")\n        print(\"This rules out epistasis between G1 and G3.\")\n        \n        # Check for synergy (indicating redundancy)\n        loss_g1 = 100 - resistance['g1']\n        loss_g3 = 100 - resistance['g3']\n        expected_additive_loss = loss_g1 + loss_g3\n        observed_combined_loss = 100 - resistance['g1g3']\n\n        print(f\"Expected combined resistance loss from single mutants: {expected_additive_loss}%.\")\n        print(f\"Observed resistance loss from double mutant: {observed_combined_loss}%.\")\n        \n        if observed_combined_loss > expected_additive_loss:\n            print(\"The combined loss is greater than the sum of individual losses.
