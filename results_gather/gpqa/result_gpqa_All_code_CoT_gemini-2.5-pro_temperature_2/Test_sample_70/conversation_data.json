    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n\n1.  **Identify the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital distance.** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance (a) from its star, assuming constant stellar luminosity and planetary albedo. This can be written as:\n    T_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n\n2.  **Relate orbital distance to orbital period.** According to Kepler's Third Law, the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its orbital distance (a). This is expressed as:\n    P² ∝ a³\n    From this, we can derive that the orbital distance is proportional to the orbital period to the power of 2/3:\n    a ∝ P^(2/3)\n\n3.  **Combine the relationships to find the link between temperature and period.** By substituting the expression for 'a' from step 2 into the temperature relation from step 1, we get:\n    T_eq ∝ 1 / √(P^(2/3))\n    This simplifies to:\n    T_eq ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)\n\n4.  **Calculate the ratio of the temperatures.** We need to find the ratio of the temperature of Planet_4 (T4) to that of Planet_2 (T2). Using the relationship from step 3:\n    T4 / T2 = (P4)^(-1/3) / (P2)^(-1/3) = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)\n\n5.  **Use the given orbital period ratios.** The problem states the orbital period ratios for Planet_1 to Planet_5 are 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Therefore, we can set P2 = 2 and P4 = 3.5.\n\n6.  **Compute the final value.** Substitute these values into the ratio equation:\n    Ratio = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Orbital period ratios for Planet_2 and Planet_4\nP2 = 2.0\nP4 = 3.5\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T4/T2 is (P2/P4)^(1/3)\ntemperature_ratio = (P2 / P4)**(1/3)\n\n# Print the result and compare with the options\nprint(f\"The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (Planet_4 / Planet_2) is: {temperature_ratio:.2f}\")\nprint(\"Comparing this with the options:\")\nprint(f\"A) ~0.57\")\nprint(f\"B) ~0.69\")\nprint(f\"C) ~0.83\")\nprint(f\"D) ~0.75\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value is closest to option C.\")\n```\n<<<C>>>"
