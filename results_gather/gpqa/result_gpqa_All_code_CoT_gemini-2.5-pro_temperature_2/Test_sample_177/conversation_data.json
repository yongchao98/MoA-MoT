    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the Lagrangian Density**: The total Lagrangian density `L` of any theory must have a mass dimension of 4, i.e., `[L] = M⁴`. This is because the action `S = ∫ d⁴x L` is dimensionless, and the spacetime volume element `d⁴x` has a mass dimension of `M⁻⁴`. Therefore, any term in the Lagrangian, including the interaction term `L_int`, must have `[L_int] = M⁴`.\n\n2.  **Determine Mass Dimensions of Fields**: I will determine the mass dimension of each component in the interaction term `L_int = κ * ψ̄ * σ_μν * ψ * F^μν`.\n    *   **Fermion Field (ψ)**: The kinetic term for a fermion is `L_fermion = ψ̄(iγ^μ∂_μ - m)ψ`. Since `[L] = M⁴` and `[∂_μ] = M¹`, we can deduce that `[ψ̄ψ] = M³`. As `ψ` and `ψ̄` have the same dimension, we get `[ψ] = M^(3/2)`.\n    *   **Electromagnetic Field Strength (F^μν)**: The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is `L_EM = -1/4 * F_μν * F^μν`. For this to have a dimension of `M⁴`, we must have `[F_μν]² = M⁴`, which means `[F_μν] = M²`.\n    *   **σ_μν**: This is defined as a commutator of gamma matrices, `σ_μν = (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]`. Since the gamma matrices `γ_μ` are dimensionless matrices, `σ_μν` is also dimensionless, so `[σ_μν] = M⁰`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Mass Dimension of κ**: I will set up the dimensional equation for the interaction term:\n    `[L_int] = [κ] * [ψ̄] * [σ_μν] * [ψ] * [F^μν] = M⁴`\n    I will then substitute the known dimensions and solve for `[κ]`.\n\n4.  **Determine Renormalizability**: The renormalizability of an interaction is determined by the mass dimension of its coupling constant.\n    *   If `[coupling] > 0`, the theory is super-renormalizable.\n    *   If `[coupling] = 0`, the theory is renormalizable.\n    *   If `[coupling] < 0`, the theory is non-renormalizable.\n    Based on the calculated dimension of `κ`, I will determine if the theory is renormalizable.\n\n5.  **Select the Correct Option**: Finally, I will compare my findings with the given options to select the correct answer.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the known mass dimensions in natural units (M=1).\n# The Lagrangian density [L] must have a mass dimension of 4.\ndim_L = 4\n\n# Step 2: Determine the mass dimension of the fields from their kinetic terms.\n# Fermion kinetic term L_fermion ~ ψ̄(iγ^μ∂_μ)ψ implies [ψ̄ψ∂] = 4.\n# Since [∂] = 1, we have [ψ̄ψ] = 3.
