    "Here is my step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula**\nThe molecular formula is C9H11NO2. First, let's calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to understand the number of rings and/or double bonds.\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\nA DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (accounting for 1 degree), likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1:** The presence of two medium-to-strong intensity bands in this region (3300-3500 cm-1) is a classic indicator of a primary amine (-NH2) group, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches.\n*   **1720 cm-1:** A strong band in this region (1670-1780 cm-1) points to a carbonyl (C=O) group. The specific frequency is consistent with an ester, especially one conjugated with a benzene ring.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum**\nLet's break down each signal:\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-). This suggests an ethyl group fragment (-CH2CH3).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3-). This confirms the ethyl group. Its downfield chemical shift (~4.5 ppm) indicates it's attached to an electronegative atom, most likely an oxygen (as in an -O-CH2-CH3 fragment). This piece, combined with the C=O from the IR, strongly suggests an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons is characteristic of the two protons of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadness is due to quadrupole relaxation and exchange. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, indicates a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two substituents have opposing electronic effects. One is electron-donating (like -NH2), which shifts the ortho protons upfield (~7.0 ppm). The other is electron-withdrawing (like an ester group), which shifts its ortho protons downfield (~8.0 ppm).\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the structure and evaluate the options**\nPutting all the pieces together:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n*   One substituent is a primary amine (-NH2).\n*   The other substituent is an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n\nThis leads to the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Now let's check this against the given options.\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: The ethyl group is not attached to an oxygen atom. Incorrect.\n*   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is meta-substituted, which would not give two doublets in the NMR. Also, it's an amide, and the NH2 protons would have a different chemical shift. Incorrect.\n*   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This has a secondary amine (-NH-), which would show only one proton in the NMR signal and only one N-H stretch in the IR. Incorrect.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectroscopic evidence: the primary amine, the ethyl ester, and the para-substituted aromatic ring. The formula C9H11NO2 is also correct.\n\nThe code below will print the step-by-step reasoning and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef identify_compound():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes spectroscopic data to identify a chemical compound and prints the reasoning.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the Molecular Formula and IR Data\")\n    print(\"-------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2\")\n    print(\"Degree of Unsaturation = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.
