    "This problem requires an understanding of the reactivity of enols with halogens. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the major product:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:** The reactant is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. This molecule contains an enol functional group, which consists of a carbon-carbon double bond (ene) with an alcohol group (-OH) attached to one of the carbons of the double bond. Enols are generally unstable and exist in equilibrium with their more stable keto tautomers.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reagent:** The reagent is bromine (Br2). Bromine is an electrophile and readily reacts with electron-rich species like the double bond of the enol.\n\n3.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   An enol's double bond is highly electron-rich due to the lone pairs on the adjacent oxygen atom, making it more reactive than a simple alkene.\n    *   The pi electrons of the enol's double bond will attack one of the bromine atoms in the Br2 molecule, causing the Br-Br bond to break.\n    *   A bromine atom will attach to the carbon that is *not* bearing the -OH group (the alpha-carbon, which is C2 in this case). This creates a carbocation intermediate that is stabilized by resonance with the lone pairs on the oxygen atom.\n    *   This resonant intermediate is essentially a protonated α-bromo ketone.\n    *   In the final step, a base (like the Br⁻ ion generated in the previous step) will deprotonate the oxygen atom.\n    *   This sequence of steps results in the formation of an α-bromo ketone. The double bond is gone, the enol's -OH group has become a carbonyl group (C=O), and a bromine atom is attached to the adjacent (alpha) carbon.\n\n4.  **Identify the Product:**\n    *   Starting Material: 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. The enol group is at C1 (-OH) and C2.\n    *   The reaction will form a ketone at C1 and add a bromine atom at the alpha-position, C2.\n    *   The dimethyl groups at C4 remain unchanged.\n    *   Therefore, the final product is 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone: Incorrect. Bromination occurs at the alpha-carbon (C2), not C4.\n    *   B) & D) (1R,2R)/(1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol: Incorrect. This would be the product of simple electrophilic addition, but the enol's reactivity favors the formation of the highly stable carbonyl group in the α-bromo ketone, making this the major outcome.\n    *   C) 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone: Correct. This is the α-bromo ketone resulting from the reaction of the enol with bromine.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine\n    and identifies the major product.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Introduction ---\n    print(\"Reaction Analysis: 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol + Bromine (Br2)\\n\")\n\n    # --- Reactant Information ---\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the Reactants\")\n    print(\"  - Starting Material: 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol.\")\n    print(\"    This is an enol, containing a reactive C=C double bond adjacent to an -OH group.\")\n    print(\"  - Reagent: Bromine (Br2).\")\n    print(\"    This is a halogen that acts as an electrophile.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Reaction Mechanism ---\n    print(\"Step 2: Determine the Reaction Mechanism\")\n    print(\"  - Enols are electron-rich and react rapidly with halogens like Br2.\")\n    print(\"  - The reaction is not a simple addition across the double bond like in a typical alkene.\")\n    print(\"  - Instead, the enol undergoes a reaction that results in an alpha-haloketone.\")\n    print(\"  - Mechanism steps:\")\n    print(\"    1.
