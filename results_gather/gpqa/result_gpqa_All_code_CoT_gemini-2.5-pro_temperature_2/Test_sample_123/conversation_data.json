    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** The problem involves radioactive decay and special relativity's time dilation. The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive to travel a distance `R` is given by the formula `f = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)`, where `t_lab` is the travel time in the lab frame and `τ_lab` is the particle's lifetime in the lab frame.\n2.  **Formulate Equations:**\n    *   The travel time in the lab is `t_lab = R / v`. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. So, `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n    *   Time dilation tells us that the particle's lifetime in the lab frame is dilated by the Lorentz factor, `γ`. So, `τ_lab = γ * τ_0`, where `τ_0` is the particle's proper lifetime (its lifetime in its own rest frame).\n    *   Substituting these into the decay formula gives: `f = exp(- (R/c) / (γ * τ_0) ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ_0))`.\n3.  **Set up a Ratio:** The term `R / (c * τ_0)` is a constant for this experiment, as the detector radius and the particle's proper lifetime do not change. We can rearrange the equation by taking the natural logarithm: `ln(f) = -R / (γ * c * τ_0)`, or `γ * ln(1/f) = R / (c * τ_0)`.\n4.  **Solve for the new Lorentz Factor (`γ_2`):**\n    *   We have two scenarios:\n        1.  `γ_1 * ln(1/f_1) = R / (c * τ_0)`\n        2.  `γ_2 * ln(1/f_2) = R / (c * τ_0)`\n    *   Since the right side is the same for both, we can set them equal: `γ_1 * ln(1/f_1) = γ_2 * ln(1/f_2)`.\n    *   We can now solve for `γ_2`: `γ_2 = γ_1 * ln(1/f_1) / ln(1/f_2)`.\n5.  **Calculate:** I will use Python to plug in the given values (`γ_1 = 20`, `f_1 = 1/3`, `f_2 = 2/3`) and calculate the value of `γ_2`. Finally, I will compare the result with the given options to find the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given values from the problem ---\n# Initial Lorentz factor\ngamma_1 = 20.0\n# Initial fraction of particles reaching the detector\nf_1 = 1/3\n# Desired fraction of particles reaching the detector\nf_2 = 2/3\n\n# --- Derivation ---\n# The fraction of surviving particles f is given by f = exp(-t_lab / tau_lab)\n# where t_lab is the time in the lab frame and tau_lab is the dilated lifetime.\n# t_lab = R / c (R=radius, c=speed of light)\n# tau_lab = gamma * tau_0 (gamma=Lorentz factor, tau_0=proper lifetime)\n# So, f = exp(-R / (gamma * c * tau_0))\n# Taking the natural log: ln(f) = -R / (gamma * c * tau_0)\n# Rearranging: gamma * -ln(f) = R / (c * tau_0)\n# Or: gamma * ln(1/f) = R / (c * tau_0)\n\n# The right side is a constant. Therefore, for two scenarios:\n# gamma_1 * ln(1/f_1) = gamma_2 * ln(1/f_2)\n# We can solve for gamma_2:\n# gamma_2 = gamma_1 * ln(1/f_1) / ln(1/f_2)\n\n# --- Calculation ---\ngamma_2 = gamma_1 * math.log(1/f_1) / math.log(1/f_2)\n\n# --- Output the result ---\nprint(\"Given Options:\")\nprint(\"A) 28\")\nprint(\"B) 40\")\nprint(\"C) 68\")\nprint(\"D) 54\")\nprint(\"\\nCalculation:\")\nprint(f\"The initial Lorentz factor (gamma_1) is: {gamma_1}\")\nprint(f\"The initial fraction of survivors (f_1) is: {f_1:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"The desired fraction of survivors (f_2) is: {f_2:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"The calculated new Lorentz factor (gamma_2) is: {gamma_2:.2f}\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value is approximately 54, which corresponds to option D.\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>"
