    "This problem requires the application of the relativistic velocity addition formula, which describes how velocities combine in Einstein's theory of special relativity.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Define Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **S:** The laboratory frame, where the observer is stationary.\n    *   **S':** The rest frame of the glass, which moves at velocity `v` relative to the laboratory frame S.\n\n2.  **Identify Known Velocities:**\n    *   The velocity of the glass frame (S') relative to the lab frame (S) is `v`.\n    *   The speed of light propagating through the glass, as measured by an observer in the glass's own frame (S'), is `u'`. The index of refraction `n` is defined as `n = c/u'`, where `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum. Since `c=1` in this problem, the speed of light in the glass's frame is `u' = 1/n`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    The speed of the light beam as measured by the observer in the laboratory frame (S), which we'll call `u`, is given by Einstein's velocity addition formula:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute and Simplify:**\n    Now, we substitute the values `u' = 1/n` and `c = 1` into the formula:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + ((1/n) * v) / 1^2)`\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To simplify the complex fraction, we find a common denominator for the terms in the numerator and denominator:\n    `u = ((1 + n*v)/n) / ((n + v)/n)`\n\n    Now, we can cancel the `n` in the denominators:\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result matches option A. The following Python code uses the `sympy` library for symbolic mathematics to perform this derivation and verify the result.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# This problem requires algebraic manipulation. We can use Python's symbolic\n# mathematics library, sympy, to verify the result.\n\n# Define the symbols we will be using.\n# n: index of refraction of the glass\n# v: velocity of the glass relative to the lab\nn, v = sympy.symbols('n v')\n\n# The speed of light in a vacuum, c, is given as 1.\nc = 1\n\n# The speed of light in the glass's rest frame (u') is c/n.\nu_prime = c / n\n\n# The speed of the glass relative to the lab is v.\n\n# Apply the relativistic velocity addition formula:\n# u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v / c^2)\n# Here, u is the speed of light in the glass as seen by the lab observer.\nu_lab = (u_prime + v) / (1 + u_prime * v / c**2)\n\n# Use sympy to simplify the algebraic expression.\nsimplified_u_lab = sympy.simplify(u_lab)\n\n# Print the available choices\nprint(\"The available choices are:\")\nprint(\"A) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\")\nprint(\"B) 1\")\nprint(\"C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\")\nprint(\"D) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\n# Print the result derived from the formula.\n# Note: Sympy might order the terms differently (e.g., n*v + 1 instead of 1 + n*v),\n# but the expression is algebraically identical.\nprint(\"The derived speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is:\")\nprint(simplified_u_lab)\n```\n<<<A>>>"
