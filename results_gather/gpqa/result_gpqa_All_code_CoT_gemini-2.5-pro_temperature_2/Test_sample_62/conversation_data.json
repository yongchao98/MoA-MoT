    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Model and States:** The problem describes a diatomic molecule using the non-rigid rotor model. The energy levels are determined by both vibrational (`v`) and rotational (`J`) quantum numbers: `E_v,J = (v + 1/2)ħω + B*J*(J + 1)`.\n    *   **Initial State:** The molecule is in its fundamental (ground) state, where `v=0` and `J=0`.\n    *   **Final State:** The molecule is excited by absorbing a photon. According to quantum selection rules for rovibrational transitions, `Δv = +1` and `ΔJ = ±1`. Therefore, the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\" that can be reached from the ground state via absorption is the `v=1, J=1` state.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Transition Energy (ΔE):** The energy of the absorbed photon must be equal to the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n    *   `E_initial = E_0,0 = (1/2)ħω`\n    *   `E_final = E_1,1 = (1 + 1/2)ħω + B*1*(1+1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B`\n    *   `ΔE = E_final - E_initial = ħω + 2B`\n\n3.  **Calculate Molecular Parameters:** To find `ΔE`, we need to calculate the rotational term `2B`.\n    *   The rotational constant `B` depends on the moment of inertia `I`, where `B = ħ² / (2I)`.\n    *   The moment of inertia `I` depends on the reduced mass `μ` and the bond length `R`, where `I = μR²`.\n    *   The reduced mass `μ` is calculated from the masses of the two atoms, `μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate Photon Momentum (p):** The energy of a photon is related to its momentum by `E = pc`, where `c` is the speed of light. Therefore, the required momentum is `p = ΔE / c`.\n\n5.  **Execution:** The Python code below will perform these calculations step-by-step, starting from the given constants and parameters, to find the final momentum and compare it with the given choices.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Setup: Define constants and given parameters ---\n\n# Physical constants\nh = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck constant in J*s\nhbar = h / (2 * math.pi)  # Reduced Planck constant in J*s\nc = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\namu_to_kg = 1.660539e-27 # Conversion factor from amu to kg\nangstrom_to_m = 1e-10 # Conversion factor from angstroms to meters\n\n# Molecule parameters from the problem\nMx_amu = 20.0\nMy_amu = 2.0\nR_angstrom = 2.0\nw_rad_s = 4e14\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate the molecule's reduced mass (mu) in kg ---\nmx_kg = Mx_amu * amu_to_kg\nmy_kg = My_amu * amu_to_kg\nmu = (mx_kg * my_kg) / (mx_kg + my_kg)\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate the moment of inertia (I) ---\nR_m = R_angstrom * angstrom_to_m\nI = mu * R_m**2\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculate the total transition energy (Delta E) ---\n# The transition is from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=1).\n# The energy difference is Delta E = E(1,1) - E(0,0)\n# Delta E = [ (3/2)hbar*w + B*1*(1+1) ] - [ (1/2)hbar*w + B*0*(0+1) ]\n# Delta E = hbar*w + 2B\n# where B = hbar^2 / (2*I)\n\n# Vibrational energy contribution to the transition\nvibrational_energy = hbar * w_rad_s\n\n# Rotational energy contribution to the transition\n# This is 2B = 2 * (hbar^2 / (2*I)) = hbar^2 / I\nrotational_energy = hbar**2 / I\n\n# Total energy of the absorbed photon\ndelta_E = vibrational_energy + rotational_energy\n\n# --- Step 4: Calculate the required photon momentum (p) ---\n# For a photon, E = p*c, so p = E/c\np_photon = delta_E / c\n\n# --- Final Output ---\nprint(f\"The calculated momentum of the absorbed photon is: {p_photon:.2e} N*s\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this value to the given choices:\")\nprint(\"A) p = 1.4*10^(-28) N*s\")\nprint(\"B) p = 1.1*10^(-27) N*s\")\nprint(\"C) p = 1.9*10^(-28) N*s\")\nprint(\"D) p = 2.3*10^(-27) N*s\")\n\n<<<A>>>\n```"
