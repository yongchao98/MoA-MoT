    "My plan is to solve this problem by applying the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of atoms among various energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium.\n\nHere are the steps:\n1.  **Identify the relationship:** The ratio of the populations of two energy levels (N2/N1) is given by the Boltzmann equation: `(N2 / N1) = (g2 / g1) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`, where `ΔE` is the energy difference between the levels, `k` is the Boltzmann constant, and `T` is the temperature. The term `(g2 / g1)` represents the ratio of statistical weights, which is a constant for the given transition.\n\n2.  **Calculate the energy difference (ΔE):** The energy difference between the levels corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given wavelength (λ = 1448 Å). This can be calculated using the formula `ΔE = h * c / λ`, where `h` is Planck's constant and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n3.  **Set up the ratio of ratios:** We need to find the factor `F = (Ratio_no_spots) / (Ratio_with_spots)`.\n    *   `Ratio_no_spots` is the population ratio at T1 = 6000 K.\n    *   `Ratio_with_spots` is the population ratio at T2 = 5500 K.\n    *   The formula for the factor becomes: `F = exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) ]`. The statistical weight term `(g2/g1)` cancels out.\n\n4.  **Calculate the final value:** I will plug in the values for the constants (`h`, `c`, `k`) and the given temperatures (`T1`, `T2`) and wavelength (`λ`) into the formula to compute the factor `F`.\n\n5.  **Compare with choices:** Finally, I will compare the calculated factor with the given multiple-choice options to find the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define physical constants and given parameters\nh = 6.626e-34  # Planck's constant in J·s\nc = 3.0e8      # Speed of light in m/s\nk = 1.38e-23   # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n\n# Given parameters from the problem\nwavelength_A = 1448.0  # Wavelength in Angstroms\nT_no_spots = 6000.0    # Temperature without spots in K\nT_with_spots = 5500.0  # Temperature with spots in K\n\n# Step 2: Convert wavelength from Angstroms to meters\nwavelength_m = wavelength_A * 1e-10\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the energy difference (Delta E) between the two levels\ndelta_E = (h * c) / wavelength_m\n\n# The Boltzmann ratio for level 2 to level 1 is proportional to exp(-delta_E / (k * T))\n# We need to find the factor = Ratio(T_no_spots) / Ratio(T_with_spots)\n# Factor = exp(-delta_E / (k * T_no_spots)) / exp(-delta_E / (k * T_with_spots))\n# Factor = exp[ (-delta_E / k) * (1/T_no_spots - 1/T_with_spots) ]\n# Factor = exp[ (delta_E / k) * (1/T_with_spots - 1/T_no_spots) ]\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the final factor\nexponent_term = (delta_E / k) * (1 / T_with_spots - 1 / T_no_spots)\nfactor = math.exp(exponent_term)\n\n# Step 5: Print the results and choices for comparison\nprint(f\"The calculated energy difference (ΔE) is: {delta_E:.4e} J\")\nprint(f\"The temperature without spots is: {T_no_spots} K\")\nprint(f\"The temperature with spots is: {T_with_spots} K\")\nprint(f\"The factor by which the ratio changes is: {factor:.2f}\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\nprint(f\"A) ~2.9\")\nprint(f\"B) ~7.8\")\nprint(f\"C) ~1.1\")\nprint(f\"D) ~4.5\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated value {factor:.2f} is closest to option D.\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>"
