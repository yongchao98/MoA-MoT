    "To determine which of the organic moieties show optical isomerism, we need to analyze each structure for chirality. A molecule is chiral, and thus optically active, if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically arises from the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or from other elements of chirality like axial chirality (as in certain biphenyls).\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This is a substituted biphenyl. The rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is severely restricted by the bulky nitro (-NO2) and ester (-COOCH3) groups at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'). This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, makes the two rings non-coplanar. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is therefore chiral. Thus, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). This carbon is a chiral center, making the molecule chiral and optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. The central carbon is double-bonded to an oxygen and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. It is not bonded to four different groups, so there is no chiral center. The molecule has a plane of symmetry and is achiral. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This is the trans isomer of an alkene, with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule is planar and has a center of inversion. It is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nCompounds 1 and 2 are chiral and exhibit optical isomerism, while compounds 3 and 4 are achiral. Therefore, the correct option includes compounds 1 and 2.\n\n```python\ndef solve_isomerism_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes four organic compounds for optical isomerism and determines the correct multiple-choice answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    compounds = {\n        \"1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\": True, # Atropisomerism due to restricted rotation\n        \"2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\": True, # Has a chiral center (C2)\n        \"3. benzophenone\": False, # Achiral, has a plane of symmetry\n        \"4. dimethyl fumarate\": False # Achiral, has a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analysis of each compound for optical isomerism:\")\n    optically_active = []\n    for name, is_active in compounds.items():\n        if is_active:\n            print(f\"- {name}: Shows optical isomerism.
