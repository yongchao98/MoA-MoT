    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the relationship between impact parameter, orbit size, and inclination.** The impact parameter `b` is given by the formula `b = (a * cos(i)) / R_s`, where `a` is the semi-major axis of the orbit, `i` is the orbital inclination, and `R_s` is the stellar radius.\n\n2.  **Relate the two planets.** Since both planets orbit the same star and are in the same orbital plane, their inclination `i` is identical, and `R_s` is the same for both. We can write the formula for each planet:\n    *   Planet 1: `b1 = (a1 * cos(i)) / R_s`\n    *   Planet 2: `b2 = (a2 * cos(i)) / R_s`\n    By dividing the second equation by the first, we can find a relationship between the two planets' orbits: `b2 / b1 = a2 / a1`.\n\n3.  **Use Kepler's Third Law.** Kepler's Third Law relates the orbital period `P` to the semi-major axis `a` for objects orbiting the same star: `(P/P')^2 = (a/a')^3`. We can use this to relate the semi-major axes to the periods of our two planets: `(P2 / P1)^2 = (a2 / a1)^3`. Rearranging gives us `a2 / a1 = (P2 / P1)^(2/3)`.\n\n4.  **Combine the relationships.** We can substitute the expression from Kepler's Law into the relationship from step 2: `b2 / b1 = (P2 / P1)^(2/3)`.\n\n5.  **Determine the maximum period.** The problem asks for the maximum orbital period for the second planet that will still exhibit a transit. A transit occurs if the planet's path intersects the star's disk. The limiting case for the *center* of the planet to cross the star's disk is when the impact parameter `b2` is equal to 1. To find the maximum possible period, we set `b2 = 1`. The given radii of the planets and the star are not necessary if we use this standard definition (`b_max=1`) for a transit.\n\n6.  **Solve for P2.** We can now rearrange the equation from step 4 to solve for `P2` using `b2 = 1`, `P1 = 3` days, and `b1 = 0.2`:\n    *   `1 / b1 = (P2_max / P1)^(2/3)`\n    *   `(1 / b1)^(3/2) = P2_max / P1`\n    *   `P2_max = P1 * (1 / b1)^(3/2)`\n    Plugging in the numbers gives `P2_max = 3 * (1 / 0.2)^(3/2) = 3 * 5^1.5 â‰ˆ 33.54` days.\n\nThe following Python code will execute this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_max_period():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum orbital period of a second planet that will exhibit\n    both transit and occultation events.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Known parameters for Planet 1\n    p1 = 3.0  # Orbital period in days\n    b1 = 0.2  # Transit impact parameter\n\n    # The maximum impact parameter for Planet 2 for its center to transit is b2 = 1.\n    b2_max = 1.0\n\n    # The relationship derived from geometry and Kepler's Third Law is:\n    # P2_max = P1 * (b2_max / b1)^(3/2)\n    # Since b2_max = 1, this simplifies to P2_max = P1 * (1 / b1)^(3/2)\n\n    p2_max = p1 * (1 / b1)**(3/2)\n\n    # Print the result along with the choices\n    print(\"The maximum orbital period of the second planet is calculated to be:\")\n    print(f\"P2_max = {p2_max:.1f} days\")\n    print(\"\\nComparing this to the given options:\")\n    print(\"A) ~ 33.5\")\n    print(\"B) ~ 7.5\")\n    print(\"C) ~ 12.5\")\n    print(\"D) ~ 37.5\")\n    print(\"\\nThe calculated value most closely matches option A.\")\n\ncalculate_max_period()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
