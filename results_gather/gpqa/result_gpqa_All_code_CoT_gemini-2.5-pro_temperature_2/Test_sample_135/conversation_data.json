    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Problem:** We need to evaluate the volume integral `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV` for a sphere of radius R. The vector field `f` has a magnitude of `1/r^2` and points radially outwards.\n\n2.  **Apply the Divergence Theorem:** The Divergence Theorem is the most direct way to solve this. It states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume V is equal to the outward flux of the field through the closed surface S that bounds the volume:\n    `∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\n3.  **Define the Terms in Spherical Coordinates:**\n    *   **Vector Field `f`:** The field is radial with magnitude `1/r^2`. So, `f = (1/r^2) * r̂`, where `r̂` is the radial unit vector.\n    *   **Surface `S`:** This is the surface of the sphere, where the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`.\n    *   **Surface Element `dS`:** For a sphere, the differential surface element vector `dS` is `dS = r^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ * r̂`. On our specific surface, `r = R`, so `dS = R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ * r̂`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Dot Product `f ⋅ dS`:** We need to evaluate this on the surface `S` (where `r = R`):\n    *   `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`\n    *   `f ⋅ dS = [ (1/R^2) * r̂ ] ⋅ [ R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ * r̂ ]`\n    *   Since `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`, the dot product simplifies to: `(1/R^2) * R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ = sin(θ) * dθ * dφ`\n\n5.  **Set Up and Evaluate the Surface Integral:** Now we integrate `sin(θ)` over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for `θ` are from 0 to `π`, and for `φ` are from 0 to `2π`.\n    *   `Integral = ∫ (from φ=0 to 2π) ∫ (from θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n    *   This is a standard integral that evaluates to `4π`.\n\n6.  **Code Implementation:** We will use the `sympy` library in Python to perform this symbolic double integration to verify the result.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy import sin, pi\n\n# Define the symbols for spherical coordinates\ntheta, phi = sympy.symbols('theta phi')\n\n# According to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence\n# of a vector field f is equal to the surface integral of the field over the\n# boundary surface S.\n# ∫ (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮ (f ⋅ dS)\n# The vector field is f = (1/r^2) * r̂.\n# The surface is a sphere of radius R, where the surface element dS is\n# dS = R^2 * sin(θ) * dθ * dφ * r̂.\n# At the surface (r=R), the dot product f ⋅ dS simplifies to:\n# f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * (R^2 * sin(θ)) dθ dφ = sin(θ) dθ dφ\n# We now need to integrate this over the surface of the sphere.\n# The limits for θ (polar angle) are 0 to π.\n# The limits for φ (azimuthal angle) are 0 to 2π.\n\n# The integrand is sin(theta)\nintegrand = sin(theta)\n\n# Perform the inner integration with respect to theta\nintegral_theta = sympy.integrate(integrand, (theta, 0, pi))\n\n# Perform the outer integration with respect to phi\ntotal_integral = sympy.integrate(integral_theta, (phi, 0, 2 * pi))\n\n# The potential answers are:\nA = \"4/3 * pi * R\"\nB = 0\nC = 1\nD = 4 * pi\n\nprint(\"The problem is to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the field f(r) = (1/r^2)r̂.\")\nprint(\"Using the Divergence Theorem, this is equivalent to the flux integral ∮(f ⋅ dS) over a sphere of radius R.\")\nprint(f\"The calculation simplifies to the integral of sin(θ) dθ dφ over the sphere's surface.\")\nprint(f\"The result of the integration is: {total_integral}\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this to the options:\")\nprint(\"A) 4/3 * π * R\")\nprint(f\"B) {B}\")\nprint(f\"C) {C}\")\nprint(f\"D) {D}\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value matches option D.\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>"
