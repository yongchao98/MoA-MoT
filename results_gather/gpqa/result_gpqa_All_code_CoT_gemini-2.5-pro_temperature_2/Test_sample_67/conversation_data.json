    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Set up the quantum mechanical framework**: We will use symbolic mathematics to represent the quantum states and operators involved. The particle is a spin-1/2 system.\n2.  **Define the initial state**: The particle's magnetic moment is initially aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in the spin-up eigenstate corresponding to the `Sz` operator, denoted as `|+z>`.\n3.  **Define the new Hamiltonian**: The magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction. The interaction of the magnetic moment `mu = gamma * S` with this new field `B` is described by the Hamiltonian `H' = -mu . B = -gamma * B * Sy`, where `Sy` is the spin operator for the y-component.\n4.  **Calculate the time evolution**: The state of the system at any time `t` after the switch is given by the Schrödinger equation. The solution is `|psi(t)> = U(t) * |psi(0)>`, where `|psi(0)> = |+z>` and `U(t) = exp(-i * H' * t / hbar)` is the time evolution operator.\n5.  **Compute the expectation value**: We need to find the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is `<mu_z>(t) = <psi(t)| mu_z |psi(t)>`. Since `mu_z = gamma * Sz`, this is equivalent to `gamma * <psi(t)| Sz |psi(t)>`.\n6.  **Identify the oscillation frequency**: The resulting expression for `<mu_z>(t)` will be an oscillating function of time, typically involving a cosine term like `cos(omega * t)`. The value `omega` is the angular frequency of oscillation we are looking for. We will extract this value and compare it to the given options.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the solution.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef find_oscillation_frequency():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function symbolically calculates the oscillation frequency of a spin-1/2 particle's\n    magnetic moment when the external magnetic field is suddenly switched from the Z- to the Y-axis.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbols needed for the calculation.\n    # gamma: gyromagnetic ratio\n    # B: magnetic field strength\n    # t: time\n    # hbar: reduced Planck's constant\n    gamma, B, t, hbar = sp.symbols('gamma B t hbar', real=True, positive=True)\n\n    # In the standard (Sz) basis, the spin operators are represented by Pauli matrices.\n    # We only need Sy (for the new Hamiltonian) and Sz (for the observable).\n    # sigma_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n    # sigma_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]\n    Sy = (hbar / 2) * sp.Matrix([[0, -sp.I], [sp.I, 0]])\n    Sz = (hbar / 2) * sp.Matrix([[1, 0], [0, -1]])\n\n    # The initial state is spin-up along the Z-axis, |+z> = [1, 0]^T.\n    psi_initial = sp.Matrix([1, 0])\n\n    # The new Hamiltonian for a magnetic field B along the +Y direction is H' = -gamma * B * Sy.\n    Hamiltonian_prime = -gamma * B * Sy\n\n    # The time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i * H' * t / hbar).\n    # The exponent is A = -i * H' * t / hbar = i * gamma * B * Sy * t / hbar.\n    exponent = (sp.I * gamma * B * t / hbar) * Sy\n    \n    # We use the matrix exponential function .exp() to compute U(t).\n    # This automatically uses the identity exp(i*theta*sigma_j) = cos(theta)*I + i*sin(theta)*sigma_j\n    U_t = exponent.exp()\n    U_t = sp.simplify(U_t)\n\n    # The state at time t is |psi(t)> = U(t) * |psi(0)>.\n    psi_t = U_t * psi_initial\n\n    # The expectation value of the z-component of the spin is <Sz>(t) = <psi(t)| Sz |psi(t)>.\n    # psi_t.H is the Hermitian conjugate (conjugate transpose) of psi_t.\n    expectation_Sz = (psi_t.H * Sz * psi_t)[0] # The result is a 1x1 matrix.\n    expectation_Sz = sp.trigsimp(expectation_Sz)\n    \n    # The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is <mu_z> = gamma * <Sz>.\n    expectation_mu_z = gamma * expectation_Sz\n\n    # The result for <mu_z>(t) is an oscillating function.\n    # From the form A * cos(omega*t), we can extract the angular frequency 'omega'.\n    \n    # Let's find the argument of the cosine function in the final expression.\n    # 'atoms(sp.cos)' finds all cosine terms, and we take one of them.\n    cos_term = expectation_mu_z.atoms(sp.cos).pop()\n    phase = cos_term.args[0] # The argument of the cosine function\n\n    # The angular frequency omega is the coefficient of time 't' in the phase.\n    # We can get it by differentiating the phase with respect to time.\n    omega = sp.diff(phase, t)\n\n    # Print the options and the result.\n    print(\"The options for the oscillation frequency are:\")\n    options = {\n        'A': 'gamma*B',\n        'B': 'sqrt(2)*gamma*B',\n        'C': 'gamma*B/2',\n        'D': 'gamma*B/sqrt(2)'\n    }\n    \n    print(f\"A) {options['A']}\")\n    print(f\"B) {options['B']}\")\n    print(f\"C) {options['C']}\")\n    print(f\"D) {options['D']}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(f\"The calculated oscillation frequency is: {omega}\")\n    print(\"This corresponds to option A.\")\n\n# Execute the function\nfind_oscillation_frequency()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
