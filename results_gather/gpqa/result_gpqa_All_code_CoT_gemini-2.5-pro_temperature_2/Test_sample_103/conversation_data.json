    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** The problem uses the Radial Velocity (RV) method for detecting exoplanets. The key principles are the Doppler effect and Kepler's Third Law.\n2.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Velocity:** The observed periodic shift in a spectral line (`Δλ`) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (`v_star`) due to the planet's gravitational pull. The amplitude of this velocity variation is denoted as `K`. Therefore, `K` is directly proportional to the amplitude of the wavelength shift (`Δλ`). This can be written as `K ∝ Δλ`.\n3.  **Relate Velocity to Orbital Period:** For a circular orbit, the star's RV amplitude `K` is related to the planet's mass (`m_p`), the star's mass (`M_s`), and the orbital period (`P`) by the formula: `K ∝ m_p / (M_s^(2/3) * P^(1/3))`.\n4.  **Simplify the Relationship:** The problem states that the star masses are the same (`M_s1 = M_s2`) and the planet masses are the same (`m_p1 = m_p2`). This simplifies the relationship to `K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)`.\n5.  **Derive the Period Ratio:** By rearranging the simplified relationship, we find that `P^(1/3) ∝ 1/K`, which means the orbital period `P` is inversely proportional to the cube of the velocity amplitude `K`. This can be written as `P ∝ 1/K³` or `P ∝ (K)⁻³`.\n6.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:** We can now set up the ratio for the two planets' periods:\n    `P2 / P1 = (K1 / K2)³`.\n    Since `K ∝ Δλ`, we can substitute the wavelength shifts:\n    `P2 / P1 = (Δλ1 / Δλ2)³`.\n7.  **Compute the Value:** Using the given values `Δλ1 = 5` miliangstrom and `Δλ2 = 7` miliangstrom, we can calculate the numerical answer.\n\n```python\n# The relevant physical quantities from the problem statement\n# Amplitude of periodic wavelength shift for planet #1's host star in miliangstrom\ndelta_lambda_1 = 5\n# Amplitude of periodic wavelength shift for planet #2's host star in miliangstrom\ndelta_lambda_2 = 7\n\n# Step 1: Understand the relationship between wavelength shift (Δλ) and RV amplitude (K).\n# The RV amplitude K is directly proportional to the wavelength shift Δλ.\n# So, the ratio of the RV amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the wavelength shifts.\n# K1 / K2 = delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2\n\n# Step 2: Understand the relationship between RV amplitude (K) and orbital period (P).\n# Given that the masses of the stars and planets are the same for both systems,\n# the orbital period P is inversely proportional to the cube of the RV amplitude K.\n# P ∝ 1 / K³\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods (P2 / P1).\n# P2 / P1 = (K1 / K2)³\n# Substituting the relationship from Step 1:\n# P2 / P1 = (delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2)³\n\nperiod_ratio = (delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2) ** 3\n\n# Step 4: Print the final result and the options to identify the correct choice.\nprint(f\"The ratio of the RV amplitudes (K1/K2) is {delta_lambda_1}/{delta_lambda_2} = {delta_lambda_1/delta_lambda_2:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"The ratio of the orbital periods (P2/P1) is (K1/K2)^3 = ({delta_lambda_1}/{delta_lambda_2})^3\")\nprint(f\"Calculated result: P2 / P1 = {period_ratio:.4f}\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this to the options:\")\nprint(f\"A) ~ 1.96\")\nprint(f\"B) ~ 1.40\")\nprint(f\"C) ~ 0.36\")\nprint(f\"D) ~ 0.85\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated value of ~0.36 matches option C.\")\n\n```\n<<<C>>>"
