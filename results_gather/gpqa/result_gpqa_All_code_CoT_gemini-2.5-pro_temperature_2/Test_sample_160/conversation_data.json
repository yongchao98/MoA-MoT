  "question": "While designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV, Mike connected vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) in the sample compartment, aiming to minimize the presence of gas molecules for improved electron microscopy.

    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   λ1 represents the mean free path of a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules.\n    *   λ2 represents the mean free path of an electron colliding with the gas molecules.\n\n2.  **Recall the formulas for mean free path:**\n    *   The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions.\n    *   For a gas molecule moving among other identical, moving molecules (the case for λ1), the formula from kinetic theory is:\n        λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ)\n        where `n` is the number density of gas molecules and `σ` is the collision cross-section. The √2 factor accounts for the fact that the target molecules are also moving.\n    *   For a very fast particle (like a high-energy electron) moving through a gas of relatively slow-moving molecules (the case for λ2), the target molecules can be considered stationary. The formula simplifies to:\n        λ2 = 1 / (n * σ')\n        where `σ'` is the scattering cross-section for an electron and a gas molecule.\n\n3.  **Compare λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   Assuming the effective collision cross-section is similar in both cases (i.e., σ ≈ σ', as it's primarily determined by the size of the gas molecule), we can establish a ratio.\n    *   Divide the equation for λ2 by the equation for λ1:\n        λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ)]\n        λ2 / λ1 = √2\n    *   This means λ2 ≈ √2 * λ1.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the result:**\n    *   The square root of 2 is approximately 1.414.\n    *   Therefore, λ2 ≈ 1.414 * λ1.\n\n5.  **Check the given options against this relationship:**\n    *   A) λ2 < λ1: This is false because 1.414 * λ1 is greater than λ1.\n    *   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22 * λ1: This is false because 1.414 is not less than 1.22.\n    *   C) λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1: This is true because 1.414 is greater than or equal to 1.22.\n    *   D) λ2 = λ1: This is false.\n\nThe correct conclusion is that λ2 is larger than λ1 by a factor of approximately √2.
