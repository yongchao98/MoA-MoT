    "Regularization is a technique used in theoretical physics, particularly in quantum field theory, to deal with divergent quantities—infinities—that arise in calculations. These divergences often occur when calculating interactions at very short distances, which corresponds to very high energies (this is known as an ultraviolet or UV divergence). The procedure involves modifying the theory by introducing a parameter, known as a regulator, to make these calculations finite. Physical results are then obtained by removing the regulator in a specific way (a process called renormalization).\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n1.  **A) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory runs into problems like the infinite self-energy of a point charge. To make the energy finite, one must \"regularize\" the model, for instance, by assuming the charge is not a point but is spread over a tiny volume.\n2.  **B) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** As a quantum field theory, QED calculations (represented by Feynman diagrams with loops) produce integrals that diverge at high energies. Regularization and renormalization are essential techniques to extract meaningful, finite predictions from QED.\n3.  **D) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** Similar to QED, QCD is a quantum field theory. It describes the strong force and also suffers from ultraviolet divergences in its perturbative calculations that must be handled by regularization and renormalization.\n4.  **C) Superstring Theory:** A key motivation for string theory is its potential to be a \"UV-complete\" theory of quantum gravity. It postulates that fundamental particles are not point-like but are instead one-dimensional vibrating \"strings.\" This intrinsic extendedness of the strings smooths out interactions at very short distances. As a result, the calculations that would diverge in a point-particle theory are expected to yield finite results in string theory without the need for an external regularization procedure.\n\nTherefore, Superstring Theory is the only candidate on the list that is believed not to require regularization for high-energy interactions.\n\n```python\ndef solve_physics_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the options to determine which physical theory does not require\n    regularization at high energies and prints the correct answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    options = {\n        'A': 'Classical Electrodynamics',\n        'B': 'Quantum Electrodynamics',\n        'C': 'Superstring Theory',\n        'D': 'Quantum Chromodynamics'\n    }\n\n    explanations = {\n        'A': \"Needs regularization to handle the infinite self-energy of a point charge.\",\n        'B': \"As a quantum field theory, it has ultraviolet divergences in loop calculations that require regularization.\",\n        'C': \"It is believed to be UV-finite.
