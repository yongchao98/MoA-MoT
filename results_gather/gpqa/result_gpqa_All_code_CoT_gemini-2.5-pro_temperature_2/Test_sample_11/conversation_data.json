    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics**: The problem involves a particle decay at rest. The key principles to use are the conservation of energy and the conservation of momentum. Since the decay is relativistic, we must use the relativistic formulas for energy and momentum.\n2.  **Initial State**: The initial particle, the positive pion (Pi+), is stationary. This means its initial momentum is zero, and its total initial energy is simply its rest mass energy (E = mc²).\n3.  **Final State**: The final state consists of two particles: a positive muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu). They move in opposite directions to conserve momentum, with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n4.  **Conservation of Momentum**:\n    *   Initial momentum = 0.\n    *   Final momentum = p_mu + p_nu.\n    *   Therefore, p_mu = -p_nu. This means their momentum magnitudes are equal: |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.\n5.  **Conservation of Energy**:\n    *   Initial energy: E_pi = m_pi * c²\n    *   Final energy: E_final = E_mu + E_nu\n    *   The total energy for a particle is given by the relativistic formula: E² = (pc)² + (m_c²)².\n    *   For the muon: E_mu = sqrt((pc)² + (m_mu * c²)²)\n    *   For the neutrino, we assume it's massless (m_nu = 0), so its energy is: E_nu = |p_nu * c| = pc.\n    *   The conservation of energy equation becomes: m_pi * c² = sqrt((pc)² + (m_mu * c²)²) + pc.\n6.  **Solve for Momentum**: We can rearrange the energy conservation equation to solve for the momentum magnitude `p` (or more conveniently, `pc`).\n    *   m_pi * c² - pc = sqrt((pc)² + (m_mu * c²)²)\n    *   Squaring both sides: (m_pi * c²)² - 2(m_pi * c²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_mu * c²)²\n    *   Simplifying gives us a formula for `pc`: pc = [(m_pi * c²)² - (m_mu * c²)²] / [2 * (m_pi * c²)]\n7.  **Calculate Kinetic Energies**:\n    *   **Neutrino's Kinetic Energy (KE_nu)**: Since the neutrino is massless, its total energy is its kinetic energy. KE_nu = E_nu = pc.\n    *   **Muon's Kinetic Energy (KE_mu)**: The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy. KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu * c². We can find E_mu from the energy conservation: E_mu = E_pi - E_nu. Therefore, KE_mu = (E_pi - E_nu) - m_mu * c² = m_pi * c² - pc - m_mu * c².\n8.  **Python Implementation**: The Python code will define the given rest masses, calculate `pc` using the formula from step 6, and then use that value to find the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino. Finally, it will print the results.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Rest mass energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6  # MeV\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7  # MeV\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate the momentum of the products ---\n# From conservation of energy and momentum, we derive the formula for pc:\n# pc = ( (m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2 ) / ( 2 * m_pi*c^2 )\npc = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate the kinetic energy of the neutrino ---\n# For a massless particle like a neutrino, Kinetic Energy = Total Energy = pc\nke_neutrino = pc\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon ---\n# From conservation of energy: E_pi = E_mu + E_nu\n# m_pi*c^2 = (KE_mu + m_mu*c^2) + KE_nu\n# So, KE_mu = m_pi*c^2 - m_mu*c^2 - KE_nu\nke_muon = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2 - ke_neutrino\n\n# --- Step 4: Print the results ---\n# The options list the kinetic energy of the muon first, then the neutrino.\n# We round the values to match the precision in the options.\nprint(f\"The calculated kinetic energy of the muon (mu+) is: {ke_muon:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"The calculated kinetic energy of the neutrino (nu) is: {ke_neutrino:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing these values with the given options:\")\nprint(\"A) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\")\nprint(\"B) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\")\nprint(\"C) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\")\nprint(\"D) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\")\n# The calculated values (4.12 MeV and 29.78 MeV) are closest to option B.\n# Rounding the neutrino KE to one decimal place gives 29.8 MeV.\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated kinetic energies correspond to option B ({round(ke_muon, 2)} MeV, {round(ke_neutrino, 1)} MeV).\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>"
