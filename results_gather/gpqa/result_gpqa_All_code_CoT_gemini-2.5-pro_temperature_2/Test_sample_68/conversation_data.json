    "Of course, I can help you with this physics problem. Here is my plan to solve it step-by-step:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics Principles**\n\n*   **Time Dilation:** A fast-moving particle's lifetime appears longer to an observer in a stationary frame (the lab) than its lifetime in its own rest frame (proper lifetime, $\\tau_0$). The lab-frame lifetime ($\\tau$) is related to the proper lifetime by the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$, where $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n*   **Relativistic Energy:** The total energy ($E$) of a particle is related to its rest mass ($m_0$) and its Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$) by the equation $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$. We can use the given energy and mass to calculate $\\gamma$.\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The decay of unstable particles follows an exponential law. The probability that a particle will travel a distance `x` or more before decaying is given by $P(x > L) = e^{-L/\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the lab frame.\n*   **Mean Decay Length:** The mean decay length ($\\lambda$) is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. It's calculated as $\\lambda = v \\cdot \\tau$, where `v` is the particle's speed and $\\tau$ is its lab-frame lifetime. A more direct formula is $\\lambda = c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n\n**2. Formulate the Calculation Plan**\n\n1.  Calculate the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$, using the particle's total energy and rest mass.\n2.  Calculate the mean decay length, $\\lambda$, in the lab frame (the Bubble Chamber).\n3.  Interpret the condition \"observe at least 30% of the decays.\" For a detector to \"observe\" a decay, the decay must happen after a distance greater than the detector's minimum resolution, `R`. Therefore, we are looking for a resolution `R` such that the probability of the decay length being greater than `R` is 30%, i.e., $P(x > R) = 0.30$.\n4.  Solve the equation $e^{-R/\\lambda} = 0.30$ for the resolution `R`.\n5.  The result will be $R = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30)$.\n6.  Compare this calculated value of `R` to the given multiple-choice options to find the correct answer.\n\nNow, here is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_decay_resolution():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum resolution needed to observe a certain fraction of particle decays.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Given Constants ---\n    tau0 = 8e-16  # proper lifetime in seconds\n    E_GeV = 27.0    # total energy in GeV\n    m0_GeV = 3.41   # rest mass in GeV (as m0*c^2)\n    c = 299792458 # speed of light in m/s\n    \n    # Fraction of decays we want to observe\n    decay_fraction_to_observe = 0.30\n\n    # --- Calculation ---\n    \n    # 1. Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma).\n    # Since E and m0 are in the same energy units (GeV), the c^2 terms cancel.\n    gamma = E_GeV / m0_GeV\n    \n    # 2. Calculate the mean decay length (lambda) in the lab frame.\n    # The formula is lambda = c * tau0 * sqrt(gamma^2 - 1).\n    mean_decay_length = c * tau0 * math.sqrt(gamma**2 - 1)\n    \n    # 3. Calculate the required resolution, R.\n    # To observe decays, the path length x must be greater than the resolution R.\n    # The probability P(x > R) is given by exp(-R / lambda).\n    # We set this probability equal to the desired fraction of observed decays.\n    # exp(-R / lambda) = decay_fraction_to_observe\n    # R = -lambda * ln(decay_fraction_to_observe)\n    resolution = -mean_decay_length * math.log(decay_fraction_to_observe)\n\n    # --- Output the result and compare with options ---\n    print(f\"Proper lifetime (tau0): {tau0:.1e} s\")\n    print(f\"Particle energy (E): {E_GeV} GeV\")\n    print(f\"Particle mass (m0*c^2): {m0_GeV} GeV\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"Calculated Lorentz factor (gamma): {gamma:.4f}\")\n    print(f\"Calculated mean decay length (lambda): {mean_decay_length:.4e} m\")\n    print(f\"Calculated minimum resolution (R): {resolution:.4e} m\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    print(\"Comparing the calculated resolution with the given options:\")\n    options = {\n        'A': 2.08e-3,\n        'B': 2.08e-1,\n        'C': 2.08e-9,\n        'D': 2.08e-6\n    }\n    \n    for key, value in options.items():\n        print(f\"{key}) {value:.2e} m\")\n        \n    # Find the closest option\n    closest_option = min(options, key=lambda k: abs(options[k] - resolution))\n    \n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"The calculated value {resolution:.4e} m is numerically closest to option {closest_option}.\")\n    print(\"The slight discrepancy might be due to a typo in the problem's given values, but the method is correct.\")\n    print(f\"The correct choice is {closest_option}.\")\n\n# Run the solver\nsolve_decay_resolution()\n```\n<<<D>>>"
