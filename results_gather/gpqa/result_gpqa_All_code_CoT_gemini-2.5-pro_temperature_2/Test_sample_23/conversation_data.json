    "Here is my thinking process to solve this chemistry puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z:** The first step is to determine the chemical formula of hydrocarbon Z. We are given that the mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CnHm.\n    *   The mass of Carbon is 12.01 g/mol, and Hydrogen is 1.008 g/mol. We can use integer masses 12 and 1 for simplicity.\n    *   The mass fraction of Hydrogen is: `mass_H / total_mass = (m * 1) / (n * 12 + m * 1)`.\n    *   So, `m / (12n + m) = 0.1428`.\n    *   This can be rearranged: `m = 0.1428 * (12n + m)`.\n    *   `m = 1.7136n + 0.1428m`.\n    *   `0.8572m = 1.7136n`.\n    *   `m / n = 1.7136 / 0.8572 â‰ˆ 2`.\n    *   The empirical formula is CH2. The general formula for such a hydrocarbon is CnH2n. This corresponds to cycloalkanes or alkenes.\n    *   We are told Z is formed by hydrogenation of other compounds and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z must be a saturated hydrocarbon, specifically a cycloalkane.\n    *   We are also told Z is a constituent of mixture Y and is a common solvent. Cyclohexane (C6H12) is a very common solvent and fits the CnH2n formula. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane.\n    *   Check the hydrogen mass fraction for cyclohexane (C6H12): `12 / (6 * 12 + 12) = 12 / 84 = 0.142857...`, which matches perfectly. So, Z is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   It does *not* decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   One of its components is Z, which is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means the other component of Y must also produce cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n    *   A stable, 6-carbon ring compound that is aromatic (and thus doesn't react with bromine water) and hydrogenates to cyclohexane is **benzene (C6H6)**.\n    *   So, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C6H12)** and **benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n3.  **Identify Mixture X and the Reaction:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that *do* decolorize bromine water, meaning they contain C=C double bonds (alkenes/cycloalkenes).\n    *   The reaction `Mixture X -> Mixture Y` is a disproportionation reaction catalyzed by platinum. Disproportionation is a reaction where a substance is simultaneously oxidized and reduced. In this context, it's a hydrogen transfer.\n    *   Let the two liquids in mixture X be A and B. The reaction is: `A + B --(Pt, heat)--> Cyclohexane + Benzene`.\n    *   We can balance the hydrogen atoms for this reaction. The total number of hydrogen atoms must be conserved.\n    *   Number of H atoms in products = (H atoms in C6H12) + (H atoms in C6H6) = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (one molecule of A and one molecule of B) must also be 18.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   The question asks for \"the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\".\n    *   This is the number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of substance A plus one molecule of substance B.\n    *   Based on the stoichiometry of the reaction, this sum is 18.\n\n    *Example substances for A and B could be cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8), which have non-conjugated double bonds. The total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.*\n\nThe following Python code will print out this logical deduction and the final answer.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the properties of the final product Z.\n# Z is a hydrocarbon with 14.28% hydrogen by mass.\n# Let the formula be C_n H_m.\n# Mass fraction of H = m / (12n + m) = 0.1428\n# This leads to the ratio m/n being approximately 2.\n# So the general formula is C_n H_{2n}, characteristic of a cycloalkane.\n# Given it's a common solvent, Z is identified as cyclohexane (C6H12).\nh_in_z = 12\nc_in_z = 6\n\n# Step 2: Identify the components of mixture Y.\n# Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n# Y does not decolorize bromine water, meaning components are saturated or aromatic.\n# One component of Y is Z itself (cyclohexane).\n# Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. So, the other component of Y must hydrogenate to Z.\n# A stable aromatic C6 compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane is benzene (C6H6).\n# So, mixture Y consists of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\nh_in_cyclohexane = 12\nh_in_benzene = 6\n\n# Step 3: Analyze the reaction from mixture X to mixture Y.\n# Mixture X (compounds A and B) disproportionates to form mixture Y (cyclohexane and benzene).\n# The reaction is: A + B -> Cyclohexane + Benzene\n# The law of conservation of mass states that the number of atoms must be the same on both sides of the reaction.\n# We are asked for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (one molecule of A and one molecule of B).\n# This sum is equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\ntotal_h_in_products = h_in_cyclohexane + h_in_benzene\n\n# Step 4: Print the final answer.\n# The options are A) 12, B) 16, C) 22, D) 18.\n# Our calculated total is 18.\nprint(\"Step 1: Identify Z.
