    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this particle physics problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the goal:** The objective is to calculate the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X in the laboratory frame.\n2.  **Recall the relevant physics formula:** The mean decay distance ($d$) is the distance a particle travels on average before it decays. It is related to its speed ($v$) and its lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau_{\\text{lab}}$) by $d = v \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{lab}}$.\n3.  **Incorporate special relativity:** The lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau_{\\text{lab}}$) is dilated from its rest-frame lifetime ($\\tau_{\\text{rest}}$) by the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$. So, $\\tau_{\\text{lab}} = \\gamma \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{rest}}$. The rest-frame lifetime is related to the decay width ($\\Gamma_X$) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: $\\tau_{\\text{rest}} = \\hbar / \\Gamma_X$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n4.  **Combine the formulas:** This gives us $d = v \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot (\\hbar / \\Gamma_X)$. It is often more convenient to use the formula $d = \\frac{p}{m} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$, where $p$ is the particle's momentum, $m$ is its mass, and $\\hbar c$ is a useful constant.\n5.  **Calculate the particle's momentum ($p$):** Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. In particle physics units (where $c=1$), this simplifies to $p = \\sqrt{E^2 - m^2}$.\n6.  **Plug in the values:**\n    *   $E_X = 8 \\text{ GeV} = 8000 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   $m_X = 1.2 \\text{ GeV} = 1200 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\text{ MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}$ (where 1 fm = $10^{-15}$ m)\n7.  **Execute the calculation and convert units:** Calculate the distance in femtometers (fm) first and then convert it to meters to compare with the given options.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the given values and constants\nE_X = 8000  # Energy of X in MeV\nm_X = 1200  # Mass of X in MeV\nGamma_X = 320  # Decay width of X in MeV\nhbar_c = 197.327  # Reduced Planck constant * speed of light in MeV*fm\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the momentum 'p' of the particle X\n# Using the relation E^2 = p^2 + m^2 (in units where c=1)\n# So, p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2)\np_X = math.sqrt(E_X**2 - m_X**2)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the ratio p/m, which is equivalent to gamma*beta\np_over_m = p_X / m_X\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the mean decay length in the rest frame (c*tau)\n# This is given by hbar*c / Gamma\nrest_frame_length = hbar_c / Gamma_X\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the mean decay distance in the lab frame\n# d = (p/m) * (c*tau)\nd_in_fm = p_over_m * rest_frame_length\n\n# Step 5: Convert the distance from femtometers (fm) to meters (m)\n# 1 fm = 1e-15 m\nd_in_m = d_in_fm * 1e-15\n\n# Print the final result and the choices for comparison\nprint(\"Calculation of the mean decay distance:\")\nprint(f\"Momentum (p): {p_X:.2f} MeV/c\")\nprint(f\"Rest frame decay length (c*tau): {rest_frame_length:.4f} fm\")\nprint(f\"Mean decay distance (d) in meters: {d_in_m:.4e} m\\n\")\n\nprint(\"Please compare the result with the following options:\")\nprint(\"A) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\")\nprint(\"B) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\")\nprint(\"C) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\")\nprint(\"D) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>"
