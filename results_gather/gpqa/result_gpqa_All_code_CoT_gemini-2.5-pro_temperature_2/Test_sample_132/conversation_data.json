    "Of course, here is the plan and the Python code to solve the problem.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Calculate Moles**: First, calculate the number of moles for `KH₂PO₄` and `Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O` using their given masses and molar masses.\n2.  **Determine Concentrations**: `KH₂PO₄` provides the dihydrogen phosphate ion (`H₂PO₄⁻`), and `Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O` provides the hydrogen phosphate ion (`HPO₄²⁻`). Calculate their initial molar concentrations by dividing the moles by the solution volume in liters (200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L).\n3.  **Find Hydrogen Ion Concentration ([H⁺])**: The solution is a buffer containing the conjugate acid-base pair `H₂PO₄⁻`/`HPO₄²⁻`. This equilibrium is related to `Ka₂` for phosphoric acid (`H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻`). We will calculate the `[H⁺]` concentration using the expression `[H⁺] = Ka₂ * [H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]`, assuming the initial concentrations are a good approximation.\n4.  **Calculate Orthophosphate Concentration ([PO₄³⁻])**: The orthophosphate ion (`PO₄³⁻`) is produced in the next dissociation step, `HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻`, which is governed by `Ka₃`. We will use the formula `[PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * [HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺]` to find the final concentration.\n5.  **Output the Result**: The calculated concentration of `[PO₄³⁻]` will be printed and compared to the given options to select the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # g\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99 # g/mol\nvolume_L = 200.00 / 1000.0  # Convert cm3 to L\n\n# Acid dissociation constants for H3PO4\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the moles of each substance.\n# KH2PO4 provides the H2PO4- ion.\nmoles_H2PO4_minus = mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4\n# Na2HPO4*2H2O provides the HPO4(2-) ion.\nmoles_HPO4_2minus = mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the initial concentrations of the ions.\nconc_H2PO4_minus = moles_H2PO4_minus / volume_L\nconc_HPO4_2minus = moles_HPO4_2minus / volume_L\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] from the Ka2 equilibrium.\n# The buffer system is H2PO4- / HPO4(2-).\n# H2PO4- <=> H+ + HPO4(2-)\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4(2-)] / [H2PO4-]\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4(2-)]\nconc_H_plus = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4_minus / conc_HPO4_2minus)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the orthophosphate ion [PO4(3-)] concentration from the Ka3 equilibrium.\n# HPO4(2-) <=> H+ + PO4(3-)\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4(3-)] / [HPO4(2-)]\n# [PO4(3-)] = Ka3 * [HPO4(2-)] / [H+]\nconc_PO4_3minus = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4_2minus / conc_H_plus)\n\n# Step 5: Output the result and compare with the options.\nprint(f\"The concentration of H2PO4- is: {conc_H2PO4_minus:.4f} M\")\nprint(f\"The concentration of HPO4(2-) is: {conc_HPO4_2minus:.4f} M\")\nprint(f\"The calculated concentration of H+ is: {conc_H_plus:.2e} M\")\nprint(f\"The calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions [PO4(3-)] is: {conc_PO4_3minus:.2e} M\")\n\n# Options\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 2.81e-7,\n    \"B\": 3.97e-7,\n    \"C\": 5.48e-7,\n    \"D\": 6.24e-7,\n}\n\n# Find the closest option\nclosest_option_label = min(options, key=lambda k: abs(options[k] - conc_PO4_3minus))\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated value {conc_PO4_3minus:.2e} M is closest to option D (6.24x10^-7 M).\")\nprint(f\"The chosen option is: {closest_option_label}\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>"
