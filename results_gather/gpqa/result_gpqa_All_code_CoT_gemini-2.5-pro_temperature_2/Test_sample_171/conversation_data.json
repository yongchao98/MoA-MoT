    "To solve this problem, we need to use the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of atoms across different energy levels in a system that is in thermal equilibrium. The problem states that the stellar photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so we can apply this equation.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **The Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (`N_j`) to the number of atoms in a lower state (`N_i`) is given by:\n    `N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k*T))`\n    where:\n    *   `ΔE = E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the two states.\n    *   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights of the states.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n    The ratio `N_j / N_i` represents the level of \"excitation\".\n\n2.  **Apply to Both Stars:** We can write the Boltzmann equation for each star:\n    *   For Star 1 (temperature T₁): `(N_j / N_i)_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))`\n    *   For Star 2 (temperature T₂): `(N_j / N_i)_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))`\n\n3.  **Use the Problem's Condition:** The problem states that iron atoms in star\\_1 are twice as excited as in star\\_2. This means:\n    `(N_j / N_i)_1 = 2 * (N_j / N_i)_2`\n\n4.  **Combine the Equations:** Substitute the expressions from step 2 into the condition from step 3:\n    `(g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * [(g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))]`\n\n5.  **Simplify:** The statistical weight term `(g_j / g_i)` is the same for both and cancels out:\n    `exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))`\n\n6.  **Solve for the Temperatures:** To solve this, we take the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides:\n    `ln(exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))) = ln(2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂)))`\n    Using logarithm rules (`ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)` and `ln(exp(x)) = x`), we get:\n    `-ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T₂)`\n\n7.  **Isolate ln(2):** Rearrange the equation:\n    `ΔE / (k * T₂) - ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2)`\n\n8.  **Factor and Combine:** Factor out the `(ΔE / k)` term and find a common denominator for the temperature terms:\n    `(ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) = ln(2)`\n    `(ΔE / k) * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ] = ln(2)`\n\n9.  **Use the Given Numerical Values:** The problem states `ΔE = 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J`. The Boltzmann constant `k` is also `1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K`. Therefore, the ratio `ΔE / k` is equal to 1 (with units of Kelvin, which is consistent).\n    Substituting this value into our equation, we get:\n    `1 * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ] = ln(2)`\n\n10. **Final Equation:** This simplifies to the final relationship:\n    `ln(2) = [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]`\n\nThis equation matches option D.\n\n```python\n# Based on the physics principles and derivation outlined above, we can determine the correct option.\n# The step-by-step derivation leads to the equation:\n# ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n#\n# The problem provides the values:\n# ΔE = 1.38 x 10^(-23) J\n# Boltzmann constant, k ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K\n#\n# Therefore, the pre-factor (ΔE / k) is approximately 1.\n# The equation simplifies to:\n# ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\n#\n# This matches option D.\n\ncorrect_choice = 'D'\nexplanation = \"ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\"\n\nprint(\"The correct equation is:\")\nprint(f\"Choice {correct_choice}: {explanation}\")\n```\n<<<D>>>"
