    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the correct statement:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Problem:** The goal is to make a polymer with \"regular branches\" using only ethylene as the reactant. This process requires a dual-catalyst or tandem system. One catalyst must perform oligomerization (linking a few ethylene units together to form short alpha-olefins like 1-butene or 1-hexene), and the second catalyst must perform copolymerization (building the main polymer chain from ethylene and incorporating the alpha-olefins as branches).\n\n2.  **Evaluate Statement A:** \"Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.\" The essential additional step is the oligomerization of ethylene. Highly selective catalysts for this reaction, particularly the industrially relevant chromium-based systems, are typically activated by aluminum-based compounds like methylaluminoxane (MAO) or modified versions (MMAO). Therefore, this statement is factually incorrect.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Statement B:** \"Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.\" While some noble metals (like palladium) are used in catalysts that can produce branched polyethylene from ethylene, they typically operate via a \"chain-walking\" mechanism, which is different from the dual-catalyst system implied. Therefore, this statement is misleading in the context of the described process.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Statement D:** \"Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.\" This statement is subtly incorrect. The key is the term \"regular branches.\" Industrial tandem systems, such as those commercialized by Chevron Phillips Chemical in the US, produce Linear Low-Density Polyethylene (LLDPE). LLDPE has *randomly* distributed branches, not *regular* ones. A polymer with perfectly regular branches is a specialty material not made by these large-scale industrial processes. Thus, the systems implemented are not for making polymers with \"regular branches.\"\n\n5.  **Evaluate Statement C:** \"One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.\" This is the correct statement. The selective oligomerization of ethylene to 1-hexene or 1-octene is a key technology for this process, and the most successful catalysts are based on **Chromium (Cr)**. Chromium is a Group 6 transition metal. Depending on the notation system used (older IUPAC vs. CAS), this group is referred to as Group VIa or VIb. In the context of transition metal chemistry, this statement clearly points to the correct class of metals. This chemical principle is sound and describes the core of the required technology.\n\n```python\ndef solve_polymer_chemistry_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes four statements about the synthesis of branched polyethylene\n    from ethylene using a dual-catalyst system and identifies the correct one.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The problem describes creating a polymer with regular branches from only ethylene.\n    # This implies a tandem catalysis system:\n    # 1.
