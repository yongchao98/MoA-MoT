    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Calculate the relative speed (`v_rel`)**: We will use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula, since both astronauts are moving in the same direction. The formula is `v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`.\n2.  **Calculate the total energy (`E_total`)**: The total energy of a system is the sum of the individual energies of its components. The energy of a single relativistic particle is given by `E = γ * m * c^2`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`.\n    *   First, we'll calculate the Lorentz factor (`γ1` and `γ2`) for each astronaut.\n    *   Next, we'll calculate the individual total energy (`E1` and `E2`) for each astronaut.\n    *   Finally, we'll sum the individual energies to find the total energy of the system: `E_total = E1 + E2`.\n3.  **Compare results**: We will compare our calculated `v_rel` and `E_total` with the given options (A, B, C, D) to find the correct answer.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given values ---\n# Masses are given as factors of 'm'\nm1_factor = 2.0\nm2_factor = 3.0\n\n# Velocities are given as factors of 'c'\nv1_factor = 0.6\nv2_factor = 0.5\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate the relative speed (v_rel) ---\n# Using the relativistic velocity subtraction formula: v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - v1*v2/c^2)\n# Since v1 and v2 are factors of c, we can write: v_rel/c = (v1/c - v2/c) / (1 - (v1/c)*(v2/c))\nv_rel_factor = (v1_factor - v2_factor) / (1 - v1_factor * v2_factor)\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate the total energy (E_total) ---\n# Total energy is E_total = E1 + E2 = (gamma1 * m1 * c^2) + (gamma2 * m2 * c^2)\n# Lorentz factor gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\n# Calculate Lorentz factor for astronaut 1\ngamma1 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v1_factor**2)\n# Calculate Lorentz factor for astronaut 2\ngamma2 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - v2_factor**2)\n\n# The total energy will be expressed as a factor of mc^2.\n# E_total / (m*c^2) = (gamma1 * m1_factor) + (gamma2 * m2_factor)\nE_total_factor = (gamma1 * m1_factor) + (gamma2 * m2_factor)\n\n# --- Step 3: Print the results and compare with options ---\nprint(f\"Calculated relative speed: {v_rel_factor:.2f}c\")\nprint(f\"Calculated total energy: {E_total_factor:.2f}mc^2\\n\")\n\nprint(\"Let's compare our results with the given options:\")\nprint(\"A) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\")\nprint(\"B) v_rel = 0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\")\nprint(\"C) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\")\nprint(\"D) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\")\nprint(\"\\nOur calculated values match option A.\")\nprint(\"The correct choice is A.\")\n<<<A>>>\n```"
