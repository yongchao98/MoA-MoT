    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Calculate the Flux Variation due to Spots:** The problem describes a star with one clean hemisphere and one spotty hemisphere. The rotation of this star causes a variation in its observed brightness.\n    *   The maximum brightness (or flux, `F_max`) occurs when the clean hemisphere, with temperature `T_eff`, is facing us. The flux is proportional to `T_eff^4`.\n    *   The minimum brightness (`F_min`) occurs when the spotty hemisphere is facing us. This hemisphere has a fraction `f` (the filling factor) covered in cooler spots (`T_spot`) and a fraction `(1-f)` at the star's normal effective temperature (`T_eff`). The flux is therefore proportional to `(1-f) * T_eff^4 + f * T_spot^4`.\n    *   The relative amplitude of this brightness variation is `(F_max - F_min) / F_max`. This simplifies to `f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4)`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Flux Variation due to a Planet Transit:** The dimming of a star's light caused by a transiting exoplanet is related to the ratio of their sizes.\n    *   The transit depth (the relative drop in brightness) is the ratio of the planet's disk area to the star's disk area.\n    *   This is mathematically expressed as `(R_pl / R_star)^2`.\n\n3.  **Equate the two scenarios and Solve:** The problem asks for the planet radius that would produce the *same* amplitude signal as the spots. Therefore, we can set the two expressions equal to each other:\n    `(R_pl / R_star)^2 = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4)`\n\n4.  **Solve for R_pl / R_star:** By taking the square root of the expression, we can find the required ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius. The final python code will implement this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given Parameters ---\n# Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\nT_eff = 6000\n\n# Temperature difference of the spots in Kelvin\nT_diff = 1000\n\n# Filling factor of the spots on the spotty hemisphere\nf = 0.20\n\n# --- Calculations ---\n# Step 1: Calculate the temperature of the spots\nT_spot = T_eff - T_diff\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the relative flux amplitude caused by the spots.\n# The formula is derived from the Stefan-Boltzmann law for the two rotational phases.\n# Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4)\nflux_amplitude_from_spots = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\n\n# Step 3: Relate the spot amplitude to the transit depth of a hypothetical exoplanet.\n# The transit depth is equal to (R_pl / R_star)^2.\n# We set this equal to the amplitude from the spots.\n# (R_pl / R_star)^2 = flux_amplitude_from_spots\nRpl_Rstar_squared = flux_amplitude_from_spots\n\n# Step 4: Solve for the radius ratio (R_pl / R_star) by taking the square root.\nRpl_Rstar = math.sqrt(Rpl_Rstar_squared)\n\n# --- Output the result ---\n# The calculated ratio corresponds to one of the choices.\nprint(f\"The given options are:\")\nprint(\"A) ~0.32\")\nprint(\"B) ~0.39\")\nprint(\"C) ~0.07\")\nprint(\"D) ~0.11\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the star (Rpl/Rstar) is: {Rpl_Rstar:.4f}\")\nprint(\"This result matches option A.\")\n\n```\n<<<A>>>"
