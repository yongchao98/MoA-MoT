    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Calculate Initial Conditions After Dilution**: First, determine the new concentration of acetic acid after it's been diluted with water. The moles of acetic acid remain the same, but the total volume doubles.\n2.  **Calculate pH at 25% Titration**: This point is in the buffer region, before the equivalence point. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: `pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])`.\n    *   Calculate pKa from the given Ka.\n    *   At 25% titration, 25% of the acid (HA) has been converted to its conjugate base (A-), and 75% of the acid remains. The ratio `[A-]/[HA]` is therefore `25/75` or `1/3`.\n3.  **Calculate pH at the Equivalence Point**: At this point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH, forming its conjugate base, acetate (CH3COO-). The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of this weak base in water.\n    *   Calculate the moles of acetate formed, which is equal to the initial moles of acetic acid.\n    *   Calculate the total volume of the solution at the equivalence point.\n    *   Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion.\n    *   Calculate Kb for acetate using the relationship `Kw = Ka * Kb`.\n    *   Use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table approach or its approximation to find the hydroxide ion concentration `[OH-]`.\n    *   Calculate pOH from `[OH-]`, and then find the pH using `pH = 14 - pOH`.\n4.  **Compare and Conclude**: Compare the calculated pH values with the given options to find the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_titration_ph():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point for an acetic acid titration.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Given values ---\n    initial_vol_acid_L = 20.00 / 1000  # cm3 to L\n    initial_conc_acid_M = 0.05       # M\n    vol_water_L = 20.00 / 1000        # cm3 to L\n    conc_naoh_M = 0.1                # M\n    Ka_acid = 1.85e-5\n    Kw = 1.0e-14\n\n    # --- Step 1: Initial state after dilution ---\n    moles_acid = initial_conc_acid_M * initial_vol_acid_L\n    total_volume_after_dilution_L = initial_vol_acid_L + vol_water_L\n    conc_acid_after_dilution_M = moles_acid / total_volume_after_dilution_L\n\n    # --- Step 2: pH at 25% Titration ---\n    # At this point, we are in the buffer region.\n    # We use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n    pKa = -math.log10(Ka_acid)\n    \n    # At 25% titration, ratio [A-]/[HA] = 25/75 = 1/3\n    ratio_base_acid = 0.25 / 0.75\n    pH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(ratio_base_acid)\n\n    # --- Step 3: pH at Equivalence Point ---\n    # At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH added = initial moles of acid.\n    vol_naoh_at_equivalence_L = moles_acid / conc_naoh_M\n    \n    # Total volume at equivalence point\n    total_vol_at_equivalence_L = total_volume_after_dilution_L + vol_naoh_at_equivalence_L\n    \n    # At equivalence, all acid is converted to its conjugate base (acetate).\n    # The moles of acetate are equal to the initial moles of acid.\n    conc_acetate_at_equivalence_M = moles_acid / total_vol_at_equivalence_L\n    \n    # Calculate Kb for the conjugate base from Ka\n    Kb_base = Kw / Ka_acid\n    \n    # Calculate [OH-] from the hydrolysis of the weak base: A- + H2O <=> HA + OH-\n    # Kb = [HA][OH-]/[A-] = x^2 / (C - x)\n    # We can approximate C-x ≈ C since Kb is small.\n    # [OH-] = x = sqrt(Kb * C_acetate)\n    OH_concentration = math.sqrt(Kb_base * conc_acetate_at_equivalence_M)\n    \n    # Calculate pOH and then pH\n    pOH = -math.log10(OH_concentration)\n    pH_at_equivalence = 14.00 - pOH\n\n    # --- Final Output ---\n    print(f\"Calculation Steps and Results:\")\n    print(f\"Initial moles of acetic acid: {moles_acid:.4f} mol\")\n    print(f\"pKa of acetic acid: {-math.log10(Ka_acid):.2f}\")\n    print(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"Volume of NaOH at equivalence point: {vol_naoh_at_equivalence_L * 1000:.2f} cm3\")\n    print(f\"Total volume at equivalence point: {total_vol_at_equivalence_L * 1000:.2f} cm3\")\n    print(f\"Concentration of acetate at equivalence: {conc_acetate_at_equivalence_M:.4f} M\")\n    print(f\"Kb of acetate: {Kb_base:.3e}\")\n    print(f\"Hydroxide concentration [OH-]: {OH_concentration:.3e} M\")\n    print(f\"pOH at equivalence point: {pOH:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_at_equivalence:.2f}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"The calculated pH values are:\")\n    print(f\"At 25% titration: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"At the equivalence point: {pH_at_equivalence:.2f}\")\n\nsolve_titration_ph()\n<<<B>>>\n```"
