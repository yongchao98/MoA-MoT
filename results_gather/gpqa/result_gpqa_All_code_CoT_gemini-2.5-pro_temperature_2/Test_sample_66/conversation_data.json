    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Identify the system's state:** The initial state of the two-electron system is given by the coupled angular momentum state `|l, m> = |2, -1>`, where the individual angular momenta are `l_1 = 1` and `l_2 = 1`.\n2.  **Identify the measurement outcome:** The question asks for the joint probability of measuring the z-component of angular momentum for electron 1 (`L_1z`) as `-ħ` and for electron 2 (`L_2z`) as `-ħ`. The eigenvalue `-ħ` corresponds to the magnetic quantum number `m = -1`. Therefore, we are looking for the probability of the measurement outcome `m_1 = -1` and `m_2 = -1`.\n3.  **Apply the conservation principle:** A fundamental principle in quantum mechanics is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This means that for a measurement to be possible, the sum of the measured magnetic quantum numbers (`m_1 + m_2`) must be equal to the total magnetic quantum number of the system (`m`).\n4.  **Check the condition:** For our specific case, the total magnetic quantum number of the system is `m = -1`. The sum for the desired measurement outcome is `m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2`.\n5.  **Determine the probability:** Since `m_1 + m_2` (`-2`) is not equal to `m` (`-1`), this measurement outcome violates the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum. Therefore, the probability of observing this outcome is zero. I will write a Python script to demonstrate this logic and find the correct option.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_angular_momentum_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the joint probability for a given quantum mechanical measurement.\n\n    The problem involves two electrons in p-orbitals in a coupled angular\n    momentum state |l, m> = |2, -1>.
