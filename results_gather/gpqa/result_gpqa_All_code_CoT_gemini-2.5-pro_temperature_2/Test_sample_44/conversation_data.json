    "This is a quantum mechanics problem involving fermions in a potential well. Here is my plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Understand the Basics:** The system consists of four identical spin-1/2 particles. These are fermions, so they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state here is defined by the spatial quantum number `n` and the spin quantum number `ms` (+1/2 or -1/2).\n2.  **Single-Particle Energy Levels:** The energy for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well is given by `En = n^2 * E`, where `n` is a positive integer (1, 2, 3, ...) and `E` is the ground state energy unit `E = (pi^2 * h_bar^2) / (2mL^2)`. Because of spin, each energy level `n` can accommodate up to two fermions (one with spin up, one with spin down).\n3.  **Calculate Ground State Energy (E_gs):** To find the ground state energy of the four-particle system, we must fill the lowest available single-particle energy levels.\n    *   The `n=1` level can hold two particles. Their total energy is `2 * (1^2 * E) = 2E`.\n    *   The `n=2` level can hold the next two particles. Their total energy is `2 * (2^2 * E) = 8E`.\n    *   The total ground state energy is the sum: `E_gs = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n4.  **Calculate First Excited State Energy (E_1st):** The first excited state is formed by moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (`n=3`) with the minimum energy cost.\n    *   The new configuration will be: two particles in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, and one in `n=3`.\n    *   The total energy is: `E_1st = 2*(1^2*E) + 1*(2^2*E) + 1*(3^2*E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n5.  **Calculate Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd):** The second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We must consider the possible low-energy promotions from the ground state:\n    *   **Option 1:** Promote one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`. The configuration is one particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, one in `n=3`. The energy is `1*(1^2*E) + 2*(2^2*E) + 1*(3^2*E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n    *   **Option 2:** Promote both particles from `n=2` to `n=3`. The configuration is two particles in `n=1`, two in `n=3`. The energy is `2*(1^2*E) + 2*(3^2*E) = 2E + 18E = 20E`.\n    *   **Option 3:** Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`. The configuration is two particles in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, one in `n=4`. The energy is `2*(1^2*E) + 1*(2^2*E) + 1*(4^2*E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`.\n    *   The lowest of these is 18E. So, `E_2nd = 18E`.\n6.  **Final Answer:** The calculated energies are 10E, 15E, and 18E, which corresponds to option D.\n\nI will now write a python script to perform and display these calculations.\n\n```python\ndef solve_fermion_energies():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the energies of the ground state, first excited state,\n    and second excited state for four spin-1/2 particles in a 1D\n    infinite potential well.
