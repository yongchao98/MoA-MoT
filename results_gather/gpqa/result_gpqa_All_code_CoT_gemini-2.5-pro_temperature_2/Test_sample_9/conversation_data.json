    "To determine which exoplanet has the highest density, we need to evaluate or estimate the density of each planet described in the options.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Analyze Option (a):** A planet with the mass and radius of Earth will, by definition, have Earth's average density, which is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n2.  **Analyze Option (b):** The density of this planet is explicitly given as approximately 5.5 g/cm³, which is essentially the same as Earth's density.\n3.  **Analyze Option (c):** This planet has the same composition as Earth but is 5 times more massive. For rocky planets, a higher mass leads to stronger self-gravity, which compresses the planet's material. This gravitational compression results in a significantly higher average density compared to a less massive planet of the same composition. We expect its density to be greater than Earth's. We can estimate this using the mass-radius relationship for rocky planets, which is approximately R ∝ M^0.27.\n4.  **Analyze Option (d):** This planet is half the mass of Earth but has the same composition. Following the same logic as option (c), but in reverse, the lower mass results in less gravitational compression. Therefore, we expect its density to be lower than Earth's.\n5.  **Compare:** We will calculate the densities for options (c) and (d) based on the mass-radius relationship and compare all four values to find the highest one. The option letter ('a', 'b', 'c', or 'd') with the highest density will be mapped to the corresponding final choice ('A', 'B', 'C', or 'D').\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations and identify the correct option.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_exoplanet_density():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and compares the densities of four exoplanets to find the highest.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Earth's average density in g/cm^3\n    rho_earth = 5.51\n\n    # Dictionary to hold the calculated densities for options a, b, c, d\n    densities = {}\n    \n    print(\"Calculating the density for each exoplanet option:\")\n\n    # --- Option a ---\n    # An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.
