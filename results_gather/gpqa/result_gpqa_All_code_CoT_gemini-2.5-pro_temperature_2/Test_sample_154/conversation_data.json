    "To find the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the necessary quantum mechanical objects.**\n    We need the matrix for the operator $P_z$ and the column vector for the state of the system, which we'll call $|\\psi\\rangle$. We are given:\n    $P_z = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    and the state vector is\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n2.  **Recall the formula for uncertainty.**\n    The uncertainty of an operator $A$ in a state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is given by the formula:\n    $\\Delta A = \\sqrt{\\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2}$\n    where $\\langle A \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | A | \\psi \\rangle$ is the expectation value of $A$.\n    So, for our problem, we need to calculate:\n    $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n\n3.  **Calculate the expectation values.**\n    We need to calculate two quantities:\n    a) $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z | \\psi \\rangle$. In matrix notation, this is $\\psi^\\dagger P_z \\psi$, where $\\psi^\\dagger$ is the conjugate transpose of $\\psi$.\n    b) $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z^2 | \\psi \\rangle$. This is $\\psi^\\dagger P_z^2 \\psi$. We first need to compute the matrix $P_z^2 = P_z \\cdot P_z$.\n\n4.  **Compute the final uncertainty.**\n    Substitute the calculated expectation values into the uncertainty formula to get the final answer. For simplicity in the numerical calculation, we can set $\\hbar=1$ and then reintroduce it at the end.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Set hbar = 1 for calculation convenience. The final answer will be a multiple of hbar.\nhbar = 1.0\n\n# Define the matrix for the operator P_z\nP_z = hbar * np.array([\n    [1, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, -1]\n])\n\n# Define the state vector of the system\npsi = np.array([\n    [-1/2],\n    [1/np.sqrt(2)],\n    [-1/2]\n])\n\n# Calculate the conjugate transpose of the state vector (psi_dagger)\npsi_dagger = psi.conj().T\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the expectation value of P_z, <P_z>\n# <P_z> = psi_dagger * P_z * psi\nexp_Pz_matrix = psi_dagger @ P_z @ psi\nexp_Pz = exp_Pz_matrix[0, 0] # Extract the scalar value from the 1x1 matrix\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the matrix for P_z^2\nP_z_squared = P_z @ P_z\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the expectation value of P_z^2, <P_z^2>\n# <P_z^2> = psi_dagger * P_z^2 * psi\nexp_Pz_squared_matrix = psi_dagger @ P_z_squared @ psi\nexp_Pz_squared = exp_Pz_squared_matrix[0, 0] # Extract the scalar value\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the uncertainty Delta P_z\n# Delta P_z = sqrt(<P_z^2> - <P_z>^2)\nuncertainty_Pz = np.sqrt(exp_Pz_squared - exp_Pz**2)\n\n# Print the intermediate and final results\nprint(f\"The state vector psi is:\\n{psi}\\n\")\nprint(f\"The operator P_z is (with hbar=1):\\n{P_z/hbar}\\n\")\nprint(f\"The expectation value <P_z> is: {exp_Pz:.4f} * hbar\")\nprint(f\"The expectation value <P_z^2> is: {exp_Pz_squared:.4f} * hbar^2\")\nprint(f\"The uncertainty Delta P_z is: {uncertainty_Pz:.4f} * hbar\\n\")\n\n# Compare the result with the given options\noptions = {\n    \"A\": hbar,\n    \"B\": hbar / np.sqrt(2),\n    \"C\": hbar / 2,\n    \"D\": np.sqrt(2) * hbar\n}\n\n# Find the option that matches the calculated uncertainty\nchosen_option = None\nfor key, value in options.items():\n    if np.isclose(uncertainty_Pz, value):\n        chosen_option = key\n        break\n\nprint(\"Comparing the result with the options:\")\nprint(f\"A) hbar = {options['A']:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"B) hbar/sqrt(2) = {options['B']:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"C) hbar/2 = {options['C']:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"D) sqrt(2)*hbar = {options['D']:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated uncertainty {uncertainty_Pz:.4f} matches option {chosen_option}.\")\nprint(f\"The uncertainty Delta P_z is hbar/sqrt(2).\")\nprint(f\"\\nFinal Answer Choice: {chosen_option}\")\n<<<B>>>\n```"
