    "Of course, I can help you solve this organic chemistry problem. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of HPLC peaks.\n\n### Plan and Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction I**: The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral ketone with one stereocenter at carbon 5. The reduction of the ketone at carbon 3 with LAH creates a new stereocenter. Since there is a pre-existing stereocenter, the product will be a mixture of two diastereomers: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n2.  **Analyze Reaction II**: The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, an achiral diketone. The reduction of both ketones with excess NaBH4 creates two new stereocenters (at C2 and C4), producing pentane-2,4-diol. Due to the symmetry of the molecule, this reaction yields three stereoisomers: one pair of enantiomers, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, and one achiral meso compound, (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.\n3.  **Analyze Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Separation)**: A normal-phase HPLC column has an achiral stationary phase. It can separate molecules with different physical properties, such as diastereomers. However, it cannot distinguish between enantiomers, which will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **From Reaction I**: The two products are diastereomers, so they will be separated into **2 peaks**.\n    *   **From Reaction II**: The products are an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers. Therefore, the enantiomeric pair will elute as one peak, and the meso compound will elute as a separate peak, giving **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Total Normal-Phase Peaks**: The products from Reaction I are structurally different from those in Reaction II (different molecular formulas), so they will not co-elute. The total number of peaks will be the sum from both reactions: 2 + 2 = **4 peaks**.\n4.  **Analyze Chiral HPLC (Chiral Separation)**: A chiral HPLC column can separate all unique stereoisomers, including enantiomers.\n    *   We have a total of five distinct stereoisomers in the combined mixture:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Each of these five compounds will be resolved by the chiral column.\n    *   **Total Chiral Peaks**: There will be **5 peaks**.\n\nBased on this analysis, we expect 5 peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC. This corresponds to option D.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this logic to confirm the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_hplc_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the products of two chemical reactions and determines the number of peaks\n    observed in normal-phase and chiral HPLC chromatograms.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the products of Reaction I.\n    # The reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one creates a new stereocenter,\n    # resulting in two diastereomers.\n    reaction_I_products = [\n        \"(3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\",\n        \"(3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\"\n    ]\n    num_diastereomers_I = len(reaction_I_products)\n\n    # Step 2: Define the products of Reaction II.\n    # The reduction of pentane-2,4-dione creates a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n    reaction_II_products = [\n        \"Enantiomeric pair of (2R,4R)/(2S,4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\", # This represents two compounds that co-elute on a normal column\n        \"meso-pentane-2,4-diol\" # This is a single, different compound (diastereomer to the others)\n    ]\n    num_stereoisomers_II = 3 # (2R,4R), (2S,4S), and meso form\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate peaks for normal-phase (achiral) HPLC.\n    # Diastereomers are separated, but enantiomers are not.\n    # For Reaction I: The 2 products are diastereomers -> 2 peaks.\n    peaks_I_normal = num_diastereomers_I\n    # For Reaction II: The enantiomeric pair gives 1 peak, and the meso compound gives another -> 2 peaks.\n    peaks_II_normal = len(reaction_II_products)\n    # Total peaks, assuming no accidental overlap between products of Reaction I and II.\n    total_peaks_normal = peaks_I_normal + peaks_II_normal\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate peaks for chiral HPLC.\n    # Chiral HPLC separates all unique stereoisomers (both diastereomers and enantiomers).\n    # We count every distinct stereoisomer from both reactions.\n    total_peaks_chiral = num_diastereomers_I + num_stereoisomers_II\n\n    # Step 5: Print the detailed results and the final conclusion.\n    print(\"--- Analysis Results ---\")\n    print(f\"Reaction I produces {num_diastereomers_I} diastereomers.\")\n    print(f\"Reaction II produces {num_stereoisomers_II} stereoisomers (one enantiomeric pair and one meso compound).\")\n    print(\"\\n--- HPLC Peak Count ---\")\n    print(f\"Normal-Phase HPLC (achiral):\")\n    print(f\"  - Separates diastereomers, not enantiomers.\")\n    print(f\"  - Peaks from Reaction I: {peaks_I_normal}\")\n    print(f\"  - Peaks from Reaction II: {peaks_II_normal} (1 for enantiomeric pair, 1 for meso compound)\")\n    print(f\"  - Total Peaks = {total_peaks_normal}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nChiral HPLC:\")\n    print(f\"  - Separates all stereoisomers (diastereomers and enantiomers).\")\n    print(f\"  - Total Peaks = (Products from I) + (Products from II) = {num_diastereomers_I} + {num_stereoisomers_II} = {total_peaks_chiral}\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Final Answer ---\")\n    print(f\"The number of peaks observed is:\")\n    print(f\"{total_peaks_chiral} Peaks in chiral HPLC and {total_peaks_normal} peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\")\n    print(\"This corresponds to option D.\")\n    print(\"<<<D>>>\")\n\nsolve_hplc_problem()\n```"
