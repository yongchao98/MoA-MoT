    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y:** The problem states that substance A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ωF) of 31.96%. We can use this to identify the element Y. The formula for mass percentage is `ωF = (n * M_F) / (M_Y + n * M_F)`, where `n` is the number of fluorine atoms, `M_F` is the atomic mass of fluorine (~19 g/mol), and `M_Y` is the atomic mass of element Y. We can rearrange this to solve for `M_Y`: `M_Y = ((1 / ωF) - 1) * n * M_F`. By testing integer values for `n`, we can find a plausible `M_Y` that corresponds to a real element.\n    *   For `n=4`, `M_Y` is calculated to be approximately 161.8 g/mol, which is very close to the atomic mass of Dysprosium (Dy, 162.5 g/mol). Let's test this possibility. `A2` would be `DyF4`.\n    *   For `n=6`, `M_Y` is calculated to be approximately 242.7 g/mol, which is close to Plutonium (Pu, 244 g/mol) or Americium (Am, 243 g/mol).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reactions:** We are given a reaction `Y + A4 -> A5` with a 1:1 molar ratio. This suggests a comproportionation reaction, where `Y(0) + YF_n -> 2 * YF_{n/2}`. This implies `A4` must have an even number of fluorine atoms (`n`), and `A5` has half that number (`n/2`). We are also told `A5` decomposes in water, which means its oxidation state is unstable and likely disproportionates.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Candidate Elements:**\n    *   **If Y is Pu or Am:** The most stable oxidation state is +3. For `A5` to be unstable, it must be in a less stable state like +2. This would require the reaction `Y + YF4 -> 2 * YF2`. So `A4` would be `PuF4` or `AmF4`. Let's calculate their molecular weights:\n        *   `MW(PuF4) = 244 + 4*19 = 320` g/mol.\n        *   `MW(AmF4) = 243 + 4*19 = 319` g/mol.\n        Neither of these values fits into the provided answer choices.\n    *   **If Y is Dy:** The most stable oxidation state is +3. For `A5` to be unstable, it could be `DyF2` (oxidation state +2). This would result from the reaction `Dy + DyF4 -> 2 * DyF2`. This means `A4` must be `DyF4`. This scenario is consistent, as `Dy(II)` is known to be unstable.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4:** Based on our deduction, `A4` is Dysprosium tetrafluoride (`DyF4`). We will calculate its molecular weight using the atomic masses `M(Dy) = 162.5` g/mol and `M(F) = 19.0` g/mol.\n\n5.  **Determine the Correct Range:** We will compare the calculated molecular weight of `DyF4` with the given options to find the correct range.\n\n```python\n# Step 1-4: Logic and deduction to identify A4\n# Based on the chemical properties described, Dysprosium (Dy) is the most plausible candidate for element Y.\n# - A2 is identified as DyF4. Let's verify the fluorine percentage.\n# - A4 is deduced to be DyF4 to satisfy the reaction conditions (Y + A4 -> A5) and the instability of A5 (DyF2).\n\n# Atomic masses\nM_Dy = 162.5  # g/mol\nM_F = 19.0    # g/mol\n\n# A4 is determined to be DyF4\nnum_F_in_A4 = 4\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the molecular weight of A4 (DyF4)\nmw_A4 = M_Dy + num_F_in_A4 * M_F\n\n# Step 6: Compare the result to the given ranges to determine the answer\nranges = {\n    \"A\": (220, 240),\n    \"B\": (160, 180),\n    \"C\": (140, 160),\n    \"D\": (110, 130)\n}\n\nfinal_choice = None\nfor choice, (low, high) in ranges.items():\n    if low <= mw_A4 <= high:\n        final_choice = choice\n        break\n\nprint(f\"The deduced substance A4 is DyF4.\")\nprint(f\"The molecular weight of A4 is: {mw_A4} g/mol.\")\nprint(f\"This falls into the range for choice {final_choice}: {ranges[final_choice][0]}-{ranges[final_choice][1]}.\")\nprint(f\"The correct option is {final_choice}.\")\n\n```\n<<<A>>>"
