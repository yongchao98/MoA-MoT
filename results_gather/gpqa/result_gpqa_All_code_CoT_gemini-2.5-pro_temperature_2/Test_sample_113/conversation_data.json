    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the correct reagents.\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves a ketone (butan-2-one) and a cyanide source (NaCN) to form a cyanohydrin (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile). This is a nucleophilic addition reaction.\n2.  **Determine the mechanism:** The nucleophilic cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms an alkoxide intermediate.\n3.  **Identify the role of reagent A:** The alkoxide intermediate needs to be protonated (gain an H⁺) to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group of the cyanohydrin. Reagent A must be a proton source. This is typically achieved by adding a dilute acid in a workup step. H₃O⁺ (hydronium ion) represents this acidic workup. Therefore, A is H₃O⁺.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction converts a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is a hydrolysis reaction of a nitrile.\n2.  **Determine the conditions:** Nitrile hydrolysis requires either strong acidic or strong basic conditions to proceed efficiently. The presence of H₂O is indicated. Reagent B acts as the catalyst.\n3.  **Identify the role of reagent B:** Among the choices, HCl is a strong acid, and CH₃COOH is a weak acid. For the complete hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, a strong acid catalyst like HCl is required. Therefore, B is HCl.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   For the first reaction, A = H₃O⁺.\n*   For the second reaction, B = HCl.\n*   Combining these findings, the correct option is D.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_reagent_selection():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the two chemical reactions and determines the correct reagents.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Analysis of Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    # This is a cyanohydrin formation.
