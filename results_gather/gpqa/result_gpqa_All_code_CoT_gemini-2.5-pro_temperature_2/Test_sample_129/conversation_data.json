    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the thinking process to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation and identify the correct answer.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Key Physical Parameters**: The problem involves the rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha (Lya) line and the atmospheric cutoff wavelength for ground-based optical telescopes.\n    *   Lya rest wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$) = 1216 Angstroms.\n    *   Atmospheric cutoff wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{cutoff}}$) is approximately 3100 Angstroms, as Earth's atmosphere absorbs most light in the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum below this value.\n\n2.  **Use the Redshift Formula**: The redshift `z` relates the observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) to the rest wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$) with the formula:\n    $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}} \\times (1 + z)$\n\n3.  **Establish the Condition for Detection**: For the Lya line to be detected by a ground-based telescope, its observed wavelength must be greater than the atmospheric cutoff:\n    $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} > \\lambda_{\\text{cutoff}}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Minimum Redshift**: By combining the formulas, we can find the minimum required redshift ($z_{\\text{min}}$):\n    $\\lambda_{\\text{rest}} \\times (1 + z_{\\text{min}}) = \\lambda_{\\text{cutoff}}$\n    $z_{\\text{min}} = (\\lambda_{\\text{cutoff}} / \\lambda_{\\text{rest}}) - 1$\n\n5.  **Compare with Options**: Calculate $z_{\\text{min}}$ and then find the lowest option (A, B, C, or D) that has a redshift value greater than this physical minimum. This will be the answer.\n\nHere is the Python code that executes this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_redshift_limit():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the lower limit on the redshift for observing the Lyman-alpha\n    line with a ground-based optical telescope and selects the correct option.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the physical constants.\n    # The rest-frame wavelength of the Lyman-alpha (Lya) transition of neutral hydrogen.\n    lambda_rest = 1216  # in Angstroms\n\n    # The approximate lower wavelength limit for ground-based telescopes, due to the\n    # Earth's atmospheric absorption of UV light. A common value is ~310 nm.\n    lambda_cutoff = 3100  # in Angstroms\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the minimum required redshift (z_min) for the Lya line to\n    # be shifted into the observable window.\n    z_min = (lambda_cutoff / lambda_rest) - 1\n\n    # Step 3: Define the provided multiple-choice options for the redshift.\n    options = {\n        \"A\": 1.2,\n        \"B\": 1.9,\n        \"C\": 2.4,\n        \"D\": 3.0\n    }\n\n    # Step 4: Explain the reasoning and calculations.\n    print(\"To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum redshift that shifts the Lyman-alpha line into the visible range for ground-based telescopes.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(f\"1.

The observed wavelength (λ_obs) is related to redshift (z) by: λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + z).\")\n    print(f\"4. For detection, we need λ_obs > {lambda_cutoff} Å.\")\n    print(\"5. This gives us the minimum redshift required:\")\n    print(f\"   z_min = (λ_cutoff / λ_rest) - 1 = ({lambda_cutoff} / {lambda_rest}) - 1 = {z_min:.2f}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(\"Now we find the lowest option that satisfies z > {:.2f}:\".format(z_min))\n\n    # Step 5: Iterate through the options and determine the correct choice.\n    correct_choice = None\n    # Sort options by value to ensure we find the minimum that meets the criteria\n    for choice, z_option in sorted(options.items(), key=lambda item: item[1]):\n        observed_lambda = lambda_rest * (1 + z_option)\n        if z_option > z_min:\n            print(f\" - Option {choice} (z={z_option}): Observable. λ_obs = {observed_lambda:.0f} Å, which is > {lambda_cutoff} Å.\")\n            if correct_choice is None:\n                correct_choice = choice\n        else:\n            print(f\" - Option {choice} (z={z_option}): Not observable. λ_obs = {observed_lambda:.0f} Å, which is < {lambda_cutoff} Å.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nConclusion:\")\n    print(f\"The lowest redshift from the list that allows the Lyman-alpha line to be observed from the ground is z = {options[correct_choice]}.\")\n    print(f\"The correct option is: {correct_choice}\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the solution\nsolve_redshift_limit()\n```\n<<<B>>>"
