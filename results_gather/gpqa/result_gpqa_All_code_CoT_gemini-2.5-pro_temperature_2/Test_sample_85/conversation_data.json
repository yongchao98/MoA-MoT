    "This is a problem of determining the stereochemistry of starting materials in two related chemical reactions. Let's break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Products**\n\n*   **Starting Material Candidates:** All options are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule is a derivative of glutaric acid (a 5-carbon dicarboxylic acid). It contains two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) at one end and an isobutyl ester (`-COOCH2CH(CH3)2`) at the other. It also has a chiral center at carbon 3, which bears an ethyl group.\n    *   Structure: `(isobutyl)-OOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`\n*   **Product:** The product in both reactions is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a Î´-lactone, which is a 6-membered cyclic ester. Such a lactone is formed from a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid. In this case, it is formed by the cyclization of `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n    *   The chiral center at C3 in the starting acid becomes the chiral center at C4 in the final lactone product.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reagents and Reaction Pathways**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in the different selectivities of the two reducing agents, `LiBH4` and `BH3`.\n\n*   **LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride):** is a mild reducing agent. It selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH3 (Borane):** is a powerful reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n\n**Reaction A: `A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-product`**\n\n1.  **Reduction:** `LiBH4` will reduce the isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`), leaving the carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) untouched.\n2.  **Intermediate:** This forms `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n3.  **Lactonization:** The acid workup (`H+`) then catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization), where the hydroxyl group attacks the carboxylic acid to form the 6-membered lactone ring.\n4.  **Stereochemistry:** Throughout this process, the bonds to the chiral center (C3) are not broken or formed. Therefore, the stereochemical configuration is retained. To get the `(R)` product, the starting material A must be the `(R)` enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion for A: (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.**\n\n**Reaction B: `B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-product`**\n\n1.  **Reduction:** `BH3` will reduce the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`), leaving the isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`) untouched. This forms a hydroxy-ester intermediate.\n2.  **Hydrolysis & Lactonization:** The acid workup (`H+`) in this case performs two functions. It first hydrolyzes the ester back into a carboxylic acid, and then it catalyzes the lactonization. This sequence also leads to the `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid` intermediate, which then cyclizes to the final lactone product.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** Similar to Reaction A, none of the steps in this pathway affect the chiral center at C3. The configuration is retained. To get the `(S)` product, the starting material B must be the `(S)` enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion for B: (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.**\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n*   Starting material A is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\n# Define the reaction schemes\nReaction = collections.namedtuple('Reaction', ['id', 'reagent', 'product_stereo'])\nreactions = [\n    Reaction(id='A', reagent='LiBH4', product_stereo='R'),\n    Reaction(id='B', reagent='BH3', product_stereo='S')\n]\n\n# Define reagent selectivity\nreagent_selectivity = {\n    'LiBH4': 'Reduces esters, not carboxylic acids.',\n    'BH3': 'Reduces carboxylic acids, not esters.'\n}\n\n# The problem is to identify the starting material for each reaction.\n# The starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n# This molecule has a carboxylic acid group and an ester group.\n# The final product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one (a lactone).\n# This lactone is formed from the intermediate 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n# The stereochemistry at the chiral center is retained in both reaction pathways.\n\ndef solve_reaction(reaction):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the stereochemistry of the starting material based on the reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The stereochemistry of the product is the same as the starting material\n    # because the reactions do not affect the chiral center.\n    if reaction.reagent == 'LiBH4':\n        # Reaction A: LiBH4 reduces the ester.
