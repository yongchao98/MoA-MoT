    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Spectroscopic Data to Identify Compound X**: I will first interpret the IR and 1H NMR data to deduce the structure of the starting material, Compound X.\n    *   **IR Spectrum**: The broad absorption between 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ and the strong absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. The peaks around 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are typical for C=C bonds in an aromatic ring.\n    *   **1H NMR Spectrum**:\n        *   The broad singlet at 10.5 ppm is a classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid.\n        *   The two doublets at 8.0 ppm (2H) and 7.2 ppm (2H) strongly suggest a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group.\n        *   The remaining signals represent an alkyl group attached to the ring:\n            *   0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A methyl group next to a -CH₂- group.\n            *   1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A methyl group next to a -CH- group.\n            *   1.7 ppm (m, 2H): A -CH₂- group adjacent to both a -CH₃ and a -CH- group.\n            *   2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A -CH- group attached to the benzene ring, a -CH₃ group, and a -CH₂- group.\n        *   Putting this alkyl puzzle together reveals a *sec*-butyl group [-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)].\n    *   **Structure of Compound X**: Based on the combined data, Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. This corresponds to option (D).\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Product**: I will identify the transformation that occurs when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI.\n    *   **Reagents**: Red phosphorus and HI (Red P/HI) form a very powerful reducing agent.\n    *   **Reaction**: This reagent is known to completely reduce carboxylic acids (-COOH) to their corresponding alkanes (specifically, a methyl group, -CH₃). The aromatic ring and the alkyl side chain will remain unchanged.\n    *   **Product Formation**: The -COOH group on 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid will be reduced to a -CH₃ group.\n    *   **Final Product**: The final product is 4-(sec-butyl)-1-methylbenzene, which can also be named 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n3.  **Select the Correct Option**: I will compare the deduced final product with the given multiple-choice options.\n    *   A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: This matches the predicted product.\n    *   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect structure.\n    *   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: Incorrect alkyl group (isobutyl instead of sec-butyl).\n    *   D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material, not the final product.\n\nThe correct choice is therefore A.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Backup the original stdout\noriginal_stdout = sys.stdout\n# Redirect stdout to a string buffer\nsys.stdout = captured_output = io.StringIO()\n\n# Step 1: Analyze the provided spectroscopic data to identify the starting material (Compound X).\n# IR data:\n# - A very broad peak from 3400–2500 cm-1 is characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid dimer.\n# - A strong peak at 1720 cm-1 is characteristic of the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n# - Peaks at 1610 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1 are characteristic of C=C stretches in an aromatic ring.\n# Conclusion from IR: The compound is a carboxylic acid with an aromatic ring.\n\n# 1H NMR data:\n# - 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet, very deshielded, is the classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n# - 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, indicate a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The downfield shift of the 8.0 ppm signal suggests it is ortho to a strong electron-withdrawing group (the -COOH).\n# - The remaining signals describe the alkyl substituent: 0.9 ppm (t, 3H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 2.9 ppm (m, 1H).\n#   - 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) -> -CH2-CH3\n#   - 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) -> -CH-CH2-CH3\n#   - 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) -> -CH-CH3\n#   - 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) -> The -CH- connected to the ring, a -CH3, and a -CH2CH3 group.\n#   - This combination of signals defines a sec-butyl group: -CH(CH3)(CH2CH3).\n# Conclusion from NMR: The compound has a sec-butyl group and a carboxylic acid group in a para-arrangement on a benzene ring.\n\n# Structure of Compound X: The data points to 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. This corresponds to option D.\n\n# Step 2: Determine the reaction product.\n# The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI.\n# Red P / HI is a powerful reducing agent. Its most notable reaction is the complete reduction of carbonyls, alcohols, and carboxylic acids to the corresponding alkanes.\n# In this case, the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n# The aromatic ring and the sec-butyl group are unaffected by this reagent.\n# So, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid becomes 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n# Step 3: Match the product to the options.\n# Product: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n# Options:\n# A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n# B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid\n# C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene\n# D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (This is the starting material)\n# The calculated final product matches option A.\n\nfinal_answer = 'A'\n\n# Restore the original stdout\nsys.stdout = original_stdout\n# Get the captured output\noutput = captured_output.getvalue()\n\n# Print the step-by-step thinking process\nprint(\"Step-by-step thinking process:\")\nprint(\"1.
