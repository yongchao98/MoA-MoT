    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the core structure and functional groups.**\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us the base structure is a benzene ring with two substituents, which can be represented as C6H4. This structure accounts for 4 aromatic protons (H) and has a degree of unsaturation (DBE) of 4 (one ring and three double bonds).\n*   **FTIR - Ester group:** The spectrum indicates the presence of an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for 2 oxygen atoms and adds one more degree of unsaturation due to the C=O double bond.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR signals.**\n*   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** For a di-substituted benzene ring, having only two signals for the 4 aromatic protons is characteristic of a para (1,4) substitution pattern.\n*   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets) and one -CH3 signal:** This splitting pattern is a classic signature for a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). The vinyl proton next to the CH3 group is split by the other vinyl proton (doublet) and the three CH3 protons (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl proton is split only by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet. The methyl group is split by one adjacent vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet. This fragment has the formula -C3H5. It also adds another degree of unsaturation due to the C=C double bond.\n*   **A second -CH3 signal:** Since one methyl group is in the propenyl substituent, this second methyl group must be part of the ester functional group. To have no -CH2- groups, this must be either a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate ester (`-OCOCH3`). In either case, this methyl group would be a singlet, which is consistent with the data of having two distinct methyl signals. This fragment adds C2H3O2 to the formula.\n*   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This confirms that there are no ethyl, propyl, or other alkyl chains with CH2 units present in the molecule, which aligns with our proposed fragments.\n\n**Step 3: Assemble the fragments and calculate the molecular formula.**\nLet's combine the identified pieces:\n1.  A para-substituted benzene ring: C6H4\n2.  A propenyl group substituent: C3H5\n3.  An ester substituent containing a methyl group (e.g., a methyl ester): COOCH3 (The alternative, an acetate ester -OCOCH3, has the same atom count).\n\nNow, let's sum the atoms from these fragments:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 1 (from COO) + 1 (from CH3) = 11 carbons.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from CH3) = 12 hydrogens.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = 2 oxygens.\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**Step 4: Match the result with the given options.**\nThe calculated formula C11H12O2 matches option A.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1. Define the molecular components based on the spectral data.\n#    - Aromatic ring: C6H4\n#    - Propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3): C3H5\n#    - Methyl ester group (-COOCH3): C1H3O2 (for counting purposes, C from CO is separate)\n# 2.
