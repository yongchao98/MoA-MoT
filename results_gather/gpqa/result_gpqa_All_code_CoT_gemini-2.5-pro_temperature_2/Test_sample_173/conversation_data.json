    "Here is a breakdown of the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define Initial Parameters and Calculate Fragment Masses:** We start with the initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus, `E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`. The two fragments have rest-masses `m1` and `m2`, where `m1 = 2*m2`. The sum of their rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * E_initial`. We can solve this system of equations to find the rest-mass energies of the more massive fragment (`m1*c^2`) and the less massive fragment (`m2*c^2`).\n\n2.  **Calculate Relativistic Kinetic Energy (T1):** We use the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before fission (300 GeV) equals the total energy after fission (`E1 + E2`, where `E1` and `E2` are the total energies of the fragments).\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta (`|p1| = |p2|`).\n    *   We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation `E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2`. Since the momenta are equal, we get `E1^2 - (m1c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2c^2)^2`.\n    *   By solving the system of equations for `E1 + E2` and `E1 - E2`, we find the total energy of the more massive fragment, `E1`.\n    *   The relativistic kinetic energy is then `T1 = E1 - m1*c^2`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Classical Kinetic Energy (T1_classical):**\n    *   First, we calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value), which is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the final sum of rest-mass energies: `Q = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`.\n    *   In classical mechanics, from the conservation of momentum, the kinetic energies are inversely proportional to the rest-masses: `T1_c / T2_c = m2 / m1`.\n    *   Using this ratio and the total kinetic energy `Q = T1_c + T2_c`, we can solve for `T1_c`, the classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment.\n\n4.  **Find the Difference:** Finally, we calculate the difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energies, `T1 - T1_c`, and convert the result from GeV to MeV to find the answer among the options.\n\n```python\ndef solve_fission_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the physics problem about spontaneous fission to find the difference\n    between relativistic and classical kinetic energy calculations.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define initial parameters and calculate fragment rest-mass energies (all in GeV)\n    E_initial = 300.0  # GeV\n\n    # Sum of rest-mass energies of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass-energy\n    E_rest_sum = 0.99 * E_initial\n\n    # We have two equations for the fragment rest-mass energies m1c^2 and m2c^2:\n    # 1) m1c_squared = 2 * m2c_squared (m1 is the more massive fragment)\n    # 2) m1c_squared + m2c_squared = E_rest_sum\n    # Substituting (1) into (2):\n    # 2 * m2c_squared + m2c_squared = E_rest_sum\n    # 3 * m2c_squared = E_rest_sum\n    m2c_squared = E_rest_sum / 3.0\n    m1c_squared = 2.0 * m2c_squared\n\n    print(f\"Initial rest-mass energy (M*c^2): {E_initial} GeV\")\n    print(f\"Rest-mass energy of massive fragment (m1*c^2): {m1c_squared:.3f} GeV\")\n    print(f\"Rest-mass energy of lighter fragment (m2*c^2): {m2c_squared:.3f} GeV\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Relativistic Kinetic Energy (T1) Calculation\n    # Total energy is conserved: E1 + E2 = E_initial\n    # Momentum is conserved: |p1| = |p2|.\n    # From E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2, we get E1^2 - (m1c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2c^2)^2\n    # Rearranging: E1^2 - E2^2 = (m1c^2)^2 - (m2c^2)^2\n    # (E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (m1c^2 - m2c^2)(m1c^2 + m2c^2)\n    E_sum = E_initial\n    E_diff = ((m1c_squared - m2c_squared) * (m1c_squared + m2c_squared)) / E_sum\n    \n    # Now we have a system of two linear equations:\n    # 1) E1 + E2 = E_sum\n    # 2) E1 - E2 = E_diff\n    # Adding them: 2*E1 = E_sum + E_diff\n    E1 = (E_sum + E_diff) / 2.0\n    \n    # The relativistic kinetic energy T1 is E1 - m1c^2\n    T1_relativistic = E1 - m1c_squared\n    \n    print(\"Relativistic Calculation:\")\n    print(f\"Total energy of fragment 1 (E1): {E1:.3f} GeV\")\n    print(f\"Kinetic energy of massive fragment (T1): {T1_relativistic:.3f} GeV\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 3: Classical Kinetic Energy (T1_classical) Calculation\n    # Total kinetic energy released (Q-value)\n    Q = E_initial - E_rest_sum\n    \n    # Classically, kinetic energy is partitioned inversely to mass: T1/T2 = m2/m1\n    # T1_c + T2_c = Q and T2_c = T1_c * (m1/m2)\n    # T1_c * (1 + m1/m2) = Q\n    # Since m1 = 2*m2, then m1/m2 = 2\n    T1_classical = Q / (1.0 + (m1c_squared / m2c_squared))\n    \n    print(\"Classical Calculation:\")\n    print(f\"Total kinetic energy released (Q): {Q:.3f} GeV\")\n    print(f\"Kinetic energy of massive fragment (T1_classical): {T1_classical:.3f} GeV\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    # Step 4: Calculate the difference and convert to MeV\n    difference_gev = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\n    difference_mev = difference_gev * 1000 # 1 GeV = 1000 MeV\n    \n    print(\"Final Result:\")\n    print(f\"The difference T1(relativistic) - T1(classical) is {difference_gev:.3f} GeV.\")\n    print(f\"This is equal to {difference_mev:.1f} MeV.\")\n\n    # Step 5: Compare to options\n    options = {'A': 2, 'B': 10, 'C': 5, 'D': 20}\n    for choice, value in options.items():\n        if round(difference_mev) == value:\n            print(f\"The calculated value {difference_mev:.1f} MeV matches option {choice}.\")\n            final_answer = choice\n            break\n    else:\n        final_answer = \"No matching option found.\"\n\n    # Final answer format\n    print(f\"\\nFinal answer selection is {final_answer}.\")\n\n\n# Execute the function to solve the problem\nsolve_fission_problem()\n\n# The logic points to 5 MeV which corresponds to option C\nprint(\"<<<C>>>\")\n\n```"
