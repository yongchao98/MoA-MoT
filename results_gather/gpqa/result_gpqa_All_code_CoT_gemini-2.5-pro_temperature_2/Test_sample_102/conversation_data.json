    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent structure is benzene.\n*   The substituents are an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   The substitution pattern is 1, 3, 5, meaning all substituents are meta to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nWe need to consider how each substituent directs incoming electrophiles during electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** A deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** A strongly deactivating group and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** A deactivating group but an *ortho, para*-director.\n\nThe 1,3,5-pattern suggests that the synthesis should prioritize using *meta*-directing groups to guide the substitutions.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's examine the reaction sequence proposed by each option:\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   i) Nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene.\n    *   ii) Reduction of nitrobenzene gives aniline (-NH2).\n    *   iii) Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic lone pair on the nitrogen of the amino group, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring towards acylation. Thus, option A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   i) Bromination of benzene gives bromobenzene.\n    *   ii) Nitration of bromobenzene gives predominantly *p*-bromonitrobenzene (and some *o*-isomer).\n    *   iii) Friedel-Crafts acylation on *p*-bromonitrobenzene. This ring is strongly deactivated by both the nitro group and the bromo group. Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on strongly deactivated rings. Thus, option C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl ; iv) H3PO2 ...`\n    *   i) Benzene -> Nitrobenzene\n    *   ii) Nitrobenzene -> Aniline\n    *   iii) Aniline -> Benzenediazonium salt\n    *   iv) Benzenediazonium salt -> Benzene (via deamination with H3PO2).\n    This sequence converts benzene to aniline and then back to benzene, which is a pointless loop. Thus, option D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   **i) Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene is acylated to form acetophenone. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a *meta*-director. This is a good first step.\n    *   **ii) Bromination:** Acetophenone is brominated. The *meta*-directing acetyl group guides the incoming bromine to position 3, yielding 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    *   **iii) Nitration:** 3-bromoacetophenone is nitrated. Now the ring has two substituents: an acetyl group (meta-director) at position 1 and a bromine atom (ortho, para-director) at position 3.\n        *   The acetyl group directs the nitro group to position 5.\n        *   The bromo group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n        *   While there are competing effects, nitration of 1,3-disubstituted rings like this often favors substitution at position 5. This position is meta to the strong meta-director and avoids steric hindrance between the two existing groups. This reaction leads to the desired product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   The remaining steps (iv-vii) in this option appear superfluous and chemically nonsensical if performed on the target product. However, the initial three steps represent the most plausible and chemically correct sequence among all the choices to achieve the desired synthesis.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy eliminating the incorrect options, we are left with Option B as the only viable choice. The first three steps of this sequence provide a logical pathway to the target molecule.\n\n```python\n# The task is to identify the correct synthetic pathway.\n# Let's analyze the options based on the principles of organic chemistry.\n# Target: 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n# This requires three substitutions: acylation, bromination, and nitration. The key is the order.\n# The final product has a 1,3,5-substitution pattern.\n\n# Analysis of Option A:\n# i) Benzene -> Nitrobenzene (-NO2 is meta-director)\n# ii) Nitrobenzene -> Aniline (-NH2 is ortho,para-director)\n# iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation). This reaction fails because the Lewis acid (AlCl3) complexes with the basic amine, deactivating the ring.\n# Conclusion for A: Fails.\n\n# Analysis of Option C:\n# i) Benzene -> Bromobenzene (-Br is ortho,para-director)\n# ii) Bromobenzene -> p-Bromonitrobenzene (major product). Wrong regiochemistry for 1,3,5 pattern.\n# iii) p-Bromonitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation). This reaction fails because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group.\n# Conclusion for C: Fails.\n\n# Analysis of Option D:\n# i) Benzene -> Nitrobenzene\n# ii) Nitrobenzene -> Aniline\n# iii) Aniline -> Diazonium salt\n# iv) Diazonium salt -> Benzene. This sequence is circular and achieves nothing.\n# Conclusion for D: Fails.\n\n# Analysis of Option B:\n# i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 -> Acetophenone. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a meta-director. Good start.\n# ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 -> 3-Bromoacetophenone. The meta-director correctly places the bromine at the 3-position.\n# iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 -> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Here, the acetyl group (meta) directs to the 5-position. The bromo group (o,p) directs elsewhere. However, nitration at position 5 is the most likely major product. This sequence is plausible.\n# The remaining steps (iv-vii) seem out of place, but the initial sequence is the most chemically sound among all options.\n# Conclusion for B: Most plausible pathway provided.\n\n# Final choice is B based on systematic elimination of other choices.\n\nprint(\"B\")\n```\n<<<B>>>"
