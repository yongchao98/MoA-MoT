    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  Analyze the potential V(r, θ) given in polar coordinates.\n2.  Transform the potential into Cartesian coordinates (x, y) to simplify its form. The key relations for this transformation are x = r*cos(θ), y = r*sin(θ), and r^2 = x^2 + y^2.\n3.  Recognize that the simplified potential V(x, y) describes a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. This means the system can be treated as two independent (uncoupled) harmonic oscillators, one along the x-axis and one along the y-axis.\n4.  For each direction (x and y), identify the effective spring constant (k_eff) by matching the potential to the standard form V = 1/2 * k_eff * q^2.\n5.  Calculate the angular frequency for each oscillator using the formula ω = sqrt(k_eff / m).\n6.  Apply the well-known formula for the energy spectrum of a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator, E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω, to find the separate energy contributions from the x and y motions.\n7.  The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies from the x and y oscillators, so E = E_x + E_y.\n8.  I will simplify the final expression for the total energy and compare it with the given multiple-choice options to determine the correct answer.\n\nThe python code below will programmatically follow these steps, explaining the derivation and printing the final correct option.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve_quantum_oscillator():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function derives the energy spectrum for the given 2D potential\n    by transforming it to Cartesian coordinates and solving it as two\n    independent quantum harmonic oscillators.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Symbolic variables for clarity in print statements ---\n    # We will use strings to represent the mathematical derivation steps.\n    nx_str, ny_str = \"n_x\", \"n_y\"\n    hbar_str, k_str, m_str = \"ħ\", \"k\", \"m\"\n\n    # --- Derivation Steps ---\n    derivation_steps = []\n    \n    # Step 1: State the potential\n    derivation_steps.append(\"Step 1: The given potential is V(r, θ) = 1/2*k*r^2 + 3/2*k*r^2*cos^2(θ).\")\n\n    # Step 2: Convert to Cartesian coordinates\n    derivation_steps.append(\"\\nStep 2: Convert the potential to Cartesian coordinates using x = r*cos(θ) and r^2 = x^2 + y^2.\")\n    derivation_steps.append(\"We can substitute r^2 = x^2 + y^2 and (r*cos(θ))^2 = x^2.\")\n    derivation_steps.append(\"V(x, y) = 1/2*k*(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2*k*x^2\")\n\n    # Step 3: Simplify the Cartesian potential\n    derivation_steps.append(\"\\nStep 3: Simplify the expression by combining terms.\")\n    derivation_steps.append(\"V(x, y) = (1/2 + 3/2)*k*x^2 + 1/2*k*y^2\")\n    derivation_steps.append(\"V(x, y) = 2*k*x^2 + 1/2*k*y^2\")\n\n    # Step 4: Identify independent oscillators\n    derivation_steps.append(\"\\nStep 4: This potential V(x, y) is separable into two independent harmonic oscillators:\")\n    derivation_steps.append(\"V(x) = 2*k*x^2  and  V(y) = 1/2*k*y^2\")\n    derivation_steps.append(\"Comparing with the standard form V = 1/2*k_eff*q^2, we find the effective spring constants:\")\n    derivation_steps.append(\"k_x = 4k\")\n    derivation_steps.append(\"k_y = k\")\n    \n    # Step 5: Find angular frequencies\n    derivation_steps.append(\"\\nStep 5: Calculate the angular frequencies (ω = sqrt(k_eff/m)).\")\n    derivation_steps.append(f\"ω_x = sqrt(4{k_str}/{m_str}) = 2*sqrt({k_str}/{m_str})\")\n    derivation_steps.append(f\"ω_y = sqrt({k_str}/{m_str})\")\n\n    # Step 6: Find the total energy\n    derivation_steps.append(\"\\nStep 6: The total energy is the sum of the energies from each oscillator, E = E_x + E_y.\")\n    derivation_steps.append(f\"The energy for a 1D QHO is E_n = (n + 1/2)*{hbar_str}*ω.\")\n    derivation_steps.append(f\"E = ({nx_str} + 1/2)*{hbar_str}*ω_x + ({ny_str} + 1/2)*{hbar_str}*ω_y\")\n    derivation_steps.append(f\"E = ({nx_str} + 1/2)*{hbar_str}*(2*sqrt({k_str}/{m_str})) + ({ny_str} + 1/2)*{hbar_str}*sqrt({k_str}/{m_str})\")\n\n    # Step 7: Simplify the final expression\n    derivation_steps.append(\"\\nStep 7: Simplify the expression for total energy E.\")\n    derivation_steps.append(f\"Factor out the term {hbar_str}*sqrt({k_str}/{m_str}):\")\n    derivation_steps.append(f\"E = [ ({nx_str} + 1/2)*2 + ({ny_str} + 1/2) ] * {hbar_str}*sqrt({k_str}/{m_str})\")\n    derivation_steps.append(f\"E = [ 2{nx_str} + 1 + {ny_str} + 1/2 ] * {hbar_str}*sqrt({k_str}/{m_str})\")\n    final_formula = f\"E = (2{nx_str} + {ny_str} + 3/2)*{hbar_str}*sqrt({k_str}/{m_str})\"\n    derivation_steps.append(f\"E = (2*{nx_str} + {ny_str} + 3/2)*{hbar_str}*sqrt({k_str}/{m_str})\")\n\n    # Print the full derivation\n    print(\"Here is the step-by-step derivation of the energy spectrum:\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"\\n\".join(derivation_steps))\n    print(\"---------------------------------------------------------\")\n\n    # Final conclusion\n    print(\"\\nComparing the derived result with the options:\")\n    print(f\"Derived formula: {final_formula}\")\n    print(f\"Option A: E = (2{nx_str}+{ny_str}+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\")\n    print(f\"The derived formula matches option A.\")\n    \n    # Print the final choice\n    print(\"\\nThe correct choice is A.\")\n\n# Run the solver\nsolve_quantum_oscillator()\n<<<A>>>\n```"
