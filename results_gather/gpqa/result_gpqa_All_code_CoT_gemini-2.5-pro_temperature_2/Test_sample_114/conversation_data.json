    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Principle of Conservation**: The core principles to apply here are the conservation of energy and the conservation of momentum. Since the particles are moving at relativistic speeds (indicated by Lorentz factors > 1), we must use the equations from special relativity.\n\n2.  **Initial State (Before Collision)**:\n    *   We have an electron ($e^-$) and a positron ($e^+$), which have the same rest mass ($m_e$).\n    *   The total energy before the collision is the sum of the individual relativistic energies: $E_{initial} = E_{electron} + E_{positron} = \\gamma_e m_e c^2 + \\gamma_p m_e c^2$.\n    *   The total momentum before the collision is the vector sum of individual momenta. Since they move along the horizontal x-axis in opposite directions: $P_{initial} = P_{electron} + P_{positron}$. The relativistic momentum is given by $p = \\sqrt{E^2/c^2 - (m_e c)^2} = m_e c \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$. Taking the direction into account, the total initial momentum (along the x-axis) is $P_{initial, x} = m_e c \\sqrt{\\gamma_e^2 - 1} - m_e c \\sqrt{\\gamma_p^2 - 1}$. The initial momentum in the y-direction is zero.\n\n3.  **Final State (After Annihilation)**:\n    *   The electron and positron annihilate, producing two photons.\n    *   The problem states the photons have equal energy, let's call it $E_{\\gamma}$. The total final energy is $E_{final} = 2E_{\\gamma}$.\n    *   A photon's momentum is $p_{\\gamma} = E_{\\gamma}/c$.\n    *   Due to conservation of momentum in the y-direction (which was initially zero), the photons must be emitted at equal and opposite angles to the horizontal axis. Let's call this angle $\\theta$. One photon goes at angle $+\\theta$ and the other at $-\\theta$.\n    *   The total final momentum in the x-direction is the sum of the x-components of the two photons' momenta: $P_{final, x} = p_{\\gamma} \\cos(\\theta) + p_{\\gamma} \\cos(-\\theta) = 2p_{\\gamma} \\cos(\\theta)$.\n\n4.  **Applying Conservation Laws**:\n    *   **Energy Conservation**: $E_{initial} = E_{final} \\implies (\\gamma_e + \\gamma_p) m_e c^2 = 2E_{\\gamma}$.\n    *   **Momentum Conservation (x-axis)**: $P_{initial, x} = P_{final, x} \\implies m_e c (\\sqrt{\\gamma_e^2 - 1} - \\sqrt{\\gamma_p^2 - 1}) = 2p_{\\gamma} \\cos(\\theta)$.\n\n5.  **Solving for the Angle**:\n    *   From energy conservation, we can express the photon's energy as $E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{(\\gamma_e + \\gamma_p)}{2} m_e c^2$.\n    *   Since $p_{\\gamma} = E_{\\gamma}/c$, we have $p_{\\gamma} = \\frac{(\\gamma_e + \\gamma_p)}{2} m_e c$.\n    *   Substitute this into the momentum conservation equation:\n        $m_e c (\\sqrt{\\gamma_e^2 - 1} - \\sqrt{\\gamma_p^2 - 1}) = 2 \\left( \\frac{(\\gamma_e + \\gamma_p)}{2} m_e c \\right) \\cos(\\theta)$.\n    *   Simplifying this equation by canceling the $m_e c$ terms gives us:\n        $\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\gamma_e^2 - 1} - \\sqrt{\\gamma_p^2 - 1}}{\\gamma_e + \\gamma_p}$.\n    *   We can now plug in the given Lorentz factors ($\\gamma_e = 4$, $\\gamma_p = 2$) to find $\\cos(\\theta)$, and then solve for $\\theta$. The total angle between the photons will be $2\\theta$.\n\nLet's implement this calculation in Python.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given Lorentz factors\ngamma_e = 4  # Electron\ngamma_p = 2  # Positron\n\n# Calculate the numerator for the cos(theta) formula\n# num = sqrt(gamma_e^2 - 1) - sqrt(gamma_p^2 - 1)\nnum = math.sqrt(gamma_e**2 - 1) - math.sqrt(gamma_p**2 - 1)\n\n# Calculate the denominator for the cos(theta) formula\n# den = gamma_e + gamma_p\nden = gamma_e + gamma_p\n\n# Calculate cos(theta)\ncos_theta = num / den\n\n# Calculate theta in radians using the arccosine function\ntheta_rad = math.acos(cos_theta)\n\n# Convert theta from radians to degrees\ntheta_deg = math.degrees(theta_rad)\n\n# The total angle between the two photons is 2 * theta\ntotal_angle = 2 * theta_deg\n\n# Print the options and the calculated result\nprint(\"The problem is to find the angle between the two photons produced in an electron-positron annihilation.\")\nprint(\"The options are:\")\nprint(\"A) 172\")\nprint(\"B) 138\")\nprint(\"C) 74\")\nprint(\"D) 96\")\nprint(\"\\nCalculating the angle...\")\nprint(f\"The half-angle (theta) is: {theta_deg:.2f} degrees.\")\nprint(f\"The total angle between the photons (2 * theta) is: {total_angle:.2f} degrees.\")\nprint(\"\\nBased on the calculation, the closest answer is 138.\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>"
