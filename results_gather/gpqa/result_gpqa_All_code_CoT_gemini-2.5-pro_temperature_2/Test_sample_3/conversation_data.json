    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to determine the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Premise:** The core of the question is what happens to Maxwell's equations if magnetic monopoles (isolated north or south poles, also known as magnetic charges) exist.\n2.  **Review Maxwell's Equations:**\n    *   **Gauss's Law for Magnetism (∇ ⋅ B = 0):** This equation states that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero. Physically, this means there are no \"sources\" or \"sinks\" for the magnetic field—no magnetic monopoles. If monopoles existed, they would be sources/sinks, and this equation would have to change to include a term for magnetic charge density (e.g., ∇ ⋅ B = ρₘ). Thus, the equation for the **divergence of the magnetic field** must change.\n    *   **Faraday's Law of Induction (∇ × E = -∂B/∂t):** This equation relates a changing magnetic field to a circulating electric field (the curl of E). By symmetry, if magnetic charges exist, a moving magnetic charge would constitute a \"magnetic current.\" Just as an electric current creates a circulating magnetic field (in Ampère's Law), a magnetic current would create a circulating electric field. Therefore, Faraday's Law would need to be modified to include a magnetic current term. This means the equation for the **circulation of the electric field** must also change.\n3.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) Only mentions the divergence of B. This is true but incomplete.\n    *   B) Mentions divergence of B and curl of B. The curl of B (Ampère-Maxwell law) is not directly modified by the existence of static or moving magnetic charges.\n    *   C) Mentions circulation of B and flux of E. Incorrect.\n    *   D) Mentions circulation of E and divergence of B. This correctly identifies the two equations that would change based on our analysis.\n4.  **Construct the Code:** The Python code will print this reasoning and then select the correct option from the list.\n\n```python\ndef solve_maxwell_monopole_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes how Maxwell's equations would change with the existence of magnetic monopoles\n    and selects the correct multiple-choice option.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Thinking Process:\")\n    print(\"1.

This equation's physical meaning is that there are no magnetic monopoles. If monopoles existed, the magnetic field would diverge from them, so this equation must change.

This current would induce a circulating electric field, modifying Faraday's Law of Induction (∇ × E = -∂B/∂t). This affects the 'circulation of the electric field'.\")\n    print(\"4.
