    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   A strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), i.e., an alkene group.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks for \"vinyl-hydrogens\" (protons on a C=C double bond) confirms the presence of an alkene group, supporting the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a classic indicator of a carboxylic acid. This fragment corresponds to the [COOH]⁺ ion, which has a mass of approximately 12 (C) + 16 (O) + 16 (O) + 1 (H) = 45 amu.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Findings:**\n    *   The combined evidence from FTIR and Mass Spectrometry strongly indicates the molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This means the correct formula must contain **two oxygen atoms**.\n    *   The evidence from FTIR and 1H NMR proves the molecule also contains an alkene functional group (C=C).\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   We can immediately eliminate choices A (C6H12O) and C (C6H10O) because they only contain one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with B (C6H10O2) and D (C6H12O2). Let's calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) for each. The DBE formula for a compound with C, H, and O is `DBE = C - (H/2) + 1`.\n        *   A carboxylic acid's C=O bond counts as 1 DBE.\n        *   An alkene's C=C bond counts as 1 DBE.\n        *   Therefore, our target compound must have a total DBE of 1 + 1 = 2.\n    *   For **D) C6H12O2**: DBE = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = 1. This molecule only has one degree of unsaturation, which would be taken by the carboxylic acid's C=O bond. It cannot also have a C=C bond.\n    *   For **B) C6H10O2**: DBE = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = 2. This molecule has two degrees of unsaturation, which perfectly accommodates both one carboxylic acid group and one alkene group.\n\nThe following Python code systematically applies this logic to find the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef analyze_compound():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes spectroscopic data to identify the chemical formula of an unknown compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Summary of spectroscopic evidence\n    # Evidence 1: Presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH)\n    # - FTIR: Broad peak ~3000 cm-1 (O-H) and strong peak ~1700 cm-1 (C=O)\n    # - Mass Spec: Fragment at m/z = 45 ([COOH]+)\n    # Requirements from Evidence 1: The formula must contain 2 oxygen atoms and have at least 1 degree of unsaturation (DBE).\n    required_oxygens = 2\n    dbe_from_cooh = 1\n\n    # Evidence 2: Presence of an alkene group (C=C)\n    # - FTIR: Strong peak ~1650 cm-1 (C=C)\n    # - 1H NMR: Vinyl-hydrogen signals\n    # Requirements from Evidence 2: The formula must have at least 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    dbe_from_alkene = 1\n    \n    # Total requirements based on all evidence\n    total_required_dbe = dbe_from_cooh + dbe_from_alkene\n\n    # List of possible formulas and their corresponding choices\n    choices = {\n        \"A\": \"C6H12O\",\n        \"B\": \"C6H10O2\",\n        \"C\": \"C6H10O\",\n        \"D\": \"C6H12O2\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step evaluation of the options:\")\n    \n    correct_choice = None\n    \n    for choice, formula in sorted(choices.items()):\n        # Parse the formula to get atom counts\n        counts = {'C': 0, 'H': 0, 'O': 0}\n        parts = re.findall(r'([A-Z])(\\d*)', formula)\n        for element, count in parts:\n            counts[element] = int(count) if count else 1\n\n        # Calculate Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)\n        # DBE = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1 (Here, N=0)\n        dbe = counts['C'] - counts['H'] / 2 + 1\n\n        # Check if the formula meets the requirements\n        meets_oxygen_req = (counts['O'] == required_oxygens)\n        meets_dbe_req = (dbe == total_required_dbe)\n\n        print(f\"\\nAnalyzing choice {choice}: {formula}\")\n        print(f\" - Number of Oxygens: {counts['O']} (Required: {required_oxygens}) -> {'Met' if meets_oxygen_req else 'Not Met'}\")\n        print(f\" - Degree of Unsaturation (DBE): {int(dbe)} (Required: {total_required_dbe}) -> {'Met' if meets_dbe_req else 'Not Met'}\")\n\n        if meets_oxygen_req and meets_dbe_req:\n            correct_choice = choice\n            print(\" - Conclusion: This formula is consistent with all spectroscopic data.\")\n        else:\n            print(\" - Conclusion: This formula is NOT consistent with the data.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n-------------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"Final Answer: The only formula that fits all the evidence is {choices[correct_choice]}.\")\n    print(f\"The correct choice is {correct_choice}.\")\n\n\nanalyze_compound()\n```\n<<<B>>>"
