    "To design a molecular diagnostic kit for a retrovirus outbreak, we need to choose the most scientifically sound and efficient method. Let's break down the options:\n\n**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target:** The target is a **retrovirus**. The key characteristic of a retrovirus is that its genetic material is RNA, not DNA. It uses an enzyme called reverse transcriptase to create a DNA copy of its RNA genome inside a host cell.\n2.  **Analyze the Goal:** The goal is to design a **molecular diagnostic kit** for **quick detection**. \"Molecular\" means we are targeting the virus's genetic material (nucleic acids). \"Quick\" implies we need a rapid and efficient method suitable for an outbreak.\n3.  **Evaluate Option A:** Identifying a virus based on symptoms alone is unreliable, as many diseases share similar symptoms. Nested PCR, while sensitive, is more complex and time-consuming than other methods like real-time PCR, making it less ideal for \"quick\" diagnosis in a large-scale outbreak.\n4.  **Evaluate Option B:** This option is fundamentally flawed because it states \"performing DNA sequencing.\" Retroviruses have an RNA genome. You cannot directly perform DNA sequencing on an RNA virus without first converting its RNA to DNA.\n5.  **Evaluate Option C:** This option suggests developing an ELISA kit to detect IgG antibodies. An ELISA is an immunological test, not a molecular one, so it doesn't fit the primary requirement. Furthermore, IgG antibodies typically appear later in the course of an infection, making this method unsuitable for quick, early detection during an outbreak.\n6.  **Evaluate Option D:** This is the correct approach.\n    *   **cDNA sequencing:** To sequence an RNA virus, you must first use reverse transcriptase to convert the viral RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA). Sequencing this cDNA allows you to accurately determine the virus's genetic code.\n    *   **Real-time PCR (RT-qPCR):** Based on the sequence data, you can design highly specific primers and probes. Real-time reverse transcription PCR is a molecular technique that is the gold standard for viral diagnostics. It is extremely sensitive, specific, quantitative, and, most importantly, very fast, making it perfect for \"quick and accurate diagnosis\" during an outbreak.\n\nTherefore, option D outlines the most accurate and modern workflow for developing the required diagnostic kit.\n\n```python\n# The task is to select the best method for designing a quick molecular diagnostic kit for a retrovirus.\n\n# A retrovirus has an RNA genome. Any molecular technique must first account for this by converting the RNA to DNA.\n# The method should also be fast and accurate for use in an outbreak.\n\n# Option A is weak because identifying a virus by symptoms is unreliable.\n# Option B is incorrect because retroviruses have RNA genomes, not DNA genomes, so \"DNA sequencing\" is the wrong first step.\n# Option C is incorrect because ELISA is an immunological test, not a molecular one, and detecting IgG is not suitable for early diagnosis.\n# Option D is the correct and standard modern approach. You convert the viral RNA to complementary DNA (cDNA) for sequencing.\n# Based on the sequence, you develop a real-time PCR (specifically, RT-qPCR) kit, which is the gold standard for rapid, sensitive, and specific molecular diagnostics.\n\nbest_choice = 'D'\n\nprint(f\"The most appropriate method for designing a quick molecular diagnostic kit for a retrovirus outbreak is described in option D.\")\nprint(f\"Reasoning: Retroviruses have RNA genomes, which must be converted to cDNA for sequencing and PCR-based detection. Real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) is the fastest and most accurate molecular method for this purpose.\")\nprint(f\"The chosen option is: {best_choice}\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number or choice in the final print!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    There has been an outbreak of an viral infectious disease in your city.
