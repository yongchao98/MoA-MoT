    "Of course, let's break down this physics problem.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Principle:** The problem describes radioactive decay, which is a random, memoryless process. This \"memoryless\" property is key: the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is completely independent of how long it has already existed. The fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes has no effect on its future decay probability.\n2.  **Re-frame the Question:** Based on the memoryless principle, the problem simplifies to: \"What is the probability this atom will decay in a 150-minute interval?\"\n3.  **Use the Given Data to Model the Decay:**\n    *   The probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32% (0.32).\n    *   This means the probability of *survival* in 100 minutes is `1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n    *   The probability of survival over any time `t` follows an exponential relationship. We can express the probability of survival over 150 minutes based on the probability of survival over 100 minutes.\n4.  **Calculate the Final Probability:**\n    *   Let `P_s(t)` be the probability of surviving for time `t`.\n    *   We know `P_s(100) = 0.68`.\n    *   The survival probability for 150 minutes will be `P_s(150) = P_s(100) ^ (150/100) = 0.68 ^ 1.5`.\n    *   The probability of decay in 150 minutes is `1 - P_s(150)`.\n5.  **Write the Python Code:** We will implement the calculation from the previous step in Python to find the numerical answer and compare it with the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Step 1: Define the known information ---\n# The problem states the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%.\nprob_decay_100_min = 0.32\n\n# The core principle of radioactive decay is that it's a \"memoryless\" process.\n# This means the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant\n# to its future decay probability.\n# We just need to calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes.\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate the probability of survival in 100 minutes ---\nprob_survival_100_min = 1 - prob_decay_100_min\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculate the probability of survival in the new timeframe (150 minutes) ---\n# The survival probability scales exponentially with time.\n# P_survival(t) = P_survival(t_ref)^(t/t_ref)\ntime_ref = 100\ntime_new = 150\nprob_survival_150_min = prob_survival_100_min ** (time_new / time_ref)\n\n# --- Step 4: Calculate the probability of decay in 150 minutes ---\nprob_decay_150_min = 1 - prob_survival_150_min\n\n# --- Step 5: Convert to percentage and print the result ---\nresult_percentage = prob_decay_150_min * 100\n\nprint(f\"The probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes is: {result_percentage:.2f}%\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing this result with the given options:\")\nprint(\"A) 52%\")\nprint(\"B) 48%\")\nprint(\"C) 40%\")\nprint(\"D) 44%\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculated probability is closest to 44%.\")\n```\n<<<D>>>"
