    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Given Information and Goal:**\n    *   Distance (d) = 10^10 parsecs\n    *   Angular size (θ) = 10^-17 degrees\n    *   Goal: Find the order of magnitude of the black hole's entropy (S).\n\n2.  **Recall Key Formulas:**\n    *   Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy: S = (k_B * c³ * A) / (4 * ħ * G), where `A` is the event horizon area.\n    *   Event Horizon Area (assuming a non-rotating black hole): A = 4 * π * R_s², where `R_s` is the Schwarzschild radius.\n    *   Small-Angle Approximation: θ_rad ≈ (2 * R_s) / d, which relates the angular size in radians to the physical size (diameter `2 * R_s`) and distance.\n\n3.  **Unit Conversion:** All calculations must be performed in SI units.\n    *   Convert the distance `d` from parsecs to meters.\n    *   Convert the angular size `θ` from degrees to radians.\n\n4.  **Calculation Steps:**\n    *   First, rearrange the small-angle formula to solve for the Schwarzschild radius: R_s = (d_meters * θ_radians) / 2.\n    *   Next, use the calculated R_s to find the event horizon area: A = 4 * π * R_s².\n    *   Finally, plug the area `A` and the fundamental physical constants (k_B, c, ħ, G) into the Bekenstein-Hawking formula to calculate the entropy `S`.\n\n5.  **Determine Order of Magnitude:** Compare the calculated value of `S` to the provided options to find the correct order of magnitude.\n\nThis plan will be implemented in the Python code below.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define physical constants and input values in SI units\nG = 6.674e-11  # Gravitational constant (N m^2 / kg^2)\nc = 3.0e8       # Speed of light (m/s)\nk_B = 1.38e-23  # Boltzmann constant (J/K)\nh_bar = 1.054e-34 # Reduced Planck constant (J s)\n\n# Conversion factors\nparsec_to_meter = 3.086e16\ndegree_to_radian = math.pi / 180\n\n# Given values\nd_parsecs = 10e10 # Distance in parsecs, using 10e10 which is 10^11 but the problem states 10^10. Let's use 1e10\nd_parsecs = 1e10\ntheta_degrees = 1e-17\n\n# Step 2: Convert given values to SI units\nd_meters = d_parsecs * parsec_to_meter\ntheta_radians = theta_degrees * degree_to_radian\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the Schwarzschild radius (R_s) using the small-angle approximation\n# theta_radians = diameter / distance = 2 * R_s / d_meters\nR_s = (d_meters * theta_radians) / 2\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the area of the event horizon (A)\n# A = 4 * pi * R_s^2\nA = 4 * math.pi * (R_s**2)\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy (S)\n# S = (k_B * A * c^3) / (4 * G * h_bar)\nS = (k_B * A * (c**3)) / (4 * G * h_bar)\n\n# Step 6: Print the results and the final choice\nprint(\"Step-by-step calculation:\")\nprint(f\"Distance (d): {d_meters:.2e} m\")\nprint(f\"Angular size (θ): {theta_radians:.2e} rad\")\nprint(f\"Schwarzschild Radius (R_s): {R_s:.2e} m\")\nprint(f\"Event Horizon Area (A): {A:.2e} m^2\")\nprint(f\"Calculated Entropy (S): {S:.2e} J/K\")\n\nprint(\"\\nComparing the result to the given options:\")\nprint(\"A) 10^59 J/K\")\nprint(\"B) 10^65 J/K\")\nprint(\"C) 10^62 J/K\")\nprint(\"D) 10^66 J/K\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated entropy {S:.2e} J/K is on the order of magnitude of 10^62.\")\nprint(\"Therefore, the correct option is C.\")\n```\n<<<C>>>"
