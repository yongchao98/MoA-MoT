    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Nucleus and its Composition**: The nucleus X is specified as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons.\n    *   Lithium (Li) has an atomic number of 3, meaning it has 3 protons.\n    *   Given it has 3 neutrons.\n    *   The total number of nucleons (protons + neutrons) is 3 + 3 = 6.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Rest Mass Energy ($E_0$)**: The rest mass energy of the nucleus is the sum of the energies of its constituent protons and neutrons. We will use the standard mass-energy equivalents for a proton and a neutron.\n    *   Rest energy of a proton: ≈ 0.938272 GeV\n    *   Rest energy of a neutron: ≈ 0.939565 GeV\n    *   Total rest energy $E_0 = (3 \\times \\text{proton rest energy}) + (3 \\times \\text{neutron rest energy})$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**: The Lorentz factor is determined by the speed of the nucleus, which is given as v = 0.96c (where c is the speed of light).\n    *   The formula for the Lorentz factor is: $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n    *   In this case, v/c = 0.96.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Relativistic Energy (E)**: The total energy of the nucleus moving at a relativistic speed is given by the formula $E = \\gamma \\times E_0$.\n    *   We will multiply the Lorentz factor calculated in step 3 by the rest mass energy calculated in step 2.\n\n5.  **Compare and Choose the Answer**: The calculated energy will be compared against the given options to find the closest match.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1 & 2: Define constants and calculate the rest mass energy (E_0)\n# Rest energy of a proton in GeV\nmass_energy_proton_gev = 0.938272\n# Rest energy of a neutron in GeV\nmass_energy_neutron_gev = 0.939565\n\n# Composition of the Li nucleus\nnum_protons = 3\nnum_neutrons = 3\n\n# Calculate the total rest mass energy of the nucleus\nE_0 = (num_protons * mass_energy_proton_gev) + (num_neutrons * mass_energy_neutron_gev)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\n# The speed is given as 0.96c, so v/c (beta) is 0.96\nbeta = 0.96\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta**2)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the total relativistic energy (E)\ntotal_energy_gev = gamma * E_0\n\n# Step 5: Print the result and compare with the options\nprint(\"The calculated total energy of the nucleus is: {:.4f} GeV\".format(total_energy_gev))\n\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the options:\")\noptions = {\n    'A': 21.419,\n    'B': 20.132,\n    'C': 18.475,\n    'D': 23.069\n}\nprint(\"A) 21.419 GeV\")\nprint(\"B) 20.132 GeV\")\nprint(\"C) 18.475 GeV\")\nprint(\"D) 23.069 GeV\")\n\n# Find the closest option\nclosest_option = min(options, key=lambda k: abs(options[k] - total_energy_gev))\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated value is closest to option {closest_option}.\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>"
