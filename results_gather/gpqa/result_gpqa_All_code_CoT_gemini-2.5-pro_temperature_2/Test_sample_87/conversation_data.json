    "The process described is an adaptive immune response occurring in a secondary lymphoid organ (Peyer's patch) upon encountering an antigen (rotavirus proteins). Let's break down the options to identify the correct process.\n\n1.  **Analyze the context:**\n    *   **Location:** Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs in the intestine. These contain germinal centers where B cells mature.\n    *   **Stimulus:** Rotavirus proteins (antigen).\n    *   **Cell population:** Proliferating cells, which are characteristic of B cells undergoing clonal expansion after antigen recognition in a germinal center.\n    *   **Key observation:** \"High variability\" in the \"variable heavy chain gene\". The variable region is what binds to the antigen.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the choices:**\n    *   **A) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that initially creates B cell receptor diversity. It happens in the bone marrow during the development of B cells, *before* they encounter an antigen. The scenario describes a response *after* antigen exposure.\n    *   **B) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This process occurs within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs after B cells have been activated by an antigen. It introduces a high rate of point mutations specifically into the variable regions (which are encoded by the rearranged V, D, and J segments) of the immunoglobulin genes. This leads to \"high variability\" and allows for the selection of B cells with higher affinity for the antigen. This perfectly matches the observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain of proliferating cells in a Peyer's patch.\n    *   **C) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process also happens in germinal centers but changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain, not the *variable* region. It switches the antibody's class (e.g., from IgM to IgA), which alters its function, but does not change its antigen-binding specificity or increase variability in the variable region.\n    *   **D) Complement activation:** This is a part of the immune system involving a cascade of proteins in the blood. It does not involve any genetic changes to the B cell's immunoglobulin genes.\n\nBased on the analysis, the process responsible for high variability in the variable heavy chain gene *after* antigen exposure in a germinal center is somatic hypermutation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_immunology_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the biological scenario and identifies the correct immunological process.\n    \"\"\"\n    question = \"\"\"You tag the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with a GFP and deliver them to mice via oral gavage. \nBy in vivo imaging, you observe that some of the fluorescence was destroyed by the stomach acid, \nand some were entangled in the intestinal mucus before they reached the secondary lymphoid organs. \nYou identify the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolate the proliferating cell population. \nYou sequence their variable heavy chain gene and observe high variability.

The event takes place in Peyer's patches, a secondary lymphoid organ, after antigen exposure.\n    # 2. VDJ recombination occurs in primary lymphoid organs (bone marrow) before antigen exposure. So, A is incorrect.\n    # 3. Class switching recombination affects the constant region of the heavy chain, not the variable region mentioned in the question. So, C is incorrect.\n    # 4. Complement activation is a protein cascade in the blood and does not alter B cell genes. So, D is incorrect.\n    # 5. Somatic hypermutation specifically introduces point mutations (high variability) into the variable region of immunoglobulin genes in proliferating B cells within germinal centers (like those in Peyer's patches) to improve antibody affinity. This perfectly matches the scenario.\n    \n    correct_choice = \"B\"\n    \n    print(\"Question Analysis:\")\n    print(\"The key observation is 'high variability' in the 'variable heavy chain gene' of a 'proliferating cell population' isolated from 'Peyer's patches' after antigen stimulation.\")\n    print(\"\\nEvaluating the Options:\")\n    print(\"A) VDJ recombination: Occurs before antigen encounter in the bone marrow.\")\n    print(\"B) Somatic hypermutation: Occurs after antigen encounter in secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches) and introduces high variability into the variable gene region to refine antibody binding.
