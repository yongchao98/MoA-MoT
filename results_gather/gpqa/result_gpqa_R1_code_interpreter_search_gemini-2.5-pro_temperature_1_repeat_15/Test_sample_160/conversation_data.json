    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning process to determine the relationship between λ₁ and λ₂.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Definitions of λ₁ and λ₂**\n\n*   **λ₁ (Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules):** This is the average distance a gas molecule travels before it collides with *another gas molecule*. The key factors are the number density of gas molecules (n) and the collision cross-section between two gas molecules (σ₁).\n*   **λ₂ (Mean Free Path of Electrons):** This is the average distance an electron from the beam travels before it collides (scatters) with a *gas molecule*. The key factors are the same number density of gas molecules (n) and the scattering cross-section for an electron hitting a gas molecule (σ₂).\n\n### **2. The Formula for Mean Free Path (MFP)**\n\nThe general formula for the mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the number density of target particles (n) and the collision cross-section (σ):\n\nλ = 1 / (n * σ)\n\n*   For λ₁, which involves collisions between identical, moving gas molecules, a correction factor for relative motion (√2) is typically included:\n    λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ₁)\n\n*   For λ₂, the projectile is a very high-speed electron (1000 kV is relativistic), and the target gas molecules are comparatively stationary. Therefore, the correction factor is not used:\n    λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ₂)\n\nThe number density of gas molecules, *n*, is the same in both scenarios because the vacuum conditions and temperature do not change.\n\n### **3. Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ₁ vs. σ₂)**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in comparing the two cross-sections:\n\n*   **σ₁ (Gas-Gas Collision Cross-Section):** This is essentially a \"hard-sphere\" collision. The cross-section is determined by the physical size of the electron clouds of the gas molecules. Two molecules collide when their electron clouds get close enough to repel each other. This area, σ₁, is relatively large and is related to the kinetic diameter of the molecule (σ₁ ≈ πd²).\n\n*   **σ₂ (Electron-Gas Scattering Cross-Section):** This is a completely different interaction. An electron is a point-like particle, vastly smaller than a gas molecule. A high-energy (1 MeV) electron interacts with the gas molecule via the electrostatic force (Coulomb interaction). Because of its high speed and small size, the electron can easily pass through the \"empty space\" within the molecule's electron cloud without significant interaction. A \"collision\" or scattering event only occurs if it passes very close to the nucleus or one of the molecule's own electrons.\n\n**Conclusion:** The effective area that a gas molecule presents to a high-energy electron (σ₂) is much, much smaller than the area it presents to another gas molecule (σ₁).\n\nTherefore: **σ₂ << σ₁**\n\n### **4. Determine the Relationship between λ₁ and λ₂**\n\nNow we can compare the two mean free paths using the formulas and our conclusion about the cross-sections.\n\n*   λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ₁)\n*   λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ₂)\n\nSince σ₂ is much smaller than σ₁, the denominator for λ₂ (n * σ₂) is much smaller than the denominator for λ₁ (√2 * n * σ₁). A smaller denominator results in a larger value.\n\nTherefore: **λ₂ >> λ₁**\n\nThe electron will travel, on average, a significantly longer distance before scattering than a gas molecule will before colliding with another molecule.\n\n### **5. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nLet's look at the options in light of our conclusion that λ₂ is much larger than λ₁.\n\n*   A) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22*λ₁: This suggests λ₂ is only slightly larger than λ₁. This is incorrect; the difference should be substantial.\n*   B) λ₂ >= 1.22*λ₁: This states that λ₂ is larger than λ₁ by at least a factor of 1.22. Since we concluded that λ₂ >> λ₁, this statement is consistent with our physical reasoning. Even in a very conservative estimate where σ₂ was equal to σ₁, the ratio λ₂/λ₁ would be √2 ≈ 1.414, which satisfies the condition. Since σ₂ is actually much smaller than σ₁, the ratio will be much larger, making this statement definitively true.\n*   C) λ₂ = λ₁, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: This is incorrect as the collision physics are fundamentally different.\n*   D) λ₂ < λ₁: This is the opposite of what the physics predicts.\n\nThe only option that correctly reflects the physical reality is B. The factor 1.22 is likely included as a distractor or a very conservative lower bound, but the inequality is correct.\n\n<<<B>>>"
