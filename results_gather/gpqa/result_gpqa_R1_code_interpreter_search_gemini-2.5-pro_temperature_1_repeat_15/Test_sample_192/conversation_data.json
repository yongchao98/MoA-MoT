    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the relationship between distance and parallax.**\n    Parallax (plx) is a measure of the apparent shift of a star against the background as the Earth orbits the Sun. It is inversely proportional to the distance (r) to the star. The relationship is given by:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n    This means a larger parallax corresponds to a smaller distance, and vice versa.\n\n2.  **Interpret the given information.**\n    The problem states that \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\". In astronomy, when we talk about \"the number of stars\" as a function of a property like distance or parallax, we are typically referring to the cumulative number. In this case, it means the number of stars (N) with a parallax *greater than* a certain value `plx` is proportional to `1/plx^5`.\n    So, we can write this as a proportionality:\n    `N(>plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\n3.  **Express the number of stars as a function of distance.**\n    We want to find how the number of stars changes with distance `r`. We need to convert the given relationship from parallax `plx` to distance `r`.\n    Since `plx = 1/r`, a parallax *greater than* `plx` corresponds to a distance *less than* `r`. Therefore, the number of stars within a distance `r`, denoted as `N(<r)`, is equivalent to `N(>plx)`.\n    We can substitute `plx = 1/r` into our proportionality:\n    `N(<r) ∝ 1 / (1/r)^5`\n    `N(<r) ∝ 1 / (1/r^5)`\n    `N(<r) ∝ r^5`\n    This tells us that the total (cumulative) number of stars out to a distance `r` is proportional to the fifth power of the distance.\n\n4.  **Determine the number of stars per unit range of distance.**\n    The question asks for \"how the number of stars ... change[s] with distance (per unit range of distance, r)\". This quantity is the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to distance, which is the derivative of the cumulative number `N(<r)` with respect to `r`. Mathematically, this is `dN/dr`.\n    We start with the proportionality `N(<r) ∝ r^5`. Let's introduce a constant of proportionality, k, so that we have an equation:\n    `N(<r) = k * r^5`\n    Now, we differentiate `N(<r)` with respect to `r`:\n    `dN/dr = d/dr (k * r^5)`\n    Using the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n    `dN/dr = 5 * k * r^(5-1)`\n    `dN/dr = 5 * k * r^4`\n\n5.  **Find the final proportionality.**\n    From the derivative, we can see that `dN/dr` is proportional to `r^4`:\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^4`\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options.**\n    The result `~ r^4` matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
