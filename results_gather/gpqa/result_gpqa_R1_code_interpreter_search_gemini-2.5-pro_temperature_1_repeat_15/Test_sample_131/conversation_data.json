    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Analyze the spectral data provided:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14.\n*   **Mixture:** The two compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n*   **Aromatic Region (around 6.7 ppm):** The 1H NMR spectrum shows two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (around 2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each potential compound based on its structure and symmetry.**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical (D2h point group). It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** corresponding to 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** All four methyl groups (at C1, C2, C4, C5) are chemically equivalent. They will appear as a single **singlet** corresponding to 12H.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry (Cs point group) that passes through the C2-CH3 and C5-CH3 groups.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are reflected onto each other by the plane of symmetry, making them chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a single **singlet** corresponding to 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H total).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (3H).\n        *   This results in three distinct **singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 3 aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry (Cs point group) that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent. However, they are adjacent (ortho) to each other, so they will couple and split each other's signals. This will result in a **multiplet (an AB quartet or a pair of doublets)**, not a singlet.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent (6H total), and the methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent (6H total). This gives two **singlets** in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic multiplet (2H), 2 aliphatic singlets (6H, 6H).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical (D2h point group).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four protons are chemically equivalent, resulting in one **singlet** for 4H.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The CH2 protons will appear as a **quartet** (4H), and the CH3 protons will appear as a **triplet** (6H).\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (4H), 1 aliphatic quartet (4H), 1 aliphatic triplet (6H).\n\n**3. Evaluate the options based on the combined spectrum of a 1:1 mixture.**\n\n*   **Aromatic Region Analysis (Two singlets, 1:1 ratio):**\n    *   The mixture must contain two compounds that *each* produce an aromatic singlet. This immediately rules out any combination containing **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**, which produces a multiplet. So, options A and B are incorrect.\n    *   The mixture cannot contain **1,4-diethylbenzene**. Its aromatic singlet corresponds to 4H. If mixed with 1,2,4,5-TMB (2H singlet) or 1,2,3,5-TMB (2H singlet), the aromatic signal ratio would be 4H:2H or 2:1, not 1:1. So, option D is incorrect.\n    *   The only remaining possibility is a mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** (which has a 2H aromatic singlet) and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene** (which also has a 2H aromatic singlet). In a 1:1 mixture, these two singlets would have a 1:1 integration ratio, perfectly matching the data. This points directly to option C.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region Analysis (Three singlets, 2:1:1 ratio):**\n    *   Let's confirm that Option C also explains the aliphatic region.\n    *   **Compound 1 (1,2,4,5-TMB):** Provides one singlet of 12H intensity.\n    *   **Compound 2 (1,2,3,5-TMB):** Provides three singlets of 6H, 3H, and 3H intensity.\n    *   The problem states that a total of only **three** aliphatic singlets are observed in the mixture. This implies an *accidental overlap* of signals.\n    *   Let's assume there is an accidental overlap (degeneracy) of the two 3H signals from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. This is a common occurrence. These two signals would merge into a single signal with an intensity of 6H.\n    *   So, the signals in the mixture would be:\n        1.  The 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB.\n        2.  The 6H singlet from 1,2,3,5-TMB.\n        3.  The combined 6H (3H + 3H) singlet from 1,2,3,5-TMB.\n    *   This gives three total aliphatic signals with an integration of 12H : 6H : 6H.\n    *   The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only pair of compounds that satisfies all the conditions of the 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
