    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **DoU Calculation:** The formula for the degree of unsaturation is DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n*   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   A DoU of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (e.g., a C=O carbonyl group).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region (3500-3300 cm⁻¹) is a classic indicator of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**. One band is for the asymmetric N-H stretch, and the other is for the symmetric N-H stretch.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a strong absorption in the carbonyl (C=O) region. This frequency is characteristic of an **ester** (typically 1750-1735 cm⁻¹) or possibly an aromatic ketone. Given the presence of two oxygen atoms in the formula, an ester is the most likely functional group.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl (-CH₃) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (t, triplet):** The signal is split into three lines, which means it's adjacent to a group with two protons (n+1=3, so n=2), i.e., a methylene (-CH₂-) group. This suggests a `-CH₂-CH₃` fragment.\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents a methylene (-CH₂) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (q, quartet):** The signal is split into four lines, meaning it's adjacent to a group with three protons (n+1=4, so n=3), i.e., a methyl (-CH₃) group.\n    *   **Conclusion from 1.20 & 4.5 ppm:** Together, these two signals confirm the presence of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very high (downfield) chemical shift for a CH₂ group. This indicates it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, which is consistent with the oxygen of an ester: **-O-CH₂CH₃**.\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Corresponds to two protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (bs, broad singlet):** A broad signal for 2H in this region is characteristic of the protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The broadness is caused by the quadrupole moment of the nitrogen atom and chemical exchange. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift Region (7.0-8.0 ppm):** This is the aromatic region. The total integration (2H + 2H = 4H) confirms a disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** The pattern of two doublets is highly characteristic of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Relative Chemical Shifts:** The doublet at the lower field (more deshielded) of **8.0 ppm** must be ortho to a strong electron-withdrawing group (EWG), such as the ester's carbonyl group. The doublet at the higher field (more shielded) of **7.0 ppm** must be ortho to an electron-donating group (EDG), such as the amino group.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following fragments:\n*   A primary amine group (-NH₂)\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃)\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring\n\nPutting these pieces together, we get a structure where the -NH₂ group and the -COOCH₂CH₃ group are attached to the benzene ring in a para (1,4) arrangement. This structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n**5. Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, not a para-substituted ester.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine and an ester.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all the data: primary amine, ethyl ester, and 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring with the correct electronic effects influencing the proton chemical shifts.\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. This is an isomer, but the \"ethyl\" part is from a propionyl group (-COCH₂CH₃). The CH₂ in this group would appear around 2.5-3.0 ppm, not at 4.5 ppm.\n\n<<<C>>>"
