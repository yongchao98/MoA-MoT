    "An oscillating charge distribution acts as a source of electromagnetic radiation. To solve this problem, we need to determine the angular distribution of the radiated power and its dependence on the wavelength. The standard approach is to use the multipole expansion of the radiation fields.\n\n1.  **Identify the dominant radiation type:**\n    The source is described as an \"oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape\" with the symmetry axis along the z-axis. The term \"oscillating\" can be interpreted in a few ways, but the most common and fundamental type of oscillation for a charge distribution is one that produces a time-varying electric dipole moment.\n    *   For example, if the spheroid has a net charge and its center of mass oscillates along the z-axis, it constitutes an oscillating electric dipole.\n    *   Alternatively, if charges on the spheroid oscillate along the z-axis (e.g., flowing from the poles to the equator and back), this also creates an oscillating electric dipole moment along the z-axis.\n\n    Unless the oscillation is of a very specific symmetric type (like a purely deformational mode of a neutral object where the dipole moment is always zero), the electric dipole radiation will be the dominant term in the far-field (radiation zone). Higher-order multipoles, like the electric quadrupole, radiate much less efficiently. Therefore, it is reasonable to model the source as an oscillating electric dipole.\n\n2.  **Determine the angular distribution of power:**\n    For an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dOmega`) is given by:\n    `dP/dOmega = C * sin^2(theta)`\n    where `theta` is the polar angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis), and `C` is a constant that depends on the frequency and magnitude of the dipole moment.\n\n    The function `f` in the question is this power per unit solid angle, so `f(lambda, theta)` is proportional to `sin^2(theta)`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the fraction of maximum power:**\n    The maximum radiated power per unit solid angle, `A`, occurs when `sin^2(theta)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin^2(theta)` is 1, which happens at `theta = 90°` (in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n    So, `A` is proportional to `sin^2(90°) = 1`.\n\n    We need to find the power radiated at an angle `theta = 30°`. At this angle, the power is proportional to `sin^2(30°)`.\n    We know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\n    Therefore, `sin^2(30°) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4`.\n\n    The fraction of the maximum power `A` that is radiated at `30°` is the ratio of the power at `30°` to the power at `90°`:\n    Fraction = `sin^2(30°) / sin^2(90°) = (1/4) / 1 = 1/4`.\n\n4.  **Determine the wavelength dependence:**\n    The power radiated by an oscillating dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency, `omega^4`.\n    The angular frequency `omega` is related to the wavelength `lambda` by the expression `omega = 2 * pi * f = 2 * pi * c / lambda`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n    Therefore, the radiated power is proportional to `(1/lambda)^4`, or `lambda^(-4)`.\n    So, a possible form for the function `f(lambda, theta)` must include a `lambda^(-4)` factor.\n\n5.  **Combine the results:**\n    The fraction of the maximum power radiated at `theta = 30°` is `1/4`.\n    A possible functional form for the power dependence on wavelength is `lambda^(-4)`.\n    Matching these two results with the given options, we find that option D fits our conclusions.\n\n    *Note on the alternative (quadrupole radiation):* If the oscillation were such that the dipole moment was zero and the electric quadrupole moment was the first non-vanishing term (e.g., a spheroid deforming from prolate to oblate), the power would be proportional to `sin^2(theta)cos^2(theta)` and `lambda^(-6)`. This would lead to a fraction of `3/4` and a `lambda^(-6)` dependence (Option A). However, as argued above, dipole radiation is the most general and dominant form for a simple \"oscillating charge distribution\".\n\n<<<D>>>"
