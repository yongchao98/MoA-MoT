    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the operators:**\n    The problem provides the components of the quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$:\n    *   $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x$\n    *   $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$\n    *   $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z$\n    These are the standard spin-1/2 operators, where $\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$ are the Pauli matrices. The particle being a muon confirms it's a spin-1/2 system.\n\n2.  **Define the direction vector:**\n    The direction $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane. A general unit vector $\\vec{n}$ in spherical coordinates is given by $(\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis and $\\phi$ is the azimuthal angle from the x-axis.\n    For a vector in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. This happens when $\\phi=0$.\n    So, the unit vector is $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n3.  **Construct the operator along the direction $\\vec{n}$:**\n    The operator for the spin along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n    $P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n    $P_n = (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x) \\sin\\theta + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y) (0) + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z) \\cos\\theta$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (\\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta)$\n    Substituting the matrices for $\\sigma_x$ and $\\sigma_z$:\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right)$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Set up and solve the eigenvalue equation:**\n    We need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$. The eigenvalue equation is:\n    $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$\n    Let the eigenvector be $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    We can cancel the factor $\\hbar/2$ from both sides:\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    This gives us a system of two linear equations:\n    1) $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n    2) $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\n    From the first equation:\n    $b \\sin\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    To simplify this, we use the trigonometric half-angle identities:\n    $\\sin\\theta = 2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)$\n    $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n    Substituting these into the equation:\n    $b (2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)) = a (2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2))$\n    Assuming $\\sin(\\theta/2) \\neq 0$ (i.e., $\\theta \\neq 0$), we can divide by $2 \\sin(\\theta/2)$:\n    $b \\cos(\\theta/2) = a \\sin(\\theta/2)$\n    This gives the ratio of the components:\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n    So, the eigenvector is proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$. We can choose $a = \\cos(\\theta/2)$, which gives $b = \\sin(\\theta/2)$.\n    The unnormalized eigenvector is $|\\psi\\rangle = C \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$ for some constant C.\n\n5.  **Normalize the eigenvector:**\n    The normalization condition is $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$. The squared norm of our vector is:\n    $|\\cos(\\theta/2)|^2 + |\\sin(\\theta/2)|^2 = \\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$\n    The vector is already normalized. So we can take the normalization constant $C=1$.\n    The normalized eigenvector is:\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
