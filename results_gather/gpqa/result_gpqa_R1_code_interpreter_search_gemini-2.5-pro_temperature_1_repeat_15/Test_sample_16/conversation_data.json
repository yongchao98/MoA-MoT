    "This problem requires us to calculate the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) from the dissociation of a Ca-EDTA complex solution.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical Equilibrium**\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex ($[CaY]^{2-}$) from calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) and the fully deprotonated EDTA ligand ($Y^{4-}$) is given by the reaction:\n$Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons [CaY]^{2-}$\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this formation reaction is the formation constant, $K_f$ (also denoted as $K_{Ca-EDTA}$).\n$K_f = \\frac{[[CaY]^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\nIn our solution, we start with the complex, which will slightly dissociate back into its constituent ions. The relevant equilibrium is the dissociation reaction, which is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n$[CaY]^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\n**2. Determine the Dissociation Constant ($K_d$)**\n\nThe equilibrium constant for the dissociation reaction, $K_d$, is the inverse of the formation constant, $K_f$:\n$K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n**3. Set up an ICE Table**\n\nWe can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ ions formed from the dissociation of the complex.\n\n| Species         | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n|-----------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n| $[CaY]^{2-}$    | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| $Ca^{2+}$       | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| $Y^{4-}$        | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n*Note: The problem states \"we assume that the pH is ideal\". This is a key simplification, meaning we assume all free EDTA exists as the fully deprotonated $Y^{4-}$ form. This occurs at high pH (typically >10) where the conditional formation constant equals the absolute formation constant.*\n\n**4. Write the Equilibrium Expression and Solve for x**\n\nNow, we substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the dissociation constant expression:\n$K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}{[[CaY]^{2-}]}$\n$2 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{(0.02 - x)}$\n\nSince $K_d$ is extremely small, we can assume that the amount of complex that dissociates, 'x', is negligible compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). This simplifies the denominator:\n$0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\nThe expression becomes:\n$2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n\nNow, we solve for x:\n$x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times 0.02$\n$x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n$x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n$x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$, is equal to x.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions in the solution is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
