    "An organic moiety shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups) or the presence of axial chirality (as seen in some substituted biphenyls, called atropisomers).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl compound. The two phenyl rings are linked by a C-C single bond.\n    *   **Substitution:** Each phenyl ring has a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃) at an *ortho* position (positions 2 and 2') and a nitro group (-NO₂) at the other *ortho* position (positions 6 and 6').\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The groups at the *ortho* positions (-COOCH₃ and -NO₂) are bulky. Their size creates significant steric hindrance, which prevents the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This restricted rotation forces the two rings to be non-coplanar. Because each ring is asymmetrically substituted (with respect to the bond connecting the rings), the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. This type of chirality, arising from hindered rotation about a single bond, is called **atropisomerism** (a form of axial chirality). The molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable enantiomers. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule is an ester derived from lactic acid. Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   A carbon atom bonded to four different groups is a **chiral center** (or asymmetric carbon). A molecule containing a single chiral center is always chiral and will exist as a pair of enantiomers (R and S forms). Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** Also known as diphenylmethanone, its structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It consists of a carbonyl group bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** The molecule has no chiral centers. Furthermore, the molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Any molecule that has a plane of symmetry is **achiral** and cannot be optically active. Its mirror image is superimposable on the original molecule. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid. Its structure is *trans*-CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality Analysis:** This molecule is planar. The plane of the molecule itself is a plane of symmetry. It also has a center of inversion. The presence of these symmetry elements means the molecule is **achiral**. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nCompounds 1 and 2 are chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and will not.\n\nThus, the correct option includes only 1 and 2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
