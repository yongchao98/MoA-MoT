    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Reactant Molecule**\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.\n\n*   **Parent Structure:** A six-membered ring with a double bond, `cyclohex-3-ene`.\n*   **Functional Groups and Substituents:**\n    1.  A `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH). By IUPAC convention, the carbon of the ring attached to this primary functional group is C1.\n    2.  A `formyl` group (-CHO, an aldehyde) at position C2.\n    3.  A `vinyl` group (-CH=CH2) at position C5.\n    4.  A carbon-carbon double bond (`C=C`) within the ring between C3 and C4.\n\nTo understand the transformation, we need to identify all the features that can be reduced. These are:\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which contains a C=O double bond.\n*   The formyl group (-CHO), which contains a C=O double bond.\n*   The vinyl group (-CH=CH2), which contains a C=C double bond.\n*   The double bond within the cyclohexene ring.\n\nThe molecule also has one ring.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, for the reactant can be calculated by summing the number of rings and pi (π) bonds:\n*   1 ring\n*   1 π bond in the cyclohexene ring (C=C)\n*   1 π bond in the vinyl group (C=C)\n*   1 π bond in the carboxylic acid group (C=O)\n*   1 π bond in the formyl group (C=O)\n*   **Total IHD of reactant = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5**\n\n### **2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent used is **red phosphorus and excess of HI** (Hydroiodic acid).\n\n*   This is a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry.\n*   Its primary function is to reduce various functional groups completely down to the corresponding alkane.\n*   Specifically, it will perform the following reductions on the reactant:\n    *   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH)** is reduced to a **methyl group (-CH3)**.\n    *   **Aldehyde (-CHO)** is reduced to a **methyl group (-CH3)**.\n    *   **All C=C double bonds** are reduced to **C-C single bonds** (hydrogenation). This applies to both the vinyl group and the double bond in the ring.\n\n### **3. Determine the Structure and Formula of the Product**\n\nLet's apply the effects of the reduction to our starting material:\n\n*   The `cyclohex-3-ene` ring becomes a `cyclohexane` ring (the C=C bond is saturated).\n*   The `carboxylic acid` group at C1 becomes a `methyl` group.\n*   The `formyl` group at C2 becomes a `methyl` group.\n*   The `vinyl` group at C5 becomes an `ethyl` group (-CH2-CH3).\n\nThe final product is a **saturated substituted cyclohexane**. It has no double bonds, and all oxygen atoms have been removed. The carbon skeleton is preserved.\n\n*   **Carbon Count:** The number of carbon atoms does not change during this reduction. We can count them in the reactant: 6 (ring) + 1 (COOH) + 1 (CHO) + 2 (vinyl) = 10 carbon atoms. So, the product has 10 carbon atoms.\n*   **Structure:** The product is a monocyclic (one ring) alkane.\n*   **General Formula:** The general formula for a saturated monocyclic alkane is **CnH2n**.\n*   **Molecular Formula of Product:** Since n = 10, the molecular formula of the product is **C10H20**.\n\n### **4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe IHD can be calculated in two ways:\n\n**Method 1: From the structure**\nIHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds)\n*   Number of rings in the product = 1 (the cyclohexane ring).\n*   Number of π bonds in the product = 0 (the molecule is fully saturated).\n*   **IHD = 1 + 0 = 1**\n\n**Method 2: From the molecular formula (C10H20)**\nThe formula for IHD is: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2), where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens.\n*   IHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2)\n*   IHD = 11 - 10\n*   **IHD = 1**\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<C>>>"
