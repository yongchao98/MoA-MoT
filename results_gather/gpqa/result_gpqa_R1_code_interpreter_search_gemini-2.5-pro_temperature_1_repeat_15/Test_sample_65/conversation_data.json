    "SMEFT, the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, is a theoretical framework that extends the Standard Model (SM) by adding higher-dimensional operators. The construction of SMEFT is based on certain fundamental assumptions about the nature of physics at energies below some new physics scale Î›.\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry:** SMEFT is constructed as a Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory. This means the laws of physics are the same for all inertial observers. All terms in the SMEFT Lagrangian, including the higher-dimensional operators, are constructed to be Lorentz scalars. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.\n\n2.  **Poincare symmetry:** Poincare symmetry is a combination of Lorentz symmetry (boosts and rotations) and spacetime translations. Like Lorentz symmetry, it is a fundamental symmetry of spacetime that is assumed to hold in SMEFT. The Lagrangian is invariant under Poincare transformations. Thus, Poincare symmetry must be respected.\n\n3.  **CP symmetry:** CP symmetry (Charge-Parity) is known to be violated in the Standard Model, specifically in the weak interactions (as described by the CKM matrix in the quark sector). Since SMEFT is an extension of the SM, it is not required to be CP-symmetric. In fact, many higher-dimensional operators in SMEFT can introduce new sources of CP violation beyond the SM. Therefore, CP symmetry is *not* a required symmetry for all operators.\n\n4.  **CPT symmetry:** The CPT theorem is a fundamental result in quantum field theory. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be invariant under the combined transformation of CPT (Charge-Parity-Time). SMEFT is formulated as a local, Lorentz-invariant theory, so it must respect CPT symmetry. All operators in the SMEFT Lagrangian must be CPT-invariant.\n\nBased on this reasoning:\n-   Lorentz symmetry (1) must be respected.\n-   Poincare symmetry (2) must be respected.\n-   CP symmetry (3) is not required to be respected.\n-   CPT symmetry (4) must be respected.\n\nTherefore, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry. This corresponds to options 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
