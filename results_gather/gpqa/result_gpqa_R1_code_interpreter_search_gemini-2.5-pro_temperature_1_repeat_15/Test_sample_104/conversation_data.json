    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Starspot Signal:**\n    The star has one hemisphere covered with spots and one that is clear. As the star rotates, an observer sees a periodic change in brightness.\n    *   **Maximum Brightness (F_max):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The flux is proportional to the effective temperature of the photosphere raised to the fourth power, according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law (Flux ∝ T⁴). So, `F_max ∝ T_eff⁴`.\n    *   **Minimum Brightness (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere is facing the observer. This hemisphere is a composite of the regular photosphere and cooler, dark spots. The filling factor `f` tells us that 20% (or 0.20) of this hemisphere's area is covered by spots, and the remaining 80% (or 0.80) is the normal photosphere. The total flux is the sum of the flux from these two components.\n        *   Flux from the photosphere part: `(1 - f) * T_eff⁴`\n        *   Flux from the spot part: `f * T_spot⁴`\n        *   So, `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Amplitude of the Starspot Signal:**\n    The amplitude of the variation in the light curve is the relative difference between the maximum and minimum flux, normalized by the maximum flux.\n    *   Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\n    *   Substituting the expressions from step 1:\n        Amplitude = [T_eff⁴ - ((1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴)] / T_eff⁴\n    *   Simplifying the numerator:\n        Amplitude = [T_eff⁴ - T_eff⁴ + f * T_eff⁴ - f * T_spot⁴] / T_eff⁴\n        Amplitude = [f * T_eff⁴ - f * T_spot⁴] / T_eff⁴\n    *   Factoring out `f` and `T_eff⁴`:\n        Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot⁴ / T_eff⁴))\n        Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)\n\n3.  **Understand the Exoplanet Transit Signal:**\n    The question asks what size exoplanet would produce the *same amplitude signal* if it were transiting a non-spotted version of the star. The amplitude of a transit signal (also known as the transit depth) is the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n    *   Transit Depth = (Area_planet) / (Area_star)\n    *   Transit Depth = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²)\n    *   Transit Depth = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n4.  **Equate the Signals and Solve:**\n    We set the amplitude from the starspots equal to the transit depth from the hypothetical exoplanet.\n    *   (R_pl / R_star)² = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)\n    *   R_pl / R_star = sqrt[ f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴) ]\n\n5.  **Plug in the Values and Compute:**\n    *   Star's effective temperature, T_eff = 6000 K\n    *   Spot temperature, T_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n    *   Spot filling factor, f = 20% = 0.20\n\n    We can use a Python script to perform the calculation accurately.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the given parameters\nT_eff = 6000.0  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\nT_spot = 5000.0 # Temperature of the spots in Kelvin\nf = 0.20        # Filling factor of the spots\n\n# Calculate the amplitude of the signal caused by the starspots\n# Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\namplitude_spots = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)**4)\n\n# For an exoplanet transit, the signal amplitude (transit depth) is (R_pl / R_star)**2.\n# We set this equal to the amplitude from the spots to find the equivalent planet radius.\n# (R_pl / R_star)**2 = amplitude_spots\n# R_pl / R_star = sqrt(amplitude_spots)\nrpl_rstar_ratio = np.sqrt(amplitude_spots)\n\nprint(f\"{rpl_rstar_ratio:.2f}\")\n```\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.32. This value corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The user wants to find the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet (`Rpl/Rstar`) that would produce a transit signal with the same amplitude as the rotational modulation signal caused by starspots on the host star.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the signal from the starspots.**\n\nThe brightness variation is caused by the star's rotation, which brings a spotted hemisphere and an unspotted hemisphere into view.\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere, with a uniform temperature `T_eff`, is facing the observer. The flux is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature, according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n    `F_max ∝ T_eff⁴`\n\n*   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere is facing the observer. This hemisphere is a composite of the normal photosphere (temperature `T_eff`) and cooler spots (temperature `T_spot`). The spots cover a fraction `f` of the hemisphere's area.\n    *   The fraction of the area with temperature `T_eff` is `(1 - f)`.\n    *   The fraction of the area with temperature `T_spot` is `f`.\n    *   The total flux from this hemisphere is the weighted sum of the fluxes from the two components.\n    `F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴`\n\n*   **Amplitude of the Spot Signal:** The amplitude of the photometric variation is the relative difference between the maximum and minimum flux.\n    `Amplitude_spot = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n    `Amplitude_spot = [T_eff⁴ - ((1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴)] / T_eff⁴`\n    `Amplitude_spot = [T_eff⁴ - T_eff⁴ + f * T_eff⁴ - f * T_spot⁴] / T_eff⁴`\n    `Amplitude_spot = [f * T_eff⁴ - f * T_spot⁴] / T_eff⁴`\n    `Amplitude_spot = f * (1 - T_spot⁴ / T_eff⁴)`\n    `Amplitude_spot = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the signal from a transiting exoplanet.**\n\nThe signal from a transiting exoplanet, known as the transit depth, is the fraction of the star's light that is blocked by the planet. This is equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n\n*   `Area_planet = π * R_pl²`\n*   `Area_star = π * R_star²`\n*   **Amplitude of the Planet Signal (Transit Depth):**\n    `Amplitude_planet = Area_planet / Area_star`\n    `Amplitude_planet = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²)`\n    `Amplitude_planet = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\n### **Step 3: Equate the signals and solve for the planet-to-star radius ratio.**\n\nThe problem states that the two signals have the same amplitude.\n\n*   `Amplitude_planet = Amplitude_spot`\n*   `(R_pl / R_star)² = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`\n*   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt[ f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴) ]`\n\n### **Step 4: Substitute the given values and calculate the result.**\n\nThe given values are:\n*   `T_eff = 6000 K`\n*   Temperature difference = `1000 K`, so `T_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K`\n*   Filling factor `f = 20% = 0.20`\n\nNow, we can perform the calculation.\n*   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt[ 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴) ]`\n*   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt[ 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴) ]`\n*   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt[ 0.20 * (1 - 625/1296) ]`\n*   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt[ 0.20 * (1 - 0.48225) ]`\n*   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt[ 0.20 * 0.51775 ]`\n*   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt[ 0.10355 ]`\n*   `R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218`\n\nThe result is approximately 0.32.\n\nComparing this to the options:\nA) ~0.32\nB) ~0.11\nC) ~0.07\nD) ~0.39\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
