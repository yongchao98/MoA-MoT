    "This problem requires us to determine the pH of a mixture of a weak acid (CH3COOH), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)2). The approach involves calculating the initial moles of all acidic and basic species, performing neutralization reactions in a specific order, and then calculating the pH based on the final composition of the solution.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Calculate the initial moles of acids and bases.**\n    *   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n        *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n        *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n        *   Moles = 0.1 mol/L * 0.500 L = **0.050 mol CH3COOH**\n\n    *   **Moles of H+ from HCl (strong acid):**\n        *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n        *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n        *   HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely: HCl -> H+ + Cl-\n        *   Moles = 0.2 mol/L * 0.400 L = **0.080 mol H+**\n\n    *   **Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**\n        *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n        *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n        *   Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates completely: Ba(OH)2 -> Ba2+ + 2OH-\n        *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 mol/L * 0.300 L = 0.090 mol\n        *   Moles of OH- = 2 * 0.090 mol = **0.180 mol OH-**\n\n2.  **Perform neutralization reactions.**\n    The neutralization process occurs in a specific order: the strong acid will react with the strong base first. Any leftover strong species will then react with the weak species.\n\n    *   **Step 2a: Strong Acid-Strong Base Reaction**\n        *   Reaction: H+ + OH- -> H2O\n        *   Initial moles H+ (strong) = 0.080 mol\n        *   Initial moles OH- (strong) = 0.180 mol\n        *   The H+ from HCl is the limiting reactant. It will be completely consumed.\n        *   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = **0.100 mol OH-**\n\n    *   **Step 2b: Remaining Strong Base-Weak Acid Reaction**\n        *   Now, the remaining strong base (OH-) reacts with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n        *   Reaction: CH3COOH + OH- -> CH3COO- + H2O\n        *   Initial moles CH3COOH = 0.050 mol\n        *   Moles of OH- available = 0.100 mol\n        *   The CH3COOH is the limiting reactant and will be completely consumed.\n        *   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = **0.050 mol OH-**\n\n3.  **Determine the final solution composition and calculate pH.**\n    *   After all reactions, the solution contains an excess of 0.050 moles of OH-, which is a strong base. The presence of this strong base will dictate the pH of the solution. The contribution from the weak conjugate base (CH3COO-) formed is negligible.\n    *   Calculate the total volume of the solution:\n        *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.200 L**\n    *   Calculate the final concentration of OH-:\n        *   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n        *   [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L = 0.04167 M\n    *   Calculate the pOH:\n        *   pOH = -log10([OH-])\n        *   pOH = -log10(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n    *   Calculate the pH:\n        *   pH = 14.00 - pOH\n        *   pH = 14.00 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nTo ensure accuracy, the calculation can be performed using a script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Moles of reactants\nmoles_ch3cooh = 0.500 * 0.1  # 0.05 mol\nmoles_h_strong = 0.400 * 0.2 # 0.08 mol\nmoles_oh_strong = 0.300 * 0.3 * 2 # 0.18 mol\n\n# Neutralization\n# Strong acid with strong base\nmoles_oh_after_hcl = moles_oh_strong - moles_h_strong # 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol\n\n# Remaining strong base with weak acid\nmoles_oh_excess = moles_oh_after_hcl - moles_ch3cooh # 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol\n\n# Final calculation\ntotal_volume = 0.500 + 0.400 + 0.300 # 1.2 L\nconc_oh = moles_oh_excess / total_volume # 0.05 / 1.2\npOH = -math.log10(conc_oh)\npH = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"{pH:.2f}\")\n```\n```output\n12.62\n```\nThe final calculation confirms that the pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<C>>>",
