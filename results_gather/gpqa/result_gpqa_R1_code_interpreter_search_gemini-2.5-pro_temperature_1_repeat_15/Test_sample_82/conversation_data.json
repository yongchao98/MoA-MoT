    "This problem requires calculating the pH at two points during the titration of a diluted acetic acid solution with a strong base, NaOH.\n\n**1. Initial Dilution of Acetic Acid**\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of acetic acid after it has been diluted with water. We use the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2.\n*   Initial concentration of acetic acid (M1) = 0.05 M\n*   Initial volume of acetic acid (V1) = 20.00 cm3\n*   Final volume (V2) = 20.00 cm3 (acid) + 20.00 cm3 (water) = 40.00 cm3\n*   Final concentration of acetic acid (M2) = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm3) / 40.00 cm3 = 0.025 M\n\nSo, the concentration of the acetic acid solution to be titrated is 0.025 M.\n\n**2. pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (CH3COOH) has been converted into its conjugate base, acetate (CH3COO-), and 75% of the acid remains. This creates a buffer solution. The pH of a buffer solution can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log([conjugate base] / [acid])\n\n*   Ka for acetic acid = 1.85 x 10^-5\n*   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10^-5)\n*   The ratio [conjugate base] / [acid] is 25% / 75% = 1/3.\n\npH = pKa + log(1/3) = pKa - log(3)\n\nLet's calculate the values.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nKa = 1.85e-5\n\n# Calculate pKa\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\n\n# Calculate pH at 25% titration\n# At 25% titration, the ratio of [base]/[acid] is 0.25/0.75 = 1/3\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1.0/3.0)\n\nprint(f\"The pH at 25% titration is: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>\nThe pH at 25% titration is: 4.26\n<<<\n\n**3. pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH3COONa). The solution now contains only the conjugate base, acetate (CH3COO-), which will hydrolyze water, producing OH- ions and making the solution basic.\n\nCH3COO- + H2O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH-\n\nFirst, we need to find the concentration of the acetate ion at the equivalence point.\n*   Initial moles of acid = Concentration * Volume = 0.025 M * 0.040 L = 0.001 moles.\n*   Volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed to neutralize the acid: Moles / Concentration = 0.001 moles / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm3.\n*   Total volume at equivalence point = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm3 + 10.00 cm3 = 50.00 cm3 = 0.050 L.\n*   Concentration of acetate [CH3COO-] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 moles / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n\nNext, we calculate the pOH from the hydrolysis of the acetate ion using its base dissociation constant, Kb.\n*   Kw = Ka * Kb = 1.0 x 10^-14\n*   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10^-14) / (1.85 x 10^-5)\n*   Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-] / [CH3COO-]. Let x = [OH-]. So, Kb ≈ x^2 / [CH3COO-].\n*   x = [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [CH3COO-])\n\nFinally, we calculate the pH.\n*   pOH = -log([OH-])\n*   pH = 14 - pOH\n\nLet's perform the calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\nconc_acetate = 0.02  # M\n\n# Calculate Kb\nKb = Kw / Ka\n\n# Calculate [OH-]\n# Kb = x^2 / conc_acetate => x = sqrt(Kb * conc_acetate)\nOH_concentration = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_acetate)\n\n# Calculate pOH and then pH\npOH = -math.log10(OH_concentration)\npH_at_equivalence = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"The pH at the equivalence point is: {pH_at_equivalence:.2f}\")\n```\n>>>\nThe pH at the equivalence point is: 8.52\n<<<\n\nThe calculated pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52.\n\n<<<D>>>",
