    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the fundamental quantities:**\n    *   **Uniform distribution of stars:** This implies that the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (rho), is constant throughout space. `ρ = Number of stars / Volume`.\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is inversely proportional to the distance `d` to a star. The relationship is `plx = 1/d` (when `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds). Therefore, `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   **Target quantity:** We need to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which can be written as `dN/d(plx)`, depends on `plx`.\n\n2.  **Consider the number of stars in a spherical shell:**\n    Let's find the number of stars, `dN`, located in a thin spherical shell at a distance `d` from Earth, with a small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell, `dV`, is approximately its surface area multiplied by its thickness.\n    *   Surface area of a sphere of radius `d` is `A = 4πd²`.\n    *   Volume of the shell is `dV = A * dd = 4πd² dd`.\n    *   Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the number of stars `dN` in this shell is:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² dd`\n\n3.  **Convert the expression from distance (`d`) to parallax (`plx`):**\n    Our expression for `dN` is in terms of `d` and `dd`. We need to convert it into terms of `plx` and `d(plx)`.\n    *   First, substitute `d = 1/plx` into the equation:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * dd`\n    *   Next, we need to relate the thickness of the shell `dd` to the corresponding interval in parallax `d(plx)`. We can do this by taking the derivative of `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `d = 1/plx = plx⁻¹`\n        `dd/d(plx) = d(plx⁻¹)/d(plx) = -1 * plx⁻² = -1/plx²`\n    *   From this, we can express `dd` in terms of `d(plx)`:\n        `dd = -(1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    *   The negative sign indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. When we are counting the number of stars in an interval, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign. `dd ≈ (1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n\n4.  **Substitute `dd` back into the equation for `dN`:**\n    Now we replace `dd` in our expression for `dN`:\n    *   `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * [ (1/plx²) * d(plx) ]`\n    *   Combine the terms:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1 / (plx² * plx²)) * d(plx)`\n        `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n5.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax:**\n    The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is the expression `dN/d(plx)`. We can find this by rearranging the equation from the previous step:\n    *   `dN / d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n6.  **Determine the proportionality:**\n    In this final expression, `4`, `π`, and `ρ` (the constant star density) are all constants. Therefore, we can see the relationship between the number of stars per unit parallax range and the parallax itself:\n    *   `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis means the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n7.  **Match with the given options:**\n    *   A) ~ 1/plx²\n    *   B) ~ 1/plx¹\n    *   C) ~ 1/plx⁴\n    *   D) ~ 1/plx³\n\nThe derived relationship `~ 1/plx⁴` matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
