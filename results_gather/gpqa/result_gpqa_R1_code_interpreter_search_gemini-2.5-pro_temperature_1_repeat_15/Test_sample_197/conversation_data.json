    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, which is `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n2.  **Identify the Species:** In a solution of Co(II) and SCN-, the following cobalt-containing species can exist in equilibrium:\n    *   `Co^2+` (the free, uncomplexed ion)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)]+` (monothiocyanato complex)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)2]` (dithiocyanato complex)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)3]-` (trithiocyanato complex)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)4]^2-` (tetrathiocyanato complex)\n\n3.  **Define Total Cobalt Concentration:** The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [[Co(SCN)]+] + [[Co(SCN)2]] + [[Co(SCN)3]-] + [[Co(SCN)4]^2-]`\n\n4.  **Use the Overall Stability Constants (β):** The problem provides the overall stability constants, which relate the concentration of each complex to the concentration of the free metal ion (`[Co^2+]`) and the free ligand (`[SCN-]`).\n\n    *   `[Co(SCN)]+ = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)3]- = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)4]^2- = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4`\n\n5.  **Express `c(Co)` in terms of `[Co^2+]`:** Substitute the expressions from step 4 into the equation from step 3.\n\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + (β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]) + (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) + (β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3) + (β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4)`\n\n    Factor out `[Co^2+]`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n6.  **Formulate the Percentage Calculation:** The percentage of the `[Co(SCN)2]` complex is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration, multiplied by 100.\n\n    `Percentage = ([[Co(SCN)2]] / c(Co)) * 100`\n\n    Substitute the expressions for `[[Co(SCN)2]]` (from step 4) and `c(Co)` (from step 5):\n\n    `Percentage = ( (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)) ) * 100`\n\n    The `[Co^2+]` term cancels out from the numerator and the denominator. This is important as it means we don't need to calculate the free cobalt ion concentration. The distribution of species depends only on the free ligand concentration.\n\n    `Percentage = ( (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4) ) * 100`\n\n7.  **Plug in the Given Values:**\n    *   `[SCN-] = 0.1` M\n    *   `β1 = 9`\n    *   `β2 = 40`\n    *   `β3 = 63`\n    *   `β4 = 16`\n\n    The total cobalt concentration `c(Co) = 10^-2` M is not needed for this specific calculation, as we are asked for a relative percentage. We assume `[SCN-] = 0.1` M is the equilibrium concentration of the free ligand.\n\n8.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:** A Python script can perform this calculation accurately.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nscn_conc = 0.1\n\n# Calculate the numerator of the fraction: beta2 * [SCN-]^2\nnumerator = beta2 * (scn_conc**2)\n\n# Calculate the denominator of the fraction (the sum of all terms)\n# This is often denoted by the symbol Φ (Phi)\ndenominator = 1 + (beta1 * scn_conc) + (beta2 * scn_conc**2) + (beta3 * scn_conc**3) + (beta4 * scn_conc**4)\n\n# Calculate the fraction (alpha_2) of the dithiocyanato complex\nfraction = numerator / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = fraction * 100\n\nprint(percentage)\n```\n>>>\n16.916180326482278\n<<<\nThe calculated percentage is approximately 16.92%.

    "Here's the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the percentage of a specific complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) or `[Co(SCN)2]`, out of the total amount of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**2. Identify All Cobalt Species**\nIn a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN⁻) ions, a series of complexation equilibria will be established. The cobalt-containing species are:\n*   The free aquated ion: `Co²⁺`\n*   The monothiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)]⁺`\n*   The dithiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)₂]` (the one we are interested in)\n*   The trithiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`\n*   The tetrathiocyanato complex: `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\n**3. Define Total Cobalt Concentration**\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n**4. Use the Overall Stability Constants (β)**\nThe overall stability constants (βn) relate the concentration of each complex to the concentration of the free metal ion (`[Co²⁺]`) and the free ligand (`[SCN⁻]`).\n\n*   For `[Co(SCN)]⁺`: `β₁ = [[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻])`  => `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]`\n*   For `[Co(SCN)₂]`: `β₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²)` => `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²`\n*   For `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻`: `β₃ = [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³)` => `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³`\n*   For `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`: `β₄ = [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴)` => `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\nNote: For the free ion `Co²⁺`, we can think of it as having a `β₀ = 1`.\n\n**5. Express Total Cobalt Concentration in Terms of the Free Ion**\nSubstitute the expressions from step 4 into the equation from step 3:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\nNow, factor out the `[Co²⁺]` term:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**6. Formulate the Percentage Calculation**\nThe percentage of the dithiocyanato complex `[Co(SCN)₂]` is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration, multiplied by 100.\n\nPercentage = `([[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)) * 100`\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for `[[Co(SCN)₂]]` (from step 4) and `c(Co)` (from step 5):\n\nPercentage = `( β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)) ) * 100`\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out from the numerator and denominator. This is a crucial simplification, as it shows that the relative distribution of the species depends only on the free ligand concentration, not the total metal concentration.\n\nPercentage = `( β₂[SCN⁻]² / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴) ) * 100`\n\n**7. Perform the Calculation**\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M\n*   `β₁` = 9\n*   `β₂` = 40\n*   `β₃` = 63\n*   `β₄` = 16\n\nThe calculation can be done with a simple script.\n\n```python\n# Given stability constants\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n\n# Given ligand concentration\nscn_conc = 0.1\n\n# The term in the numerator corresponding to the [Co(SCN)2] complex\nnumerator_term = beta2 * (scn_conc**2)\n\n# The term in the denominator, which is the sum of all relative species concentrations\ndenominator_sum = 1 + (beta1 * scn_conc) + (beta2 * scn_conc**2) + (beta3 * scn_conc**3) + (beta4 * scn_conc**4)\n\n# Calculate the fraction of the [Co(SCN)2] complex\nfraction_of_CoSCN2 = numerator_term / denominator_sum\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage = fraction_of_CoSCN2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage)\n```\n<<<C>>>",
    "The calculation performed by the code confirms the reasoning process.\n\n**Summary of Calculation:**\n\n1.  **Numerator (Contribution of `[Co(SCN)2]`)**:\n    *   `β2 * [SCN-]^2` = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n\n2.  **Denominator (Sum of contributions of all species)**:\n    *   `1` (for `Co^2+`)\n    *   `β1 * [SCN-]` = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n    *   `β2 * [SCN-]^2` = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 0.4\n    *   `β3 * [SCN-]^3` = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n    *   `β4 * [SCN-]^4` = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n    *   **Total Sum (Denominator)** = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\n3.  **Fraction and Percentage**:\n    *   Fraction = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n    *   Percentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.916%\n\nThe calculated value is approximately 16.9%, which matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
