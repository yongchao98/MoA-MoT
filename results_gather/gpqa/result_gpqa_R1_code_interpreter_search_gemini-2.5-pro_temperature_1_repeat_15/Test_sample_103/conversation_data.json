    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Stellar Velocity:**\n    The radial velocity (RV) method measures the change in a star's velocity along our line of sight. This velocity change causes a Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines. The observed wavelength shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity ($v_r$):\n    $$ \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_r}{c} $$\n    where $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n    The problem gives the amplitude of the periodic wavelength shift, which corresponds to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as $K$. Therefore, the amplitude of the wavelength shift is directly proportional to $K$.\n    $$ \\Delta\\lambda_{max} \\propto K $$\n    We are given:\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ mÅ for planet #1's host star.\n    *   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ mÅ for planet #2's host star.\n\n    The ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes is:\n    $$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4 $$\n\n2.  **Relate Stellar Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Period (T):**\n    For a planet of mass $M_p$ orbiting a star of mass $M_s$ in a circular orbit with period $T$, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity is given by the formula:\n    $$ K = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{(M_s + M_p)^{2/3}} $$\n    where $G$ is the gravitational constant and $i$ is the inclination of the orbit to our line of sight.\n\n3.  **Set up the Ratio for the Two Systems:**\n    We can write the expression for $K$ for each of the two star-planet systems:\n    $$ K_1 = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T_1}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_{p1} \\sin i_1}{(M_{s1} + M_{p1})^{2/3}} $$\n    $$ K_2 = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi G}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_{p2} \\sin i_2}{(M_{s2} + M_{p2})^{2/3}} $$\n    The problem states:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: $M_{s1} = M_{s2}$.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: $M_{p1} \\approx M_{p2}$.\n\n    Since the problem is solvable with a single numerical answer, we must assume that other unmentioned parameters, like the orbital inclinations, are the same ($i_1 = i_2$).\n\n    Under these conditions, the term $\\frac{M_p \\sin i}{(M_s + M_p)^{2/3}}$ is approximately the same for both systems. Let's call it $C$.\n    $$ C = \\frac{M_{p1} \\sin i_1}{(M_{s1} + M_{p1})^{2/3}} \\approx \\frac{M_{p2} \\sin i_2}{(M_{s2} + M_{p2})^{2/3}} $$\n    So, the relationship simplifies to a proportionality:\n    $$ K \\propto T^{-1/3} $$\n\n4.  **Solve for the Ratio of Orbital Periods:**\n    Now we can use the ratio of the velocity amplitudes to find the ratio of the periods:\n    $$ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{(T_2)^{-1/3}}{(T_1)^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{T_2}{T_1}\\right)^{-1/3} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    Substitute the known value of the velocity ratio:\n    $$ \\frac{7}{5} = \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n    We need to find the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to that of planet #1, which is $T_2/T_1$. Let's solve for it. First, cube both sides of the equation:\n    $$ \\left(\\frac{7}{5}\\right)^3 = \\frac{T_1}{T_2} $$\n    Now, invert the expression to get the desired ratio:\n    $$ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 $$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    Let's compute the value of $(5/7)^3$.\n    ```python\n    ratio = (5/7)**3\n    print(ratio)\n    ```\n    <execute_result>\n    0.364431487\n    </execute_result>\n    The result is approximately 0.364.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
