    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Determine the Initial State (`t < 0`)**\n    *   The particle is a spin-1/2 particle, so its spin state can be described by a two-component vector (spinor).\n    *   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B` in the `+z` direction. The Hamiltonian of the system is given by `H = -μ · B`, where `μ` is the magnetic moment operator and `B` is the magnetic field vector.\n    *   The magnetic moment `μ` is related to the spin operator `S` by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n    *   So, the initial Hamiltonian is `H_initial = -γS · (B ẑ) = -γBS_z`, where `ẑ` is the unit vector in the z-direction.\n    *   The problem states that the particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned with the magnetic field\". This means the particle is in the lowest energy eigenstate of `H_initial`.\n    *   The eigenvalues of `S_z` are `+ħ/2` (spin up) and `-ħ/2` (spin down). The corresponding energy eigenvalues are `E = -γB(±ħ/2)`.\n    *   Assuming `γ` and `B` are positive, the lowest energy state corresponds to the largest positive eigenvalue of `S_z`, which is `+ħ/2`. This state is called the \"spin-up\" state along the z-axis, denoted as `|+z>`.\n    *   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`. In the standard `S_z` basis, this state is represented by the vector `[1, 0]`.\n\n2.  **Determine the New Hamiltonian (`t > 0`)**\n    *   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the `+y` direction, with the same magnitude `B`.\n    *   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution for `t > 0` is `H_new = -γS · (B ŷ) = -γBS_y`, where `ŷ` is the unit vector in the y-direction.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Time Evolution of the State**\n    *   The state of the system at a later time `t` is given by the Schrödinger equation:\n        `|ψ(t)> = U(t)|ψ(0)> = exp(-i * H_new * t / ħ) |ψ(0)>`\n    *   Substituting the expression for `H_new`:\n        `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * (-γBS_y) * t / ħ) |+z> = exp(i * γBt * S_y / ħ) |+z>`\n    *   The operator `exp(i * θ * S_y / ħ)` represents a rotation of the spin state around the y-axis by an angle `-θ`. Here, `θ = γBt`. So, the state vector `|ψ(t)>` is the initial state `|+z>` rotated around the y-axis by an angle `ωt`, where the angular velocity is `ω = γB`. This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value of the Z-Component of the Magnetic Moment**\n    *   We are interested in the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z(t)>`.\n    *   `<μ_z(t)> = <ψ(t)|μ_z|ψ(t)>`. Since `μ_z = γS_z`, this is `<μ_z(t)> = γ <ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`.\n    *   Let's calculate `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)>`. We can use the Heisenberg picture for a more intuitive calculation. The operator `S_z` evolves in time as:\n        `S_z(t) = U†(t)S_zU(t) = exp(-i * γBt * S_y / ħ) * S_z * exp(i * γBt * S_y / ħ)`\n    *   This transformation corresponds to rotating the `S_z` operator around the y-axis by an angle `θ = γBt`. The vector components transform as:\n        `S_z' = S_z cos(θ) + S_x sin(θ)`\n        `S_x' = S_x cos(θ) - S_z sin(θ)`\n    *   So, `S_z(t) = S_z cos(γBt) + S_x sin(γBt)`. Note: A sign error in the scratchpad, `S_z` rotation gives `S_z cos(θ) + S_x sin(θ)`. Let's re-verify. A positive rotation of the coordinate system by `θ` around y means `z' = z cosθ - x sinθ`. Rotating the vector means `V_z' = V_z cosθ + V_x sinθ`. The Heisenberg evolution `U†SU` corresponds to rotating the operator in the same way as the vector. So, `S_z(t) = S_z cos(γBt) + S_x sin(γBt)`.\n    *   The expectation value is calculated with respect to the initial state `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`:\n        `<S_z(t)> = <+z| S_z(t) |+z> = <+z| (S_z cos(γBt) + S_x sin(γBt)) |+z>`\n        `<S_z(t)> = cos(γBt) <+z|S_z|+z> + sin(γBt) <+z|S_x|+z>`\n    *   We know `|+z>` is an eigenstate of `S_z` with eigenvalue `ħ/2`, so `<+z|S_z|+z> = ħ/2`.\n    *   The expectation value of `S_x` in the `|+z>` state is zero: `<+z|S_x|+z> = 0`.\n    *   Therefore, `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`.\n\n5.  **Determine the Oscillation Frequency**\n    *   The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment is:\n        `<μ_z(t)> = γ * <S_z(t)> = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`\n    *   This expression describes a sinusoidal oscillation. The general form of an oscillation is `A cos(ωt + φ)`, where `ω` is the angular frequency.\n    *   By comparing `γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)` with the general form, we can identify the angular frequency of oscillation as:\n        `ω = γB`\n\nThis frequency is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nFinal Answer matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
