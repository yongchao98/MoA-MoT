    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   Let the laboratory frame be the stationary frame, which we'll call `S`. The observer is in this frame.\n    *   Let the rest frame of the moving glass be the moving frame, which we'll call `S'`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Velocities:**\n    *   **Velocity of the glass relative to the lab:** The problem states the glass is moving at a constant velocity `v` in the same direction as the light beam, relative to the observer in the laboratory. So, the velocity of frame `S'` with respect to frame `S` is `v`.\n    *   **Velocity of light in the glass's rest frame:** The speed of light in a medium with refractive index `n` is given by `u' = c/n`. The problem specifies that the speed of light in a vacuum is `c=1`. Therefore, the speed of light as measured by an observer in the rest frame of the glass (`S'`) is `u' = 1/n`. This velocity is in the same direction as the motion of the glass.\n\n3.  **Choose the Correct Physical Principle:**\n    This problem involves adding velocities that are close to the speed of light. Classical (Galilean) velocity addition (`u = u' + v`) is not accurate in this regime. We must use the relativistic velocity addition formula from Einstein's special theory of relativity.\n\n4.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    The formula for adding velocities `u'` and `v` that are in the same direction is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v / c^2)`\n    where:\n    *   `u` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) in the stationary frame `S` (the lab).\n    *   `u'` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) in the moving frame `S'` (the glass).\n    *   `v` is the velocity of the moving frame `S'` (the glass) relative to the stationary frame `S` (the lab).\n    *   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\n5.  **Substitute the Given Values into the Formula:**\n    We have:\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    Substituting these into the formula:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)*v / 1^2)`\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n6.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    To simplify the complex fraction, we can find a common denominator for the terms in the numerator and the denominator, or we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`. Let's use the latter method as it's more direct.\n    \n    `u = [n * (1/n + v)] / [n * (1 + v/n)]`\n    \n    Distribute `n` in both the numerator and the denominator:\n    \n    `u = (n/n + n*v) / (n*1 + n*v/n)`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n7.  **Compare the Result with the Given Options:**\n    The calculated speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n    Let's check the options:\n    A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n    B) 1\n    C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n    D) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n\n    Our result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
