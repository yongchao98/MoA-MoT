    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ and determine the renormalizability of the theory.\n\n**1. Mass Dimension of the Lagrangian**\n\nIn quantum field theory, we work in natural units where $\\hbar = c = 1$. The action, $S$, is a dimensionless quantity. The action is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian density, $\\mathcal{L}$, over four-dimensional spacetime:\n$$ S = \\int d^4x \\, \\mathcal{L} $$\nSince the action $S$ is dimensionless, $[S] = [M^0]$, where $[M]$ denotes the mass dimension. The four-dimensional volume element $d^4x$ has units of (length)⁴. In natural units, length has the dimension of inverse mass, so $[d^4x] = [M^{-4}]$.\nFor the action to be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density must have a mass dimension of 4:\n$$ [S] = [d^4x][\\mathcal{L}] \\implies [M^0] = [M^{-4}][\\mathcal{L}] \\implies [\\mathcal{L}] = [M^4] $$\nThis means that every term in the Lagrangian, including the interaction term $\\mathcal{L}_{int}$, must have a mass dimension of 4.\n\n**2. Mass Dimensions of the Fields**\n\nTo find the dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$, we first need the dimensions of the fields $\\psi$ and $F^{\\mu\\nu}$. We can deduce these from their kinetic terms in the standard model Lagrangian.\n\n*   **Fermion field $\\psi$**: The kinetic term for a fermion is $\\mathcal{L}_{fermion, kin} = i\\bar{\\psi}\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu\\psi$.\n    *   We know $[\\mathcal{L}] = 4$.\n    *   The derivative $\\partial_\\mu$ has a mass dimension of 1, i.e., $[\\partial_\\mu] = [M^1]$.\n    *   The gamma matrices $\\gamma^\\mu$ are dimensionless matrices.\n    *   Thus, $[\\mathcal{L}_{fermion, kin}] = [\\bar{\\psi}][\\psi][\\partial_\\mu] = 4$.\n    *   Since $[\\bar{\\psi}] = [\\psi]$, we have $2[\\psi] + 1 = 4$, which gives $[\\psi] = 3/2$. So, $[\\psi] = [\\bar{\\psi}] = [M^{3/2}]$.\n\n*   **Field strength tensor $F^{\\mu\\nu}$**: The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is $\\mathcal{L}_{gauge, kin} = -\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\n    *   We have $[\\mathcal{L}_{gauge, kin}] = [F^{\\mu\\nu}][F^{\\mu\\nu}] = 2[F^{\\mu\\nu}] = 4$.\n    *   This implies that the mass dimension of the field strength tensor is $[F^{\\mu\\nu}] = [M^2]$.\n\n**3. Mass Dimension of the Coupling Constant $\\kappa$**\n\nNow we can analyze the given interaction term:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu} $$\nAs established, $[\\mathcal{L}_{int}] = [M^4]$. The term $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{i}{2}[\\gamma_\\mu, \\gamma_\\nu]$ is constructed from dimensionless gamma matrices, so it is also dimensionless: $[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] = [M^0]$.\n\nWe can now write an equation for the mass dimensions of the terms in $\\mathcal{L}_{int}$:\n$$ [\\mathcal{L}_{int}] = [\\kappa] [\\bar{\\psi}] [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] [\\psi] [F^{\\mu\\nu}] $$\n$$ [M^4] = [\\kappa] [M^{3/2}] [M^0] [M^{3/2}] [M^2] $$\n$$ [M^4] = [\\kappa] [M^{3/2 + 3/2 + 2}] $$\n$$ [M^4] = [\\kappa] [M^{3 + 2}] $$\n$$ [M^4] = [\\kappa] [M^5] $$\nSolving for the mass dimension of $\\kappa$, we get:\n$$ [\\kappa] = \\frac{[M^4]}{[M^5]} = [M^{-1}] $$\nSo, the mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is -1.\n\n**4. Renormalizability of the Theory**\n\nThe renormalizability of a quantum field theory can be assessed by examining the mass dimensions of its coupling constants. This is known as power-counting renormalizability.\n\n*   If a coupling constant has a **positive** mass dimension, the interaction is called **relevant**. Such theories are super-renormalizable.\n*   If a coupling constant has a **zero** mass dimension, the interaction is called **marginal**. Such theories are typically renormalizable (e.g., QED, QCD).\n*   If a coupling constant has a **negative** mass dimension, the interaction is called **irrelevant**. Such theories are **non-renormalizable**.\n\nIn this case, the coupling constant $\\kappa$ has a mass dimension of -1. A negative mass dimension means that in perturbation theory, higher-order loop corrections will introduce divergences that are more and more severe. To cancel these divergences, one would need to introduce an infinite number of new counterterms, which would mean an infinite number of free parameters that must be fixed by experiment. This renders the theory non-predictive at high energies, and thus it is considered non-renormalizable.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is -1, and because this dimension is negative, the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
