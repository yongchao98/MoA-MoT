    "This is a classic two-body decay problem in particle physics. We need to apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\n**1. Initial State:**\n*   The particle is a positive pion (Pi+).\n*   It is stationary, which means its initial momentum is zero (p_initial = 0) and its initial kinetic energy is zero.\n*   The total initial energy (E_initial) is therefore just its rest mass energy:\n    E_initial = m_pi * c^2 = 139.6 MeV\n\n**2. Final State:**\n*   The decay products are a positive muon (mu+) and a muon neutrino (nu).\n*   The total final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino:\n    E_final = E_mu + E_nu\n*   The total final momentum is the sum of the momenta of the muon and the neutrino:\n    p_final = p_mu + p_nu\n\n**3. Conservation of Momentum:**\nSince the initial momentum is zero, the final momentum must also be zero.\np_initial = p_final\n0 = p_mu + p_nu\nThis implies that the muon and the neutrino must fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let's call this magnitude 'p'.\n|p_mu| = |p_nu| = p\n\n**4. Conservation of Energy:**\nThe total energy before equals the total energy after.\nE_initial = E_final\nm_pi * c^2 = E_mu + E_nu\n\nWe can express the total energy of each product particle in terms of its momentum and rest mass using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m*c^2)^2.\n\n*   For the muon (mu+): E_mu = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2)\n*   For the neutrino (nu): Neutrinos are considered massless (or have a negligible mass) in this context (m_nu ≈ 0). So, its energy is given by E_nu = p*c.\n\nSubstituting these into the energy conservation equation:\nm_pi * c^2 = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2) + p*c\n\nNow, we solve for the momentum 'p' (or more conveniently, for the quantity 'p*c' which has units of energy).\nm_pi * c^2 - p*c = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2)\n\nSquare both sides:\n(m_pi * c^2 - p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2\n(m_pi*c^2)^2 - 2*(m_pi*c^2)*(p*c) + (p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2\n\nThe (p*c)^2 term cancels out on both sides.\n(m_pi*c^2)^2 - 2*(m_pi*c^2)*(p*c) = (m_mu*c^2)^2\n\nRearrange to solve for p*c:\np*c = [ (m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2 ] / [ 2 * (m_pi*c^2) ]\n\n**5. Calculation:**\nNow we plug in the given values:\n*   m_pi * c^2 = 139.6 MeV\n*   m_mu * c^2 = 105.7 MeV\n\n```python\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7\n\n# Calculate the momentum in energy units (pc)\npc = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# The kinetic energy of the massless neutrino is equal to its total energy, which is pc.\nKE_nu = pc\n\n# The total energy of the muon can be found from energy conservation.\nE_mu = m_pi_c2 - KE_nu\n\n# The kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest mass energy.\nKE_mu = E_mu - m_mu_c2\n\nprint(f\"KE_mu = {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE_nu = {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\n> KE_mu = 4.12 MeV\n> KE_nu = 29.78 MeV\n\n**Results:**\n*   Kinetic Energy of the muon (KE_mu) ≈ 4.12 MeV\n*   Kinetic Energy of the neutrino (KE_nu) ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\nThese values correspond to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Identify the physical process:** This is a two-body decay of a stationary particle. The initial particle is a positive pion (Pi+), and the final particles are a positive muon (mu+) and a muon neutrino (nu).\n    *   Decay reaction: Pi(+) -> mu(+) + nu\n\n2.  **Identify the conserved quantities:** In any particle decay, both total energy and total momentum are conserved.\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   The initial Pi(+) is stationary, so the initial momentum of the system is zero (p_initial = 0).\n    *   According to the conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero (p_final = 0).\n    *   The final state has two particles, the muon and the neutrino. For their total momentum to be zero, they must move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n    *   Let `p_mu` be the momentum of the muon and `p_nu` be the momentum of the neutrino. Then, `p_mu + p_nu = 0`, which implies `|p_mu| = |p_nu| = p`.\n\n4.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   The initial energy (E_initial) is the rest energy of the stationary pion, as its kinetic energy is zero.\n        *   E_initial = m_pi * c^2 = 139.6 MeV\n    *   The final energy (E_final) is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n        *   E_final = E_mu + E_nu\n    *   Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation, E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2:\n        *   For the muon: E_mu = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2)\n        *   For the neutrino: The rest mass of a neutrino is considered to be zero (or negligible) in this context. So, m_nu ≈ 0.\n        *   Therefore, E_nu = sqrt((p*c)^2 + 0) = p*c\n    *   Equating initial and final energies:\n        *   m_pi * c^2 = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2) + p*c\n\n5.  **Solve for the momentum (p*c):**\n    *   Rearrange the energy conservation equation to isolate the square root term:\n        *   m_pi * c^2 - p*c = sqrt((p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2)\n    *   Square both sides of the equation:\n        *   (m_pi*c^2 - p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2\n        *   (m_pi*c^2)^2 - 2*(m_pi*c^2)*(p*c) + (p*c)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2\n    *   The (p*c)^2 term cancels out from both sides:\n        *   (m_pi*c^2)^2 - 2*(m_pi*c^2)*(p*c) = (m_mu*c^2)^2\n    *   Solve for `p*c`:\n        *   p*c = [ (m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2 ] / [ 2 * (m_pi*c^2) ]\n\n6.  **Calculate the Kinetic Energies (KE):**\n    *   **KE of the neutrino (KE_nu):** Since the neutrino is massless, its total energy is purely kinetic.\n        *   KE_nu = E_nu = p*c\n    *   **KE of the muon (KE_mu):** The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy.\n        *   KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu*c^2\n        *   We can find E_mu from the energy conservation equation: E_mu = m_pi*c^2 - E_nu = m_pi*c^2 - p*c\n        *   Therefore, KE_mu = (m_pi*c^2 - p*c) - m_mu*c^2\n\n7.  **Perform the Calculation using the provided values:**\n    *   m_pi * c^2 = 139.6 MeV\n    *   m_mu * c^2 = 105.7 MeV\n\n    The following Python code will perform these calculations efficiently.\n```python\n# Given rest mass energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the momentum of the products in energy units (pc).\n# This formula is derived from conservation of energy and momentum.\npc = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the kinetic energy of the neutrino (KE_nu).\n# For a massless particle like the neutrino, its total energy is its kinetic energy, which is equal to pc.\nKE_nu = pc\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_mu).\n# First find the total energy of the muon from energy conservation.\nE_mu = m_pi_c2 - KE_nu\n# The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy.\nKE_mu = E_mu - m_mu_c2\n\n# Print the results rounded to two decimal places for comparison with the options.\n# The order in the options is KE_mu, KE_nu.\nprint(f\"KE of muon (mu+): {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE of neutrino (nu): {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n\n```\nThe code output shows the kinetic energy of the muon is 4.12 MeV and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is 29.78 MeV (which rounds to 29.8 MeV).\n\nComparing this result {4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV} with the given options:\nA) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nB) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nC) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nD) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
