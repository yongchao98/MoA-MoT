    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**\n\n    *   **Dienophile (from the dicarboxylic acid):** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride's spectral data is key:\n        *   ¹H NMR: A single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates all protons are chemically equivalent. The chemical shift (7 ppm) is in the vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond).\n        *   ¹³C NMR: Two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. A peak around 165 ppm is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon (C=O), and a peak around 137 ppm is characteristic of an alkene carbon (C=C).\n        *   The simplest structure that fits this description is **maleic anhydride**. It is formed from the dehydration of maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). Maleic anhydride has a plane of symmetry, making the two vinylic protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent, resulting in the observed simple NMR spectra. The chemical shifts are also consistent with those of maleic anhydride.\n\n    *   **Diene:** The problem explicitly states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with conjugated double bonds at positions 1-2 and 3-4. It has methyl groups on all four carbons of the diene system (C1, C2, C3, C4) and a CH₂ group at C5.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Diels-Alder Reaction and Products**\n\n    *   The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition between the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and the dienophile (maleic anhydride).\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative. The product's molecular formula is C₁₃H₁₆O₃ (from C₉H₁₄ diene + C₄H₂O₃ anhydride), which matches the information given.\n    *   Like most Diels-Alder reactions, this one can produce two stereoisomeric products: an *endo* adduct and an *exo* adduct.\n        *   The **endo adduct** is generally the major product due to kinetic control arising from favorable secondary orbital interactions. In this product, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the one-carbon bridge (the C7 methylene bridge).\n        *   The **exo adduct** is generally the minor product. In this product, the anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the one-carbon bridge.\n\n3.  **Relate Structure to the NOESY Spectrum**\n\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak between two signals indicates a spatial proximity between the corresponding protons.\n    *   The question states that a specific cross-peak is present in the major product but absent (or very weak) in the minor product. This means we must find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* structure but far apart in the *exo* structure.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry and Proton Proximity**\n\n    *   Let's visualize the structures:\n        *   **Endo Product (Major):** The bicyclic system has a V-shape. In the endo isomer, the anhydride ring is tucked underneath the newly formed cyclohexene ring. This places the two protons that came from maleic anhydride (let's call them **H_anhydride**) very close to the methyl groups on the double bond of the bicyclic system (let's call them **Me_vinyl**).\n        *   **Exo Product (Minor):** In the exo isomer, the anhydride ring is flipped away. This moves the **H_anhydride** protons far away from the **Me_vinyl** groups. Instead, they are now closer to the protons on the C7 methylene bridge.\n\n    *   Therefore, the unique NOE interaction in the major (endo) product is between the **H_anhydride** protons and the **Me_vinyl** protons.\n\n5.  **Predict the ¹H NMR Signals for the Interacting Protons**\n\n    *   **H_anhydride:** These two protons are on the carbons adjacent to the anhydride's carbonyl groups. They are chemically equivalent due to a plane of symmetry in the product. They have no adjacent protons to couple with, so they will appear as a **singlet**. Their integral will be **2H**. Being next to electron-withdrawing carbonyls, they will be deshielded, appearing at a chemical shift of approximately **3.5 ppm**.\n    *   **Me_vinyl:** These are the two methyl groups attached to the C=C double bond in the product (originally on C2 and C3 of the diene). They are also equivalent by symmetry. They will appear as a **singlet** with an integral of **6H**. The typical chemical shift for vinylic methyl groups is around **1.7 ppm**.\n\n6.  **Match the Prediction with the Given Options**\n\n    *   We are looking for a NOESY cross-peak connecting a **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (H_anhydride) and a **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** (Me_vinyl).\n    *   Let's examine the options:\n        *   A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - Incorrect signal type/integral (1H doublet).\n        *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm - Incorrect signal type/integral (1H doublet).\n        *   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm - This perfectly matches our prediction.**\n        *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm - This would be an interaction between the bridgehead methyls (~1 ppm) and the vinyl methyls (~1.7 ppm). This interaction would exist in both isomers and is not the unique interaction differentiating the major and minor products.\n\nThe cross-peak present in the major product's NOESY spectrum connects the 6H singlet from the vinyl methyl groups (~1.7 ppm) and the 2H singlet from the anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm).\n\n<<<C>>>"
