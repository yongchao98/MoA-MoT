    "The user wants to determine the total energy of a Lithium-6 nucleus moving at a relativistic speed.\n\n**1. Identify the Nucleus (X):**\n*   The problem states that X is a Lithium (Li) nucleus with 3 neutrons.\n*   The atomic number (Z) of Lithium is 3, which means it has 3 protons.\n*   The number of neutrons (N) is given as 3.\n*   The mass number (A) is the sum of protons and neutrons: A = Z + N = 3 + 3 = 6.\n*   Therefore, the nucleus is Lithium-6 ($^{6}_{3}$Li).\n\n**2. Determine the Rest Mass of the Nucleus:**\nTo find the energy, we first need the rest mass ($m_0$) of the Lithium-6 nucleus. We can calculate this by taking the atomic mass of Lithium-6 and subtracting the mass of its 3 electrons.\n\n*   First, let's find the atomic mass of Lithium-6.\n<search>atomic mass of Lithium-6 in MeV/c^2</search>\n<information>\nThe atomic mass of lithium-6 (⁶Li) is approximately 6.0151228 atomic mass units (amu).\n\nTo convert this to MeV/c², we can use the conversion factor 1 amu ≈ 931.494 MeV/c².\n\nMass of ⁶Li ≈ 6.0151228 amu * 931.494 MeV/c²/amu\nMass of ⁶Li ≈ 5603.05 MeV/c²\n\nThis value is the mass of the neutral atom, including its 3 electrons.\n</information>\n*   The atomic mass of a neutral $^{6}$Li atom is approximately 5603.05 MeV/c².\n*   We need the mass of the *nucleus*, so we must subtract the mass of the 3 electrons.\n*   The rest mass of a single electron is approximately 0.511 MeV/c².\n*   Mass of 3 electrons = 3 * 0.511 MeV/c² = 1.533 MeV/c².\n*   Rest mass of the $^{6}$Li nucleus ($m_0$) = Atomic mass - Mass of electrons\n    $m_0$ = 5603.05 MeV/c² - 1.533 MeV/c² = 5601.517 MeV/c².\n\n**3. Apply the Relativistic Energy Formula:**\nThe total energy (E) of a particle moving at relativistic speed is given by the formula:\n$E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$\nwhere:\n*   $m_0$ is the rest mass of the particle.\n*   $c$ is the speed of light.\n*   $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is defined as $1 / \\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$.\n\nThe problem states the speed of the nucleus, v = 0.96c.\n\n**4. Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):**\n*   $v^2/c^2 = (0.96c)^2 / c^2 = 0.96^2 = 0.9216$.\n*   $1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784$.\n*   $\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \\sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28$.\n*   $\\gamma = 1 / 0.28 \\approx 3.57142857$.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Energy (E):**\n*   $E = \\gamma \\times (m_0 c^2)$.\n*   We already have the rest energy ($m_0 c^2$) = 5601.517 MeV.\n*   $E = 3.57142857 \\times 5601.517 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   $E \\approx 20005.417 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nThe question asks for the energy in GeV (Giga-electron Volts). Since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV:\n*   $E = 20005.417 \\text{ MeV} / 1000 \\text{ MeV/GeV} = 20.005417 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nTo ensure precision, let's use a Python script to perform the calculation with higher precision values.\n\n```python\n# Constants\natomic_mass_li6_amu = 6.0151228874  # Atomic mass of Lithium-6 in AMU\nelectron_mass_amu = 0.0005485799   # Mass of an electron in AMU\namu_to_gev = 0.931494102          # Conversion factor from AMU to GeV/c^2\nv_over_c = 0.96                    # Speed of the nucleus as a fraction of c\n\n# 1.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Nucleus (X)**\n\n*   The problem states that nucleus X is Lithium (Li). The atomic number of Lithium is Z=3, meaning it has 3 protons.\n*   It is specified to have 3 neutrons (N=3).\n*   The mass number (A) is the total number of protons and neutrons: A = Z + N = 3 + 3 = 6.\n*   Therefore, the nucleus is Lithium-6 ($^{6}_{3}$Li).\n\n**2. Determine the Rest Mass ($m_0$) and Rest Energy ($E_0$) of the Nucleus**\n\nTo find the total relativistic energy, we first need the rest energy of the nucleus. There are two ways to calculate this:\n\n*   **Method A (Physically Correct):** Use the atomic mass of Li-6 and subtract the mass of the electrons. This accounts for the nuclear binding energy.\n*   **Method B (Simplified):** Sum the masses of the individual protons and neutrons. This method ignores nuclear binding energy but is sometimes used in textbook problems for simplification.\n\nLet's evaluate both methods.\n\n**Method B (Simplified - Sum of Constituents):**\nOften in physics problems of this type, a simplified model is used where the mass of the nucleus is considered the sum of the masses of its constituent protons and neutrons, ignoring the binding energy.\n\n*   Rest mass of a proton ($m_p$) ≈ 938.272 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of a neutron ($m_n$) ≈ 939.565 MeV/c²\n*   The rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus ($m_0$) is the sum of 3 protons and 3 neutrons:\n    $m_0 = (3 \\times m_p) + (3 \\times m_n)$\n    $m_0 c^2 = (3 \\times 938.272 \\text{ MeV}) + (3 \\times 939.565 \\text{ MeV})$\n    $m_0 c^2 = 2814.816 \\text{ MeV} + 2818.695 \\text{ MeV}$\n    $m_0 c^2 = 5633.511 \\text{ MeV}$\n*   This rest energy in GeV is $E_0 = 5.6335$ GeV.\n\n**3. Apply the Relativistic Energy Formula**\n\nThe total energy (E) of a particle moving at relativistic speed is given by the formula:\n$E = \\gamma m_0 c^2 = \\gamma E_0$\n\nWhere $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$\n\n**4. Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\n\nThe problem states the speed of the nucleus is v = 0.96c.\n\n*   $v/c = 0.96$\n*   $(v/c)^2 = 0.96^2 = 0.9216$\n*   $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.0784}} = \\frac{1}{0.28}$\n*   $\\gamma \\approx 3.571428$\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Energy (E)**\n\nNow, we multiply the Lorentz factor by the rest energy calculated in Step 2 (using Method B).\n\n*   $E = \\gamma \\times E_0$\n*   $E = 3.571428 \\times 5.6335 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   $E \\approx 20.1196 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n**6. Compare with Options**\n\nLet's compare our calculated value with the given options:\nA) 20.132 GeV\nB) 18.475 GeV\nC) 21.419 GeV\nD) 23.069 GeV\n\nOur calculated energy, 20.120 GeV, is extremely close to option A (20.132 GeV). The minor difference (less than 0.1%) is due to the precise values of proton/neutron mass used by the source of the question.\n\nTo confirm this, let's use a Python script with high-precision constants for the calculation.\n\n```python\n# Constants based on CODATA 2018\nproton_rest_energy_gev = 0.93827208816\nneutron_rest_energy_gev = 0.93956542052\nv_over_c = 0.96\n\n# Nucleus composition\nnum_protons = 3\nnum_neutrons = 3\n\n# 1.

The physically correct method (including binding energy) yields a result of ~20.005 GeV, which does not match any of the options, indicating the simplified model was the intended approach for this problem.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Nucleus (X) and its Constituents**\n\n*   The problem specifies the nucleus is Lithium (Li). The atomic number of Lithium is Z=3, so it has 3 protons.\n*   The problem also states it has 3 neutrons (N=3).\n*   The total number of nucleons (protons + neutrons) is the mass number, A = Z + N = 3 + 3 = 6.\n*   Therefore, the nucleus is Lithium-6 ($^{6}_{3}$Li).\n\n**2. Determine the Correct Method to Calculate Rest Energy ($E_0$)**\n\nThere are two common ways to determine the rest energy of a nucleus:\n*   **Method 1 (Physically Precise):** Use the measured atomic mass of the $^{6}$Li atom and subtract the mass of its electrons. This method correctly accounts for the nuclear binding energy. The atomic mass of $^{6}$Li is approximately 6.01512 amu, which corresponds to a rest energy of about 5601.6 MeV for the nucleus.\n*   **Method 2 (Simplified Approximation):** Sum the rest masses of the individual constituent nucleons (3 protons and 3 neutrons). This method ignores nuclear binding energy and is often used in textbook problems for simplification.\n\nBy calculating the final energy using both methods and comparing to the options, we can determine which method the question intends. Experience suggests that for such problems, the simplified method is often expected.\n\n**3.

The minor difference of about 0.012 GeV (or 0.06%) is due to the problem's author using slightly different values for the proton/neutron rest masses. The result is unambiguously closest to option A.\n\n(Note: If we had used the physically precise Method 1, the total energy would be ~20.006 GeV, which does not match any of the options well, confirming that the simplified summation method was intended.)\n\n<<<A>>>",

Choose the Method for Calculating Rest Energy ($E_0$)**\nFor this type of physics problem, the rest energy of the nucleus is typically approximated by summing the rest energies of its constituent protons and neutrons.
