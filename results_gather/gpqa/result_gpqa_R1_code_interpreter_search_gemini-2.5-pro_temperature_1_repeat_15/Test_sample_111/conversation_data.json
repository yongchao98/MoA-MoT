    "Here is a breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Define and Normalize the Initial State |alpha>**\n\nThe given state is `|alpha> ∝ (1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>`.\nLet's write it as `|alpha> = N * [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>]`, where N is the normalization constant. In the basis where `|up> = [1, 0]` and `|down> = [0, 1]`, the state vector is `N * [1+i, 2-i]`.\n\nThe normalization condition is `<alpha|alpha> = 1`.\nThe bra vector `<alpha|` is the conjugate transpose of the ket `|alpha>`, so `<alpha| = N* * [1-i, 2+i]`.\n\n`<alpha|alpha> = |N|² * ([1-i, 2+i] * [1+i, 2-i])`\n`= |N|² * ((1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i))`\n`= |N|² * ((1² - i²) + (2² - i²))`\n`= |N|² * ((1 - (-1)) + (4 - (-1)))`\n`= |N|² * (2 + 5) = 7|N|²`\n\nSince `<alpha|alpha> = 1`, we have `7|N|² = 1`, which gives `N = 1/sqrt(7)` (we can choose the real, positive root).\n\nSo, the normalized state is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>]`\nIn vector form: `|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [[1+i], [2-i]]`\n\n2.  **Define the Operator A and Find its Eigenstates and Eigenvalues**\n\nThe operator A is defined by its matrix elements: `Aij = hbar/2` if `i ≠ j`, and `Aij = 0` otherwise. For a 2x2 system, this gives the matrix:\n`A = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\nThis operator is proportional to the Pauli-X matrix (`sigma_x`).\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`:\n`det([[ -λ, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -λ]]) = λ² - (hbar/2)² = 0`\nThis gives two eigenvalues: `λ₁ = +hbar/2` and `λ₂ = -hbar/2`.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors:\n*   For `λ₁ = +hbar/2`:\n    `(A - λ₁I) |v₁> = [[-hbar/2, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -hbar/2]] * [[a], [b]] = [[0], [0]]`\n    This leads to the equation `-a + b = 0`, or `a = b`.\n    The unnormalized eigenvector is `[[1], [1]]`. Normalizing it gives `|v₁> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [[1], [1]]`.\n\n*   For `λ₂ = -hbar/2`:\n    `(A - λ₂I) |v₂> = [[hbar/2, hbar/2], [hbar/2, hbar/2]] * [[c], [d]] = [[0], [0]]`\n    This leads to the equation `c + d = 0`, or `c = -d`.\n    The unnormalized eigenvector is `[[1], [-1]]`. Normalizing it gives `|v₂> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [[1], [-1]]`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probabilities**\n\nThe probability of measuring an eigenvalue `λᵢ` is given by `P(λᵢ) = |<vᵢ|alpha>|²`.\n\n*   **Probability of measuring λ₁ = +hbar/2 (P₁):**\n    `<v₁|alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 1] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [[1+i], [2-i]]`\n    `= (1/sqrt(14)) * [1*(1+i) + 1*(2-i)]`\n    `= (1/sqrt(14)) * (1 + i + 2 - i) = 3 / sqrt(14)`\n    `P₁ = |3 / sqrt(14)|² = 9 / 14 ≈ 0.6428`\n\n*   **Probability of measuring λ₂ = -hbar/2 (P₂):**\n    `<v₂|alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, -1] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [[1+i], [2-i]]`\n    `= (1/sqrt(14)) * [1*(1+i) - 1*(2-i)]`\n    `= (1/sqrt(14)) * (1 + i - 2 + i) = (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14)`\n    `P₂ = |(-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14)|² = ((-1)² + 2²) / 14 = (1 + 4) / 14 = 5 / 14 ≈ 0.3571`\n\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Average (Expectation) Value <A>**\n\nThe average value can be calculated in two ways:\n*   Method 1: Using eigenvalues and probabilities\n    `<A> = P₁λ₁ + P₂λ₂`\n    `<A> = (9/14) * (hbar/2) + (5/14) * (-hbar/2)`\n    `<A> = (hbar/2) * (9/14 - 5/14) = (hbar/2) * (4/14) = (hbar/2) * (2/7) = hbar / 7`\n\n*   Method 2: Using the definition `<A> = <alpha|A|alpha>`\n    `A|alpha> = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [[1+i], [2-i]] = (hbar / (2*sqrt(7))) * [[2-i], [1+i]]`\n    `<alpha|A|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [1-i, 2+i] * (hbar / (2*sqrt(7))) * [[2-i], [1+i]]`\n    `= (hbar / 14) * [(1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i)]`\n    `= (hbar / 14) * [(2 - 3i - 1) + (2 + 3i - 1)]`\n    `= (hbar / 14) * [(1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i)] = (hbar / 14) * 2 = hbar / 7`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value is `hbar / 7`. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
