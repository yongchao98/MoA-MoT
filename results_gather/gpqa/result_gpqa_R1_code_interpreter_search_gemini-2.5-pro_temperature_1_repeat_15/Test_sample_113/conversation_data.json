    "*   **Analysis of Reaction 1:**\n    *   **Reactants:** butan-2-one (a ketone), NaCN (sodium cyanide).\n    *   **Product:** 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile (a cyanohydrin).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a classic cyanohydrin formation reaction. It is a nucleophilic addition to a carbonyl group.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  The cyanide ion (CN⁻), a strong nucleophile, attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This breaks the C=O pi bond and forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.\n            `CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃ + CN⁻  →  CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃`\n        2.  The negatively charged alkoxide ion needs a proton (H⁺) to be neutralized and form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n            `CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃ + H⁺  →  CH₃-C(OH)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃`\n    *   **Role of Reagent A:** Reagent A must be the source of protons (H⁺). In a typical laboratory setting, this reaction is carried out by adding a mineral acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄) to an aqueous solution of NaCN, which generates HCN in situ. Alternatively, an acidic workup is performed after the initial nucleophilic attack. The notation H₃O⁺ represents an acidic aqueous solution, which serves as the required proton source. NaHSO₃ forms a bisulfite addition product, which is a different reaction.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** A = H₃O⁺.\n\n*   **Analysis of Reaction 2:**\n    *   **Reactant:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile (a nitrile).\n    *   **Product:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid (a carboxylic acid).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-C≡N) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   **Mechanism:** Nitrile hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either strong acid or strong base. The reaction involves the addition of water across the carbon-nitrogen triple bond.\n        *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** `R-C≡N + 2 H₂O + H⁺ → R-COOH + NH₄⁺`\n        *   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** `R-C≡N + H₂O + OH⁻ → R-COO⁻ + NH₃` (followed by acidification to get R-COOH)\n    *   **Role of Reagent B:** Reagent B acts as the catalyst for the hydrolysis in the presence of water.\n        *   `HCl` (Hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid and is a very common and effective catalyst for hydrolyzing nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n        *   `CH₃COOH` (Acetic acid) is a weak acid and is generally not strong enough to catalyze this reaction efficiently under normal conditions.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** B = HCl.\n\n*   **Final Combination:**\n    *   Reagent A is H₃O⁺.\n    *   Reagent B is HCl.\n    *   This combination matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
