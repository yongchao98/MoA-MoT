    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is `E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`. Since it's at rest, its initial momentum is `p_initial = 0`.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`. These fragments are moving, possessing kinetic energies `T1` and `T2`, and momenta `p1` and `p2`.\n\n**2. Determine the Rest Masses of the Fragments**\n\nWe are given two conditions:\n1.  One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let `m1` be the more massive fragment, so `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n2.  The sum of their rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\nWe can solve this system of equations:\n*   Substitute (1) into (2): `2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n*   `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n*   `m2 = 0.33 * M`\n*   Now find `m1`: `m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`.\n\nNow, let's express these in terms of rest-mass energy (in GeV), which is more convenient for calculations:\n*   Rest energy of m1: `m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest energy of m2: `m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Released Kinetic Energy (Q-value)**\n\nThe total kinetic energy released in the fission (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy. This \"lost\" mass is converted into kinetic energy.\n*   `Q = E_initial_rest - E_final_rest`\n*   `Q = (M * c^2) - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: `Q = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\nThe initial nucleus was at rest (`p_initial = 0`). By the law of conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero.\n*   `p_final = p1 + p2 = 0`\n*   This means the fragments move in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude: `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n\n**5. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Mechanics**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   `T1_classical = p^2 / (2 * m1)`\n*   `T2_classical = p^2 / (2 * m2)`\n\nWe can find the ratio of the kinetic energies:\n*   `T1_classical / T2_classical = (p^2 / (2*m1)) / (p^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`\n*   Since `m1 = 2 * m2`, the ratio is `T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / (2*m2) = 1/2`.\n*   This means `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nNow use the total kinetic energy equation:\n*   `T1_classical + T2_classical = Q = 3 GeV`\n*   `T1_classical + 2 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n*   `T1_classical = 1 GeV`.\n\n**6. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics**\n\nThe relativistic relationship between energy, momentum, and rest mass is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`. The total energy is `E = T + m*c^2`.\nSubstituting `E` into the relation, we get `(T + m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\nExpanding this gives `T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2) + (m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\nThis simplifies to a useful formula for the momentum: `(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`.\n\nSince the magnitudes of the momenta are equal (`p1 = p2`), we have `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n*   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n\nWe have two unknowns, `T1` and `T2`. We use the other equation we know: `T2 = Q - T1 = 3 - T1`. We also substitute the rest energies we calculated.\n*   `m1*c^2 = 198 GeV`\n*   `m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`\n\nSubstitute these into the momentum equality equation:\n*   `T1^2 + 2 * T1 * (198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2 * (3 - T1) * (99)`\n*   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n*   Now, we group terms. The `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out.\n*   `396*T1 = (9 + 594) + (-6 - 198)*T1`\n*   `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n*   `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n*   `600*T1 = 603`\n*   `T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`. This is the correct, relativistic kinetic energy.\n\n**7. Find the Difference**\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the classical and relativistic values for T1.\n*   Correct (Relativistic) `T1 = 1.005 GeV`\n*   Approximate (Classical) `T1_classical = 1.000 GeV`\n*   Difference `ΔT1 = T1 - T1_classical = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n\nFinally, convert the answer to Mega-electron Volts (MeV). Since `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n*   `ΔT1 = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`.\n\nTo confirm the calculations, we can use a Python script.\n```python\n# All energy values are in GeV\nM_c2 = 300.0\n\n# Calculate fragment rest energies\nm1_c2 = 0.66 * M_c2\nm2_c2 = 0.33 * M_c2\n\n# Calculate Q-value (total kinetic energy)\nQ = M_c2 - (m1_c2 + m2_c2)\n\n# Calculate T1 using classical approximation\n# T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 => T2_classical = T1_classical * (m1/m2)\n# T1_classical + T2_classical = Q => T1_classical + T1_classical * (m1_c2/m2_c2) = Q\n# T1_classical * (1 + m1_c2/m2_c2) = Q\n# T1_classical = Q / (1 + m1_c2/m2_c2)\nT1_classical = Q / (1 + (m1_c2 / m2_c2))\n# A simpler way is T1_classical = Q * (m2_c2 / (m1_c2 + m2_c2))\nT1_classical_simple = Q * (m2_c2 / (m1_c2 + m2_c2))\n\n\n# Calculate T1 using relativistic formula derived in the reasoning:\n# T1 * (2*(m1_c2 + m2_c2) + 2*Q) = Q * (Q + 2*m2_c2)\nnumerator = Q * (Q + 2 * m2_c2)\ndenominator = 2 * (m1_c2 + m2_c2 + Q)\nT1_relativistic = numerator / denominator\n\n# Calculate the difference in MeV\ndifference_GeV = T1_relativistic - T1_classical\ndifference_MeV = difference_GeV * 1000\n\nprint(f\"T1 (Relativistic): {T1_relativistic:.3f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"T1 (Classical): {T1_classical:.3f} GeV\")\nprint(f\"Difference: {difference_MeV:.1f} MeV\")\n```\n<execute_code>\nT1 (Relativistic): 1.005 GeV\nT1 (Classical): 1.000 GeV\nDifference: 5.0 MeV\n</execute_code>\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic kinetic energy T1 and the classically calculated T1 is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>",

Define Initial and Final States**\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A single nucleus of mass M at rest.\n    *   Initial rest energy, `E_i = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n    *   Initial momentum, `p_i = 0`.\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   Two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   The fragments are moving, so they have kinetic energies `T1` and `T2`, and momenta `p1` and `p2`.\n\n### **2. Determine Rest Masses and Energies of the Fragments**\nWe are given two pieces of information about the fragment masses:\n1.  `m1 = 2 * m2` (Let `m1` be the more massive fragment).\n2.  `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\nWe can solve this system of equations. Substitute the first equation into the second:\n`2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3*m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow, find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, calculate their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest energy of `m1`: `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest energy of `m2`: `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### **3. Calculate Total Released Kinetic Energy (Q-value)**\nThe Q-value of the reaction is the energy released as kinetic energy. This comes from the \"missing\" mass, according to `E=mc^2`.\n`Q = Initial Rest Energy - Final Rest Energy`\n`Q = (M*c^2) - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments:\n`Q = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n### **4. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\nThe initial nucleus was at rest (`p_i = 0`), so the total momentum of the fragments must be zero.\n`p1 + p2 = 0`\nThis means they fly apart in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude: `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n\n### **5. Calculate T1 (Classical Approximation)**\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\n*   `T1_classical = p^2 / (2*m1)`\n*   `T2_classical = p^2 / (2*m2)`\n\nFrom this, we can see that the kinetic energy is inversely proportional to the mass:\n`T1_classical / T2_classical = m2 / m1 = 1/2`\nSo, `T2_classical = 2 * T1_classical`.\n\nNow, use the total kinetic energy equation:\n`T1_classical + T2_classical = Q`\n`T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV`\n**`T1_classical = 1 GeV`**\n\n### **6. Calculate T1 (Correct Relativistic Value)**\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\nThe total energy is the sum of kinetic and rest energy: `E = T + m*c^2`.\nSubstituting this in, we get `(T + m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\nRearranging for momentum gives: `(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*(m*c^2)`.\n\nSince the momenta `p1` and `p2` are equal in magnitude, `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(m1*c^2) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(m2*c^2)`\n\nWe have two equations with two unknowns (`T1` and `T2`):\n1.  `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = T2^2 + 2*T2*(99)`\n2.  `T2 = 3 - T1`\n\nSubstitute (2) into (1):\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out:\n`396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n`396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n`396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n**`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`**\n\n### **7. Find the Difference**\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) `T1` and the classical approximation.\n`Difference = T1_relativistic - T1_classical`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, convert the answer from GeV to MeV (`1 GeV = 1000 MeV`):\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<B>>>"
