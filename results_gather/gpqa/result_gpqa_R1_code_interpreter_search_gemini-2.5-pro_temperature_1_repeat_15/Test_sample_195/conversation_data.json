    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the principle of conservation of energy.**\n    In a conservative system like a harmonic oscillator, the total energy is constant. The total energy is the sum of the kinetic energy and the potential energy.\n\n2.  **Define the energies at different points in the oscillation.**\n    *   **Potential Energy (U):** The force is given by Hooke's Law, $F = -kx$. The potential energy at a displacement $x$ from the equilibrium position is given by $U(x) = \\int_0^x (-F(x')) dx' = \\int_0^x kx' dx' = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n    *   **Relativistic Kinetic Energy (K):** The kinetic energy of a particle with mass $m$ moving at speed $v$ is given by $K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor and $c$ is the speed of light.\n    *   **Total Energy (E_total):** The total energy of the system, which is conserved, is $E_{total} = K + U = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the energy at the point of maximum amplitude.**\n    *   The problem states that the maximum amplitude is $A$. At this point ($x=A$), the mass is momentarily at rest before changing direction.\n    *   Therefore, its speed is $v=0$.\n    *   When $v=0$, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-0}} = 1$.\n    *   The kinetic energy is $K = (1-1)mc^2 = 0$.\n    *   The potential energy is at its maximum: $U_{max} = U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    *   So, the total energy of the system is $E_{total} = 0 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the energy at the equilibrium position.**\n    *   At the equilibrium position ($x=0$), the potential energy is zero: $U(0) = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$.\n    *   At this point, all the potential energy has been converted into kinetic energy, so the speed is maximum. Let's call this maximum speed $v_{max}$.\n    *   The Lorentz factor corresponding to this speed is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   The kinetic energy is at its maximum: $K_{max} = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n    *   The total energy at this point is $E_{total} = K_{max} + U(0) = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n\n5.  **Apply the conservation of energy.**\n    *   The total energy at the maximum amplitude must be equal to the total energy at the equilibrium position.\n    *   $E_{total}(x=A) = E_{total}(x=0)$\n    *   $\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$\n\n6.  **Solve for the maximum speed, $v_{max}$.**\n    *   First, rearrange the equation to solve for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n        $\\gamma_{max} - 1 = \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n        $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n    *   Now, substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n        $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n    *   Invert both sides of the equation:\n        $\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n    *   Square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n        $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n    *   Rearrange the terms to isolate $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n    *   Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n        $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n7.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The derived expression for $v_{max}$ is identical to option B.\n\n    $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n<<<B>>>"
