    "*   **Step-by-step Derivations:**\n\n    1.  **Structure Elucidation of the Starting Material (C8H9NO)**\n\n        *   **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n            DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n            A DBE of 5 typically indicates a benzene ring (DBE=4) and one additional double bond or ring (DBE=1).\n\n        *   **Analyze the 1H-NMR Data:**\n            *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift (>9.5 ppm) is highly characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) splitting indicates it is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-), as per the n+1 rule (n=2 protons). This confirms the fragment **-CH2-CHO**. The DBE of 1 is accounted for by the C=O bond.\n            *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region suggest a para-disubstituted benzene ring. A 1,4-disubstituted pattern often gives two doublets, each integrating to two protons.\n            *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet that integrates to 2H is characteristic of a primary amine group (-NH2). The broadness is due to rapid proton exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n            *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal represents a methylene group (-CH2-). The doublet (d) splitting indicates it is adjacent to a single proton (n=1), which is the aldehyde proton from our earlier analysis. This confirms the -CH2-CHO fragment. The chemical shift is consistent with a benzylic CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl.\n\n        *   **Assemble the Structure:**\n            We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring, an -NH2 group, and a -CH2-CHO group. Assembling these gives **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + C2H3O (side chain) + NH2 (amine) = C8H9NO. This matches the given formula.\n\n    2.  **Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n        *   **Starting Material:** 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde\n        *   **Reagents 1 & 2: NaNO2 + HCl, then H2O**\n            This is a two-step process to convert a primary aromatic amine into a phenol.\n            1.  **Diazotization:** The primary amine (-NH2) reacts with nitrous acid (formed in situ from NaNO2 and HCl) to form a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-). The aldehyde group remains unchanged. The intermediate is 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n            2.  **Hydrolysis:** Gently warming the aqueous solution of the diazonium salt causes it to decompose, replacing the -N2+ group with an -OH group and releasing nitrogen gas (N2).\n            The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n        *   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n            This step involves reacting an aldehyde (4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde) that has α-protons with a strong base (KOH) and heat. These are the classic conditions for an **Aldol Condensation**. The reaction is a self-condensation since only one type of aldehyde is present.\n\n            *   **Step A: Aldol Addition:** The base (OH-) removes an acidic α-proton from one molecule of the aldehyde to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule. Protonation of the resulting alkoxide yields an aldol addition product, which is a β-hydroxy aldehyde.\n                The product is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**. This corresponds to option (C).\n\n            *   **Step B: Dehydration (Condensation):** The reaction is carried out with **heat**. The heat promotes the elimination of a water molecule from the aldol addition product. The acidic α-proton (on C2) is removed, and the hydroxyl group on the β-carbon (C3) leaves, forming a double bond between C2 and C3. This dehydration is highly favorable because it creates a conjugated system (an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde), which is thermodynamically very stable.\n                The final condensation product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n    3.  **Identify the Final Product**\n\n        *   The question asks for the final product after all three reaction steps, including heat. The presence of \"Heat\" in the last step signifies that the reaction proceeds to the more stable condensation product, not stopping at the addition stage.\n        *   The structure of 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal matches option (A).\n        *   Option (B) is incorrect as it results from a different pathway and has only one phenyl ring.\n        *   Option (C) is the intermediate aldol addition product, not the final product under heating conditions.\n        *   Option (D) is incorrect as it lacks the hydroxyl groups that are introduced in the second step of the reaction sequence.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** The final product is the result of the aldol condensation, which is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<A>>>"
