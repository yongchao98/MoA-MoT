    "This problem can be solved using the method of images, a common technique in electrostatics.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process:\n\n1.  **Problem Setup:** We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means its electric potential is held at zero (V=0).\n\n2.  **Method of Images:** The electric field outside the sphere is created by the point charge `q` and the induced charges on the surface of the sphere. The method of images simplifies this by replacing the grounded sphere and its induced charges with a single, fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` inside the sphere. The position and magnitude of this image charge are chosen such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at radius R) is zero.\n\n3.  **Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b):**\n    *   Let the center of the sphere be the origin. The charge `q` is at `x=d`. The image charge `q'` is placed at a distance `b` from the origin along the same line.\n    *   The potential `V(P)` at any point `P` on the surface of the sphere must be zero. The potential is the sum of the potentials from `q` and `q'`.\n    *   Standard derivation for this setup shows that to make `V(P) = 0` for all points on the sphere's surface, the image charge must have:\n        *   **Magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n        *   **Position:** `b = R^2 / d` (measured from the center)\n\n4.  **Calculating the Potential Energy (U):**\n    The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d` from the center of the grounded sphere. There are two common ways to calculate this:\n\n    *   **Method 1: Integrating the Force**\n        The force on the charge `q` is due to the attraction of the induced charges on the sphere. Using the method of images, this is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n        The work done to bring `q` from infinity to `d` is the integral of the external force `F_ext = -F_electric` from infinity to `d`. The potential energy `U` is equal to this work.\n        `U = W = ∫[∞, d] F_ext dx = -∫[∞, d] F_electric dx`\n        The force on `q` when it is at a distance `x` from the center is:\n        `F_electric(x) = k * q * q' / (distance between them)^2`\n        At this point, `q' = -qR/x` and `b = R^2/x`.\n        Distance = `x - b = x - R^2/x`.\n        `F_electric(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n        The potential energy is the integral of this force (with a negative sign because `U = ∫ F⋅dl` from the final to the initial position, or `U = -W` where W is work done by the field):\n        `U = ∫[d, ∞] F_electric(x) dx = ∫[d, ∞] -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx`\n        Let `u = x^2 - R^2`, so `du = 2x dx`.\n        `U = -k * q^2 * (R/2) ∫[d^2-R^2, ∞] du / u^2`\n        `U = -k * q^2 * (R/2) * [-1/u] |_[d^2-R^2, ∞]`\n        `U = k * q^2 * (R/2) * [1/u] |_[d^2-R^2, ∞]`\n        `U = k * q^2 * (R/2) * [ (1/∞) - (1/(d^2 - R^2)) ]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    *   **Method 2: Using Potential**\n        The energy of a system of conductors and charges is `U = (1/2) Σ q_i V_i`.\n        In our case, the sphere is one conductor with `q_sphere` and `V_sphere = 0`. The point charge `q` is the other part of the system.\n        `U = (1/2) * (q_sphere * V_sphere + q * V_at_q)`\n        Since `V_sphere = 0`, this simplifies to `U = (1/2) * q * V_at_q`.\n        `V_at_q` is the potential at the location of `q` created by all other charges (i.e., the induced charges on the sphere).\n        Using the method of images, this potential is the same as the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n        Potential at `d` due to `q'` (at `b`): `V_image = k * q' / (d - b)`\n        Substitute `q' = -qR/d` and `b = R^2/d`:\n        `V_image = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d) = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n        `V_image = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n        Now, calculate the energy `U`:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V_image = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n        `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Both methods yield the same result. The potential energy of the system is `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n    This matches option A. The negative sign indicates that the force between the charge and the grounded sphere is attractive, and work is done by the electric field as the charge is brought from infinity.\n\nFinal Answer Comparison:\n*   A) `U = -(1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)` --> Matches our result.\n*   B) `U = -kq^2 * d / (d^2 - R^2)` --> Missing the (1/2) factor and has `d` instead of `R` in the numerator.\n*   C) `U = -(1/2) * kq^2 * d / (d^2 + R^2)` --> Incorrect sign in the denominator and `d` instead of `R`.\n*   D) `U = -(1/2) * kq^2 * R^2 / (d^2 - R^2)` --> Has `R^2` instead of `R` in the numerator.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
