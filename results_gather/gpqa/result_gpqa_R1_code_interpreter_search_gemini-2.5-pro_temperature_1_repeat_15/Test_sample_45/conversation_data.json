    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the number of possible products.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactant and Reaction:**\n    *   The reactant is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. \"Racemic\" means it's a 50:50 mixture of two enantiomers: (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene.\n    *   The chiral center is at carbon 3. Let's denote the chiral group, sec-butyl (-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃), as R* for the (R)-enantiomer and S* for the (S)-enantiomer. So, the reactants are CH₂=CH-R* and CH₂=CH-S*.\n    *   The catalyst is Grubbs catalyst, which facilitates olefin metathesis. Since the reactant is a terminal alkene, it will undergo self-metathesis.\n    *   The general reaction is: 2 (Alkene) → Dimer + Ethene.\n        2 (CH₂=CH-R) → R-CH=CH-R + CH₂=CH₂\n    *   The question asks to exclude ethene, so we only need to consider the dimer product, which is 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Possible Dimerization Reactions:**\n    Since the starting material is a racemic mixture, three different reaction pairings can occur:\n    *   **Homo-dimerization 1:** (R)-alkene + (R)-alkene → (R,R)-dimer\n    *   **Homo-dimerization 2:** (S)-alkene + (S)-alkene → (S,S)-dimer\n    *   **Hetero-dimerization (cross-coupling):** (R)-alkene + (S)-alkene → (R,S)-dimer\n\n3.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry of the Products:**\n    The product, 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene, has two chiral centers (C3 and C6) and a new double bond (C4=C5) that can exhibit E/Z isomerism. We need to analyze the stereoisomers formed from each reaction pathway.\n\n    *   **From (R) + (R) reaction:** The product is (3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. The new double bond can be E or Z, creating two diastereomers:\n        1.  (E)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral)\n        2.  (Z)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral)\n\n    *   **From (S) + (S) reaction:** The product is (3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. This reaction produces the enantiomers of the products from the (R)+(R) reaction:\n        3.  (E)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (enantiomer of product 1)\n        4.  (Z)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (enantiomer of product 2)\n\n    *   **From (R) + (S) reaction:** The product has both (R) and (S) configurations, i.e., (3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. Again, we consider the E and Z isomers.\n        *   **(E)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene:** Let's analyze the symmetry of this molecule. It has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral. This is a **meso compound**.\n        *   **(Z)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene:** This molecule possesses a C2 axis of rotation but lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Therefore, it is **chiral**. Since it's a chiral product formed from a racemic mixture with an achiral catalyst, it must be produced as a racemic mixture, meaning its enantiomer is also formed in equal amounts. The enantiomer is (Z)-(3S,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene.\n        So, this pathway yields three distinct stereoisomers:\n        5.  (E)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (meso, achiral)\n        6.  (Z)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (chiral)\n        7.  (Z)-(3S,6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene (enantiomer of product 6)\n\n4.  **Count the Total Number of Possible Products:**\n    Listing all the unique stereoisomers formed, we have:\n    1.  E-(3R,6R)\n    2.  Z-(3R,6R)\n    3.  E-(3S,6S)\n    4.  Z-(3S,6S)\n    5.  E-(3R,6S) (meso)\n    6.  Z-(3R,6S)\n    7.  Z-(3S,6R)\n\n    There are a total of **7** possible stereoisomeric products.\n\n5.  **Interpret the Question and Options:**\n    The calculated number of stereoisomers is 7, which is not among the options (A) 4, (B) 8, (C) 2, (D) 6. This implies the question might have a specific interpretation.\n    *   **Option A (4):** This would be the number of fractions separable by achiral chromatography (i.e., grouping enantiomeric pairs together). We would have three racemic pairs and one meso compound, making 4 fractions.\n    *   **Option D (6):** Let's re-examine our list of 7 products. There are 6 chiral molecules and 1 achiral (meso) molecule. If the question is interpreted as \"How many *chiral* products are possible?\", the answer would be 6. This is a common type of trick question in stereochemistry problems. Given that 6 is an option and 7 is not, this is the most likely intended interpretation.\n\n    Let's count the chiral products:\n    *   E-(3R,6R) and its enantiomer E-(3S,6S) -> 2 chiral products\n    *   Z-(3R,6R) and its enantiomer Z-(3S,6S) -> 2 chiral products\n    *   Z-(3R,6S) and its enantiomer Z-(3S,6R) -> 2 chiral products\n    *   E-(3R,6S) is achiral (meso).\n\n    Total number of chiral products = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\nFinal conclusion based on the provided options is that the question is asking for the number of chiral stereoisomers formed.\n\n<<<D>>>"
