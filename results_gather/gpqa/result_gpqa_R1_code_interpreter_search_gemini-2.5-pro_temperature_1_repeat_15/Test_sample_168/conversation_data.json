    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Spectrum Shape (Continuous vs. Discrete)\n\nThe shape of the energy spectrum of a particle emitted in a decay depends on the number of particles in the final state.\n\n*   **Two-body decay:** If a particle at rest decays into two final particles (e.g., A -> B + C), the laws of conservation of energy and momentum completely determine the energies of B and C. Each will have a single, fixed kinetic energy. This results in a **discrete** energy spectrum (a sharp peak).\n*   **Three-or-more-body decay:** If a particle at rest decays into three or more final particles (e.g., A -> B + C + D), the available energy (the Q-value) is shared among the final particles. The energy of any single particle is no longer fixed but can vary over a continuous range, from zero up to a maximum value. This results in a **continuous** energy spectrum.\n\nLet's apply this to the two decays in the question:\n\n*   **Original Decay:** `2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V`\n    The final state consists of the `2B` nucleus, the two `E` particles, and the two `V` particles. We can think of this as a decay into at least three \"bodies\" (the nucleus, the E particles, the V particles). Since there are more than two particles sharing the decay energy, the energy spectrum of the `E` particles will be continuous. The problem statement confirms this.\n\n*   **Variant Decay:** `2A -> 2B + 2E + M`\n    The final state consists of the `2B` nucleus, the two `E` particles, and the massless particle `M`. Again, this is a three-body final state. The energy will be shared among these three components. Therefore, the energy spectrum of the `E` particles will also be **continuous**.\n\nThis analysis eliminates options B and C, which state that the spectrum becomes discrete. The choice is now between A and D.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Spectrum Endpoint (Energy)\n\nThe endpoint of the energy spectrum corresponds to the maximum possible kinetic energy the `E` particles can have. To find this, we need to apply the principle of conservation of energy. The total energy released in the decay is determined by the difference in mass between the initial and final states.\n\nLet `m_X` be the mass of particle X, and `T_X` be its kinetic energy. The total energy released from the conversion of the nucleons `2A -> 2B` is `Q_nuc = (m(2A) - m(2B))c^2`. This energy is distributed among the rest mass and kinetic energy of the emitted particles.\n\n*   **Original Decay:** `2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V`\n    Energy conservation gives:\n    `m(2A)c^2 = m(2B)c^2 + (2m_E c^2 + T_{2E}) + (2m_V c^2 + T_{2V}) + T_{2B}`\n    The total kinetic energy of the `E` particles is `T_{2E}`. Let's find its maximum possible value, which is the endpoint `Q`.\n    `T_{2E} = (m(2A) - m(2B))c^2 - 2m_E c^2 - 2m_V c^2 - T_{2V} - T_{2B}`\n    `T_{2E}` is maximized when the other kinetic energy terms (`T_{2V}` and `T_{2B}`) are minimized. The minimum kinetic energy is zero (neglecting the tiny recoil energy of the heavy `2B` nucleus).\n    So, the endpoint `Q` is:\n    `Q = (T_{2E})_max ≈ (m(2A) - m(2B))c^2 - 2m_E c^2 - 2m_V c^2`\n\n*   **Variant Decay:** `2A -> 2B + 2E + M`\n    Energy conservation gives:\n    `m(2A)c^2 = m(2B)c^2 + (2m_E c^2 + T_{2E}) + (m_M c^2 + T_M) + T_{2B}`\n    We are given that particle `M` is massless, so `m_M = 0`.\n    `T_{2E} = (m(2A) - m(2B))c^2 - 2m_E c^2 - T_M - T_{2B}`\n    The new endpoint, let's call it `Q'`, is the maximum value of `T_{2E}`. This occurs when `T_M` and `T_{2B}` are minimized (i.e., zero).\n    `Q' = (T_{2E})_max ≈ (m(2A) - m(2B))c^2 - 2m_E c^2`\n\n### 3. Compare the Endpoints\n\nNow we compare the new endpoint `Q'` with the original endpoint `Q`:\n`Q' = (m(2A) - m(2B) - 2m_E)c^2`\n`Q = (m(2A) - m(2B) - 2m_E)c^2 - 2m_V c^2`\n\nWe can see that `Q' = Q + 2m_V c^2`.\n\nSince `V` is a particle, its mass `m_V` must be greater than or equal to zero. As it's described as a light particle emitted in a decay (analogous to a neutrino), it has a small but positive mass (`m_V > 0`). Therefore, `2m_V c^2` is a positive amount of energy.\n\nThis means `Q' > Q`. The endpoint of the spectrum for the variant decay is higher than the endpoint for the original decay.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n1.  The spectrum **remains continuous** because the decay product is still a multi-body state.\n2.  The endpoint of the spectrum **increases** because replacing two massive particles (`2V`) with one massless particle (`M`) frees up the rest mass energy of the `2V` particles to be converted into kinetic energy.\n\nThe phrase \"with an adjusted shape\" in the correct option is also accurate. The detailed shape of the energy spectrum depends on the phase space available to the final particles. Since the number, masses, and available energy of the final particles have changed, the statistical distribution of energy, and thus the shape of the spectrum, will also change.\n\nPutting it all together, the correct option is that the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.\n\n<<<D>>>"
