    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon that is fully saturated (does not react further with hydrogen). This means it is an alkane (CnH2n+2) or a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let's determine the formula of Z.\n    *   The mass fraction of Hydrogen (H) in a hydrocarbon (CxHy) is given by:\n        Mass % H = (y * AtomicMass(H)) / (x * AtomicMass(C) + y * AtomicMass(H)) * 100%\n    *   Using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1):\n        For an alkane (CnH2n+2): Mass % H = (2n+2) / (12n + 2n+2) = (2n+2) / (14n+2). As n gets larger, this approaches 2/14 = 1/7 ≈ 14.3%.\n        For a cycloalkane (CnH2n): Mass % H = (2n) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 14.2857%.\n    *   The value 14.28% is an excellent match for 1/7, which corresponds to the general formula CnH2n. Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. Let's assume Z is cyclohexane.\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, C and D.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y gives only substance Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is itself a component of Y. Let's say C = Z = Cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    *   Since hydrogenation of Y gives only cyclohexane, the other component, D, must also hydrogenate to cyclohexane. This means D must have a 6-carbon ring skeleton.\n    *   Since D does not decolorize bromine water, it must be saturated or aromatic. It cannot be cyclohexane (since C and D are different). The only remaining possibility for a C6-ring structure is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene does not react with bromine water and is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n    *   So, **Mixture Y = Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)**. This fits all the conditions.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, A and B.\n    *   X is converted to Y by treatment with platinum when heated in a disproportionation reaction. Disproportionation here implies a hydrogen transfer reaction.\n        `A + B --(Pt, heat)--> C + D`\n        `A + B --(Pt, heat)--> Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)`\n    *   This is a hydrogen transfer: one reactant is oxidized (loses H) to form benzene, and the other is reduced (gains H) to form cyclohexane.\n    *   By conservation of atoms, the total number of carbon and hydrogen atoms must be the same on both sides of the reaction.\n        Total atoms in products = (C6H12 + C6H6) = C12H18.\n        Therefore, total atoms in reactants = A + B = C12H18.\n    *   The problem states that hydrogenation of mixture X (A and B) gives *only* one substance, Z (cyclohexane). This implies that both A and B have the same carbon skeleton: a 6-carbon ring.\n    *   So, A must be C6Hx and B must be C6Hy.\n    *   From the atom balance, we have x + y = 18.\n\n4.  **Identify Liquids in Mixture X**\n    *   We need to find two different C6-ring molecules, A and B, where the sum of their hydrogen atoms is 18.\n    *   The reaction is: `C6Hx + C6Hy -> C6H12 + C6H6`.\n        One molecule is oxidized to benzene (C6H6), and the other is reduced to cyclohexane (C6H12). For example:\n        `C6Hx -> C6H6 + (x-6)H` (oxidation)\n        `C6Hy + (12-y)H -> C6H12` (reduction)\n        For the hydrogen transfer to balance, `x-6 = 12-y`, which simplifies to `x+y = 18`. This confirms our previous finding.\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, meaning both A and B must be unsaturated (contain C=C bonds).\n    *   The problem also states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of mixture X.\n    *   Let's consider possible unsaturated C6-ring structures:\n        *   Cyclohexene (C6H10)\n        *   Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)\n    *   Let's try the combination: A = C6H10 and B = C6H8. The sum of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18. This works.\n    *   Let's check the structures and conditions:\n        *   A = **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**. It has one double bond, so it is unsaturated and has no conjugated bonds.\n        *   B = **Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**. There are two isomers: cyclohexa-1,3-diene (conjugated) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene (non-conjugated). The problem specifies no conjugated bonds, so B must be **cyclohexa-1,4-diene**.\n    *   This pair of molecules, cyclohexene and cyclohexa-1,4-diene, fits all the conditions described for mixture X.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of liquid A and one molecule of liquid B.\n    *   Liquid A = Cyclohexene (C6H10). Number of H atoms = 10.\n    *   Liquid B = Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C6H8). Number of H atoms = 8.\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
