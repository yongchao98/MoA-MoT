    "*   **Initial Setup and Formulas**\n    The number of particles, N, that survive after traveling a distance R is given by the exponential decay law:\n    N = N₀ * exp(-t / τ')\n    where:\n    *   N₀ is the initial number of particles.\n    *   t is the time elapsed in the lab frame.\n    *   τ' is the mean lifetime of the particles in the lab frame.\n\n    The particles travel at ultra-relativistic speeds, so their velocity v is approximately the speed of light, c. The time t to travel the radius R = 30 m is:\n    t = R / v ≈ R / c\n\n    Due to time dilation, the lifetime of the particles in the lab frame (τ') is longer than their proper lifetime (τ) in their own rest frame. This is given by:\n    τ' = γ * τ\n    where γ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n    Substituting these into the decay equation, we get the fraction of particles reaching the detector wall:\n    N/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ)) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))\n\n*   **Analyze the First Condition**\n    We are given that when the Lorentz factor γ₁ = 20, one-third (1/3) of the particles reach the detector.\n    1/3 = exp(-R / (γ₁ * c * τ))\n    1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 * c * τ))\n\n    To solve for the unknown constant term (c * τ), we can take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * c * τ)\n    -ln(3) = -30 / (20 * c * τ)\n    ln(3) = 30 / (20 * c * τ)  (Equation 1)\n\n*   **Analyze the Second Condition**\n    We need to find the new Lorentz factor, γ₂, required for two-thirds (2/3) of the particles to reach the detector.\n    2/3 = exp(-R / (γ₂ * c * τ))\n    2/3 = exp(-30 / (γ₂ * c * τ))\n\n    Again, taking the natural logarithm:\n    ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)\n    -ln(3/2) = -30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)\n    ln(1.5) = 30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)  (Equation 2)\n\n*   **Solve for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂)**\n    We now have a system of two equations. A simple way to solve this is to divide Equation 1 by Equation 2:\n    ln(3) / ln(1.5) = [30 / (20 * c * τ)] / [30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)]\n    ln(3) / ln(1.5) = (30 * γ₂ * c * τ) / (30 * 20 * c * τ)\n\n    The terms '30', 'c', and 'τ' cancel out:\n    ln(3) / ln(1.5) = γ₂ / 20\n\n    Now, we can solve for γ₂:\n    γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(1.5))\n\n    To get a numerical value, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ngamma_2 = 20 * (math.log(3) / math.log(1.5))\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 54.19. This value is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem involves the relativistic effect of time dilation on particle decay.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics**\n\nThe fraction of particles, `N/N₀`, that survive after traveling a time `t` in the laboratory frame is given by the exponential decay law:\n`N/N₀ = exp(-t / τ_lab)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `N₀` is the initial number of particles.\n*   `N` is the number of particles remaining.\n*   `t` is the time elapsed in the lab frame.\n*   `τ_lab` is the mean lifetime of the particles as measured in the lab frame.\n\nDue to time dilation, the lifetime measured in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) is related to the particle's proper lifetime (`τ_proper`, its lifetime in its own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor, `γ`:\n`τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`\n\nThe particles are ultra-relativistic, so their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time `t` it takes them to travel the detector radius `R` is:\n`t = R / v ≈ R / c`\n\nSubstituting these into the decay equation, we get a general formula for the fraction of surviving particles:\n`N/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ_proper)) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ_proper))`\n\nLet's group the constants `R`, `c`, and `τ_proper` into a single constant `K`, since they do not change between the two scenarios: `K = R / (c * τ_proper)`.\nThe formula simplifies to:\n`N/N₀ = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n**2. Apply the First Condition**\n\nWe are given that when the Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`, one-third of the particles reach the detector (`N/N₀ = 1/3`).\n`1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\nTo solve for `K`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n`-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n`K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n**3. Apply the Second Condition**\n\nWe need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, required for two-thirds of the particles to survive (`N/N₀ = 2/3`).\n`2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\nAgain, take the natural logarithm:\n`ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n`-ln(3/2) = -K / γ₂`\n`ln(1.5) = K / γ₂`\n`K = γ₂ * ln(1.5)`\n\n**4. Solve for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂)**\n\nWe now have two expressions for the constant `K`. We can set them equal to each other:\n`20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(1.5)`\n\nNow, solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(1.5))`\n\nUsing the provided code output:\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\nThis value is closest to the option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
