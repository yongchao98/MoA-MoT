    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n**1. Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The hydrogen bonding causes the peak to be very broad.\n*   **A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position (around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹) is typical for the carbonyl group in a saturated carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n**2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in deciphering the complex splitting patterns described. The multiplicity of a signal is determined by the number of adjacent non-equivalent protons (n) according to the (n+1) rule. Complex splitting (multiplet of multiplets) occurs when a proton is coupled to multiple, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated compounds, which is consistent with this information.\n*   **Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This means a proton (let's call it H_A) is coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet:** H_A is adjacent to one proton (n=1, 1+1=2).\n    *   **Triplet:** H_A is adjacent to a group of two equivalent protons (like a CH₂ group, n=2, 2+1=3).\n    *   **Quartet:** H_A is adjacent to a group of three equivalent protons (like a CH₃ group, n=3, 3+1=4).\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a proton with the following neighbors: a CH group, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group.\n*   **Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This means a different proton (let's call it H_B) is also coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet:** H_B is adjacent to one proton (n=1, 1+1=2).\n    *   **Triplet:** H_B is adjacent to a group of two equivalent protons (a CH₂ group, n=2, 2+1=3).\n    *   **Triplet:** H_B is also adjacent to a *different* group of two equivalent protons (another CH₂ group, n=2, 2+1=3).\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a proton with the following neighbors: a CH group and two different CH₂ groups.\n\n**3. Evaluating Each Structure**\n\nLet's analyze each option to see if it contains protons that would produce both of these specific splitting patterns. We will number the carbon chain starting from the COOH group as carbon 1.\n\n*   **A) 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid (CH₃CH₂CH(CH₃)CH(CH₃)COOH):**\n    *   H at C3 is coupled to H at C2 (1H), the CH₂ at C4 (2H), and the CH₃ at C3 (3H). This would give a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches Signal 1.\n    *   However, there is no proton in this molecule that is coupled to one proton and two different CH₂ groups. Thus, it cannot produce Signal 2. **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n*   **C) 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid (CH₃CH(CH₃)CH(CH₃)CH₂COOH):**\n    *   H at C3 is coupled to the CH₂ at C2 (2H), H at C4 (1H), and the CH₃ at C3 (3H). This would give a **triplet of doublets of quartets (tdq)**, which is the same pattern as a dtq. This matches Signal 1.\n    *   There is no proton coupled to one proton and two different CH₂ groups. Thus, it cannot produce Signal 2. **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid (CH₃CH₂CH(C₂H₅)CH(C₂H₅)COOH):**\n    *   H at C3 is coupled to H at C2 (1H), the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H), and the CH₂ at C4 (2H). This would give a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches Signal 2.\n    *   However, there is no proton in this molecule that is coupled to one proton, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group. Thus, it cannot produce Signal 1. **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH:**\n    This condensed formula is ambiguous. To determine the structure, we must draw it out and apply IUPAC rules to find the longest carbon chain containing the COOH group.\n    `CH₃-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`\n    The longest chain is a heptanoic acid derivative:\n    `COOH(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(4)(Me)-CH₂(5)-CH₂(6)-CH₃(7)`\n    The correct name is **3-ethyl-4-methylheptanoic acid**. Let's analyze the key protons in this structure:\n    *   **H at C4:** This proton is coupled to H at C3 (1H), the CH₃ group attached to C4 (3H), and the CH₂ group at C5 (2H). This environment (neighbors: 1H, 3H, 2H) will produce a **doublet of quartets of triplets (dqt)**. This matches the pattern of Signal 1.\n    *   **H at C3:** This proton is coupled to H at C4 (1H), the CH₂ group at C2 (2H), and the CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent on C3 (2H). This environment (neighbors: 1H, 2H, 2H) will produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches Signal 2.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly the structure corresponding to option B, which is correctly identified as 3-ethyl-4-methylheptanoic acid, contains protons that would generate both a \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" and a \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>"
