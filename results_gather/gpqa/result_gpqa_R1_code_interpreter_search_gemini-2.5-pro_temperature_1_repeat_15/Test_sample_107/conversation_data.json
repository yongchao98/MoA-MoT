    "To solve this problem, we need to compare the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling energy, $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$, with the transition energy, $\\Delta E$, of a hydrogen atom.\n\n### 1. Calculation of the Transition Energy ($\\Delta E$)\n\nThe transition energy $\\Delta E$ can be calculated from the given wavelength $\\lambda$ of the emitted photon using the Planck-Einstein relation:\n\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\n\nWhere:\n-   $h$ is the Planck constant ($6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J}\\cdot\\text{s}$)\n-   $c$ is the speed of light ($3.00 \\times 10^{8} \\text{ m/s}$)\n-   $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of the transition ($0.4861 \\mu\\text{m} = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$)\n\nTo make the comparison easier, we will calculate the energy in electron volts (eV). We can use the convenient formula:\n\n$\\Delta E (\\text{eV}) = \\frac{1240 \\text{ eV}\\cdot\\text{nm}}{\\lambda (\\text{nm})}$\n\nFirst, convert the wavelength to nanometers:\n$\\lambda = 0.4861 \\mu\\text{m} = 486.1 \\text{ nm}$\n\nNow, calculate the energy:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{1240 \\text{ eV}\\cdot\\text{nm}}{486.1 \\text{ nm}} \\approx 2.55 \\text{ eV}$\n\nThis wavelength corresponds to the Balmer series (n=4 to n=2 transition) in the hydrogen spectrum, which is a typical electronic transition energy.\n\n### 2. Calculation of the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy ($\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$)\n\nThe paramagnetic coupling term, also known as the Zeeman effect energy, describes the interaction of an atom's orbital magnetic moment with an external magnetic field. The Hamiltonian for this interaction is:\n\n$H = -\\vec{\\mu}_L \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nThe orbital magnetic moment $\\vec{\\mu}_L$ is related to the orbital angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ by:\n\n$\\vec{\\mu}_L = -\\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L}$\n\nWhere $e$ is the elementary charge and $m_e$ is the electron mass.\nThe Hamiltonian becomes:\n\n$H = \\frac{e}{2m_e} \\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nThe magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is given to be parallel to the z-axis, so $\\vec{B} = B\\hat{z}$. The dot product simplifies to $\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B} = L_z B$.\n\n$H = \\frac{eB}{2m_e} L_z$\n\nThe expectation value of the energy, $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle$, is the energy shift. The eigenvalues of the $L_z$ operator are $m\\hbar$, where $m$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number.\n\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\frac{eB}{2m_e} (m\\hbar) = m \\left( \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e} \\right) B$\n\nThe term in the parenthesis is the Bohr magneton, $\\mu_B$.\n\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = m \\mu_B B$\n\nWe are given:\n-   $B = 1 \\text{ T}$\n-   \"small values of m\". We can take $m=1$ as a representative case.\n-   The value of the Bohr magneton is $\\mu_B = 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/T}$.\n\nNow, calculate the paramagnetic coupling energy:\n\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = (1) \\times (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/T}) \\times (1 \\text{ T})$\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}$\n\n### 3. Comparison\n\nNow we compare the order of magnitude of the two energies:\n\n-   Transition Energy: $\\Delta E \\approx 2.55 \\text{ eV}$\n-   Paramagnetic Coupling Energy: $\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\approx 5.79 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}$\n\nLet's find the ratio:\n\n$\\frac{\\Delta E}{\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle} = \\frac{2.55}{5.788 \\times 10^{-5}} \\approx 44000 \\approx 4.4 \\times 10^4$\n\nThe transition energy is more than four orders of magnitude larger than the paramagnetic coupling energy for a 1T field. Therefore, the paramagnetic coupling term is much, much smaller than the transition energy.\n\n$\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E$\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
