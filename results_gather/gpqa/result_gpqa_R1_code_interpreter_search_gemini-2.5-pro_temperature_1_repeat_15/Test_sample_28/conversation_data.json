    "To solve this problem, we need to determine which mutation is most likely to result in a non-functional protein, thereby eliminating the production of the anti-nutritional compound. A non-functional protein is most reliably created by a mutation that causes translation to stop prematurely, especially early in the gene sequence. This type of mutation is called a nonsense mutation, which changes an amino acid-coding codon into a stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA).\n\nLet's analyze the genetic sequences by breaking them down into three-letter codons and translating them into amino acids. The starting point for translation is the `ATG` codon, which codes for Methionine.\n\n**1. Intact Gene Analysis:**\n*   Sequence: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...-3’\n*   Codons:\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (Start)\n    *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine\n    *   `CTC` -> Leucine\n    *   `GCT` -> Alanine\n    *   `GGT` -> Glycine\n*   Protein Start: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - ...\n    This is the original, functional protein that we want to inactivate.\n\n**2. Mutant Analysis:**\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT...-3’\n    *   Comparison: The second codon `TTT` is changed to `TTC`, and the third codon `CTC` is changed to `TAC`.\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine\n    *   `TTC` -> Phenylalanine (Note: `TTT` and `TTC` both code for Phenylalanine, so this part is a *silent mutation*).\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Note: `CTC` for Leucine is changed to `TAC` for Tyrosine. This is a *missense mutation*).\n    *   Protein Start: Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly - ...\n    *   **Effect:** One amino acid is changed. This might alter or destroy the protein's function, but it's not guaranteed. The protein could still be partially or fully functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT...-3’\n    *   Comparison: The second codon `TTT` is changed to `TTC`, and the third codon `CTC` is changed to `TAA`.\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine\n    *   `TTC` -> Phenylalanine (Silent mutation).\n    *   `TAA` -> **STOP** codon. This is a *nonsense mutation*.\n    *   Protein Start: Met - Phe - [STOP]\n    *   **Effect:** Translation will terminate after the second amino acid. The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid fragment instead of a full-length protein. This fragment will be non-functional. This is the most definitive way to eliminate the protein's activity.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’\n    *   Comparison: The third codon `CTC` is changed to `TAC`, and the sixth codon `ACT` is changed to `GTC`.\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine\n    *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Missense mutation: Leucine -> Tyrosine).\n    *   `GTC` -> Valine (Missense mutation: Threonine -> Valine).\n    *   Protein Start: Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Gly - **Val** - ...\n    *   **Effect:** Two amino acids are changed. While more disruptive than one change, it is still not a guarantee of complete inactivation.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...-3’\n    *   Comparison: The original sequence `CTC GCT GGT` has been changed to `TAC GCT`. This represents a change of `CTC` to `TAC` and a deletion of the `GGT` codon.\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine\n    *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Missense mutation: Leucine -> Tyrosine).\n    *   `GGT` -> Deleted (This is an in-frame deletion of the Glycine amino acid).\n    *   Protein Start: Met - Phe - **Tyr** - Ala - Thr - ...\n    *   **Effect:** One amino acid is changed, and another is deleted. This is a major alteration and is likely to disrupt protein function, but because the reading frame is preserved, a nearly full-length (but altered) protein will still be produced. Its potential for residual function is higher than that of Mutant 2.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe most reliable way to eliminate the function of a gene is to introduce a premature stop codon early in its sequence. Mutant 2 contains a nonsense mutation (`CTC` to `TAA`) at the third codon, which will lead to the production of a severely truncated and non-functional dipeptide. The other mutations (missense and in-frame deletion) result in altered but full-length or near-full-length proteins, which have a higher chance of retaining some function.\n\nTherefore, Mutant 2 is the mutation most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nTo confirm this reasoning, let's translate the beginning of each DNA sequence.\n```python\ndef translate_dna(dna_sequence):\n    \"\"\"Translates a DNA sequence into a protein sequence.\"\"\"\n    genetic_code = {\n        'ATA':'I', 'ATC':'I', 'ATT':'I', 'ATG':'M',\n        'ACA':'T', 'ACC':'T', 'ACG':'T', 'ACT':'T',\n        'AAC':'N', 'AAT':'N', 'AAA':'K', 'AAG':'K',\n        'AGC':'S', 'AGT':'S', 'AGA':'R', 'AGG':'R',\n        'CTA':'L', 'CTC':'L', 'CTG':'L', 'CTT':'L',\n        'CCA':'P', 'CCC':'P', 'CCG':'P', 'CCT':'P',\n        'CAC':'H', 'CAT':'H', 'CAA':'Q', 'CAG':'Q',\n        'CGA':'R', 'CGC':'R', 'CGG':'R', 'CGT':'R',\n        'GTA':'V', 'GTC':'V', 'GTG':'V', 'GTT':'V',\n        'GCA':'A', 'GCC':'A', 'GCG':'A', 'GCT':'A',\n        'GAC':'D', 'GAT':'D', 'GAA':'E', 'GAG':'E',\n        'GGA':'G', 'GGC':'G', 'GGG':'G', 'GGT':'G',\n        'TCA':'S', 'TCC':'S', 'TCG':'S', 'TCT':'S',\n        'TTC':'F', 'TTT':'F', 'TTA':'L', 'TTG':'L',\n        'TAC':'Y', 'TAT':'Y', 'TAA':'_', 'TAG':'_',\n        'TGC':'C', 'TGT':'C', 'TGA':'_', 'TGG':'W',\n    }\n    protein = \"\"\n    # Process the sequence in chunks of 3 (codons)\n    for i in range(0, len(dna_sequence) - (len(dna_sequence) % 3), 3):\n        codon = dna_sequence[i:i+3]\n        amino_acid = genetic_code.get(codon, '?')\n        if amino_acid == '_': # Stop codon\n            break\n        protein += amino_acid\n    return protein\n\n# Reconstruct sequences based on the likely intended mutations described in the analysis\nintact_gene = \"ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\"\n# Mutant 1: ATG-TTC-TAC...

Mutant 2 results in a protein of only two amino acids (`MF`) before translation is terminated. This truncated peptide is inactive. The other mutants produce much longer, albeit altered, proteins. Therefore, Mutant 2 is the correct choice.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The goal is to find the mutation that is most likely to eliminate the function of the gene that produces an anti-nutritional compound. The most effective way to completely inactivate a gene's protein product is to introduce a mutation that causes translation to stop prematurely, especially near the beginning of the coding sequence. This is called a nonsense mutation, which changes an amino acid-coding codon into a stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA).\n\nLet's analyze the effect of each mutation by translating the DNA sequence into its corresponding amino acid sequence. The translation starts at the `ATG` codon.\n\n1.  **Intact Gene:**\n    *   Sequence: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...-3’\n    *   Translation: Met (M) - Phe (F) - Leu (L) - Ala (A) - Gly (G) - Thr (T)...\n    *   This sequence produces the functional protein that synthesizes the unwanted compound.\n\n2.  **Mutant 1:**\n    *   Sequence: 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT...-3’\n    *   Changes: The original third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). The second codon change from `TTT` to `TTC` is silent as both code for Phenylalanine.\n    *   Translation: Met (M) - Phe (F) - **Tyr (Y)** - Ala (A) - Gly (G) - Thr (T)...\n    *   Effect: This is a **missense mutation**. It changes one amino acid in the protein chain. While this *might* disrupt the protein's function, it is not guaranteed. The protein could still be partially or fully active.\n\n3.  **Mutant 2:**\n    *   Sequence: 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT...-3’\n    *   Changes: The original third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`.\n    *   Translation: Met (M) - Phe (F) - **STOP**.\n    *   Effect: This is a **nonsense mutation**. `TAA` is a stop codon. Translation will terminate after only two amino acids have been joined. The resulting product is a tiny, two-amino-acid fragment (a dipeptide), which will be completely non-functional. This is the most certain way to eliminate the protein's activity.\n\n4.  **Mutant 3:**\n    *   Sequence: 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’\n    *   Changes: Two changes are present. The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and the sixth codon `ACT` (Threonine) is changed to `GTC` (Valine).\n    *   Translation: Met (M) - Phe (F) - **Tyr (Y)** - Ala (A) - Gly (G) - **Val (V)**...\n    *   Effect: These are two **missense mutations**. Similar to Mutant 1, this changes amino acids but does not guarantee a complete loss of function.\n\n5.  **Mutant 4:**\n    *   Sequence: 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...-3’\n    *   Changes: The codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and the codon `GGT` (Glycine) has been deleted.\n    *   Translation: Met (M) - Phe (F) - **Tyr (Y)** - Ala (A) - Thr (T) - Ser (S)... (Glycine is missing).\n    *   Effect: This is an **in-frame deletion** (a deletion of 3 bases) combined with a missense mutation. The reading frame is maintained, but the resulting protein is missing one amino acid and has another one changed. This is a significant alteration, but it is less likely to cause a complete loss of function compared to a premature stop codon.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nMutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon very early in the sequence, leading to a severely truncated and non-functional protein. This is the most reliable way to eliminate the production of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<B>>>"
