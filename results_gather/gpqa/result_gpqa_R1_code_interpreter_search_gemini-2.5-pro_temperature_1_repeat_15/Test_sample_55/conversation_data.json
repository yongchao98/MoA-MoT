    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the process:** The problem describes a two-step decay (a cascade) of a hydrogen atom from the excited state |n=3, l=0, m=0> to the ground state |n=1, l=0, m=0> through an intermediate state. The decay occurs via two electric dipole transitions.\n\n2.  **Recall the selection rules for electric dipole transitions:**\n    For a transition from an initial state |n, l, m> to a final state |n', l', m'>, the following rules must be obeyed:\n    *   The change in the principal quantum number, Δn = n' - n, can be any integer. For decay, n' < n.\n    *   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, Δl = l' - l, must be ±1.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number, Δm = m' - m, must be 0 or ±1.\n\n3.  **Determine the possible intermediate states:**\n    Let the intermediate state be |n_int, l_int, m_int>.\n    *   **Step 1: |3,0,0> → |n_int, l_int, m_int>**\n        *   Initial state: l=0, m=0.\n        *   Applying the selection rule Δl = ±1, the intermediate state must have l_int = l + 1 = 1 (since l cannot be negative).\n        *   Applying the selection rule Δm = 0, ±1, the intermediate state can have m_int = m + Δm = 0 + (0, ±1), so m_int can be 0, +1, or -1.\n        *   The principal quantum number must decrease. The options suggest that the intermediate state has n_int = 2. This is a valid decay (3 → 2).\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,-1>.\n\n    *   **Step 2: |n_int, l_int, m_int> → |1,0,0>**\n        *   Intermediate state: l_int = 1, m_int ∈ {1, 0, -1}.\n        *   Final state: l_final = 0, m_final = 0.\n        *   Let's check if this transition is allowed for all possible intermediate states:\n            *   Δl = l_final - l_int = 0 - 1 = -1. This is allowed.\n            *   Δm = m_final - m_int = 0 - m_int.\n                *   If m_int = 1, Δm = -1 (allowed).\n                *   If m_int = 0, Δm = 0 (allowed).\n                *   If m_int = -1, Δm = +1 (allowed).\n        *   So, all three routes proposed in options A, B, and C are physically possible according to the selection rules.\n\n4.  **Calculate the probability of each transition route:**\n    The overall process is a cascade: |3,0,0> → |2,1,m_int> → |1,0,0>. The \"probability\" of a specific route refers to the branching ratio of the first step, i.e., the probability that the atom decays into that specific intermediate state. The second step is then a necessary consequence of being in that intermediate state.\n\n    We need to find the relative transition rates (and thus probabilities) for the first step:\n    *   Route A: |3,0,0> → |2,1,1>\n    *   Route B: |3,0,0> → |2,1,0>\n    *   Route C: |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>\n\n    The transition rate Γ for spontaneous emission from an initial state |i> to a final state |f> is given by Fermi's Golden Rule and is proportional to the square of the matrix element of the electric dipole operator **d** = e**r**:\n    $Γ_{i→f} ∝ |⟨f|e\\textbf{r}|i⟩|^2$\n    When averaged over all emission directions and polarizations, the rate is proportional to the sum of the squares of the matrix elements for the x, y, and z components:\n    $Γ_{i→f} ∝ |⟨f|ex|i⟩|^2 + |⟨f|ey|i⟩|^2 + |⟨f|ez|i⟩|^2$\n\n    A key insight comes from the symmetry of the initial state. The state |3,0,0> has l=0, meaning its wavefunction is spherically symmetric (the spherical harmonic Y_{0,0} is a constant). Because the initial state has no preferred direction in space, the probability of the atom emitting a photon and transitioning to a final state should be independent of the orientation of the final state's angular momentum. The quantum number 'm' represents the projection of the angular momentum onto the z-axis. Therefore, the probabilities of transitioning to the final states |2,1,1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,-1> must be equal.\n\n    Since these are the only three possible outcomes for the first decay step (to a state with l=1), their probabilities must sum to 1.\n    Let P(m_int) be the probability of transitioning to the state with magnetic quantum number m_int.\n    P(1) + P(0) + P(-1) = 1\n    Since P(1) = P(0) = P(-1) due to symmetry, we have:\n    3 * P(m_int) = 1\n    P(m_int) = 1/3\n\n    So, the probability for each of the three possible first steps is 1/3.\n    *   Probability of route via |2,1,1> is 1/3.\n    *   Probability of route via |2,1,0> is 1/3.\n    *   Probability of route via |2,1,-1> is 1/3.\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) Route |3,0,0>→|2,1,1>→|1,0,0> and probability 1/4. The route is correct, but the calculated probability is 1/3. So, A is incorrect.\n    *   B) Route |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and probability 1/3. The route is correct, and the calculated probability is 1/3. So, B is correct.\n    *   C) Route |3,0,0>→|2,1,-1>→|1,0,0> and probability 1/4. The route is correct, but the calculated probability is 1/3. So, C is incorrect.\n    *   D) Route |3,0,0>→|2,1,0>→|1,0,0> and probability 2/3. The route is correct, but the calculated probability is 1/3. So, D is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that presents a valid transition route with the correct corresponding probability is B.\n\nFinal Answer Check: The calculation based on the spherical symmetry of the initial l=0 state is robust. A detailed calculation of the matrix elements confirms that the transition rates to the m=+1, m=0, and m=-1 sublevels of the l=1 state are indeed identical, leading to a 1/3 branching ratio for each.\n\n<<<B>>>"
