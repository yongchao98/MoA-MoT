    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial setup:** We have an uncharged spherical conductor. This means the conductor itself has a net charge of zero. A positive point charge `+q` is then placed inside a cavity within this conductor.\n\n2.  **Principle of Electrostatic Induction:** The presence of the positive charge `+q` inside the cavity will cause the mobile electrons within the conductor to redistribute.\n    *   Electrons will be attracted towards the charge `+q`, accumulating on the inner surface of the cavity. This creates an induced charge on the inner surface. By Gauss's Law (considering a Gaussian surface within the conducting material, enclosing the cavity), the total charge on the inner surface must be `-q` to make the electric field inside the conductor zero.\n    *   Since the conductor was initially uncharged (net charge = 0), and a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a corresponding positive charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor to maintain the conductor's overall charge neutrality.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key property of a closed conducting shell is that it shields the region outside the shell from the electric fields of any charges placed inside it. The electric field inside the bulk of the conductor must be zero in electrostatic equilibrium. This zero field is a superposition of the field from the charge `+q` in the cavity, the field from the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface, and the field from the induced charge `+q` on the outer surface. The consequence is that the combined electric field produced by the charge `+q` in the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the inner surface is exactly zero everywhere outside the cavity.\n\n4.  **Field at Point P:** The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is the superposition of the fields from all charges.\n    *   Field from (`+q` inside cavity + `-q` on inner surface) = 0 at point P.\n    *   Field from `+q` on the outer surface.\n\n    Therefore, the electric field at point P is determined *solely* by the charge `+q` residing on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n5.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** The charge `+q` on the outer surface is shielded from the specific location of the charge `+q` and the cavity inside. Since the outer surface is a sphere and there are no other external electric fields mentioned, this charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the surface of the sphere to achieve the lowest energy state.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Electric Field (Shell Theorem):** According to the shell theorem (a result of Gauss's Law), the electric field at a point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field that would be produced if all the charge were concentrated into a single point charge at the center of the sphere.\n    *   The total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n    *   The center of the spherical conductor is O.\n    *   The distance from the center O to the point P is `L`.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** Using Coulomb's Law for a point charge, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is:\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{Total Charge}}{\\text{distance}^2}$\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The other parameters given in the problem, such as the cavity's radius `r`, its position `s`, the distance `l` from the cavity's center, and the angle `Î¸`, are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor. They are distractors intended to test the understanding of electrostatic shielding.\n\nThe correct expression for the magnitude of the electric field at point P is given by option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
