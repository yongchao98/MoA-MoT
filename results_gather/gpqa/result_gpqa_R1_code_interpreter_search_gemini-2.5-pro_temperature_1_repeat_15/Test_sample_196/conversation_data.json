    "**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n*   **Step 1: Elucidate the structure of the starting material, Compound X, from the provided spectroscopic data.**\n\n    *   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum:**\n        *   The broad absorption from 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid, broadened by hydrogen bonding.\n        *   The strong absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, specifically from a carboxylic acid.\n        *   The absorptions at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ suggest the presence of C=C stretching from an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This is a very downfield, broad singlet. This chemical shift is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the finding from the IR data.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The doublet at 8.0 ppm is significantly downfield, which is expected for protons ortho to a strong electron-withdrawing group like a carboxylic acid. The doublet at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the other substituent.\n        *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:** Now let's analyze the remaining signals to determine the structure of the second substituent on the benzene ring.\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3H indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet integrating to 3H indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet integrating to 2H is consistent with a methylene group (-CH₂-). Based on the triplet at 0.9 ppm, this CH₂ is adjacent to a CH₃. It's a multiplet because it is also coupled to another proton.\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet integrating to 1H. Its chemical shift (downfield) suggests it's a benzylic proton (a proton on a carbon directly attached to the benzene ring). This must be the methine group (-CH-) that is coupled to the methyl group at 1.4 ppm and the methylene group at 1.7 ppm.\n        *   **Assembling the Alkyl Group:** Let's put the pieces together. We have a -CH₃ group next to a -CH₂ group (from the 0.9 ppm and 1.7 ppm signals), forming an ethyl fragment (-CH₂CH₃). We also have a -CH₃ group next to a -CH group (from the 1.4 ppm and 2.9 ppm signals). The benzylic -CH group is attached to both the methyl group and the ethyl group. This forms a **sec-butyl group**: -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the information, Compound X has a carboxylic acid group and a sec-butyl group in a para (1,4) arrangement on a benzene ring. The structure is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the reaction and predict the product.**\n\n    *   **The Reaction:** Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) reacts with red phosphorus and hydriodic acid (HI).\n    *   **Reagent Functionality:** The combination of red phosphorus and HI is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to their corresponding alkanes (in this case, a methyl group, -CH₃). It will not affect the stable aromatic ring or the alkyl (sec-butyl) substituent.\n    *   **Product Prediction:** The reaction will convert the carboxylic acid group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid into a methyl group. The rest of the molecule will remain unchanged.\n        *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n        *   Product: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n\n*   **Step 3: Match the predicted product with the given options.**\n\n    *   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material (Compound X).\n    *   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - This structure is incorrect.\n    *   C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches our predicted final product.\n    *   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - This has the wrong alkyl isomer (isobutyl instead of sec-butyl).\n\nThe correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
