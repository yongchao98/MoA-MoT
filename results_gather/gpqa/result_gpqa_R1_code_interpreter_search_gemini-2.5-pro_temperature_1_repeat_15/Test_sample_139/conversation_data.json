    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of substance B is given as very close to 277 K, which is 4 °C. This is the melting point of heavy water (D₂O), which is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). The standard water (H₂O) melts at 0 °C (273.15 K). This strongly suggests that **B is D₂O**.\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The problem states that the molecule of gas W contains the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's analyze some simple gas molecules:\n    *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons.\n    *   He: 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Possible, but inert).\n    *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Each deuterium (D or ²H) atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So, a D₂ molecule has **2 protons and 2 neutrons**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   N₂: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Possible).\n    *   CO: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Possible).\n    *   O₂: 16 protons, 16 neutrons. (Possible).\n    Given that D₂O is involved (from step 1), D₂ is the most likely candidate for gas W.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction:** The reaction is `Substance X + Liquid Y -> Gas W + Precipitate G`.\n    *   We've deduced W is likely D₂. To produce D₂ gas, both the reactant X and the liquid Y must be sources of deuterium atoms. If Y were normal water (H₂O), the reaction with a deuteride (like M-D) would produce HD gas (`M-D + H₂O -> M-OH + HD`), which has 2 protons and 1 neutron, not matching the properties of W.\n    *   Therefore, the reaction must be between a deuterated substance X and heavy water Y. So, **Y is D₂O**.\n    *   The reaction is: `X (a deuteride) + D₂O -> D₂ + G`.\n\n4.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   X is a deuterated substance that reacts violently with D₂O.\n    *   X and its non-deuterated analog are common reagents in organic chemistry.\n    *   This points towards complex metal hydrides like Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄) or Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄). Their deuterated analogs are LiAlD₄ and NaBD₄.\n    *   LiAlH₄ is known to react *violently* with water, while NaBH₄'s reaction is much milder. The \"violent\" reaction clue strongly favors **X = LiAlD₄**.\n    *   Let's check the rest of the clues with X = LiAlD₄ and Y = D₂O.\n    *   The reaction is: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O -> LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`.\n    *   This produces D₂ gas (W), which matches our deduction.\n    *   It forms a precipitate G. Aluminium deuteroxide, **Al(OD)₃**, is the deuterated analog of Al(OH)₃, which is a well-known gelatinous precipitate. This fits perfectly. In contrast, the product from NaBD₄ would be B(OD)₃ (deuterated boric acid), which is soluble and not a precipitate.\n    *   The precipitate G (Al(OD)₃), when heated, releases B. The decomposition is `2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. This releases B (D₂O), which matches our initial finding.\n    *   The final clue is about the reaction with a keto acid. LiAlD₄ is a powerful reducing agent that reduces both ketones and carboxylic acids. A keto acid (like pyruvic acid, R-CO-COOH) would be reduced to a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH)). The product contains two oxygen atoms, which matches the clue.\n    *   All clues point to **Substance X being Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Deuterium (D).\n    *   For this type of problem, we use the mass numbers of the most common or relevant isotopes:\n        *   Deuterium (D, or ²H): Mass number = 2\n        *   Lithium (⁷Li is the most common isotope): Mass number = 7\n        *   Aluminium (²⁷Al is the only stable isotope): Mass number = 27\n    *   Comparing the masses: D (2) < Li (7) < Al (27).\n    *   The lightest element is **Deuterium (D)**.\n    *   The heaviest element is **Aluminium (Al)**.\n    *   The question states: \"...if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\" This means we must account for all atoms of the identified lightest and heaviest elements in the formula.\n    *   In one formula unit of LiAlD₄, there are:\n        *   4 atoms of the lightest element (D).\n        *   1 atom of the heaviest element (Al).\n    *   Cumulative mass = (Number of D atoms × Mass of D) + (Number of Al atoms × Mass of Al)\n    *   Cumulative mass = (4 × 2) + (1 × 27)\n    *   Cumulative mass = 8 + 27 = 35\n\nThe calculated cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<B>>>"
