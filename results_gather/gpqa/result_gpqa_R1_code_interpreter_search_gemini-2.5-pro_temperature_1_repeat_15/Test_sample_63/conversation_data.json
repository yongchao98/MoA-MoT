    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Experimental Data and Identify the Products\n\nThe problem describes the thermal decomposition of a mixture of two salts, A and B. The resulting gases are passed through a series of tubes, and the mass changes of these tubes provide information about the composition of the gas mixture.\n\n*   **Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2**\n    *   This substance is a strong drying agent, so it absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass increase is 3.60 g, which is the mass of the water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2: Ca(OH)₂ solution**\n    *   This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂.\n    *   The mass of the tube did not change, which means no acidic gases were produced in the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3: Red-hot copper (Cu)**\n    *   Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states CuO is formed, which implies the gas provided oxygen to the copper. The reaction could be with O₂, N₂O, NO, etc.\n    *   The mass increase of the tube is due to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Mass of oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C**\n    *   After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 L of a gas C remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas is inert to all the reagents used (Mg(ClO₄)₂, Ca(OH)₂, hot Cu), suggesting it is likely nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### 2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Salt Mixture\n\nThe initial salts A and B decomposed completely into the gaseous products we've just quantified. By the law of conservation of mass, the total mass and elemental composition of the products must equal that of the initial reactants.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × n(H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the water and the species that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = n(O in H₂O) + n(O reacted with Cu) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n\n*   **Other Elements (likely Nitrogen, N):** The total initial mass was 7.20 g. We can find the mass of the remaining elements by subtraction.\n    *   Mass of other elements = Total mass - Mass(H) - Mass(O)\n    *   Mass of other elements = 7.20 g - (Mass of H₂O + Mass of O reacted with Cu) = 7.20 g - (3.60 g + 0.80 g) = 2.80 g.\n    *   Let's assume the remaining element is nitrogen, as is common in decomposing salts. The final inert gas C is also likely N₂.\n    *   If the mass is 2.80 g of Nitrogen, then:\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   If the final gas C is N₂, its number of moles would be n(N₂) = 0.20 mol N / 2 = 0.10 mol. This perfectly matches the calculated moles of gas C from its volume.\n    *   This confirms our assumption: the salts contain only Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen.\n\n### 3. Determine the Formulas of Salts A and B\n\nWe have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. This means we have some number of moles, `x`, of salt A and `x` moles of salt B. The total elemental composition we found (0.20 mol N, 0.40 mol H, 0.25 mol O) corresponds to this entire mixture.\n\nThe molar ratio of elements in the combined mixture (A + B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\nTo get integer ratios, we can multiply by 20:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\n\nThis means that the combined chemical formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nWe need to find two plausible inorganic salts, A and B, that contain N, H, and O, and whose formulas sum to N₄H₈O₅. The most common and simple salts fitting this description are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxoacids.\nLet's consider:\n*   Ammonium nitrate: NH₄NO₃ (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n*   Ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂ (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n\nLet's sum their formulas:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = N(2+2)H(4+4)O(3+2) = **N₄H₈O₅**\n\nThis is a perfect match. Therefore, salts A and B are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\n(We can also quickly verify this with the decomposition reactions. At ~200°C:\nNH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\nNH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O\nIf we have `x` moles of each, we get `x` mol N₂, `x` mol N₂O, and `4x` mol H₂O.\nThe N₂O reacts with Cu: N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO.\nThe products match the experimental results perfectly, confirming the identity of the salts.)\n\n### 4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in their respective chemical formulas.\n\n*   **Salt A (e.g., NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (e.g., NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2 atoms\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms in A and B:**\n    *   Total atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThe total number of atoms is 17.\n\n<<<A>>>"
