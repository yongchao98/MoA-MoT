    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the partition function Z for a system of three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each spin can take a value of +1 or -1. The partition function is defined as the sum over all possible states of the system of the Boltzmann factor, `e^(-βE)`, where E is the energy of the state and β = 1/(kT).\n\nThe formula for the partition function is:\n`Z = Σ_states * e^(-βE)`\n\nThe energy of the system is given by:\n`E = -J[S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3]`\n\nThe system has three spins, each with two possible values (+1 or -1). Therefore, there are `2^3 = 8` possible states for the system. We need to calculate the energy for each of these states and then sum their corresponding Boltzmann factors.\n\nLet's list all 8 possible states and calculate their energies:\n\n1.  **State (+1, +1, +1):** All spins are up.\n    S1 = +1, S2 = +1, S3 = +1\n    E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n    Contribution to Z: `e^(-β(-3J)) = e^(3Jβ)`\n\n2.  **State (-1, -1, -1):** All spins are down.\n    S1 = -1, S2 = -1, S3 = -1\n    E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n    Contribution to Z: `e^(-β(-3J)) = e^(3Jβ)`\n\n    These two states have the same energy, E = -3J. Their combined contribution to Z is `2 * e^(3Jβ)`.\n\n3.  **States with two spins up and one spin down:** There are three such states:\n    *   **(+1, +1, -1):** E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   **(+1, -1, +1):** E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   **(-1, +1, +1):** E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n\n    These three states have the same energy, E = J. Their contribution to Z is `3 * e^(-βJ)`.\n\n4.  **States with one spin up and two spins down:** There are three such states:\n    *   **(+1, -1, -1):** E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   **(-1, +1, -1):** E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   **(-1, -1, +1):** E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n\n    These three states also have the same energy, E = J. Their contribution to Z is `3 * e^(-βJ)`.\n\nNow, we sum the contributions from all the states. We can group the states by their energy levels and degeneracies (the number of states with a given energy).\n\n*   **Energy Level E1 = -3J:**\n    *   Degeneracy g1 = 2 (states (+1,+1,+1) and (-1,-1,-1))\n*   **Energy Level E2 = J:**\n    *   Degeneracy g2 = 3 (two spins up) + 3 (one spin up) = 6\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum of the degeneracies multiplied by their respective Boltzmann factors:\n`Z = g1 * e^(-βE1) + g2 * e^(-βE2)`\n`Z = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))`\n`Z = 2 * e^(3Jβ) + 6 * e^(-Jβ)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z= 2e^(2Jβ)+6e^(-2Jβ)\nB) Z= 2e^(3Jβ)+6e^(-Jβ)\nC) Z= 2e^(-3Jβ)+6e^(Jβ)\nD) Z= 6e^(2Jβ)+2e^(-2Jβ)\n\nOur calculated partition function `Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)` matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
