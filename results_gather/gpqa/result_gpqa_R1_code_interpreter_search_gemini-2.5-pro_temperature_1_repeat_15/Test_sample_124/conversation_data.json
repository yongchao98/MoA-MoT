    "The user wants to find the energy and degeneracy of the third excited state for a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential.\n\n**1. Identify the system and its properties:**\nThe potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator. \"Isotropic\" means the spring constant (and thus the angular frequency $\\omega$) is the same in all three directions.\n\n**2. Determine the energy eigenvalues:**\nThe time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system can be solved by separating the variables in Cartesian coordinates ($x, y, z$). The total energy is the sum of the energies of three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators:\n$E = E_x + E_y + E_z$\nThe energy for a 1D harmonic oscillator is $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number for the $i$-th direction.\nSo, the total energy is:\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nLet's define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$. The energy levels are then given by:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\n**3. Calculate the energy of the third excited state:**\n*   **Ground state:** The lowest energy state corresponds to the smallest possible value of $n$. Since $n_x, n_y, n_z$ must be non-negative integers, the minimum value for $n$ is $0$ (when $n_x=n_y=n_z=0$). This is the ground state.\n    $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **First excited state:** This corresponds to $n=1$.\n    $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **Second excited state:** This corresponds to $n=2$.\n    $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **Third excited state:** This corresponds to $n=3$.\n    $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n**4. Determine the degeneracy of the third excited state:**\nThe degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different sets of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same value of $n$. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is $n=3$.\n\nWe can list the combinations:\n*   $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ can be a permutation of (3, 0, 0). There are 3 such permutations: (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3).\n*   $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ can be a permutation of (2, 1, 0). There are $3! = 6$ such permutations: (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2).\n*   $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ can be (1, 1, 1). There is only 1 such combination.\n\nThe total number of states (degeneracy) is the sum of these possibilities: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\nTherefore, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for the energy eigenvalue $E_3 = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nA general formula for the degeneracy $g_n$ of the $n$-th level of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is:\n$g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\nFor $n=3$:\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\nThe energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy is 10. This corresponds to option C. The other options mention an energy term proportional to $1/r^2$, which is characteristic of a particle in a spherical infinite potential well, not a harmonic oscillator.\n\n<<<C>>>"
