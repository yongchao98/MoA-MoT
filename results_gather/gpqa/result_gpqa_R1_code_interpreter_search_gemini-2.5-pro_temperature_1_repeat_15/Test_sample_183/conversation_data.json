    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   A benzene ring.\n*   An ethoxy group (-OEt) at position 1.\n*   A tert-butyl group (-tBu) at position 2.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 3.\n\nThe key features are the substituent positions (1, 2, 3) and their electronic properties:\n*   **-OEt (ethoxy)**: Strong activator, ortho, para-director.\n*   **-tBu (tert-butyl)**: Weak activator, ortho, para-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro)**: Strong deactivator, meta-director.\n\nThe relative positions are:\n*   -OEt and -tBu are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -tBu and -NO2 are **ortho** to each other.\n*   -OEt and -NO2 are **meta** to each other.\n\nAchieving a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern with electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) is challenging and requires a careful strategy.\n\n**2. Devise a Retrosynthetic Strategy**\n\nLet's work backward from the final product.\n\n*   **Final Step:** The ethoxy group is likely introduced last via a Williamson ether synthesis (`NaOH/EtBr`). This reaction requires a phenol precursor.\n    *   **Precursor 1:** 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol.\n\n*   **Phenol Formation:** A phenol can be prepared from an aniline via diazotization followed by hydrolysis.\n    *   `... -> Aniline --(NaNO2/HCl)--> Diazonium salt --(H3O+, Heat)--> Phenol`\n    *   **Precursor 2:** 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline. The substituents (-NH2, -tBu, -NO2) must be in a 1,2,3 arrangement.\n\n*   **Aniline Formation:** The key is to synthesize **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. This aniline would be formed by introducing a nitro group onto a substituted aniline or reducing a dinitro compound.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options based on the Strategy**\n\nThe common end-game in the options is: `... Fe/HCl (reduction) ; ... NaNO2/HCl (diazotization) ; ... H3O+, H2O/Heat (hydrolysis to phenol) ; ... NaOH/EtBr (etherification) ...`. This sequence converts a nitro-substituted precursor into the final ethoxy-substituted product. This matches our retrosynthesis.\n\nThe core of the problem is to create the correct aromatic precursor before this sequence. Let's analyze each option.\n\n*   **Option D:** Starts with nitration, then reduction to aniline, then Friedel-Crafts alkylation (`tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`). Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on anilines because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. So, **D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Options B and C:** These sequences are jumbled. For example, in C, diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`) is listed before the reduction (`Fe/HCl`) that forms the necessary amine. In B, the sequence of reagents after step (v) is illogical. Thus, **B and C are incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option A:** This is the only chemically coherent sequence. Let's analyze its regiochemistry.\n\n    *   **i) `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` on Benzene:** Forms **tert-butylbenzene**. This is a standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n\n    *   **ii) `HNO3/H2SO4` on tert-butylbenzene:** Nitration. The -tBu group is an o,p-director. Due to sterics, the major product is the para isomer, **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene**. A \"high-yield\" synthesis would typically use the major product. However, let's consider both possibilities.\n\n    *   **Path 1 (Assuming we proceed with the major para isomer):**\n        *   iii) `Fe/HCl` on 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene -> **4-tert-butylaniline**.\n        *   iv) `HNO3/H2SO4` on 4-tert-butylaniline. In strong acid, aniline is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. The -tBu group is an o,p-director. Both groups direct nitration to the position ortho to the t-Bu group and meta to the -NH3+ group. This gives **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**.\n        *   v-vii) Following the endgame sequence on this aniline would lead to **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**. This is the wrong isomer.\n\n    *   **Path 2 (Exploring the minor ortho isomer from step ii):**\n        This path is necessary to get the correct final arrangement. The term \"high-yield\" in the question might be misleading or implies that this is the only viable route among the choices, despite a non-optimal step.\n        *   ii) Take the minor ortho-nitration product: **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n        *   iii) `Fe/HCl` reduction -> **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n        *   iv) `HNO3/H2SO4` nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. This is the crucial step. We need to place a nitro group at position 3 to create our key precursor, 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline. While the regiochemistry of nitrating substituted anilines can be complex, for the synthesis to work, this step *must* yield the 3-nitro isomer. Let's assume it does.\n        *   Precursor formed: **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n        *   v) `NaNO2/HCl` -> Diazotization of the amino group.\n        *   vi) `H3O+, H2O/Heat` -> Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a hydroxyl group, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n        *   vii) `NaOH/EtBr` -> Williamson ether synthesis to convert the phenol to an ether, yielding the target molecule, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n    *   **viii) `SO3/H2SO4` and ix) `dilute H2SO4`:** These last two steps are sulfonation followed by desulfonation. This sequence does not alter the final product's structure and is typically used as a method for purification, as sulfonic acids are often crystalline solids that are easy to purify.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile Option A involves steps with potential regiochemistry issues (especially requiring a minor isomer and a specific nitration outcome), it is the only sequence presented that is chemically logical and can, in principle, lead to the target molecule. The other options contain fundamentally flawed steps. Therefore, Option A represents the best-choice synthesis route among the given possibilities.\n\n<<<A>>>"
