    "*   **Step 1: Deconstruct the experimental setup and observations.**\n    *   **Antigen Delivery:** Rotavirus inner capsid proteins (the antigen), tagged with GFP, are delivered orally to mice.\n    *   **Antigen Path:** The antigen travels through the gastrointestinal tract. Some is degraded (stomach acid) or trapped (mucus), but some reaches the Peyer's patches.\n    *   **Immune Response Location:** The fluorescence is observed in Peyer's patches. Peyer's patches are a type of Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT), which function as secondary lymphoid organs. This is where immune responses to intestinal antigens are initiated.\n    *   **Cellular Activity:** Within the Peyer's patches, a \"proliferating cell population\" is isolated. This indicates that specific lymphocytes have recognized the antigen and are undergoing clonal expansion.\n    *   **Genetic Analysis:** The variable heavy chain (VH) gene from these proliferating cells is sequenced.\n    *   **Key Finding:** The sequencing reveals \"high variability\" in the VH gene.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the question.**\n    *   The question asks to identify the process responsible for the \"high variability\" observed in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating cells within a secondary lymphoid organ *after* exposure to an antigen.\n\n*   **Step 3: Evaluate the options in the context of the key finding.**\n    *   **A) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that creates the initial diversity of B cell receptors. It occurs in the bone marrow (a primary lymphoid organ) during B cell development, *before* the B cell ever encounters an antigen. While it generates variability, it is not the process happening in proliferating, antigen-activated cells in a secondary lymphoid organ.\n    *   **B) Class switching recombination:** This process occurs in activated B cells in secondary lymphoid organs. It changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain (e.g., from IgM to IgA or IgG), which alters the antibody's effector function. It does *not* affect the *variable* region, so it cannot explain the high variability observed in the VH gene.\n    *   **C) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This process occurs specifically in activated, proliferating B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). SHM introduces point mutations at a high rate into the DNA encoding the variable regions of both the heavy and light chains. This creates variants of the original B cell receptor, some of which may have a higher affinity for the antigen. This process is the direct cause of increased variability in the variable region gene after antigen stimulation and is a key part of affinity maturation. This perfectly matches the observations.\n    *   **D) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate immune system, involving a cascade of plasma proteins that helps clear pathogens. It is not a genetic process that alters the B cell receptor genes.\n\n*   **Step 4: Conclude based on the analysis.**\n    *   The observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating cells in a Peyer's patch following antigen challenge is the classic signature of somatic hypermutation. This process fine-tunes the antibody response by generating diversity in the antigen-binding site, allowing for the selection of B cells with higher affinity.\n\n<<<C>>>"
