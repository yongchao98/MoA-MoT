    "This problem involves the reaction of an aryl halide, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, with a very strong base, sodium amide (NaNH2), in liquid ammonia. This set of reagents is characteristic of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction mechanism to determine all possible products:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates (Elimination)**\n\nThe amide ion (NH2⁻), a powerful base, abstracts a proton from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the leaving group (the bromine atom). In the starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such *ortho* positions:\n\n*   **Position C6:** This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This carbon is bonded to a deuterium atom (D), which is an isotope of hydrogen.\n\nThe base can abstract either the proton from C6 or the deuteron from C2. This leads to two distinct pathways and two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of the proton (H) from C6**\n    1.  The NH2⁻ ion removes the proton from C6, creating a carbanion at that position.\n    2.  This carbanion then triggers the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected.\n    4.  The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n    ```\n    Reactant (1-bromo-2-d-benzene) --(H+ removal from C6)--> Intermediate --(-Br-)--> 3-deuterobenzyne\n    ```\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of the deuteron (D) from C2**\n    1.  The NH2⁻ ion removes the deuteron from C2, creating a carbanion at C2. (Note: The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond, so this pathway is kinetically slower due to the kinetic isotope effect, but it is still a possible reaction).\n    2.  This carbanion causes the elimination of the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  A triple bond forms between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is lost from the molecule.\n    4.  The resulting intermediate is the non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n    ```\n    Reactant (1-bromo-2-d-benzene) --(D+ removal from C2)--> Intermediate --(-Br-)--> Benzyne\n    ```\n\nSo, we have two possible benzyne intermediates: **3-deuterobenzyne** and **benzyne**.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates (Addition)**\n\nThe nucleophile, which is also the amide ion (NH2⁻), now attacks the triple bond of each benzyne intermediate. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, ammonia (NH3), to yield the final products.\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C6. These two carbons are not equivalent because of the nearby deuterium atom at C2. Therefore, the attack of NH2⁻ can occur at two different sites, leading to two different products.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The NH2⁻ group attaches to C1, forming a carbanion at C6. Subsequent protonation by NH3 at C6 yields a product with the -NH2 group at C1 and the -D group at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The NH2⁻ group attaches to C6, forming a carbanion at C1. Subsequent protonation by NH3 at C1 yields a product with the -NH2 group at C6 and the -D group at C2. According to IUPAC nomenclature (where the -NH2 group defines C1), this is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C2 of a symmetrical C6H4 ring. The two carbons of the triple bond are equivalent.\n    1.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** Attack by NH2⁻ at either carbon, followed by protonation of the adjacent carbanion, leads to the same single product. Since the deuterium was lost in the formation of this intermediate, the product is simply **aniline** (C6H5NH2).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy considering both possible elimination pathways and the subsequent addition steps, we find that three distinct organic products can be formed:\n\n1.  **Aniline** (from the benzyne intermediate)\n2.  **2-deuteroaniline** (from the 3-deuterobenzyne intermediate)\n3.  **3-deuteroaniline** (from the 3-deuterobenzyne intermediate)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>"
