    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Physical System:**\n    *   The problem describes the diffraction of monochromatic light (wavelength λ) by an N-sided regular polygon aperture.\n    *   A key piece of information is that all apothems have the same length 'a'. The apothem is the distance from the center of the polygon to the midpoint of a side. It is also the radius of the inscribed circle (inradius).\n    *   We are asked to find the angular distance between the first two intensity minima in the far-field (Fraunhofer) diffraction pattern.\n    *   A crucial condition is that the number of sides, N, is infinitely large (N → ∞).\n\n2.  **The Limiting Case (N → ∞):**\n    *   As the number of sides of a regular polygon increases infinitely, while keeping its apothem 'a' constant, the polygon's shape approaches that of a circle.\n    *   In this limit, the apothem 'a' becomes the radius of the circle.\n    *   Therefore, the problem simplifies to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n3.  **Fraunhofer Diffraction by a Circular Aperture:**\n    *   The diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern. It consists of a bright central maximum (the Airy disk) surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings.\n    *   The angular position of the dark rings (intensity minima) is determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x).\n    *   The intensity is zero when the argument of the Bessel function meets the condition:\n        `k * a * sin(θ) = zₙ`\n        where:\n        *   `k = 2π / λ` is the wave number.\n        *   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n        *   `θ` is the angular position from the central axis.\n        *   `zₙ` is the n-th zero of the J₁(x) function (excluding the trivial zero at x=0).\n\n4.  **Finding the Angular Positions of the Minima:**\n    *   Rearranging the formula, we get:\n        `sin(θₙ) = (zₙ * λ) / (2π * a)`\n    *   The problem states that we can use the small-angle approximation (sin(θ) ≈ θ for small θ). This is valid for far-field diffraction where the angles are typically small.\n        `θₙ ≈ (zₙ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n    *   To find the positions of the first two minima, we need the first two non-trivial zeros of the J₁(x) Bessel function.\n        *   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n        *   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\n5.  **Calculating the Angles:**\n    *   **Angular position of the first minimum (n=1):**\n        `θ₁ ≈ (z₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n        `θ₁ ≈ (3.8317 / (2 * 3.14159...)) * (λ / a)`\n        `θ₁ ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)`\n        (This value, `0.610 λ/a`, corresponds to the angular radius of the Airy disk).\n\n    *   **Angular position of the second minimum (n=2):**\n        `θ₂ ≈ (z₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n        `θ₂ ≈ (7.0156 / (2 * 3.14159...)) * (λ / a)`\n        `θ₂ ≈ 1.1165 * (λ / a)`\n\n6.  **Calculating the Angular Distance:**\n    *   The question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n        `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ ≈ (1.1165 - 0.6098) * (λ / a)`\n        `Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`\n\n7.  **Comparing with Options:**\n    *   The calculated value `Δθ ≈ 0.5067 λ / a` is closest to option A.\n\nTo verify the calculation with higher precision, we can use a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.special import jn_zeros\n\n# The problem asks for the angular distance between the first two minima for a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n# The angular position of the nth minimum is given by theta_n = (z_n / (2 * pi)) * (lambda / a),\n# where z_n is the nth zero of the J1 Bessel function.\n\n# Get the first two zeros of the J1 Bessel function\nfirst_two_zeros = jn_zeros(1, 2)\nz1 = first_two_zeros[0]\nz2 = first_two_zeros[1]\n\n# Calculate the coefficient for the first minimum's angle\ncoeff_theta1 = z1 / (2 * np.pi)\n\n# Calculate the coefficient for the second minimum's angle\ncoeff_theta2 = z2 / (2 * np.pi)\n\n# The angular distance is delta_theta = theta2 - theta1.\n# The coefficient for the angular distance is coeff_theta2 - coeff_theta1.\ndelta_coeff = coeff_theta2 - coeff_theta1\n\nprint(f\"{delta_coeff:.3f}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.507\n</execute_result>\n\nThe code output, rounded to three decimal places, is 0.507. This confirms that our manual calculation was correct. Comparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) 0.506 λ / a\nB) 0.610 λ / a\nC) 0.500 λ / a\nD) 1.220 λ / a\n\nThe value `0.507 λ / a` is best represented by option A, `0.506 λ / a`. The slight difference is due to the rounding in the option itself.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "An N-sided polygon with a constant apothem 'a' will approach the shape of a circle with radius 'a' as the number of sides, N, approaches infinity. Therefore, the problem simplifies to finding the far-field diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nThe diffraction pattern from a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern. The intensity minima (dark rings) in this pattern occur at angles θ that satisfy the following condition:\n\n`k * a * sin(θ) = z_n`\n\nwhere:\n- `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π / λ`.\n- `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n- `λ` is the wavelength of the light.\n- `z_n` is the n-th zero of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x).\n\nUsing the small-angle approximation (sin(θ) ≈ θ), the equation becomes:\n\n`(2π / λ) * a * θ_n = z_n`\n\nRearranging for the angular position `θ_n`:\n\n`θ_n = (z_n / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\nTo find the angular distance between the first two minima, we need the positions of the first minimum (n=1) and the second minimum (n=2). This requires the first two non-trivial zeros of the J₁(x) Bessel function:\n- `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n- `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nThe angular position of the first minimum is:\n`θ₁ = (z₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ (3.8317 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.610 * (λ / a)`\n\nThe angular position of the second minimum is:\n`θ₂ = (z₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ (7.0156 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.117 * (λ / a)`\n\nThe angular distance between these two minima is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`:\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (1.117 - 0.610) * (λ / a) = 0.507 * (λ / a)`\n\nThis calculated value `0.507 λ / a` is closest to option A. The Python code executed previously also confirmed this result (`0.507`).\n\n<<<A>>>"
