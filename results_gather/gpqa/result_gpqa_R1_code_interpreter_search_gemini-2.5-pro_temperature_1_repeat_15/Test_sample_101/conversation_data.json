The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane barrel with eight alpha helices, four extracellular helices, and three beta sheets that create a binding site for the ligand. The ligand is a coiled-coil of two alpha helices. You create a bicistronic lox-Cre vector with the ligand ORF at the 5' position, fused to mCherry; the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to the eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES regulatory element. Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there is a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and between the receptor and the eGFP, there is a stop in the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette.

Total proteins give a signal proportional to the actin loading. You finally breed a mouse model homozygous for your construct in the wt background.

    "*   **Analysis of the experimental setup:**\n    *   **Goal:** To track the fate of cells expressing a specific ligand-receptor pair from the neural crest.\n    *   **Vector Design:** A bicistronic construct is used. The key feature is that it's a conditional \"reporter\" system, meaning the fluorescent proteins (mCherry and eGFP) should only be expressed when a specific event occurs.\n    *   **Conditional Element:** The system relies on Cre-Lox recombination. Cre recombinase is an enzyme that recognizes specific 34-bp DNA sequences called `loxP` sites and excises the DNA flanked by them.\n    *   **First Gene (Ligand):** The structure is `Ligand ORF - loxP-STOP-loxP - mCherry`. In a normal cell without Cre recombinase, transcription will produce an mRNA, but translation will stop at the STOP codon, so only the ligand is made, not the mCherry fusion protein. When Cre recombinase is present (from the SOX10-Cre mouse), it will recognize the two `loxP` sites and excise the intervening STOP codon. This brings the Ligand ORF in frame with the mCherry ORF, leading to the production of a red fluorescent Ligand-mCherry fusion protein.\n    *   **Second Gene (Receptor):** The structure is `Receptor ORF - lox2272-STOP-lox2272 - eGFP`. This part is downstream of an IRES element, allowing its translation independently from the first gene on the same mRNA. It has its own conditional stop cassette. However, this cassette is flanked by `lox2272` sites, not `loxP` sites.\n    *   **The Cross:** The reporter mouse is crossed with a `SOX10-Cre` mouse. SOX10 is a transcription factor expressed in neural crest cells. This means that in the offspring, Cre recombinase will be specifically expressed in the neural crest cell lineage.\n*   **Identifying the Problem:**\n    *   The `SOX10-Cre` mouse provides **Cre recombinase**.\n    *   Cre recombinase efficiently recombines DNA between two `loxP` sites.\n    *   `lox2272` is a mutated version of the `loxP` site. While Cre can bind to it, it does not efficiently catalyze recombination between a `loxP` and a `lox2272` site, or even between two `lox2272` sites. A different recombinase system, like Dre/rox, is typically used for this kind of \"dual reporter\" strategy where two different recombination events are desired.\n    *   Because the `SOX10-Cre` mouse only provides Cre recombinase, it will excise the `loxP`-flanked STOP codon (activating mCherry expression) but will be unable to excise the `lox2272`-flanked STOP codon.\n    *   Therefore, the ribosome translating the receptor ORF will encounter the STOP codon and terminate translation. The downstream eGFP ORF will never be translated into protein.\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi: This is incorrect. For the protein to be stuck in the Golgi, it must first be synthesized. The problem lies in the fact that the eGFP portion of the protein is never synthesized at all due to the persistent STOP codon.\n    *   B) the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing: This is incorrect. The construct uses the CBA promoter, a strong and generally ubiquitous promoter that does not require a tissue-specific enhancer. Expression is driven, but translation of eGFP is blocked.\n    *   C) the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame: This is the most accurate description of the outcome. The presence of the un-excised STOP codon between the receptor and eGFP ORFs prevents them from being translated as a single, continuous polypeptide. The ribosome stops, so the eGFP is effectively not \"in frame\" for translation.\n    *   D) ligand and the receptor are in a paracrine relationship: This describes a biological mode of action between cells. It has no bearing on why a reporter gene within a specific molecular construct fails to be expressed.\n\nThe fundamental issue is a mismatch between the recombinase enzyme (Cre) and the target DNA sequence (`lox2272`), preventing the removal of the STOP codon and the subsequent translation of eGFP.\n\n<<<C>>>"
