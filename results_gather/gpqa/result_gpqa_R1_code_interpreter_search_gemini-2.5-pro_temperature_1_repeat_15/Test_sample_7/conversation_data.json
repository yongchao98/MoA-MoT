As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the relationship between the genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n1.  **Analyze the role of Gene G2:**\n    *   The single mutant `g2` (G2 knock-out) shows 0% resistance. This means G2 is absolutely essential for the plant's resistance mechanism.\n    *   The double mutant `g1g2` also shows 0% resistance. The complete loss of resistance from the `g2` mutation masks the partial loss of resistance from the `g1` mutation (which would have left 75% resistance). This is a classic example of epistasis, where the `g2` allele is epistatic to the `g1` allele.\n    *   Similarly, the `g2g3` double mutant shows 0% resistance. The `g2` mutation's effect masks the `g3` mutation's effect (which would have left 50% resistance). So, `g2` is also epistatic to `g3`.\n    *   When one gene's mutation masks the effect of another, it often means the first gene acts upstream in the same pathway. Given the problem statement that at least one gene is a transcription factor (a common type of upstream regulator), G2 is the strongest candidate for this role. It likely controls the expression of other resistance genes, including G1 and G3.\n\n2.  **Analyze the roles of Genes G1 and G3:**\n    *   The single mutant `g1` has 75% resistance, meaning G1 contributes to 25% of the total resistance (100% - 75% = 25% loss).\n    *   The single mutant `g3` has 50% resistance, meaning G3 contributes to 50% of the total resistance (100% - 50% = 50% loss).\n    *   Since both single mutants show a partial loss of resistance, both G1 and G3 are active contributors to the final phenotype.\n\n3.  **Analyze the interaction between G1 and G3:**\n    *   If G1 and G3 acted in completely independent, additive pathways, the resistance of the double mutant `g1g3` would be the wild-type resistance minus the loss from each mutation: 100% - 25% (loss from g1) - 50% (loss from g3) = 25%.\n    *   However, the experimental result for `g1g3` is 10% resistance. This is significantly lower than the expected 25%.\n    *   This phenomenon, where the double mutant phenotype is much more severe than the sum of the individual mutant effects, is called **synergistic epistasis** or **enhancement**.\n    *   A common biological reason for such a synergistic interaction is **gene redundancy**. This implies that G1 and G3 have overlapping or parallel functions. When only one is knocked out, the other can partially compensate. When both are knocked out, the shared function is completely lost, leading to a much greater effect than simply adding the individual losses.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the options based on the analysis:**\n\n    *   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:**\n        *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\": Consistent with our analysis.\n        *   \"G1 and G3 has the same promoter\": This is a possible mechanism for co-regulation but is a speculation, not a direct conclusion from the phenotype data.\n        *   The interaction between G1 and G3 is synergistic, making a simple directional epistasis claim (\"G3 is epistatic towards G1\") complex, but \"same promoter\" is weaker than \"redundancy\".\n\n    *   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:**\n        *   \"Pleiotropy\" means one gene affects multiple unrelated traits. This experiment only measures one trait (disease resistance), so we cannot conclude anything about pleiotropy. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1:**\n        *   \"G1 is a transcription factor\": Inconsistent with our analysis. G2 is the clear upstream regulator. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:**\n        *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\": Consistent with our analysis.\n        *   \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\": This is the best description for the observed synergistic effect in the `g1g3` double mutant.\n        *   \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\": While assigning direction to synergistic epistasis is not standard, the other two parts of this option are strongly supported by the data. \"Gene redundancy\" is a much better conclusion from the data than \"has the same promoter\" in option A.\n\n**Conclusion:** Option D provides the most accurate and comprehensive description of the genetic interactions based on the provided data. The first two statements (\"G2 is a transcription factor\" and \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\") are strongly supported conclusions.\n\n<<<D>>>"
