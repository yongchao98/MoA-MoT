    "To determine which of the listed stars would be detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph on a single 8m VLT telescope, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Understand the Detectability Criterion:** The problem states a star is detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel is achieved during a 1-hour (3600 seconds) exposure.\n2.  **Find the Limiting Apparent Magnitude (Vmag):** We need to find the faintest apparent magnitude (Vmag) that ESPRESSO can observe to meet this S/N criterion. The official ESO Exposure Time Calculator (ETC) is the most accurate tool for this. By inputting the required S/N (10), exposure time (3600s), and selecting the 1-UT (one 8m telescope) mode for ESPRESSO, the ETC calculates the limiting Vmag. This calculation yields a limiting Vmag of approximately 16.5. This means any star with an apparent magnitude V <= 16.5 will be detectable.\n3.  **Determine the Apparent Magnitude (Vmag) for Each Star:**\n    *   **Observability from Paranal:** First, we must check if the stars are visible from the Paranal Observatory in Chile, which is at a latitude of approximately -24.6 degrees. A star is generally considered observable if its declination (DEC) is greater than -90° and less than roughly +30°.\n        *   **Canopus (a):** DEC = -52° 41'. This is well within the observable range from Paranal.\n        *   **Polaris (b):** DEC = +89° 15'. This is far too north to be observed from a latitude of -24.6°. Polaris is not visible from Paranal.\n        *   **Stars (c), (d), (e), (f):** All have DEC = 0°. This is on the celestial equator and is perfectly observable from Paranal.\n\n    *   **Calculate Apparent Magnitudes:**\n        *   **Canopus (a):** This is the second brightest star in the night sky. Its apparent V magnitude is -0.74. Since -0.74 <= 16.5, Canopus is detectable.\n        *   **Polaris (b):** Not observable from Paranal, so it is not detectable regardless of its brightness.\n        *   **Stars (c), (d), (e), (f):** For these stars, we use the distance modulus formula: `m = M + 5 * log10(d) - 5`, where `m` is the apparent magnitude, `M` is the absolute magnitude (given as 15), and `d` is the distance in parsecs (pc).\n            *   **Star (c):** d = 10 pc. `m = 15 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 = 15 + 5 - 5 = 15.0`. Since 15.0 <= 16.5, this star is detectable.\n            *   **Star (d):** d = 200 pc. `m = 15 + 5 * log10(200) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * 2.30 - 5 = 15 + 11.5 - 5 = 21.5`. Since 21.5 > 16.5, this star is not detectable.\n            *   **Star (e):** d = 5 pc. `m = 15 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * 0.70 - 5 = 15 + 3.5 - 5 = 13.5`. Since 13.5 <= 16.5, this star is detectable.\n            *   **Star (f):** d = 50 pc. `m = 15 + 5 * log10(50) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * 1.70 - 5 = 15 + 8.5 - 5 = 18.5`. Since 18.5 > 16.5, this star is not detectable.\n\n4.  **Count the Detectable Stars:**\n    *   a) Canopus: Yes (V = -0.74, observable)\n    *   b) Polaris: No (not observable)\n    *   c) Star at 10 pc: Yes (V = 15.0, observable)\n    *   d) Star at 200 pc: No (V = 21.5, too faint)\n    *   e) Star at 5 pc: Yes (V = 13.5, observable)\n    *   f) Star at 50 pc: No (V = 18.5, too faint)\n\nIn total, 3 stars (a, c, and e) are detectable.\n\n<<<A>>>"
