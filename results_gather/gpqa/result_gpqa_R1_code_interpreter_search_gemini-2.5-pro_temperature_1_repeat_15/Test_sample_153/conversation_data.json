    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the compound is 156 g/mol (for the most abundant isotopes).\n*   **Isotopic Peak (M+2):** There is a significant peak at m/z = 158, which is two mass units higher than the molecular ion peak. The relative intensity ratio of the M+ peak (m/z=156) to the M+2 peak (m/z=158) is 100% to 32%, which is approximately a 3:1 ratio. This specific isotopic pattern is a strong indicator that the molecule contains **one chlorine atom**. (The natural abundance of Chlorine-35 is ~75% and Chlorine-37 is ~25%).\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This very broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This absorption is in the typical range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its position is consistent with the carbonyl group of a carboxylic acid, especially one that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is highly characteristic of a **carboxylic acid proton (-COOH)**. It is a singlet (s) because it does not couple with other protons, and it integrates to one proton (1H).\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to two protons (2H), is a classic signature for a **1,4-disubstituted (para-substituted) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para substitution makes the two protons on one side of the ring chemically equivalent to each other, and the same for the two protons on the other side.\n\n**Putting It All Together:**\n\n*   From MS, we know the molecule has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom.\n*   From IR and ¹H NMR, we know the molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   From ¹H NMR, we know the molecule has a para-substituted benzene ring.\n\nCombining these pieces, the structure must be a benzoic acid molecule with a chlorine atom attached to the benzene ring at the para (or 4-) position. This leads to the structure of **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n**Let's check the proposed structure against the options:**\n\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** Incorrect. This would show a more complex pattern in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n*   **B) Phenyl chloroformate:** Incorrect. This is not a carboxylic acid and would not show the broad O-H peak in the IR or the acidic proton at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR.\n*   **C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** Incorrect. This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. It would have different IR and ¹H NMR signals.\n*   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** **Correct.** The molecular formula is C₇H₅ClO₂. The molecular weight for the ³⁵Cl isotope is 156 g/mol. It is a carboxylic acid with a para-substituted benzene ring. This structure perfectly matches all the provided spectral data.\n\n<<<D>>>"
