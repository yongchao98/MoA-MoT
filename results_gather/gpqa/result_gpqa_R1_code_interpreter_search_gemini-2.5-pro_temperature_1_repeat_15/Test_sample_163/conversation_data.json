    "**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the total mass of system_1 to the total mass of system_2, i.e., $M_{sys1} / M_{sys2}$.\n\n2.  **Recall Relevant Physics:** The problem involves binary stars with known orbital periods and radial velocity amplitudes. The key physical law connecting these quantities to the mass of the system is Kepler's Third Law, adapted for binary stars.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Equation:** For a spectroscopic binary system, the total mass ($M_1 + M_2$) can be related to the orbital period ($P$) and the orbital velocities ($v_1, v_2$) by the following equation:\n    $M_1 + M_2 = \\frac{P(v_1 + v_2)^3}{2\\pi G \\sin^3{i}}$\n    where:\n    *   $M_1, M_2$ are the masses of the two stars.\n    *   $P$ is the orbital period.\n    *   $v_1, v_2$ are the orbital velocities of the stars.\n    *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n    *   $i$ is the inclination of the orbital plane with respect to the line of sight.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Given Information and Simplify:**\n    *   The problem states that both systems are \"eclipsing\". An eclipse can only happen if we are viewing the system nearly edge-on. This means the inclination angle $i \\approx 90^\\circ$, and therefore $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n    *   The observed sinusoidal variations of radial velocities have amplitudes $K_1$ and $K_2$. The radial velocity is given by $v_r = v \\sin(i)$. Since we've established $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$, the observed radial velocity amplitudes are equal to the orbital velocities: $K_1 = v_1$ and $K_2 = v_2$.\n    *   Therefore, the equation for the total mass ($M_{total} = M_1 + M_2$) simplifies to:\n        $M_{total} = \\frac{P(K_1 + K_2)^3}{2\\pi G}$\n\n5.  **Set up the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 ($M_{total,1}$) to the total mass of system_2 ($M_{total,2}$).\n    $\\frac{M_{total,1}}{M_{total,2}} = \\frac{\\frac{P_1 (K_{1,1} + K_{1,2})^3}{2\\pi G}}{\\frac{P_2 (K_{2,1} + K_{2,2})^3}{2\\pi G}}$\n\n6.  **Cancel Common Terms:** The constant term $2\\pi G$ appears in both the numerator and the denominator, so it cancels out.\n    $\\frac{M_{total,1}}{M_{total,2}} = \\frac{P_1 (K_{1,1} + K_{1,2})^3}{P_2 (K_{2,1} + K_{2,2})^3}$\n\n7.  **Substitute the Given Values:**\n    *   **For system_1:**\n        *   $P_1 = 2$ years\n        *   $K_{1,1} + K_{1,2} = 10 \\text{ km/s} + 5 \\text{ km/s} = 15 \\text{ km/s}$\n    *   **For system_2:**\n        *   $P_2 = 1$ year\n        *   $K_{2,1} + K_{2,2} = 15 \\text{ km/s} + 10 \\text{ km/s} = 25 \\text{ km/s}$\n\n8.  **Calculate the Ratio:**\n    $\\frac{M_{total,1}}{M_{total,2}} = \\frac{2 \\times (15)^3}{1 \\times (25)^3} = 2 \\times \\left(\\frac{15}{25}\\right)^3$\n    $\\frac{M_{total,1}}{M_{total,2}} = 2 \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^3 = 2 \\times \\frac{27}{125} = \\frac{54}{125}$\n    $\\frac{M_{total,1}}{M_{total,2}} = 0.432$\n\n9.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value of 0.432 is closest to the option A) ~ 0.4.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let's use a Python script for the calculation.\n\n```python\n# Data for system_1\nP1 = 2.0  # Period in years\nK1_1 = 10.0 # Radial velocity amplitude of star 1 in km/s\nK1_2 = 5.0  # Radial velocity amplitude of star 2 in km/s\n\n# Data for system_2\nP2 = 1.0  # Period in years\nK2_1 = 15.0 # Radial velocity amplitude of star 1 in km/s\nK2_2 = 10.0 # Radial velocity amplitude of star 2 in km/s\n\n# The total mass M of an eclipsing binary system is proportional to P * (K1 + K2)^3.\n# We want to find the ratio M_sys1 / M_sys2.\n# The proportionality constant (which includes 2*pi*G) will cancel out in the ratio.\n\n# Sum of velocity amplitudes for system_1\nK_sum_1 = K1_1 + K1_2\n\n# Sum of velocity amplitudes for system_2\nK_sum_2 = K2_1 + K2_2\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the total masses\nmass_ratio = (P1 * (K_sum_1**3)) / (P2 * (K_sum_2**3))\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n\nExecution output:\n```\n0.432\n```\n\nThe code confirms the manual calculation. The ratio is 0.432, which is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to determine the ratio of the total mass of system_1 to the total mass of system_2, denoted as $M_{sys1} / M_{sys2}$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Relevant Physical Principles:** The problem deals with binary star systems for which we have the orbital period ($P$) and the radial velocity amplitudes ($K_1$, $K_2$). The relationship between these quantities and the total mass of the system ($M_{total} = M_1 + M_2$) is derived from Kepler's Third Law. For a double-lined spectroscopic binary, the total mass is given by the formula:\n    $M_1 + M_2 = \\frac{P(v_1 + v_2)^3}{2\\pi G}$\n    where $v_1$ and $v_2$ are the orbital velocities.\n\n3.  **Relate Observed Quantities to the Formula:**\n    *   The observed quantities are the *amplitudes of the radial velocities*, $K_1$ and $K_2$. These are related to the true orbital velocities by the inclination of the orbit, $i$:\n        $K_1 = v_1 \\sin(i)$ and $K_2 = v_2 \\sin(i)$.\n    *   Substituting $v_1 = K_1/\\sin(i)$ and $v_2 = K_2/\\sin(i)$ into the mass equation gives:\n        $M_1 + M_2 = \\frac{P(K_1/\\sin(i) + K_2/\\sin(i))^3}{2\\pi G} = \\frac{P(K_1 + K_2)^3}{2\\pi G \\sin^3(i)}$\n\n4.  **Incorporate the \"Eclipsing\" Information:** The problem states that both systems are \"eclipsing.\" Eclipses can only be observed if the orbital plane is viewed nearly edge-on. This means the inclination angle $i$ must be very close to 90°.\n    *   If $i \\approx 90°$, then $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$, and $\\sin^3(i) \\approx 1$.\n    *   This simplifies the mass formula significantly for both systems:\n        $M_{total} \\approx \\frac{P(K_1 + K_2)^3}{2\\pi G}$\n\n5.  **Form the Ratio:** We need to calculate the ratio of the mass of system_1 to the mass of system_2:\n    $\\frac{M_{sys1}}{M_{sys2}} = \\frac{\\frac{P_1(K_{1,1} + K_{1,2})^3}{2\\pi G}}{\\frac{P_2(K_{2,1} + K_{2,2})^3}{2\\pi G}}$\n\n6.  **Simplify and Substitute Values:**\n    *   The constant term $2\\pi G$ cancels out from the numerator and the denominator.\n    *   The ratio simplifies to:\n        $\\frac{M_{sys1}}{M_{sys2}} = \\frac{P_1(K_{1,1} + K_{1,2})^3}{P_2(K_{2,1} + K_{2,2})^3}$\n    *   Now, we plug in the given values:\n        *   **For system_1:**\n            *   $P_1 = 2$ years\n            *   Sum of velocities, $K_{1,1} + K_{1,2} = 10 \\text{ km/s} + 5 \\text{ km/s} = 15 \\text{ km/s}$\n        *   **For system_2:**\n            *   $P_2 = 1$ year\n            *   Sum of velocities, $K_{2,1} + K_{2,2} = 15 \\text{ km/s} + 10 \\text{ km/s} = 25 \\text{ km/s}$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Result:**\n    $\\frac{M_{sys1}}{M_{sys2}} = \\frac{2 \\times (15)^3}{1 \\times (25)^3}$\n    $\\frac{M_{sys1}}{M_{sys2}} = 2 \\times \\left(\\frac{15}{25}\\right)^3$\n    $\\frac{M_{sys1}}{M_{sys2}} = 2 \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^3$\n    $\\frac{M_{sys1}}{M_{sys2}} = 2 \\times \\frac{27}{125} = \\frac{54}{125}$\n    $\\frac{M_{sys1}}{M_{sys2}} = 0.432$\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value of 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
