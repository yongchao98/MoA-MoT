    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Total Number of Protons and Functional Groups**\n\n*   **Integration:** The sum of the integrations for the given signals is 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons.\n*   **Molecular Formulas:**\n    *   Propenyl acetate (Cis or Trans) has the formula C5H8O2, which contains 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Butenyl acetate (Cis or Trans) has the formula C6H10O2, which contains 10 hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the total number of protons is 8, the unknown compound must be a propenyl acetate. This eliminates options B (Trans-butenyl acetate) and C (Cis-butenyl acetate).\n\n**2. Analyze Individual Signals**\n\nWe are now left with two possibilities: Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. Let's analyze the signals in detail.\n\n*   **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl (CH3) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** Indicates this methyl group has no adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~2.1 ppm):** This is the typical region for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl in an acetate functional group (CH3-COO-).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This signal confirms the presence of the acetate group in the molecule.\n\n*   **Remaining Signals for the Propenyl Group (CH3-CH=CH-):**\n    The remaining signals at 7.0 ppm (1H), 5.5 ppm (1H), and 1.6 ppm (3H) must correspond to the three distinct proton environments in the propenyl group. Let's label the protons: CH3(c)-CH(b)=CH(a)-.\n    *   **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This corresponds to the methyl group protons, H(c). They are split by the adjacent vinylic proton H(b), resulting in a doublet (d). The chemical shift is appropriate for an allylic methyl group.\n    *   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This corresponds to the vinylic proton H(b). It is split into a doublet by H(a) and into a quartet by the three H(c) protons, resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq).\n    *   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This corresponds to the vinylic proton H(a). It is the most deshielded proton because it's on a carbon atom bonded to the electronegative oxygen of the acetate group. It is split into a doublet by H(b).\n\n**3. Distinguish Between Cis and Trans Isomers**\n\nThe key to distinguishing between the cis and trans isomers is the coupling constant (J-value) between the two vinylic protons, H(a) and H(b).\n\n*   **Trans Isomers:** The coupling constant for two protons in a *trans* configuration across a double bond (³J_trans) is typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n*   **Cis Isomers:** The coupling constant for two protons in a *cis* configuration (³J_cis) is smaller, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nThe problem states that the signal at 7.0 ppm has a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**. This value falls squarely within the range for a *trans* coupling.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe integration data rules out the butenyl acetate options. The large coupling constant (16.0 Hz) between the vinylic protons is characteristic of a trans double bond. Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
