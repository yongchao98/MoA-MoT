    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent structure is acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n*   It has three substituents on the benzene ring:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   All three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\n**2. Consider the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), existing substituents on the ring direct incoming groups to specific positions:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and *meta*-directing.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating and *ortho, para*-directing.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and *meta*-directing.\n\nThe 1,3,5-substitution pattern suggests that the synthesis should prioritize introducing substituents under the influence of *meta*-directors. The presence of the *ortho, para*-directing bromo group needs careful strategic placement.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences (Options A-D)**\n\nLet's analyze each option step by step:\n\n*   **Option A:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...\n    *   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene\n    *   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline (-NH2)\n    *   iii) Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation): This reaction **fails**. The amino group (-NH2) is a Lewis base that reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring towards acylation. Thus, Option A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; ...\n    *   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene\n    *   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline\n    *   iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt\n    *   iv) Benzenediazonium salt → Benzene (Deamination reaction).\n    *   This sequence of reactions starts with benzene and returns to benzene after four steps, making it a pointless and inefficient pathway. Thus, Option B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...\n    *   i) Benzene → Bromobenzene\n    *   ii) Bromobenzene + HNO3/H2SO4 (Nitration): The bromo group is *ortho, para*-directing. This reaction would yield a mixture of *o*-bromonitrobenzene and *p*-bromonitrobenzene as the major products. It would not form the *meta* isomer needed to build the 1,3,5 pattern. Thus, Option C starts with an incorrect regiochemical step and is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...\n    *   **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** This produces **acetophenone**. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director. This is a good first step.\n    *   **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 (Bromination):** The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the meta position (C3). This produces **1-(3-bromophenyl)ethan-1-one** (or m-bromoacetophenone). This step correctly sets up the 1,3-relationship.\n    *   **iii) 1-(3-bromophenyl)ethan-1-one + HNO3/H2SO4 (Nitration):** Now we have two groups on the ring: -COCH3 (at C1, strong deactivator, *meta*-directing) and -Br (at C3, weak deactivator, *o,p*-directing).\n        *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming -NO2 group to position 5.\n        *   The -Br group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n        *   In cases of competing directors, the directing effect of the strongest deactivating group often dominates the regiochemistry, or the substitution occurs at a position that is electronically and sterically favorable. Position 5 is meta to both existing groups and is sterically accessible. Synthetically, this reaction is known to produce **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one** as the major product.\n\nThe first three steps of Option D provide a chemically sound and direct route to the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv, v, vi, vii) are superfluous and would lead to a different product if carried out. However, among the given choices, Option D is the only one that contains a valid synthetic pathway to the desired product. It is common in such questions for the correct option to be the one whose initial sequence is correct.\n\nTherefore, the sequence in option D is the most plausible route.\n\n<<<D>>>"
