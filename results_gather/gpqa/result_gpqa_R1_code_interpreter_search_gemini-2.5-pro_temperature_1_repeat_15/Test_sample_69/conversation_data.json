    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the chemical riddle:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **Reaction 1:** `A(s) + 8B(g) -> C(bright red)`\n    *   **Reaction 2:** `C + 2D(g) -> E(extremely hazardous)`\n    *   **Reaction 3:** `C + H₂O -> A(s) + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid)`\n    *   **Reaction 4:** `D(g) + B(g) -> H(solvent)` (1:1 ratio)\n    *   **Question:** What is the molecular symmetry group of E? Options: A) C₂, B) D₄h, C) D∞h, D) C₂v.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Core Chemical Transformations:**\n    *   **Reaction 3 is the most revealing clue.** The hydrolysis of compound `C` regenerates the starting solid `A` and produces two different acids, one strong (`F`) and one weak (`G`).\n    *   The regeneration of `A` suggests that `A` is a stable element, likely a metal, and `C` is a complex or salt containing `A`.\n    *   The formation of two acids implies that the ligands or counter-ions in `C` are derived from at least two different non-metals. These non-metals must come from gas `B`.\n    *   A combination of a strong acid and a weak acid is key. A common weak acid formed in such reactions is hydrofluoric acid (HF). A corresponding strong acid could be nitric acid (HNO₃), sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄), or a hydrohalic acid like HCl.\n    *   Let's hypothesize that `G` is HF (weak acid) and `F` is HNO₃ (strong acid). This would mean `C` contains fluorine and nitrogen. This implies gas `B` must be the source of fluorine, and nitrogen must also be involved.\n\n3.  **Identify the Chemical System:**\n    *   This set of clues points towards a known, albeit complex, area of inorganic chemistry, specifically involving nitrogen fluorides. The riddle appears to be a classic, even if some details are simplified.\n    *   Let's try to assign the identities based on the hypothesis that fluorine and nitrogen are involved.\n    *   **A = Nickel (Ni)**: A common solid metal.\n    *   **B = Fluorine (F₂)**: A gas. It is the ultimate source of fluorine atoms.\n    *   **C = Tetrafluoroammonium hexafluoronickelate(IV), [NF₄]₂[NiF₆]**: This compound is known to be a vibrant **bright red** solid. The Ni is in a +4 oxidation state.\n    *   **F = Nitric Acid (HNO₃)**: A strong acid.\n    *   **G = Hydrofluoric Acid (HF)**: A weak acid.\n    *   **D = Nitrogen Trifluoride (NF₃)**: A gas.\n    *   **E = Dinitrogen Tetrafluoride (N₂F₄)**: A highly toxic and reactive gas, fitting the \"extremely hazardous\" description.\n    *   **H = Dinitrogen Difluoride (N₂F₂)**: A gas (not typically a solvent, this is a weak point in the riddle's description).\n\n4.  **Verify the Reactions with the Identified Compounds:**\n    *   **Reaction 3:** `[NF₄]₂[NiF₆] + H₂O -> Ni(s) + HNO₃ + HF`. In this complex hydrolysis, Ni(IV) is reduced to Ni(0), and N(+3 in NF₄⁺) is oxidized to N(+5 in HNO₃). The fluorine atoms form HF. This conceptually fits the products `A + F + G`.\n    *   **Reaction 1:** `A(s) + 8B(g) -> C`. The actual synthesis of `C` is complex, for example: `Ni(s) + 2NF₃(g) + 5F₂(g) -> [NF₄]₂[NiF₆](s)`. The riddle simplifies this, possibly by considering NF₃ as an intermediate from N₂ and F₂, and states the overall required equivalents of the primary gas `B` (F₂) as \"8\", though the stoichiometry is actually 7 if we start from N₂ (`Ni + N₂ + 7F₂ -> C`). We proceed assuming the identities are correct despite the stoichiometric discrepancy in the riddle.\n    *   **Reaction 2:** `C + 2D -> E`. `[NF₄]₂[NiF₆] + 2NF₃ -> N₂F₄ + ...`. This is also a simplification. N₂F₄ can be synthesized from NF₃, and the high-oxidation state compound C could facilitate this, for example, by `NiF₄` (from C) reacting with NF₃: `NiF₄ + 2NF₃ -> N₂F₄ + NiF₂ + F₂`. The riddle seems to represent this complex transformation as a simple addition.\n    *   **Reaction 4:** `D + B -> H`. `NF₃ + F₂ -> N₂F₂`. This is not a standard reaction. N₂F₂ is usually formed from the decomposition of fluoroazide (FN₃). This is another simplification in the riddle.\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E:**\n    *   Despite the inaccuracies in the reaction descriptions, the set of compounds is chemically consistent and fits the qualitative clues. We can be confident that **E is N₂F₄**.\n    *   The question asks for the molecular symmetry group of N₂F₄.\n    *   The molecule N₂F₄ (F₂N-NF₂) has a single bond between the two nitrogen atoms. The geometry around each nitrogen is pyramidal.\n    *   There is rotation around the N-N single bond, leading to different conformers. The two most significant are the *gauche* and *anti* (or *trans*) conformers.\n    *   The *gauche* conformer is the most stable form (the ground state). In this conformation, the molecule possesses a single C₂ rotational axis that bisects the N-N bond. It has no other symmetry elements (besides identity). Therefore, its point group is **C₂**.\n    *   The *anti* conformer is slightly higher in energy and has a center of inversion (`i`), a C₂ axis, and a horizontal mirror plane (σh), giving it a point group of C₂h.\n    *   Since C₂ is one of the options and it corresponds to the ground state conformer of the identified molecule E, this is the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
