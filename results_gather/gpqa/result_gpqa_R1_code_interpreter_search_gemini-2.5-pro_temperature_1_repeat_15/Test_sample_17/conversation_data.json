    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the notation:** The notation `[A/B]` represents the logarithmic abundance ratio of element A to element B in a star, relative to the Sun. The formula is:\n    `[A/B] = log10(n_A/n_B)_star - log10(n_A/n_B)_sun`\n    where `n_A` and `n_B` are the number densities of atoms of elements A and B. A special case is `[A/H]`, which measures the abundance of element A relative to hydrogen (metallicity for metals).\n\n2.  **State the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star 1 and Star 2. In the context of stellar abundances, this is interpreted as the ratio of the silicon abundance fractions: `(n_Si/n_H)_1 / (n_Si/n_H)_2`.\n\n3.  **Use the Abundance Identity:** A useful identity derived from the definition is `[X/H] = [X/Y] + [Y/H]`. This allows us to relate different abundance ratios.\n    *   `[X/Y] + [Y/H] = [log10(n_X/n_Y)_star - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun] + [log10(n_Y/n_H)_star - log10(n_Y/n_H)_sun]`\n    *   `= [log10(n_X)_star - log10(n_Y)_star] - [log10(n_X)_sun - log10(n_Y)_sun] + [log10(n_Y)_star - log10(n_H)_star] - [log10(n_Y)_sun - log10(n_H)_sun]`\n    *   `= log10(n_X/n_H)_star - log10(n_X/n_H)_sun = [X/H]`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Silicon Abundance for Star 1:** We are given `[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3` and `[Fe/H]_1 = 0`. We can find `[Si/H]_1`.\n    *   Using the identity: `[Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1`\n    *   Substituting the given values: `[Si/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Silicon Abundance for Star 2:** We are given `[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3` and `[Mg/H]_2 = 0`. We need to find `[Si/H]_2`.\n    *   Using the identity: `[Mg/H]_2 = [Mg/Si]_2 + [Si/H]_2`\n    *   Substituting the given values: `0 = 0.3 + [Si/H]_2`\n    *   Solving for `[Si/H]_2`: `[Si/H]_2 = -0.3`\n\n6.  **Relate Abundance Ratios to the Desired Ratio:** Now we use the definition of `[Si/H]` to find the ratio of abundances.\n    *   For Star 1: `[Si/H]_1 = log10( (n_Si/n_H)_1 / (n_Si/n_H)_sun ) = 0.3`\n    *   For Star 2: `[Si/H]_2 = log10( (n_Si/n_H)_2 / (n_Si/n_H)_sun ) = -0.3`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:** We want to find `Ratio = (n_Si/n_H)_1 / (n_Si/n_H)_2`. It's easiest to work with logarithms.\n    *   `log10(Ratio) = log10( (n_Si/n_H)_1 ) - log10( (n_Si/n_H)_2 )`\n    *   From step 6, we can write:\n        *   `log10( (n_Si/n_H)_1 ) = 0.3 + log10( (n_Si/n_H)_sun )`\n        *   `log10( (n_Si/n_H)_2 ) = -0.3 + log10( (n_Si/n_H)_sun )`\n    *   Substitute these into the equation for `log10(Ratio)`:\n        *   `log10(Ratio) = [0.3 + log10( (n_Si/n_H)_sun )] - [-0.3 + log10( (n_Si/n_H)_sun )]`\n        *   `log10(Ratio) = 0.3 - (-0.3) = 0.6`\n    *   Therefore, `Ratio = 10^0.6`.\n\n8.  **Compute the Numerical Value:** The final step is to calculate the value of `10^0.6`. This can be done with a calculator. The information about the stellar masses, the measurement method (LTE, EW), and the specific solar abundances of Fe and Mg are not needed for this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the value of 10^0.6\nratio = math.pow(10, 0.6)\nprint(ratio)\n```\n\nThe computed value is approximately 3.98, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
