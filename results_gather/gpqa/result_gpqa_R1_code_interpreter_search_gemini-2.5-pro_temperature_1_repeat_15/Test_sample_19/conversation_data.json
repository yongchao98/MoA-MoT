    "The user wants to identify the set of assumptions that define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. The core idea of this approximation is that a nucleon inside a nucleus behaves like a free nucleon during an interaction. Let's analyze each statement to see how it contributes to this core idea.\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.**\n    This assumption is fundamental. If the interaction could involve multiple nucleons simultaneously (e.g., through meson-exchange currents) or the nucleus as a collective entity, then the picture of an interaction with a single, isolated particle would break down immediately. By restricting the interaction to a single nucleon, we take the first step toward treating that nucleon as if it were free. This is often called the \"one-body current\" approximation and is a prerequisite for the impulse approximation.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.**\n    This assumption deals with the environment of the interaction. If the incoming probe (e.g., an electron or neutrino) interacts with other nucleons on its way in, or if the struck nucleon interacts with other nucleons on its way out (known as final-state interactions or FSI), the overall process would be significantly modified by the presence of the nuclear medium. The energy and momentum of the particles would be altered. To treat the interaction as if it happened to a free nucleon in a vacuum, we must assume that the rest of the nucleus is \"transparent\" and does not interfere. This is a crucial part of the approximation.\n\n3.  **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.**\n    This statement describes the internal structure of the nucleon itself (its constituent quarks). The impulse approximation, however, is about the behavior of the nucleon *as a whole particle* within the nuclear environment. The internal structure of a nucleon is largely the same whether it is free or bound (though minor modifications, like the EMC effect, exist, they are beyond the scope of the basic impulse approximation). This assumption is related to specific models of nucleon structure (like a constituent quark model), not the impulse approximation itself, which treats the nucleon as the fundamental entity of interaction. Therefore, this assumption is not a defining feature of the impulse approximation.\n\n4.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.**\n    This is the very heart of the \"impulse\" in \"impulse approximation\". It assumes the interaction happens over such a short timescale (is an \"impulse\") that the relatively slow-moving nucleon doesn't have time to interact with its neighbours via the strong nuclear force. The nucleon's binding energy and its momentum due to the nuclear potential are ignored *during the interaction vertex*. This directly enforces the idea that the nucleon behaves as if it were free and unbound at the moment of the interaction.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nTo make a bound nucleon behave like a free one for the purpose of a calculation, we must:\n-   Isolate the interaction to that single nucleon (Assumption 1).\n-   Ignore the influence of the other nucleons on the incoming and outgoing particles (Assumption 2).\n-   Ignore the binding forces holding the nucleon in the nucleus during the brief moment of interaction (Assumption 4).\n\nTherefore, the assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
