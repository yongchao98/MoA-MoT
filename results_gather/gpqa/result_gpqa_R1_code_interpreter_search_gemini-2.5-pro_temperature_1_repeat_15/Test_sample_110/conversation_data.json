    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves a ketone, an α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate), and a strong, bulky base (potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK). This is a classic **Michael addition** reaction. The base will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate, which then acts as a nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate (the Nucleophile):**\n    *   The base, t-BuOK, abstracts an acidic α-proton from the ketone.\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   Let's identify the α-carbons relative to the carbonyl group (C=O at position 1):\n        *   **C2:** This carbon is substituted with an ethyl group and a methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no α-protons**.\n        *   **C6:** This carbon is substituted with a methyl group and a hydrogen atom. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Since only C6 has a proton, the base can only deprotonate at this position. This is a regioselective deprotonation.\n    *   The enolate will form with a double bond between C1 and C6.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The C6 of the enolate is the nucleophilic carbon.\n    *   It attacks the β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH−COOEt).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate molecule.\n    *   The resulting molecule, after workup (protonation), will have a `–CH₂–CH₂–COOEt` group attached to the C6 position of the original cyclohexanone ring.\n\n4.  **Naming the Product (Product A):**\n    *   We need to name the resulting structure. Let's analyze the names provided in the options, which treat the cyclohexyl ring as a substituent on the propanoate chain.\n    *   The new side chain is an ethyl propanoate derivative.\n    *   The point of attachment to the propanoate chain is defined as C1 of the cyclohexyl substituent ring. So, the original C6 is now C1.\n    *   The carbonyl group (original C1) is adjacent to the new C1, making it C2. Hence, the substituent is a `2-oxo` cyclohexyl.\n    *   The ethyl and methyl groups were on the original C2. This carbon is adjacent to the original C1 (now C2), making it the new C3. Thus, we have `3-ethyl` and `3-methyl` substituents.\n    *   The methyl group that was on the original C6 is now on the new C1. Thus, we have a `1-methyl` substituent.\n    *   Combining these pieces gives the substituent name: `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n    *   The full name of the product is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   The other name provided, `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`, implies the ketone is at position 4, which is inconsistent with the reaction mechanism.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves a nitroalkane, an α,β-unsaturated nitrile ((E)-but-2-enenitrile, also known as crotononitrile), and a strong base (KOH). This is also a **Michael addition**.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nitronate (the Nucleophile):**\n    *   The base, KOH, deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group (–NO₂) in 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂).\n    *   The α-carbon (C1) is acidic due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the nitro group.\n    *   The resulting nucleophile is the nitronate anion: `[CH₃CH₂CHNO₂]⁻`.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃–CH=CH–CN).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C1 of the 1-nitropropane and C3 of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The product structure is: `CH₃CH₂–CH(NO₂) –CH(CH₃)–CH₂–CN` (after protonation by H₂O).\n\n4.  **Naming the Product (Product B):**\n    *   The principal functional group is the nitrile (–CN), so the parent chain is named as a nitrile.\n    *   We must find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon.\n        `C⁶H₃–C⁵H₂–C⁴H(NO₂) –C³H(CH₃)–C²H₂–C¹N`\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so it is a **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   The substituents are:\n        *   A methyl group (–CH₃) at C3.\n        *   A nitro group (–NO₂) at C4.\n    *   The IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   The other name provided, `2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile`, is inconsistent with the starting materials. It would require nitroethane and a different Michael acceptor.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A** is `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`.\n*   **Product B** is `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   **A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile** - This matches our findings perfectly.\n*   B) A is correct, but B is incorrect.\n*   C) A is incorrect, but B is correct.\n*   D) A and B are both incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
