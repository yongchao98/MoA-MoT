    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂) → Product 1**\n\nThis reaction is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. In this case, cyclohexanone is brominated at the alpha-position (the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group). The major product formed is 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) → Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) is an α-halo ketone. When treated with a strong base like NaOH and heated, it undergoes a classic reaction called the Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the formation of a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate, followed by nucleophilic attack by hydroxide and ring-opening. For 2-halocyclohexanones, this rearrangement results in a ring contraction. The six-membered ring becomes a five-membered ring with a carboxylic acid group (after protonation during workup).\n\n*   **Mechanism outline:**\n    1.  A proton is removed from the other α-carbon (C6) by OH⁻ to form an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 attack, displacing the bromide to form a strained bicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-2-one intermediate.\n    3.  The hydroxide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon of the bicyclic intermediate.\n    4.  The three-membered ring opens up to form a more stable cyclopentane ring, resulting in a cyclopentanecarboxylate anion.\n    5.  Upon acidic workup (implicit in this type of problem), the carboxylate is protonated.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine → Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 is a carboxylic acid. Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) is a standard reagent used to convert carboxylic acids into acyl chlorides (acid chlorides). Pyridine is a weak base added to neutralize the HCl gas produced as a byproduct.\n\n*   **Reaction:** R-COOH + SOCl₂ → R-COCl + SO₂ + HCl\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃) → Product 4**\n\nProduct 3 is an acyl chloride. Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky, mild reducing agent. It is well-known for its ability to selectively reduce acyl chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the primary alcohol. This selectivity is due to its steric hindrance and reduced reactivity compared to stronger reducing agents like LiAlH₄.\n\n*   **Reaction:** R-COCl + LiAlH(OtBu)₃ → R-CHO\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nNow we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. This is equivalent to determining the number of signals we would expect to see in a proton NMR (¹H NMR) spectrum.\n\nThe structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde is a cyclopentane ring with a -CHO group attached.\n\n```\n      H\n      |\n      C=O\n      |\n H - C1\n    /   \\\nH₂C2-----C3H₂\n  |       |\nH₂C5-----C4H₂\n```\n\nTo determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogens, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry. At room temperature, the cyclopentane ring undergoes rapid conformational changes (puckering). The NMR spectrum reflects the time-averaged structure, which possesses a plane of symmetry (Cₛ symmetry). This plane passes through the aldehyde group (CHO), the C1 carbon, and the hydrogen atom attached to C1, and it bisects the C3-C4 bond.\n\nLet's count the sets of equivalent protons:\n\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton is unique in its chemical environment. It lies on the plane of symmetry. (1 type of H)\n2.  **The proton on C1:** This proton (a methine hydrogen) is also unique and lies on the plane of symmetry. (1 type of H)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. However, on each of these carbons, the two hydrogen atoms (geminal protons) are not equivalent to each other. One is *cis* to the aldehyde group and the other is *trans*. They are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. The *cis*-proton on C2 is equivalent to the *cis*-proton on C5, and the *trans*-proton on C2 is equivalent to the *trans*-proton on C5. Therefore, the four hydrogens on C2 and C5 constitute two distinct sets. (2 types of H)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, the plane of symmetry makes C3 and C4 equivalent. The two geminal protons on C3 are diastereotopic, as are the two on C4. The four protons on these two carbons also split into two distinct sets. (2 types of H)\n\n**Tally:**\n*   Set 1: Aldehyde H (1 proton)\n*   Set 2: C1-H (1 proton)\n*   Set 3: C2-H & C5-H (2 protons)\n*   Set 4: C2-H' & C5-H' (2 protons)\n*   Set 5: C3-H & C4-H (2 protons)\n*   Set 6: C3-H' & C4-H' (2 protons)\n\nTotal number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\n<<<D>>>"
