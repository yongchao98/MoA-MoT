    "*   **Step 1: Determine the molecular structure from the given information.**\n    1.  **\"6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This indicates a benzene ring, which accounts for 6 carbon atoms and has the formula C6H6 as a base.\n    2.  **\"di-substituted\"**: Two hydrogen atoms on the benzene ring are replaced by two substituent groups. This leaves 4 hydrogen atoms on the ring itself.\n    3.  **\"8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring has 6 carbons, so the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    4.  **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicates the presence of a carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents contains a C=O group.\n    5.  **\"FTIR spectrum ... indicates ... an aromatic-halogen bond\"**: One of the substituents is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, I) attached directly to the aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Step 2: Combine the structural features.**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X). A halogen atom has zero carbon atoms.\n    *   Therefore, the other substituent must contain both of the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group.\n    *   A group with two carbons and a carbonyl group is an acetyl group (-C(=O)CH3).\n    *   So, the compound is a haloacetophenone. Its general structure is X-C6H4-COCH3. The molecular formula is C8H7XO, meaning there should be a total of 7 protons in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Step 3: Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for the possible isomers (ortho, meta, para).**\n    *   **Acetyl group protons (-COCH3)**: This methyl group is adjacent to a carbonyl group and not adjacent to any carbon with protons. It will appear as a singlet (s) integrating to 3 hydrogens (3H). Its chemical shift is typically in the range of 2.0-2.6 ppm because the carbonyl group is deshielding.\n    *   **Aromatic protons**: There are 4 protons on the ring. Their splitting pattern depends on the substitution pattern:\n        *   **ortho (1,2-substitution)**: All 4 protons are chemically different, leading to a complex multiplet pattern in the aromatic region (approx. 7.0-8.0 ppm).\n        *   **meta (1,3-substitution)**: All 4 protons are chemically different, also leading to a complex pattern, although potentially distinguishable from the ortho isomer.\n        *   **para (1,4-substitution)**: Due to the molecule's symmetry, there are only two types of aromatic protons. The two protons ortho to the acetyl group are equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the halogen are equivalent. This results in a characteristic pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to 2 hydrogens (2H).\n\n*   **Step 4: Evaluate the given options against the predicted spectrum.**\n    *   The structure we deduced is a haloacetophenone. We expect to see a 3H singlet around 2.3 ppm and 4H of aromatic signals. The total integration should be 3H + 4H = 7H.\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   Total protons: 1+2+2+2 = 7H.\n        *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a methyl ketone (-COCH3). This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   Total protons: 1+2+2+2 = 7H.\n        *   The signals are not in the expected chemical shift ranges for an aromatic ketone. The aromatic region is nearly absent. This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   Total protons: 2+2+3 = 7H.\n        *   There are no signals in the typical aromatic region (> 6.5 ppm). This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   Total protons: 2+2+3 = 7H.\n        *   **2.3 (3H, s)**: This is a perfect match for the methyl protons of an acetyl group (-COCH3). The chemical shift, integration, and splitting are all correct.\n        *   **7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d)**: This pattern of two doublets, each for 2 protons, is the classic signature of a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The chemical shifts are appropriate for protons on a ring with electron-withdrawing groups.\n        *   This option perfectly describes the 1H NMR spectrum of a para-haloacetophenone.\n\n<<<D>>>"
