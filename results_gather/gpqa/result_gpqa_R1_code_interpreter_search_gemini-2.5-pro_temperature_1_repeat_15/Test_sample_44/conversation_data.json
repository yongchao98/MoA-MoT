    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the System\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. According to the spin-statistics theorem, particles with half-integer spin are fermions.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state for a particle in this system is defined by its spatial quantum number `n` and its spin quantum number `ms` (spin up, +1/2, or spin down, -1/2).\n*   **Energy Levels:** The system is a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The single-particle energy levels are given by the formula:\n    E_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)\n    where `n` is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n*   **Energy Unit:** The problem defines a base energy unit E = (π²ħ² / 2mL²). Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as:\n    E_n = n²E\n\nSince each spatial level `n` can have two spin states (up and down), each level `n` can accommodate a maximum of two fermions.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Ground State Energy (E_ground)\nTo find the ground state, we fill the energy levels from the lowest energy upwards, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle, until all four particles are placed.\n\n*   **Level n=1:** We can place two particles in this level (one spin up, one spin down).\n    *   Energy contributed by these two particles = 2 * E₁ = 2 * (1²E) = 2E.\n*   **Level n=2:** We have two remaining particles. We place them in the next available level, n=2.\n    *   Energy contributed by these two particles = 2 * E₂ = 2 * (2²E) = 2 * 4E = 8E.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\nE_ground = (2 * E₁) + (2 * E₂) = 2E + 8E = **10E**\n\nThe ground state configuration is (2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2).\n\n### 3. Calculating the First Excited State Energy (E_1st_excited)\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. This is typically achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (LUMO).\n\n*   **Ground State Configuration:** Levels n=1 and n=2 are filled.\n*   **HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital/Level):** n=2\n*   **LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital/Level):** n=3\n*   **Excitation:** We move one particle from level n=2 to level n=3.\n\nThe new configuration for the first excited state is:\n*   Two particles in level n=1.\n*   One particle in level n=2.\n*   One particle in level n=3.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\nE_1st_excited = (2 * E₁) + (1 * E₂) + (1 * E₃)\nE_1st_excited = (2 * 1²E) + (1 * 2²E) + (1 * 3²E)\nE_1st_excited = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**\n\n### 4. Calculating the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd_excited)\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We need to consider all possible low-energy excitations from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy.\n\nLet's list the possible configurations and their energies, starting from the ground state energy of 10E:\n\n*   **Configuration A (First Excited State, calculated above):** Move one particle from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: (2 @ n=1), (1 @ n=2), (1 @ n=3)\n    *   Energy = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\n*   **Configuration B:** Move one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: (1 @ n=1), (2 @ n=2), (1 @ n=3)\n    *   Energy = (1 * E₁) + (2 * E₂) + (1 * E₃) = (1 * 1²E) + (2 * 2²E) + (1 * 3²E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n\n*   **Configuration C:** Move two particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: (2 @ n=1), (0 @ n=2), (2 @ n=3)\n    *   Energy = (2 * E₁) + (2 * E₃) = (2 * 1²E) + (2 * 3²E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n\n*   **Configuration D:** Move one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n    *   Configuration: (2 @ n=1), (1 @ n=2), (1 @ n=4)\n    *   Energy = (2 * E₁) + (1 * E₂) + (1 * E₄) = (2 * 1²E) + (1 * 2²E) + (1 * 4²E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n\nComparing the energies of the excited states:\n*   Ground State: 10E\n*   Lowest Excited State Energy: 15E\n*   Next Lowest Excited State Energy: 18E\n\nSo, the second excited state has an energy of **18E**.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
