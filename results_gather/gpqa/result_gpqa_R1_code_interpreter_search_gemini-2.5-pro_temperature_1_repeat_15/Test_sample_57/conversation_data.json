    "An analysis of the options is as follows:\n\n1.  **Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)** and **Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)**: Both of these are quantum field theories (QFTs). When calculating physical quantities in QFTs using perturbation theory, one often encounters integrals that diverge at high energies (or, equivalently, short distances). These are known as ultraviolet (UV) divergences. To handle these infinities and extract meaningful physical predictions, a two-step process is required:\n    *   **Regularization**: This is a mathematical trick to make the divergent integrals temporarily finite. Methods include introducing a momentum cutoff, using dimensional regularization, or Pauli-Villars regularization.\n    *   **Renormalization**: This procedure absorbs the infinities into a redefinition of the theory's fundamental parameters (like mass and charge), leaving finite, physically measurable predictions.\n    Therefore, both QED and QCD absolutely require regularization at high energies.\n\n2.  **Classical Electrodynamics**: This theory, described by Maxwell's equations, also has a high-energy problem, although it's of a different nature than the loop divergences in QFT. If one models an electron as a true point charge, the energy stored in its own electric field (its \"self-energy\") is infinite. To calculate a finite energy, one must \"regularize\" the theory, for instance, by assuming the charge is not a point but is spread over a tiny, non-zero radius. This acts as a short-distance (high-energy) cutoff. Thus, classical electrodynamics also requires a form of regularization to avoid infinities associated with point particles.\n\n3.  **Superstring Theory**: A primary motivation for developing superstring theory was to resolve the conflicts between general relativity and quantum mechanics, particularly the problem of UV divergences that arise when one tries to quantize gravity. In string theory, fundamental particles are not point-like but are instead different vibrational modes of a tiny, one-dimensional \"string\". Because these strings are extended objects (not points), their interactions are \"smeared out\" in spacetime. This smearing effectively smooths out the interactions at very short distances (high energies), which prevents the UV divergences from appearing in the first place. For this reason, superstring theory is believed to be \"UV-finite\" and does not require the procedure of regularization.\n\nBased on this analysis, superstring theory is the only theory listed that is constructed to be free of high-energy divergences and therefore does not require regularization.\n\n<<<A>>>"
