    "This problem requires us to calculate the minimum distance a particle must travel for its decay to be observable, given a certain probability threshold. This distance corresponds to the minimum required resolution of the detector.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:**\n    *   **Time Dilation:** A particle moving at relativistic speeds experiences time slower than in its own rest frame. Its lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau$) is longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) by a factor of $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor).\n        $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n    *   **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** This factor relates the total energy ($E$) of a particle to its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$).\n        $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2}$\n    *   **Decay Law:** The probability that a particle survives for a time $t$ in the lab frame follows an exponential decay law: $P(\\text{survival}) = e^{-t/\\tau}$.\n    *   **Distance Traveled:** The distance ($d$) a particle travels is its velocity ($v$) multiplied by the time it lives ($t$). For relativistic particles, $v$ is very close to the speed of light, $c$. The precise velocity is given by $v = \\beta c$, where $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Condition:**\n    The problem asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe *at least 30% of the decays*. This means we need to find the distance, let's call it $d_{min}$, such that the probability of the particle traveling *further* than $d_{min}$ before decaying is 30% (or 0.3).\n    *   The time it takes to travel a distance $d_{min}$ is $t_{min} = d_{min}/v$.\n    *   The probability of surviving longer than $t_{min}$ is $P(\\text{survival}) = e^{-t_{min}/\\tau}$.\n    *   We are given this probability is 30%, so:\n        $e^{-t_{min}/\\tau} = 0.30$\n\n3.  **Solve for the distance $d_{min}$:**\n    *   From the probability equation, we can solve for $t_{min}$:\n        $-t_{min}/\\tau = \\ln(0.30)$\n        $t_{min} = -\\tau \\ln(0.30)$\n    *   Now, substitute this time into the distance equation, $d_{min} = v \\cdot t_{min}$:\n        $d_{min} = v \\cdot (-\\tau \\ln(0.30))$\n    *   Replace $v$ with $\\beta c$ and $\\tau$ with $\\gamma \\tau_0$:\n        $d_{min} = (\\beta c) \\cdot (-\\gamma \\tau_0 \\ln(0.30))$\n        $d_{min} = -c \\tau_0 \\ln(0.30) \\cdot (\\beta \\gamma)$\n    *   A useful relativistic identity is $\\beta \\gamma = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$. This simplifies the equation to:\n        $d_{min} = -c \\tau_0 \\ln(0.30) \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\n    *   Finally, substitute $\\gamma = E / (m_0c^2)$:\n        $d_{min} = -c \\tau_0 \\ln(0.30) \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{E}{m_0c^2}\\right)^2 - 1}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    We are given:\n    *   $E = 27$ GeV\n    *   $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n    *   $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    *   Probability $P = 0.30$\n    *   Speed of light $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\n    We can now compute the value using a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# --- Given parameters ---\nE = 27.0  # Total energy in GeV\nm0c2 = 3.41  # Rest mass energy in GeV\ntau0 = 8.0e-16  # Proper lifetime in seconds\nP_survival = 0.30  # Probability of survival\nc = 299792458.0  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# --- Calculation ---\n# 1. Calculate the Lorentz factor gamma\ngamma = E / m0c2\n\n# 2. Use the derived formula for the minimum distance d\n# d = -c * tau0 * ln(P_survival) * sqrt(gamma^2 - 1)\nd_min = -c * tau0 * np.log(P_survival) * np.sqrt(gamma**2 - 1)\n\n# --- Output the result ---\nprint(f\"{d_min:.2e}\")\n```\n\nExecution of the code yields:\n```\n2.27e-06\n```\nThe calculated minimum distance is $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The available options are:\n    A) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n    B) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\n    C) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\n    D) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\n\nOur calculated result, $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is closest in value and order of magnitude to option D, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The small discrepancy (about 9%) might be due to slightly different constants or rounding in the problem's intended solution. However, option D is clearly the correct choice.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem asks for the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle $X^0$. This minimum resolution is the minimum distance, $d$, that the particle must travel before it decays for the decay to be considered \"observed\" by the detector. Therefore, we need to find the distance $d$ such that the probability of the particle traveling at least this distance is 30%.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Time Dilation and Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**:\n    A particle moving at relativistic speeds has a longer lifetime in the laboratory frame ($\\tau$) compared to its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$). This phenomenon is called time dilation and is described by the equation:\n    $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n    The Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$, is the ratio of the particle's total energy ($E$) to its rest mass energy ($m_0c^2$):\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0c^2}$\n\n    Given:\n    *   Total energy $E = 27$ GeV\n    *   Rest mass energy $m_0c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n\n    Let's calculate $\\gamma$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n2.  **Relativistic Velocity ($\\beta$) and Momentum**:\n    The particle's velocity is given by $v = \\beta c$, where $c$ is the speed of light. The factor $\\beta$ is related to $\\gamma$ by:\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    A useful combination is $\\beta\\gamma$, which relates to the particle's momentum. We can calculate it as:\n    $\\beta\\gamma = \\gamma \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}} = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\n    $\\beta\\gamma = \\sqrt{(7.918)^2 - 1} \\approx \\sqrt{62.69 - 1} \\approx \\sqrt{61.69} \\approx 7.854$\n\n3.  **Exponential Decay Law**:\n    The probability that a particle survives for a time $t$ in the lab frame follows an exponential decay law:\n    $P(\\text{survival}) = e^{-t/\\tau}$\n    We want to find the distance $d$ such that the probability of the particle traveling at least that far is 30% (0.30). The time it takes to travel a distance $d$ is $t = d/v$.\n    So, the condition is:\n    $P(\\text{travels distance } \\ge d) = P(\\text{survives time } \\ge d/v) = e^{-(d/v)/\\tau} = 0.30$\n\n4.  **Solving for the Distance (d)**:\n    From the probability equation, we can solve for $d$:\n    $e^{-d/(v\\tau)} = 0.30$\n    Take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $-\\frac{d}{v\\tau} = \\ln(0.30)$\n    $d = -v\\tau \\ln(0.30)$\n\n    Now, substitute the expressions for $v$ and $\\tau$:\n    $v = \\beta c$\n    $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n    $d = -(\\beta c)(\\gamma \\tau_0) \\ln(0.30)$\n    $d = -c \\tau_0 \\ln(0.30) (\\beta\\gamma)$\n\n    Finally, substitute the expression for $\\beta\\gamma$:\n    $d = -c \\tau_0 \\ln(0.30) \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\n\n5.  **Numerical Calculation**:\n    Let's plug in the given values:\n    *   $c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n    *   $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    *   $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n    *   $\\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1} \\approx 7.854$\n\n    $d \\approx -(3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\times (-1.204) \\times (7.854)$\n    $d \\approx (3 \\times 8 \\times 1.204 \\times 7.854) \\times 10^{8-16}$ m\n    $d \\approx 226.75 \\times 10^{-8}$ m\n    $d \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n    This calculation was confirmed by the Python code execution, which yielded $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**:\n    The calculated minimum distance (resolution) is approximately $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) 2.08 * 1e-3 m = $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\n    B) 2.08 * 1e-9 m = $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\n    C) 2.08 * 1e-1 m = $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\n    D) 2.08 * 1e-6 m = $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n    The calculated value is closest to option D. The small difference (about 9%) is likely due to the use of slightly different physical constants or rounding in the problem's design. Option D is the only one with the correct order of magnitude.\n\n<<<D>>>"
