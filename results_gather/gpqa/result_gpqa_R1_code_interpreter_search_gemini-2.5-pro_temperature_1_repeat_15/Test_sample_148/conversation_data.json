    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental data provided:**\n    *   **Â¹H NMR:** Two distinct peaks are observed for a single proton (an alpha-proton).\n        *   The integrals are roughly equal and sum to the expected value of 1H. This means there are two species present in an approximate 1:1 ratio, and in each species, that proton is present.\n        *   The chemical shifts are similar, suggesting the chemical environments in the two species are similar but not identical.\n        *   Spin-spin coupling is ruled out as the cause, so the peak splitting is not due to neighboring protons. This reinforces the idea that two distinct molecular species are present.\n    *   **LC-MS:**\n        *   Two peaks are observed in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace. This confirms that there are two different compounds that can be physically separated based on their different interactions with the stationary and mobile phases.\n        *   The peaks have equal intensities, which correlates with the equal integrals seen in the NMR, confirming a ~1:1 ratio of the two species.\n        *   The mass spectrometry (MS) data for both LC peaks is identical and matches the expected mass of the target molecule. This is a crucial piece of information: it means the two species are isomers (they have the same chemical formula and thus the same mass) of the desired compound.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the possible explanations based on the data:**\n\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties.\n        *   **NMR:** A standard NMR spectrometer operates in an achiral environment. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers. Therefore, a mixture of enantiomers would show only a single set of peaks, not two.\n        *   **LC:** A standard reverse-phase LC column is also achiral. Enantiomers would co-elute and appear as a single peak.\n        *   This option is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data.\n\n    *   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor from the synthesis would be a different molecule, almost certainly with a different molecular weight.\n        *   **MS:** The MS data shows both peaks have the *same* mass as the target compound. A precursor would have a different mass.\n        *   This option is inconsistent with the MS data.\n\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. They have different 3D arrangements.\n        *   **Properties:** Crucially, diastereomers have different physical and chemical properties.\n        *   **NMR:** Because they are chemically distinct, their corresponding protons (like the alpha-proton in question) exist in different chemical environments. This would result in two different chemical shifts, leading to two separate peaks in the NMR spectrum.\n        *   **LC:** Because they have different physical properties, they will interact differently with the chromatography column and can be separated, resulting in two distinct peaks in the LC trace.\n        *   **MS:** Being isomers, they have the same chemical formula and therefore the same mass.\n        *   This option is perfectly consistent with all pieces of experimental data (NMR, LC, and MS). A common reason for this observation in peptides is **atropisomerism**, where slow rotation around an amide (C-N) bond (e.g., a proline-containing peptide) leads to stable *cis* and *trans* conformers. These conformers are diastereomers of each other and can be observed as separate species by NMR and LC. Another possibility is that one of the chiral amino acids racemized during the synthesis, creating a mixture of diastereomers (e.g., L-Ala-L-Val and D-Ala-L-Val).\n\n    *   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This term is ambiguous, but any likely interpretation, such as a side reaction where an amine is acylated twice, would result in a product with a different chemical structure and a different molecular weight.\n        *   **MS:** This would lead to a different mass spectrum, which contradicts the observation that both peaks have the mass of the expected product.\n        *   This option is inconsistent with the MS data.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The only explanation that fits all the evidence is that the crude compound is a mixture of diastereoisomers. They are isomers (same mass), but are distinct compounds that can be separated by LC and distinguished by NMR.\n\n<<<C>>>"
