    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe primary goal is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n**2. Equilibrium Temperature Formula:**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\nwhere:\n*   T_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   A is the planet's albedo.\n*   R_star is the radius of the star.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n**3. Formulate the Ratio:**\nWe want to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [T_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are the same. It is also given that the albedos are the same (A1 = A2). Therefore, these terms cancel out:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1 / a1) / sqrt(1 / a2)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nThis means the problem reduces to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes of the two planets.\n\n**4. Relate Observational Data to Physical Parameters:**\nWe are given data from the radial velocity (RV) method, specifically the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ) for a specific spectral line (λ₀). The Doppler shift is related to the star's radial velocity (v_r) by:\nΔλ / λ₀ = v_r / c\nThe maximum radial velocity, known as the semi-amplitude (K), is therefore proportional to the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ_max):\nK = c * (Δλ_max / λ₀)\nSince c and λ₀ are constants for both observations, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts:\nK1 / K2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2\n\n**5. Connect Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters:**\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is given by:\nK = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * v_p\nwhere v_p is the planet's orbital velocity, M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, and i is the orbital inclination.\nThe planet's orbital velocity is v_p = sqrt(G * M_star / a) (assuming M_p << M_star).\nSubstituting v_p into the equation for K:\nK = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\nK = (M_p * sin(i)) * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n\n**6. Isolate the Semi-Major Axis (a):**\nWe can rearrange the formula to solve for `a`:\nK² = (M_p * sin(i))² * G / (M_star * a)\na = (M_p * sin(i))² * G / (M_star * K²)\n\n**7. Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a2 / a1):**\na2 / a1 = [(M_p2 * sin(i2))² * G / (M_star * K2²)] / [(M_p1 * sin(i1))² * G / (M_star * K1²)]\n\nSince both planets are detected via the transit method, their orbital inclinations must be very close to 90°, so we can assume sin(i1) ≈ sin(i2) ≈ 1. The terms G and M_star also cancel out.\na2 / a1 = (M_p2² / K2²) / (M_p1² / K1²)\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²\n\n**8. Substitute Numerical Values:**\n*   Mass ratio: M_p2 / M_p1 = (5 M_earth) / (7 M_earth) = 5/7\n*   Semi-amplitude ratio: K1 / K2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3/4\n\nNow, plug these ratios into the equation for a2 / a1:\na2 / a1 = (5/7)² * (3/4)²\na2 / a1 = (25/49) * (9/16)\na2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\n**9. Final Calculation of Temperature Ratio:**\nFinally, substitute the value of a2 / a1 back into the temperature ratio formula:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\nTo get the decimal value, we perform the division. This can be done with a simple calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 8: Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2 / a1)\nmass_ratio_2_to_1 = 5.0 / 7.0\nK_ratio_1_to_2 = 0.03 / 0.04\n\na_ratio_2_to_1 = (mass_ratio_2_to_1)**2 * (K_ratio_1_to_2)**2\n\n# Step 9: Calculate the final temperature ratio\nTeq_ratio_1_to_2 = math.sqrt(a_ratio_2_to_1)\n\nprint(Teq_ratio_1_to_2)\n```\n\n>>>0.5357142857142857\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.536. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.53\nB) ~ 1.30\nC) ~ 1.05\nD) ~ 0.98\n\nThe calculated value is closest to 0.53.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature of a planet ($T_{\\text{eq}}$) is given by the formula:\n$T_{\\text{eq}} = T_{\\text{star}} \\left( \\frac{R_{\\text{star}}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A)^{1/4}$\nwhere $T_{\\text{star}}$ is the star's effective temperature, $R_{\\text{star}}$ is the star's radius, $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, and $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, $T_{\\text{eq1}} / T_{\\text{eq2}}$.\n$\\frac{T_{\\text{eq1}}}{T_{\\text{eq2}}} = \\frac{T_{\\text{star}} \\left( \\frac{R_{\\text{star}}}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{\\text{star}} \\left( \\frac{R_{\\text{star}}}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, $T_{\\text{star}}$ and $R_{\\text{star}}$ are the same for both. The problem also states that the albedos are the same ($A_1 = A_2$). Therefore, most terms cancel out:\n$\\frac{T_{\\text{eq1}}}{T_{\\text{eq2}}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^{1/2}$\n\nNow, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, $a_2/a_1$. We can determine this from the radial velocity (RV) data. The maximum RV shift, or semi-amplitude (K), is related to the maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) by the formula $K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$, where $c$ is the speed of light and $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line. Since $c$ and $\\lambda_0$ are constant, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude of the star is given by:\n$K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_{\\text{star}}^{2/3}}$\nwhere P is the orbital period, $M_p$ is the planet mass, $M_{\\text{star}}$ is the star mass, and $i$ is the orbital inclination.\nUsing Kepler's Third Law ($P^2 \\propto a^3/M_{\\text{star}}$), we can write the period as $P = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{a^3}{G(M_{\\text{star}}+M_p)}}$. Since $M_p \\ll M_{\\text{star}}$, we can approximate this as $P \\approx 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{a^3}{GM_{\\text{star}}}}$.\nSubstituting this into the equation for K:\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_{\\text{star}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{GM_{\\text{star}}}{a}}$\nSince both planets were detected by the transit method, their orbits must be viewed nearly edge-on, so we can assume the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ and $\\sin i \\approx 1$.\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_{\\text{star}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{GM_{\\text{star}}}{a}} = \\frac{M_p \\sqrt{G}}{\\sqrt{M_{\\text{star}} a}}$\n\nNow we can set up a ratio for the semi-major axes. From the equation above, we can see that $a \\propto (\\frac{M_p}{K})^2$.\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{(M_{p2}/K_2)^2}{(M_{p1}/K_1)^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\nWe are given the following information:\n- $M_{p1} = 7 M_{\\text{Earth}}$\n- $M_{p2} = 5 M_{\\text{Earth}}$\n- $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n- $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nSubstitute these values into the equation for the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\nFinally, we can find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n$\\frac{T_{\\text{eq1}}}{T_{\\text{eq2}}} = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<A>>>"
