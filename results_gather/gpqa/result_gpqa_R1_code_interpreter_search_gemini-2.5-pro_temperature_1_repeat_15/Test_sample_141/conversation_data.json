    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the geometrical position of the given density matrix in the qubit space (Bloch sphere).\n\n1.  **Understand the Density Matrix:**\n    The given density matrix is:\n    $\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$\n    This represents a quantum state that is an equal statistical mixture of the basis state $|0\\rangle$ and the basis state $|1\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Bloch Sphere Representation:**\n    Any single-qubit density matrix $\\rho$ can be represented as a point inside or on the surface of a three-dimensional unit sphere called the Bloch sphere. This representation is given by the formula:\n    $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n    where:\n    *   $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n    *   $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrices.\n    *   $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$ is the Bloch vector, which represents the geometrical position of the state in the Bloch sphere. The origin of the sphere corresponds to $\\vec{r}=(0,0,0)$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Bloch Vector:**\n    The components of the Bloch vector $\\vec{r}$ can be calculated from the density matrix using the formula:\n    $r_i = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_i)$, where $i$ can be $x, y,$ or $z$.\n\n4.  **Matrix Formulation:**\n    First, let's write the density matrix $\\rho$ in its matrix form. The basis states and Pauli matrices are:\n    $|0\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $|1\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $|0\\rangle\\langle0| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $|1\\rangle\\langle1| = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    Substituting these into the expression for $\\rho$:\n    $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2}I$\n    This is the density matrix for the maximally mixed state.\n\n5.  **Compute the Components of the Bloch Vector:**\n    Now we use the Pauli matrices to find the components of $\\vec{r}$:\n    $\\sigma_x = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $\\sigma_y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $\\sigma_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    *   $r_x = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_x) = \\text{Tr}\\left( \\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_x \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2}(0+0) = 0$\n    *   $r_y = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_y) = \\text{Tr}\\left( \\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_y \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2}(0+0) = 0$\n    *   $r_z = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_z) = \\text{Tr}\\left( \\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_z \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2}(1-1) = 0$\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculated Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$. This point corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere.\n\nAn alternative intuitive approach:\n*   The pure state $|0\\rangle$ is at the north pole of the Bloch sphere, with Bloch vector $\\vec{r}_{|0\\rangle} = (0, 0, 1)$.\n*   The pure state $|1\\rangle$ is at the south pole of the Bloch sphere, with Bloch vector $\\vec{r}_{|1\\rangle} = (0, 0, -1)$.\n*   The density matrix $\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}|0\\rangle\\langle0| + \\frac{1}{2}|1\\rangle\\langle1|$ represents an incoherent mixture of these two states with equal probability (1/2 each).\n*   The Bloch vector of a mixture is the weighted average of the Bloch vectors of the constituent states.\n*   Therefore, $\\vec{r} = \\frac{1}{2}\\vec{r}_{|0\\rangle} + \\frac{1}{2}\\vec{r}_{|1\\rangle} = \\frac{1}{2}(0,0,1) + \\frac{1}{2}(0,0,-1) = (0,0,\\frac{1}{2}) + (0,0,-\\frac{1}{2}) = (0,0,0)$.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the geometrical position is r=(0,0,0).\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) r=(0,0,1) - This is the pure state $|0\\rangle$.\nB) r=(1,1,1) - This is not a valid physical state as its length is $\\sqrt{3} > 1$.\nC) r=(1,1,0) - This is not a valid physical state as its length is $\\sqrt{2} > 1$.\nD) r=(0,0,0) - This matches our calculation for the maximally mixed state.\n\n<<<D>>>"
