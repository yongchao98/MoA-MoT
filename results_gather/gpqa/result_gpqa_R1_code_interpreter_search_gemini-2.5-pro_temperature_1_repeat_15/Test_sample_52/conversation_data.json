    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data to Deduce Structural Fragments**\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** The presence of absorption peaks for an ester group indicates the molecule contains a `-COO-` functional group. An ester group contains one carbon and two oxygen atoms.\n\n*   **Compound Type:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This implies a benzene ring (`C6H6`) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by two substituent groups. The core of the molecule is therefore a `C6H4` fragment.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** A di-substituted benzene ring can be ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4) substituted. A para-substituted ring is symmetrical, which would result in two distinct signals for the four aromatic protons (two sets of two equivalent protons, appearing as two doublets). This is the simplest pattern that fits the \"two signals\" description. We can assume a `p-C6H4` fragment. This fragment accounts for 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens.\n    *   **Vinyl-H (2 signals: one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is highly characteristic of a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n        *   Let's label the protons: `R-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3`.\n        *   Proton H(b) is adjacent to one vinyl proton H(a) (giving a doublet) and three methyl protons (giving a quartet). The combined splitting results in a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n        *   Proton H(a) is adjacent only to vinyl proton H(b). This results in a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   This confirms the presence of a `-CH=CH-CH3` fragment, which contains 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens.\n    *   **–CH₃ Groups (2 signals):**\n        *   One signal corresponds to the methyl group in the propenyl fragment (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n        *   The second signal corresponds to another methyl group.\n    *   **No –CH₂ Groups:** The spectrum shows a complete absence of signals for methylene (`-CH2-`) groups. This is a crucial piece of information that eliminates many possible structures (e.g., those with ethyl, propyl, or allyl groups). The second methyl group must be attached to an atom with no hydrogens, such as the aromatic ring, a carbonyl carbon (`-CO-CH3`), or an ester oxygen (`-O-CH3`).\n\n**2. Assemble the Fragments into a Plausible Structure**\n\nWe have the following pieces:\n*   A para-substituted benzene ring: `p-C6H4`\n*   A propenyl group: `-CH=CH-CH3`\n*   An ester group: `-COO-`\n*   A second methyl group: `-CH3`\n\nLet's combine them. The two substituents on the benzene ring must be the propenyl group and a group containing the ester and the second methyl group. There are two primary ways to arrange this:\n\n*   **Structure 1 (Methyl ester):** The substituents are `-CH=CH-CH3` and `-COOCH3`. The full structure is methyl p-(propenyl)benzoate.\n*   **Structure 2 (Phenyl ester):** The substituents are `-CH=CH-CH3` and `-O-CO-CH3`. The full structure is p-(propenyl)phenyl acetate.\n\n**3. Determine the Chemical Formula**\n\nLet's count the atoms for either of these valid structures (they will have the same formula):\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from -CH=CH-CH₃) + 1 (from -COO-) + 1 (from the second -CH₃) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from -CH=CH-CH₃) + 3 (from the second -CH₃) = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from -COO-) = **2**\n\nThe chemical formula derived from the spectroscopic data is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n**4. Compare with Options and Use Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n\nThe derived formula, C₁₁H₁₂O₂, matches option A. Let's use the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to verify our choice and eliminate other options.\n\nThe DoU for a formula `CxHyOz` is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n*   Our proposed structure has a benzene ring (DoU=4), a C=C double bond (DoU=1), and a C=O double bond (DoU=1). Total DoU = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the given options:\n*   A) **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**. (Matches)\n*   B) **C₁₂H₁₄O₂**: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = **6**. (Matches)\n*   C) **C₁₁H₁₄O₂**: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5. (Incorrect DoU, eliminated)\n*   D) **C₁₂H₁₂O₂**: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7. (Incorrect DoU, eliminated)\n\nWe are left with options A (C₁₁H₁₂O₂) and B (C₁₂H₁₄O₂). The difference between these two formulas is one carbon and two hydrogens (`CH₂`). However, the problem explicitly states there are **no signals for –CH₂ groups**. Therefore, the correct formula cannot be C₁₂H₁₄O₂, as it would require adding a CH₂ unit to the structure we logically deduced (C₁₁H₁₂O₂).\n\nThe only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>"
