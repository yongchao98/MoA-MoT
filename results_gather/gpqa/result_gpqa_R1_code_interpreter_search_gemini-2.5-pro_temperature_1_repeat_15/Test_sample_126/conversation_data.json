    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product formed when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant and Reaction Conditions**\n\n*   **Reactant:** The starting molecule is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. Let's first draw its structure based on the IUPAC name.\n    *   \"nona\" indicates a 9-carbon parent chain.\n    *   \"-2,6-diene\" indicates double bonds starting at carbon 2 and carbon 6.\n    *   \"5-butyl\" indicates a butyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃) is attached to carbon 5.\n\n    The structure is:\n    ```\n        CH₃(1)-CH(2)=CH(3)-CH₂(4)-CH(5)-CH(6)=CH(7)-CH₂(8)-CH₃(9)\n                                  |\n                                  CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃ (butyl group)\n    ```\n\n*   **Reaction Condition:** The molecule is heated. Heating organic molecules, especially those with conjugated or nearby pi systems, often induces pericyclic reactions.\n\n**2. Identify the Type of Pericyclic Reaction**\n\n*   We need to examine the structure of the reactant for patterns that suggest a specific pericyclic reaction. The most common pericyclic reactions are cycloadditions, electrocyclic reactions, and sigmatropic rearrangements.\n*   Let's look for a hexa-1,5-diene system, which is the substrate for a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement known as the **Cope Rearrangement**. A 1,5-diene has the general structure `C=C-C-C-C=C`.\n*   In our molecule, 5-butylnona-2,6-diene, let's trace the carbon chain from one double bond to the other. The double bonds are at `C2=C3` and `C6=C7`. The chain connecting them is `C3-C4-C5-C6`.\n*   The sequence of atoms `C2=C3-C4-C5-C6=C7` forms a hexa-1,5-diene system (a 6-carbon chain with double bonds at positions 1 and 5 if we renumber it for the reaction). This is a perfect substrate for a Cope rearrangement.\n\n**3. Apply the Mechanism of the Cope Rearrangement**\n\n*   The Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic shift. In the system `C(a)=C(b)-C(c) — C(d)-C(e)=C(f)`, the following bond changes occur in a concerted manner through a cyclic six-membered transition state:\n    1.  The sigma bond between C(c) and C(d) breaks.\n    2.  A new sigma bond between C(a) and C(f) forms.\n    3.  The pi bond from `C(a)=C(b)` shifts to `C(b)=C(c)`.\n    4.  The pi bond from `C(e)=C(f)` shifts to `C(d)=C(e)`.\n\n*   Let's apply this to our molecule's `C2=C3-C4-C5-C6=C7` system:\n    *   `C(a)=C2`, `C(b)=C3`, `C(c)=C4`\n    *   `C(d)=C5`, `C(e)=C6`, `C(f)=C7`\n    1.  The `C4-C5` sigma bond breaks.\n    2.  A new sigma bond forms between `C2` and `C7`.\n    3.  The `C2=C3` pi bond moves to form a new `C3=C4` double bond.\n    4.  The `C6=C7` pi bond moves to form a new `C5=C6` double bond.\n\n**4. Determine the Structure of the Product and its IUPAC Name**\n\n*   Let's trace the connectivity of the resulting molecule. The original 9-carbon chain is broken and reassembled.\n    *   The fragment `CH₃(C1)-C2-C3-C4` is now `CH₃(C1)-C2-C3=C4`.\n    *   The fragment `C5-C6=C7-C8-C9` (with the butyl group on C5) is now `(Butyl)-C5=C6-C7-C8-C9`.\n    *   A new bond connects `C2` and `C7`.\n\n*   Let's sketch the product structure, keeping track of all groups:\n    *   Original C1 (methyl) is attached to C2.\n    *   Original C8-C9 (ethyl) is attached to C7.\n    *   Original butyl group is attached to C5.\n\n    The resulting structure is:\n    `H₂C(4)=C(3)H-C(2)H(CH₃)-C(7)H(CH₂CH₃)-C(6)H=C(5)H-(CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃)`\n\n*   Now, we must name this product according to IUPAC rules:\n    1.  **Find the longest parent chain** containing the maximum number of double bonds. The chain `C4-C3-C2-C7-C6-C5` contains both double bonds. We can extend this from C5 into the butyl group. The longest such chain is `C4-C3-C2-C7-C6-C5-butyl(4C)`, which is 10 carbons long.\n    2.  **Number the parent chain** to give the double bonds the lowest possible locants.\n        *   Numbering from the C4 end: `C(1)H₂=C(2)H-C(3)H-C(4)H-C(5)H=C(6)H-...` The double bonds are at positions 1 and 5. The name is **deca-1,5-diene**.\n        *   Numbering from the butyl end: The double bonds would be at positions 5 and 9 (`deca-5,9-diene`).\n        *   Since `(1,5)` is a lower set of locants than `(5,9)`, we use the first numbering scheme.\n    3.  **Identify and locate the substituents.**\n        *   On C3 of our new chain (which was the original C2), there is a methyl group (original C1). So, we have a **3-methyl** substituent.\n        *   On C4 of our new chain (which was the original C7), there is an ethyl group (original C8-C9). So, we have a **4-ethyl** substituent.\n    4.  **Assemble the full name** in alphabetical order of substituents.\n        The name is **4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene**.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nComparing our derived name with the options provided:\nA) 5-ethylundeca-2,6-diene\nB) 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene\nC) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\nD) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\n\nThe calculated product name matches option B exactly.\n\n<<<B>>>"
