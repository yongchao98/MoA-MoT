    "To determine which of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to assess whether each molecule is chiral and not a meso compound. A molecule is optically active if it is chiral and present as a single enantiomer or in an enantioenriched mixture. The naming of the compounds often provides crucial clues about their stereochemistry.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   Structure: `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`\n    *   A molecule is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common source of chirality is a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n    *   In this molecule, there are no chiral centers.\n    *   The molecule has a double bond. The atoms Cl, H, C1, C2, the carbon of the methyl group, and the first carbon of the ethyl group all lie in the same plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule.\n    *   Since the molecule possesses a plane of symmetry, it is achiral and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   This is a complex bicyclic molecule. The name itself provides the key information.\n    *   The descriptors `(3aR,7aS)` specify the absolute configuration at two chiral centers (the bridgehead carbons).\n    *   Naming a compound with specific R/S descriptors means that we are referring to a single, specific stereoisomer.\n    *   Unless this specific stereoisomer happens to be a meso compound (which is not the case here, as the `(R,S)` combination in this specific ring system does not lead to a plane or center of symmetry), it is a single enantiomer.\n    *   A pure sample of a single enantiomer is chiral and **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   Structure: `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    *   This molecule has two chiral centers, at C2 and C3.\n    *   The stereoisomer is specified as `(2R,3S)`. When a molecule has two chiral centers with opposite configurations (R,S) and the groups attached to these centers are the same (here, both centers are attached to H, CH3, COOH, and the other chiral carbon group), we must check if it is a meso compound.\n    *   A meso compound is an achiral compound that has chiral centers. It possesses an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, which makes it superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   The (2R,3S) isomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is a classic example of a meso compound. It has a center of symmetry when in the anti-periplanar conformation.\n    *   Since it is a meso compound, it is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   The configuration is `(2R,3R)`. This isomer does not have any internal plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n    *   Its mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer, and they are non-superimposable (they are enantiomers).\n    *   The name refers to a single enantiomer, which is chiral. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   Structure: A six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an OH group at C1.\n    *   The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, the ring segment -CH2-CH=, and the ring segment -CH2-CH2-CH=. These two paths around the ring are different, so C1 is a chiral center.\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` configuration, meaning it is a single enantiomer.\n    *   As a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with OH groups at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   The notation `(1s,3s,5s)` is unusual, but in this context, it implies a symmetrical arrangement where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   Let's visualize the molecule with all three OH groups pointing \"up\" from the average plane of the ring. This molecule has a threefold axis of rotation (C3) and, more importantly, three planes of symmetry. Each plane of symmetry passes through one C-OH group and the C-H group on the opposite side of the ring (e.g., C1 and C4).\n    *   The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   The name describes a ketone where the carbonyl group is bonded to a cyclopentyl group and a 3-methylbutyl (isobutyl) group.\n    *   Structure: `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-(C5H9)` where C5H9 is a cyclopentyl ring.\n    *   Let's search for chiral centers. The carbon atom in the `CH(CH3)2` group is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not chiral. There are no other potential chiral centers in the chain or in the unsubstituted cyclopentyl ring.\n    *   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that contains the `C=O`, `CH2`, and `CH` groups and bisects the cyclopentyl ring.\n    *   Due to this plane of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>"
