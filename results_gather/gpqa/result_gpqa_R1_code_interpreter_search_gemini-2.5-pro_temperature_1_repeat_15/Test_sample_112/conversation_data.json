    "*   **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Spectroscopic Data:**\n    *   **FTIR Spectroscopy:**\n        *   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding. While alcohols also have O-H stretches, they are typically less broad than those of carboxylic acids.\n        *   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This falls squarely in the absorption range for a carbonyl (C=O) group. The combination of this peak with the broad O-H peak strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n        *   **Strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This is the characteristic absorption region for a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), indicating an alkene.\n\n    *   **1H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n        *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** This is definitive proof of a C=C double bond. Vinyl hydrogens are those directly attached to the carbons of the double bond.\n\n    *   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n        *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment. We need to identify a common fragment with this mass-to-charge ratio. The most likely candidate is the carboxyl group cation, [COOH]⁺.\n            *   Mass of [COOH]⁺ = 12 (for C) + 16 (for O) + 16 (for O) + 1 (for H) = 45.\n        *   This fragmentation pattern provides strong confirmation for the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n\n2.  **Synthesize the Structural Features:**\n    *   From the combined data, we can conclude that the unknown compound is a **carboxylic acid** that also contains an **alkene (C=C double bond)**.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Candidate Formulas using the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is: DoU = C - (H/2) + 1 (for a formula containing only C, H, and O).\n    *   Our identified structure must have at least two degrees of unsaturation: one for the C=O in the carboxylic acid and one for the C=C of the alkene. So, we are looking for a formula with DoU = 2.\n    *   The structure must also have two oxygen atoms to be a carboxylic acid.\n\n4.  **Calculate DoU and check the oxygen count for each option:**\n    *   **A) C6H12O:**\n        *   Oxygens = 1 (not a carboxylic acid).\n        *   DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 1. This is inconsistent with the required DoU of 2.\n\n    *   **B) C6H10O:**\n        *   Oxygens = 1 (not a carboxylic acid).\n        *   DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 2. The DoU is correct, but it lacks the second oxygen for the -COOH group.\n\n    *   **C) C6H10O2:**\n        *   Oxygens = 2 (consistent with a carboxylic acid).\n        *   DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 2. This is consistent with one C=O and one C=C bond.\n        *   This formula perfectly matches all the spectroscopic evidence.\n\n    *   **D) C6H12O2:**\n        *   Oxygens = 2 (consistent with a carboxylic acid).\n        *   DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 1. This DoU corresponds to a saturated carboxylic acid (only one pi bond in the C=O). It cannot also contain a C=C double bond, which contradicts the FTIR and NMR data.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The only formula that accommodates a carboxylic acid group (2 oxygens, DoU=1) and an alkene group (DoU=1) for a total DoU of 2 is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
