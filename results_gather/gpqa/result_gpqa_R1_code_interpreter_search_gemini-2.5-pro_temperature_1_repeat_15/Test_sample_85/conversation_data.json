    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is a stereoisomer of **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**. Let's break down this name to understand its structure.\n*   **Pyran**: A six-membered heterocyclic ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **Tetrahydro**: The ring is fully saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **-2-one**: A carbonyl group (C=O) is at the C2 position of the ring. By convention, the oxygen atom is at position 1. This makes the molecule a cyclic ester, specifically a **lactone**.\n*   **delta-Lactone**: Because it's a six-membered ring lactone, it is also known as a delta-lactone.\n*   **4-ethyl**: An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to the C4 position of the ring.\n*   **(R) or (S)**: This refers to the stereochemistry at the chiral center, which is the C4 carbon atom bearing the ethyl group.\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n      O=C(2)---C(3)H2\n       /         \\\n     O(1)         C(4)H-Et\n       \\         /\n      C(6)H2---C(5)H2\n```\nThis delta-lactone is formed by the intramolecular cyclization (esterification) of a **delta-hydroxy acid** (a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid).\n\nLet's determine the structure of the open-chain hydroxy acid precursor by conceptually breaking the ester bond (O1-C2). The C2 carbonyl becomes a carboxylic acid (-COOH), and the O1 atom (which is attached to C6) becomes a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n\nThe resulting open-chain precursor is:\n**HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)OH**\n\nThis molecule is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**. The stereocenter at C3 of this acid corresponds to the stereocenter at C4 of the lactone. The cyclization reaction does not affect the stereocenter's configuration.\n\nTherefore:\n*   (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is formed from (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n*   (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is formed from (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials and Reagents**\n\nThe starting materials (A and B) are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. Although the IUPAC name is slightly unconventional, it describes a derivative of pentanedioic acid (glutaric acid) where one carboxylic acid group is converted into an isobutyl ester.\n\nThe structure is:\n**HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu** (where iBu = isobutyl, -CH2CH(CH3)2)\n\nThis starting material has two different carbonyl functional groups:\n*   A carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n*   An ester (-COO-iBu)\n\nThe reactions use two different reducing agents with different selectivities:\n\n*   **LiBH4 (Lithium borohydride)**: This is a selective reducing agent. It reduces esters, aldehydes, and ketones, but it reduces carboxylic acids very slowly. Therefore, in a molecule with both an ester and a carboxylic acid, LiBH4 will preferentially reduce the **ester**.\n*   **BH3 (Borane)**: This reagent is highly selective for reducing **carboxylic acids**. It reduces them much faster than it reduces esters.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH4 selectively reduces the ester group.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The ester group (-COO-iBu) of starting material A is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is not affected.\n    2.  This forms the intermediate, 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n        HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu  --[LiBH4]--> HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH\n    3.  The acid workup (H+) protonates any intermediates and catalyzes the cyclization of the hydroxy acid to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions occur at the functional groups (C1 and C5) and do not involve the stereocenter at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry is retained throughout the process. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH3 selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) of starting material B is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH). The ester group (-COO-iBu) is not affected.\n    2.  This forms the intermediate, isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n        HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu  --[BH3]--> HOCH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu\n    3.  The acid workup (H+) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed -OH group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol (iBuOH) to form the final lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in Reaction 1, the reactions do not affect the stereocenter at C3. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A must be the **(R)** enantiomer.\n*   Starting material B must be the **(S)** enantiomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
