    "This is a classic problem of radioactive decay, which follows an exponential distribution. The key property of this distribution is that it is \"memoryless\". This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval does not depend on how long it has already survived.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Define the Survival Probability:** Let P(t) be the probability that the atom has *not* decayed by time `t`. This is also known as the survival function. For radioactive decay, this is given by the formula:\n    P(t) = e^(-λt)\n    where `λ` is the decay constant.\n\n2.  **Use the Given Information to find λ:** We are told that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%.\n    *   Probability of decay within 100 minutes = 1 - P(100) = 0.32\n    *   This means the probability of *survival* after 100 minutes is P(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n    *   Using the formula: 0.68 = e^(-λ * 100).\n\n3.  **Formulate the Question:** We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\n    *   Let T be the time of decay. We want to find the conditional probability: P(T < 50 + 150 | T > 50), which simplifies to P(T < 200 | T > 50).\n\n4.  **Apply the Memoryless Property:** For an exponential distribution, the probability of an event occurring in the next time interval `Δt` is independent of how much time `t` has already passed.\n    *   P(T < t + Δt | T > t) = P(T < Δt)\n    *   In our case, `t = 50` minutes and the future interval `Δt = 150` minutes.\n    *   Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the probability that a *new* atom will decay within 150 minutes.\n    *   Required Probability = 1 - P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150).\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Probability:** We don't need to calculate `λ` explicitly. We can use the relationship we found in step 2.\n    *   We know: e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68\n    *   We can rewrite this as: (e^(-λ))^100 = 0.68\n    *   This gives us: e^(-λ) = 0.68^(1/100)\n    *   Now, we can find the survival probability for 150 minutes:\n        P(150) = e^(-λ * 150) = (e^(-λ))^150 = (0.68^(1/100))^150 = 0.68^(150/100) = 0.68^1.5\n    *   The probability of decay within 150 minutes is 1 - P(150) = 1 - 0.68^1.5.\n\nNow, we perform the final calculation.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem simplifies to finding the probability of decay in 150 minutes.\n# This probability is given by 1 - (survival_probability_at_100_mins)^(150/100)\n# Survival probability at 100 mins is 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\ndecay_prob = 1 - (0.68 ** 1.5)\n\nprint(decay_prob)\n```\n\nThe calculated probability is approximately 0.440. In percentage terms, this is 44%.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem deals with radioactive decay, which is governed by the exponential distribution. A key characteristic of this distribution is its \"memoryless\" property. This means the probability of an event (decay) occurring in a future time interval is independent of how long the atom has already survived.\n\n**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**\n\n1.  **Define the Survival Probability:** Let `S(t)` be the probability that the atom survives (does not decay) for a time `t`. The formula for this is `S(t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n\n2.  **Use the Given Data:** We are told the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    *   Probability of Decay = `1 - S(100) = 0.32`\n    *   Therefore, the probability of survival for 100 minutes is `S(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n    *   So, we have the equation: `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Question:** We need to find the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\n    *   Let `T` be the time of decay. We are looking for the conditional probability `P(T < 50 + 150 | T > 50)`.\n\n4.  **Apply the Memoryless Property:** Because radioactive decay is a memoryless process, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes has no impact on its future decay probability.\n    *   `P(T < 50 + 150 | T > 50) = P(T < 150)`\n    *   This means the problem is simplified to finding the probability that a new atom would decay within 150 minutes.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Probability:** We need to calculate the probability of decay within 150 minutes, which is `1 - S(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`.\n    *   We can find the value of `e^(-λ * 150)` from our equation in Step 2:\n        *   `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`\n        *   Take the `1/100` power of both sides: `e^(-λ) = 0.68^(1/100)`\n        *   Now, raise both sides to the power of `150`: `(e^(-λ))^150 = (0.68^(1/100))^150`\n        *   This simplifies to: `e^(-λ * 150) = 0.68^(150/100) = 0.68^1.5`\n\n    *   Now we can calculate the survival probability for 150 minutes:\n        *   `S(150) = 0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`\n\n    *   The probability of decay within 150 minutes is:\n        *   `1 - S(150) = 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 0.4393, which is 43.93%. This rounds to 44%.\n\n<<<B>>>"
