    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride.\n*   **Reaction:** This is an α-halogenation of a carboxylic acid. While the classic Hell-Vollhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction uses PBr3/Br2, the use of bromine with a base (pyridine) and an activator (acetic anhydride might form a mixed anhydride to facilitate enolization) achieves the same outcome: bromination at the alpha-carbon.\n*   **Product 1:** Acetic acid has one α-carbon (the methyl group). One of the α-hydrogens is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   Product 1 is **α-bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH)**.\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid reacts with the alcohol in the presence of a strong acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** The -OH of the carboxyl group is replaced by the -OCH2CH3 group from ethanol.\n    *   Product 2 is **ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3)**.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (BrCH2COOCH2CH3) and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile, and it displaces the bromide ion (Br⁻), which is a good leaving group, from the primary carbon.\n*   **Product 3:** The bromine atom is replaced by a cyano group.\n    *   Product 3 is **ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3)**.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Final Product 4**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (NCCH2COOCH2CH3), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Reaction:**\n    1.  Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate. The hydrogens on this carbon are acidic because the resulting carbanion is stabilized by resonance with both the adjacent cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups.\n        `NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → Na⁺[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + H₂`\n    2.  The resulting enolate anion is a strong nucleophile. It attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction, displacing a bromide ion.\n        `[NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)₅-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)₅-Br + Br⁻`\n    3.  The intermediate product still has an acidic α-hydrogen. Since \"excess\" NaH is used, this proton is also removed, creating a new carbanion.\n        `NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)₅-Br + NaH → Na⁺[NC-C(COOEt)-(CH2)₅-Br]⁻ + H₂`\n    4.  This carbanion can now undergo an intramolecular SN2 reaction. The nucleophilic carbon attacks the carbon at the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion. This type of reaction is highly favorable when it forms a stable 5- or 6-membered ring. In this case, the chain `C-(CH2)₅-Br` consists of 6 carbons, leading to the formation of a 6-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group and an ethyl carboxylate group attached to the same carbon.\n    *   Product 4 is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n**Step 5: 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\n*   **Structure:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n    ```\n          CN\n          |\n     ---- C ---- COOCH₂CH₃\n    /    |    \\\n   CH₂ - CH₂ - CH₂\n   |           |\n   CH₂ - CH₂ ---\n    ```\n*   **Symmetry and Signal Counting:** To determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n    *   The carbon atom C1 (the one bonded to both -CN and -COOEt) is a chiral center, as it is attached to four different groups. This lack of symmetry means that corresponding protons on opposite sides of the ring are not chemically equivalent.\n    *   However, in introductory/intermediate level problems, it is common to make a simplifying assumption: if two groups are sterically and electronically similar (like -CN and -COOEt), the molecule can be treated as if it has a plane of symmetry for the purpose of counting NMR signals.\n    *   Let's apply this simplification. We assume an effective plane of symmetry that passes through C1 and C4 of the cyclohexane ring.\n    *   This plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to the protons on C6, and the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C5.\n*   **Counting the Signals with the Symmetry Assumption:**\n    1.  **Ethyl -CH₃:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent. **1 signal**.\n    2.  **Ethyl -OCH₂-:** The plane of symmetry makes the two methylene protons equivalent. **1 signal**.\n    3.  **Ring C2 & C6:** These two CH₂ groups are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, within each CH₂ group, the two protons (one axial, one equatorial in the chair conformation) are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. This gives **2 signals**.\n    4.  **Ring C3 & C5:** These two CH₂ groups are equivalent. The two protons within each group are diastereotopic. This gives another **2 signals**.\n    5.  **Ring C4:** This CH₂ group is unique as it lies on the plane of symmetry. Its two protons are diastereotopic (one \"above\" and one \"below\" the ring's average plane). This gives **2 signals**.\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    Adding them up: 1 (from -CH₃) + 1 (from -OCH₂-) + 2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) + 2 (from C4) = **8 distinct hydrogen signals**.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
