    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene, which is achiral and symmetrically substituted (a propyl group on each side of the double bond).\n    ```\n        H       CH2CH2CH3\n         \\     /\n          C = C\n         /     \\\n    CH3CH2CH2   H\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n        *   Reacting a trans-alkene with a syn-addition reagent results in a racemic mixture of trans-epoxides.\n        *   The attack of mCPBA can happen from the top face or the bottom face of the planar alkene with equal probability.\n        *   This produces a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-4,5-dipropyloxirane and (4S,5S)-4,5-dipropyloxirane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reagent performs an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. This reaction proceeds via a backside attack by a water molecule (SN2-type mechanism), resulting in an *anti*-addition of two hydroxyl (-OH) groups.\n\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step sequence (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) is a standard method for the *anti*-dihydroxylation of an alkene.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 1:**\n    *   We are performing an *anti*-addition on a *trans*-alkene.\n    *   A useful mnemonic for stereochemistry is: **trans + anti = meso**.\n    *   Therefore, the product of Reaction 1 is a single meso compound: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. A meso compound is achiral despite having chiral centers because it possesses an internal element of symmetry (like a plane or center of inversion).\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene, which is also achiral and symmetrically substituted.\n    ```\n        H           H\n         \\         /\n          C = C\n         /         \\\n    CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The same as in Reaction 1 (mCPBA, then H₃O⁺).\n\n*   **Overall Transformation:** This is also an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 2:**\n    *   We are performing an *anti*-addition on a *cis*-alkene.\n    *   The corresponding mnemonic is: **cis + anti = racemic**.\n    *   Therefore, the product of Reaction 2 is a racemic mixture, which is a 50:50 mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,4R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the meso compound, let's call it **M**) from Reaction 1.\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (one enantiomer, let's call it **E1**) from Reaction 2.\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the other enantiomer, let's call it **E2**) from Reaction 2.\n\nThe relationships between these isomers are:\n*   **E1** and **E2** are enantiomers of each other.\n*   **M** is a diastereomer of **E1**.\n*   **M** is also a diastereomer of **E2**.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\nThe combined mixture of M, E1, and E2 is analyzed using two types of HPLC.\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n    *   Achiral columns separate compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers** (like E1 and E2) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by an achiral column and will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers** (like M and the E1/E2 pair) have different physical properties. They will interact differently with the stationary phase and will be separated into different peaks.\n    *   **Conclusion for standard HPLC:** We will observe two peaks.\n        *   Peak 1: The meso compound (M).\n        *   Peak 2: The unresolved racemic mixture of enantiomers (E1 + E2).\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral columns have a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment.\n    *   In a chiral environment, **enantiomers** (E1 and E2) interact differently with the stationary phase (forming transient diastereomeric complexes of different stabilities). This allows for their separation into two distinct peaks.\n    *   The **meso compound** (M), being a diastereomer of E1 and E2, will also have a different retention time and elute as a separate peak.\n    *   **Conclusion for chiral HPLC:** All three stereoisomers will be resolved. We will observe three peaks.\n        *   Peak 1: The meso compound (M).\n        *   Peak 2: One enantiomer (E1).\n        *   Peak 3: The other enantiomer (E2).\n\n### **Final Summary**\n\n*   **Standard HPLC:** 2 peaks.\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 3 peaks.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
