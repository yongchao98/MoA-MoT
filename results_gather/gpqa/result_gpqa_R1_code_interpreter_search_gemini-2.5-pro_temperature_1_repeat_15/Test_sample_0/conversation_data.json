    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle:** The problem connects the lifetime of a quantum state to its energy. This relationship is described by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n2.  **State the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in a particle's energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in the time interval over which the energy is measured (Δt) is greater than or equal to a constant value. Mathematically:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h / 2π).\n\n3.  **Apply the Principle to the Problem:**\n    *   For a quantum state with a finite lifetime (τ), the lifetime can be taken as the uncertainty in time (Δt = τ).\n    *   The uncertainty in the energy (ΔE) represents the \"energy width\" or \"natural linewidth\" of the energy level. A state doesn't have an infinitely sharp energy value; it's spread out over a range ΔE.\n    *   The minimum uncertainty in energy is given by ΔE ≈ ħ / τ.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Uncertainty for Each State:**\n    *   First, we need the value of the reduced Planck constant (ħ) in units of electron-volts times seconds (eV·s), as the final options are in eV.\n    *   ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n    *   **For state 1:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s.\n        *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n    *   **For state 2:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s.\n        *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV.\n\n5.  **Determine the Condition for \"Clearly Resolving\" the States:**\n    *   To distinguish two energy levels, the difference in their central energies (|E₁ - E₂|) must be larger than their energy widths. If the energy difference is smaller than the widths, the energy levels will overlap too much to be seen as separate.\n    *   A common criterion for resolution (the Rayleigh criterion for spectroscopy) is that the energy separation must be at least as large as the total width of the two levels combined, or at the very least, larger than the wider of the two energy levels.\n    *   The total width is ΔE_total = ΔE₁ + ΔE₂.\n    *   The wider level is the one with the shorter lifetime (state 1), so its width is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   Therefore, for the levels to be clearly resolved, the energy difference |E₁ - E₂| must be significantly greater than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n6.  **Compare the Required Energy Difference with the Given Options:**\n    *   We need |E₁ - E₂| > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   Let's check the options:\n        *   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is much smaller than 10⁻⁷ eV.\n        *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is smaller than 10⁻⁷ eV.\n        *   C) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is much larger than 10⁻⁷ eV (10⁻⁴ = 1000 x 10⁻⁷).\n        *   D) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is smaller than 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** Only option C provides an energy separation that is substantially larger than the energy uncertainty of the broader state. This large separation ensures that the two energy levels do not significantly overlap and can be clearly distinguished.\n\nI can use a python script to formalize the calculation.\n```python\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nhbar_eVs = 6.582119569e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states\ntau1 = 1e-9  # seconds\ntau2 = 1e-8  # seconds\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (ΔE ≈ ħ/τ)\ndelta_E1 = hbar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = hbar_eVs / tau2\n\n# To resolve the two levels, the energy difference between them must be greater than their linewidths.\n# The dominant (larger) linewidth comes from the shorter lifetime.\n# A good criterion is that the separation should be greater than the sum of the linewidths.\nrequired_separation = delta_E1 + delta_E2\n\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty of state 1 (ΔE1): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty of state 2 (ΔE2): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"The required energy difference should be greater than the larger uncertainty, ΔE1 = {delta_E1:.3e} eV.\")\nprint(f\"A more stringent condition is that the difference should be greater than the sum of uncertainties, ΔE1 + ΔE2 = {required_separation:.3e} eV.\")\n\n# Given options\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1e-11,\n    \"B\": 1e-9,\n    \"C\": 1e-4,\n    \"D\": 1e-8\n}\n\nprint(\"\\nComparing with options:\")\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    if value > required_separation:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is a possible energy difference as it is greater than {required_separation:.3e} eV.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is NOT a possible energy difference as it is less than {required_separation:.3e} eV.\")\n\n```\n<<<C>>>",
    "The user wants me to solve a physics problem about resolving two quantum energy levels.\n\n1.  **Identify the core concept:** The problem relates the lifetime of a quantum state to its energy. This is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n2.  **State the principle:** The principle is ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. In this context, the lifetime (τ) of a state is the uncertainty in time (Δt), and the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) is the natural linewidth of the energy level. So, the minimum energy width is ΔE ≈ ħ/τ.\n\n3.  **Calculate the energy width for each state:**\n    *   I need the value of the reduced Planck constant, ħ, in units of eV·s. From my knowledge base, ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n    *   For state 1: τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s.\n        *   ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   For state 2: τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s.\n        *   ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV.\n\n4.  **Define the condition for \"clearly resolved\":** For two energy levels to be clearly distinguished or \"resolved,\" the difference between their central energies, |E₁ - E₂|, must be significantly larger than their energy widths. If the energy difference is smaller than the widths, the two levels will overlap so much that they appear as a single, broader level. A common rule of thumb (similar to the Rayleigh criterion in optics) is that the separation must be at least on the order of the sum of the individual widths (ΔE₁ + ΔE₂), or at the very least, larger than the broader of the two widths.\n    *   The broader width is ΔE₁, which is approximately 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   The sum of the widths is ΔE₁ + ΔE₂ ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV + 0.66 x 10⁻⁷ eV ≈ 7.26 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   Therefore, the required energy difference must be |E₁ - E₂| >> 7.26 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the given options:**\n    *   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is much smaller than 7.26 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is much smaller than 7.26 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   C) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is much larger than 7.26 x 10⁻⁷ eV (10⁻⁴ is over 100 times larger).\n    *   D) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is smaller than 7.26 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Only option C provides an energy difference that is substantially larger than the combined energy widths of the two states, allowing them to be clearly resolved.\n\nThe python code I generated in the previous step confirmed these calculations. It calculated ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582e-07 eV and ΔE₂ ≈ 6.582e-08 eV. The condition for resolution is that the energy difference must be greater than the sum of these uncertainties, which is about 7.24e-07 eV. Comparing the options, only 1e-4 eV (Option C) satisfies this condition. The code output correctly identified Option C as the only valid choice. Therefore, the reasoning and the calculation are sound. I am ready to provide the final answer.\n<<<C>>>"
