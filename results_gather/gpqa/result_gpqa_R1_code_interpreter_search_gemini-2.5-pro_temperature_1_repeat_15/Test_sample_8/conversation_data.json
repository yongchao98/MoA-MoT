    "*   **Analysis of Molecular Symmetry**\n\n    To answer this question, we need to determine the point group of each molecule. A molecule has C3h symmetry if it possesses a C3 axis (three-fold rotational symmetry) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to that axis, and no other symmetry elements that would place it in a higher symmetry group (like D3h).\n\n    1.  **Quinuclidine (D):**\n        *   Structure: 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. It's a cage-like molecule.\n        *   Symmetry elements: It has a C3 axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon atom. It also has three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C3 axis and one of the three ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) bridges.\n        *   Point group: The presence of a C3 axis and three σv planes places it in the **C3v** point group. It lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n\n    2.  **Triisopropyl borate (B):**\n        *   Structure: B(O-iPr)3, where iPr is isopropyl, -CH(CH3)2. The central boron atom is bonded to three oxygen atoms in a trigonal planar geometry.\n        *   Symmetry elements: The molecule has a C3 axis passing through the boron atom, perpendicular to the plane of the three oxygen atoms. The three isopropyl groups are likely arranged in a propeller-like fashion to minimize steric hindrance. In this conformation, the molecule lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σh) because the methyl groups of the isopropyl substituents are not located within the BO3 plane.\n        *   Point group: Its point group is **C3**.\n\n    3.  **Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (C):**\n        *   Structure: This is a large, planar molecule. It consists of a triphenylene core (a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with D3h symmetry) to which three anhydride groups are fused symmetrically.\n        *   Symmetry elements: Being planar, it has a horizontal mirror plane (σh) in the plane of the molecule. It has a C3 axis perpendicular to the plane. Crucially, due to the high symmetry of the triphenylene core and the symmetric placement of the anhydride groups, it also possesses three C2 axes lying within the molecular plane and perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n        *   Point group: The presence of C3, σh, and perpendicular C2 axes places it in the **D3h** point group. While D3h contains all the symmetry elements of C3h, its full symmetry is higher.\n\n    4.  **Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (A):**\n        *   Structure: This molecule is mellitic trianhydride (C12O9). It consists of a central benzene ring with three anhydride groups (-C(=O)-O-C(=O)-) fused to adjacent pairs of carbon atoms (1-2, 3-4, 5-6). The molecule is planar.\n        *   Symmetry elements:\n            *   It has a C3 axis passing through the center of the benzene ring, perpendicular to the molecular plane. A 120° rotation maps the molecule onto itself.\n            *   Since the molecule is planar, the plane of the molecule is a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n            *   Unlike molecule C, it does *not* have any C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis. The asymmetry of the anhydride groups (the ether oxygen is on one side) breaks this potential symmetry. It also lacks vertical mirror planes (σv).\n        *   Point group: The presence of a C3 axis and a σh plane, and the absence of any higher-order symmetry elements, defines the point group as **C3h**.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n\n    Comparing the point groups of the four molecules:\n    *   A) C3h\n    *   B) C3\n    *   C) D3h\n    *   D) C3v\n\n    The question asks which molecule has C3h symmetry. Molecule A is the only one whose point group is exactly C3h.\n\n<<<A>>>"
