    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Nitration of Toluene**\nThe first reaction is the nitration of toluene using a mixture of nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction. The methyl group (-CH₃) on toluene is an ortho, para-directing group. The reaction yields a mixture of ortho-nitrotoluene and para-nitrotoluene. Due to less steric hindrance, the major product is para-nitrotoluene.\n\n*   **Reactant:** Toluene (C₆H₅CH₃)\n*   **Reagents:** HNO₃, H₂SO₄\n*   **Product 1:** 4-nitrotoluene (p-nitrotoluene)\n\n**Step 2: Oxidation of Product 1**\nThe second reaction involves treating Product 1 (4-nitrotoluene) with manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a strong oxidizing agent that selectively oxidizes the methyl group to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) without affecting the nitro group (-NO₂).\n\n*   **Reactant:** 4-nitrotoluene\n*   **Reagents:** MnO₂, H₂SO₄\n*   **Product 2:** 4-nitrobenzoic acid\n\n**Step 3: Reaction of Product 2 with Acetone and NaOH**\nThe third reaction involves treating Product 2 (4-nitrobenzoic acid) with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This reaction is known as the Janovský reaction.\n\n1.  **Acid-Base Reaction:** The strong base (NaOH) first deprotonates the carboxylic acid of 4-nitrobenzoic acid to form its conjugate base, the 4-nitrobenzoate anion.\n2.  **Enolate Formation:** NaOH also deprotonates acetone at its α-carbon to form the acetone enolate ion ([CH₂COCH₃]⁻), which is a potent nucleophile.\n3.  **Janovský Reaction:** The acetone enolate attacks the electron-deficient aromatic ring of the 4-nitrobenzoate anion. The strong electron-withdrawing nitro group activates the ring for nucleophilic addition. The attack occurs at the ortho position (C2 or C6) relative to the nitro group. This forms a negatively charged σ-complex, also known as a Janovský complex or Meisenheimer complex.\n\nThe structure of the final product (Product 3) is a resonance-stabilized anionic σ-complex.\n\n**Step 4: Determining the Molecular Symmetry of Product 3**\nLet's analyze the symmetry elements of the Janovský complex (Product 3). The molecule has the following structure: a six-membered ring with one sp³ hybridized carbon atom bonded to a hydrogen and an acetonyl group (-CH₂COCH₃), and another sp³ hybridized carbon atom bonded to the carboxylate group (-COO⁻). The remaining four carbons are part of a conjugated system.\n\n*   The molecule is not planar due to the sp³ hybridized carbons and the acetonyl group.\n*   The molecule does not have a center of inversion (i).\n*   The molecule does not have any rotational axes (Cₙ where n>1). For example, a C₂ axis passing through the molecule is not possible because the substituents on one side (-NO₂) are different from the other (-COO⁻), and the acetonyl group breaks any potential C₂ symmetry.\n*   The molecule does not have any improper rotation axes (Sₙ).\n*   However, the molecule possesses a single plane of symmetry (σ). This plane passes through the nitro group, the carboxylate group, the C1 and C4 atoms of the ring, and it bisects the acetonyl group (-CH₂COCH₃) and the methylene group attached to the ring. This assumes free rotation of the C-C bond allows the acetonyl group to align within this plane. Even if the acetonyl group is not perfectly planar, the plane containing the C₁-C₄ axis, the NO₂ group, and the COO⁻ group is the only possible symmetry element.\n\nA molecule that has only a single plane of symmetry (and the identity element E) belongs to the Cₛ point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of Product 3 is Cₛ.\n\n<<<D>>>"
