    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### **Part A: Tautomerism Analysis**\n\nTautomerism is a form of constitutional isomerism where two isomers (tautomers) are in equilibrium and can be readily interconverted. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group) that can migrate to the carbonyl oxygen.\n\n1.  **Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with three ketone (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are methylene groups (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The hydrogen atoms on carbons 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-hydrogens because these carbons are adjacent to the carbonyl groups. In fact, they are alpha to two carbonyl groups, making them particularly acidic and easy to remove.\n    *   **Tautomerization:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. By losing protons from the alpha-carbons and rearranging the double bonds, it converts into its enol form, which is **1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol)**.\n    *   **Keto form:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (C₆H₆O₃)\n    *   **Enol form:** 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (C₆H₆O₃)\n    *   **Stability:** The enol form (phloroglucinol) is an **aromatic** compound. The stability gained from forming an aromatic ring is a powerful driving force, so this compound exists almost entirely in its enol form.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism.\n\n2.  **Analyze Benzoquinone (specifically, p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two ketone groups at opposite (para) positions. Its chemical name is cyclohexa-2,5-diene-1,4-dione.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The carbons alpha (adjacent) to the carbonyl groups are part of the carbon-carbon double bonds within the ring. While these carbons do have hydrogen atoms, a key distinction must be made.\n    *   **Tautomerization vs. Redox:** Tautomers must have the same molecular formula. The molecular formula for benzoquinone is C₆H₄O₂. If it were to undergo a process to form its corresponding aromatic alcohol, it would become hydroquinone (1,4-dihydroxybenzene). The formula for hydroquinone is C₆H₆O₂. Since the molecular formulas are different (C₆H₄O₂ vs. C₆H₆O₂), the conversion between benzoquinone and hydroquinone is not tautomerism; it is a **redox reaction** (reduction/oxidation). Benzoquinone does not have a stable tautomeric form with the same molecular formula.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone **does not** show tautomerism.\n\n**Therefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is benzoquinone.**\n\n### **Part B: Optical Isomerism Analysis**\n\nA compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator of chirality is the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).\n\n1.  **Analyze Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** Let's examine carbon-2 (the carbon bonded to the -OH group). It is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   **Chirality:** Since carbon-2 is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and **will show** optical isomerism (it has two enantiomers).\n\n2.  **Analyze Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is trans-CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** There are no carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. The double-bonded carbons are only bonded to three groups each.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry (an inversion point at the center of the C=C bond). The presence of a center of symmetry or a plane of symmetry makes a molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and **will not show** optical isomerism.\n\n**Therefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.**\n\n### **Final Summary**\n\n*   **A** (does not show tautomerism) = **benzoquinone**\n*   **B** (will show optical isomerism) = **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
