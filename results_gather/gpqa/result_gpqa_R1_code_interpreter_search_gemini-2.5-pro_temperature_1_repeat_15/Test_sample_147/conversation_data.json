    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y and compound A2 using the given mass percentage.**\nThe problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), with the mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) being 31.96%.\nThe formula for A2 can be written as YF_n.\nThe mass percentage of fluorine is given by the formula:\nɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\nWhere M(F) is the molar mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol) and M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y.\n\nWe can rearrange the formula to solve for M(Y):\n0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\n0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * 19.00 * n = 19.00 * n\n0.3196 * M(Y) = (19.00 - 6.0724) * n\n0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276 * n\nM(Y) = (12.9276 / 0.3196) * n\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\nNow, we test small integer values for 'n' (the number of fluorine atoms) to find a plausible molar mass M(Y) that corresponds to a known element.\n*   If n = 1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (This is close to Calcium, but its chemistry doesn't fit).\n*   If n = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (This is close to Bromine, but its fluorides don't match the problem description well).\n*   If n = 3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (This is very close to the atomic mass of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol).\n*   If n = 4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (No common element matches).\n*   If n = 5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (Close to Mercury or Thallium, but their fluoride chemistry is not extensive enough).\n*   If n = 6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (This is very close to Plutonium, Pu, with an atomic mass around 244 g/mol).\n\nLet's verify the two best candidates, Sb and Pu.\n*   For Y=Sb, A2 = SbF3. M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n    ɷF = (3 * 19.00) / 178.76 = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188 (31.88%). This is very close to the given 31.96%.\n*   For Y=Pu, A2 = PuF6. M(PuF6) = 244 + 6 * 19.00 = 358 g/mol.\n    ɷF = (6 * 19.00) / 358 = 114 / 358 ≈ 0.3184 (31.84%). This is also very close.\n\nHowever, many of the qualitative descriptions in the problem (e.g., \"colorless concentrated solution of A4\") fit the chemistry of antimony (whose fluorides are colorless) better than that of plutonium (whose compounds are characteristically colored). Antimony(V) fluoride, SbF5, is also a known agent that can oxidize xenon. While there are inconsistencies in the problem statement for any choice, the numerical evidence for Sb is slightly stronger, and the qualitative clues also point towards it. So, we will proceed with the hypothesis that **Y = Sb**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the possible compounds A4.**\nIf Y is Antimony (Sb), its common binary fluorides are Antimony(III) fluoride (SbF3) and Antimony(V) fluoride (SbF5). Therefore, substance A4 must be one of these two compounds.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the molecular weights of the possible compounds for A4.**\n*   Molecular Weight of SbF3: M(Sb) + 3 * M(F) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = **178.76 g/mol**.\n*   Molecular Weight of SbF5: M(Sb) + 5 * M(F) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = **216.76 g/mol**.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the calculated molecular weights with the given options.**\nThe question asks to indicate the range in which the molecular weight of substance A4 falls.\nThe options are:\nA) 160-180\nB) 220-240\nC) 110-130\nD) 140-160\n\nLet's check our calculated values:\n*   The molecular weight of SbF3 (178.76 g/mol) falls within the range **160-180 g/mol**.\n*   The molecular weight of SbF5 (216.76 g/mol) does not fall into any of the provided ranges. It is close to range B, but it is not within it.\n\nBased on this, A4 must be SbF3. The molecular weight of A4 falls in the range of 160-180 g/mol.\n\n*(Note: The problem contains several statements that are contradictory or factually incorrect, regardless of the choice of element Y. However, by focusing on the quantitative data provided—the mass percentage and the final options for molecular weight—we can arrive at the most plausible intended answer.)*\n\n<<<A>>>"
