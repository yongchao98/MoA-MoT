    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a ketone with a single chiral center at the C5 position, and its configuration is specified as (S). The structure is CH3-CH(OCH3)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. This is followed by an acidic workup to protonate the resulting alkoxide.\n*   **Reaction:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The carbonyl carbon (C3) is prochiral. The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack from either face of the planar carbonyl group.\n*   **Products:** The reaction creates a new stereocenter at C3, which can have either an (R) or (S) configuration. The original stereocenter at C5 is not involved in the reaction and retains its (S) configuration. Therefore, two products are formed:\n    *   Product 1 (P1): (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2 (P2): (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** P1 and P2 have one stereocenter in common (5S) and one that is different (3R vs. 3S). This makes them **diastereomers**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone). The structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. This molecule is achiral.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is a reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. The problem states \"excess\" NaBH4, ensuring both ketone groups are reduced. This is followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** The reduction of the two ketone groups at C2 and C4 creates two new stereocenters.\n*   **Products:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. We need to determine the possible stereoisomers. The molecule has two stereocenters (C2 and C4) and is symmetric.\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (P3)\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (P4)\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, which is a **meso compound** (P5) due to an internal plane of symmetry. Note that (2S, 4R) is the same meso compound.\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship and Mixture Composition:** Since the starting material and the reagent are both achiral, the product mixture must be optically inactive. This means that the chiral products, P3 and P4, must be formed in equal amounts as a **racemic mixture**. The meso compound, P5, is also formed. Therefore, Reaction II produces three stereoisomers: a racemic pair of enantiomers (P3 and P4) and a meso compound (P5). P5 is a diastereomer of P3 and P4.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity. Enantiomers have identical physical properties (including polarity) in an achiral environment, so they cannot be separated. Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n*   **Products in the mixture:** {P1, P2, P3, P4, P5}\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   P1 and P2 are diastereomers, so they have different polarities and will give **two separate peaks**.\n    *   P3 and P4 are enantiomers, so they have the same polarity and will co-elute, giving **one single peak**.\n    *   P5 (the meso compound) is a diastereomer of P3 and P4. Therefore, it has a different polarity and will give a **separate peak**.\n    *   The products of Reaction I (C7 ethers/alcohols) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (C5 diols). They will have significantly different polarities and retention times, so there will be no accidental overlap of peaks.\n*   **Counting the peaks:** We have four groups of compounds that are separable on a normal-phase column: {P1}, {P2}, {P3+P4}, and {P5}.\n*   **Conclusion for Normal-Phase HPLC:** There will be a total of **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   **Principle:** Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase. This allows for the separation of enantiomers because they form transient diastereomeric complexes with the stationary phase, which have different energies and stabilities. Chiral HPLC can, of course, also separate diastereomers. In short, it can separate all stereoisomers.\n*   **Products in the mixture:** {P1, P2, P3, P4, P5}. These are five distinct stereoisomers.\n*   **Separation:**\n    *   P1 ((3R, 5S)-...) - unique stereoisomer -> 1 peak\n    *   P2 ((3S, 5S)-...) - unique stereoisomer -> 1 peak\n    *   P3 ((2R, 4R)-...) - unique stereoisomer -> 1 peak\n    *   P4 ((2S, 4S)-...) - unique stereoisomer -> 1 peak (separated from its enantiomer P3)\n    *   P5 (meso-...) - unique stereoisomer -> 1 peak (separated from all others as it is a diastereomer)\n*   **Counting the peaks:** Each of the five stereoisomers will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and will be resolved.\n*   **Conclusion for Chiral HPLC:** There will be a total of **5 peaks**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   The analysis predicts **4 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n*   The analysis predicts **5 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
