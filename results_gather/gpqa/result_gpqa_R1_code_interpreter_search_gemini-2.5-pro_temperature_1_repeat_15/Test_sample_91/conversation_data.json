    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the Chemical Formula and Structure**\n\nThe chemical formula is given as (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\nLet's determine the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms:\n*   **Carbon (C):** The structure consists of a main chain and methyl (CH3) groups.\n    *   `(CH3)2C=`: 1 C in the chain + 2 C in methyl groups = 3 C\n    *   `=CH-`: 1 C\n    *   `-CH2-`: 1 C\n    *   `-CH(CH3)-`: 1 C in the chain + 1 C in a methyl group = 2 C\n    *   `-CH2-`: 1 C\n    *   `-CH=`: 1 C\n    *   `=C(CH3)2`: 1 C in the chain + 2 C in methyl groups = 3 C\n    *   Total Carbon atoms = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):**\n    *   `(CH3)2C=`: 2 * 3 = 6 H\n    *   `=CH-`: 1 H\n    *   `-CH2-`: 2 H\n    *   `-CH(CH3)-`: 1 H on the chain + 3 H in the methyl group = 4 H\n    *   `-CH2-`: 2 H\n    *   `-CH=`: 1 H\n    *   `=C(CH3)2`: 2 * 3 = 6 H\n    *   Total Hydrogen atoms = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22.\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the Number of Each Type of Bond**\n\nBased on the structure, we can count the covalent bonds:\n*   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n*   **C=C double bonds:** The formula clearly shows two double bonds (`C=C...C=C`). So, there are **2** C=C bonds.\n*   **C-C single bonds:**\n    *   Bonds in the main chain: There are 7 carbons in the main chain, connected by 4 single bonds and 2 double bonds. The single bonds are C2-C3, C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6. (4 bonds)\n    *   Bonds to methyl groups:\n        *   The first carbon is attached to two methyl groups (2 bonds).\n        *   The fourth carbon is attached to one methyl group (1 bond).\n        *   The seventh carbon is attached to two methyl groups (2 bonds).\n    *   Total C-C single bonds = 4 + 2 + 1 + 2 = **9**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound (ΔH_atom_compound)**\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the gaseous compound to form gaseous atoms. It is the sum of all the bond energies.\nΔH_atom_compound = (No. of C-H bonds × BE_CH) + (No. of C-C bonds × BE_CC) + (No. of C=C bonds × BE_C=C)\nUsing the given values:\n*   BE(C-H) = 400 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C-C) = 200 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C=C) = 300 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_atom_compound = (22 × 400) + (9 × 200) + (2 × 300)\nΔH_atom_compound = 8800 + 1800 + 600\nΔH_atom_compound = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Elements (ΔH_atom_elements)**\n\nThis is the energy required to form the gaseous atoms (12 moles of C and 22 moles of H) from the elements in their standard states (C(s, graphite) and H2(g)).\nThe overall process is: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → 12 C(g) + 22 H(g)\nΔH_atom_elements = (12 × ΔH_atom(C)) + (11 × BE(H-H))\nUsing the given values:\n*   ΔH_atom(C) = 1000 kJ/mol\n*   BE(H-H) = 100 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_atom_elements = (12 × 1000) + (11 × 100)\nΔH_atom_elements = 12000 + 1100\nΔH_atom_elements = **13100 kJ**\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation of the Compound (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) can be found using Hess's Law, which relates these enthalpies:\nΔH_f = ΔH_atom_elements - ΔH_atom_compound\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol\nΔH_f = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**6. Convert the Enthalpy of Formation to kJ/g**\n\nThe options include answers in kJ/g, so we need to convert our result. First, we calculate the molar mass of C12H22.\n*   Molar Mass (M) = (12 × Atomic Mass of C) + (22 × Atomic Mass of H)\n*   Using standard integer masses for this type of problem: M = (12 × 12) + (22 × 1) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n\nNow, convert the enthalpy of formation from kJ/mol to kJ/g:\nΔH_f (kJ/g) = ΔH_f (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\nΔH_f (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166\nΔH_f (kJ/g) ≈ **11.4457... kJ/g**\n\nThis value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
