    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing physical principle:** The problem describes the population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of stars. Assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms across different energy states is described by the Boltzmann equation.\n\n2.  **Write down the Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (level 2) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state (level 1) is given by:\n    N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n    where:\n    *   N₂ and N₁ are the populations of the upper and lower levels, respectively.\n    *   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels.\n    *   ΔE = E₂ - E₁ is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   T is the temperature.\n\n3.  **Apply the equation to the two stars:** We have two stars, star_1 and star_2, with effective temperatures T₁ and T₂, respectively. The ratio of populations (which represents the \"excitation\") for each star is:\n    *   For star_1:  (N₂/N₁)_₁ = (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))\n    *   For star_2:  (N₂/N₁)_₂ = (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\n    Note that ΔE, k, g₂, and g₁ are constants related to the specific atomic transition of iron and fundamental physics, so they are the same for both stars.\n\n4.  **Use the information from the problem:** The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star_2. This means the population ratio for star_1 is twice the population ratio for star_2:\n    (N₂/N₁)_₁ = 2 * (N₂/N₁)_₂\n\n5.  **Substitute the Boltzmann equations into the relationship:**\n    (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * [(g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))]\n\n6.  **Simplify the equation:** The term for the statistical weights, (g₂/g₁), appears on both sides and can be canceled out:\n    exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))\n\n7.  **Isolate the temperatures by taking the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:**\n    ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))]\n\n    Using the logarithm properties ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b) and ln(eˣ) = x:\n    -ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) + [-ΔE / (k * T₂)]\n\n8.  **Rearrange the equation to solve for ln(2):**\n    ΔE / (k * T₂) - ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2)\n\n    Factor out the common term (ΔE / k):\n    (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) = ln(2)\n\n    Combine the fractions inside the parenthesis:\n    (ΔE / k) * [(T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂)] = ln(2)\n\n9.  **Use the given numerical values:** The problem provides:\n    *   ΔE = 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J\n    *   The Boltzmann constant, k, is a known physical constant, k ≈ 1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n\n    The value for ΔE appears to be specifically chosen so that the ratio ΔE/k is approximately 1. Let's verify this.\n    ```python\n    delta_E = 1.38e-23  # Energy difference in Joules\n    k = 1.380649e-23 # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n    ratio = delta_E / k\n    print(ratio)\n    ```\n    \n    0.999530013783308\n    \n    The ratio ΔE/k is indeed approximately 1.\n\n10. **Finalize the equation:** Substituting ΔE/k ≈ 1 into our derived equation:\n    1 * [(T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂)] = ln(2)\n    ln(2) = [(T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂)]\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
