    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Vector Field and the Problem:**\n    The vector field is given by `f(r)`. Its magnitude is `|f(r)| = 1/r^2`, and its direction is radial. In spherical coordinates, this can be written as:\n    `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r̂`\n    where `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n    The problem asks to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, `∫_V (∇.f) dV`, where `V` is the volume of a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n2.  **Choose the Method of Solution:**\n    This problem is a perfect candidate for the Divergence Theorem. The Divergence Theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux of that field through the closed surface that encloses the volume. The theorem states:\n    `∫_V (∇.f) dV = ∮_S (f . dS)`\n    where `S` is the closed surface bounding the volume `V`.\n\n    **Important Note:** The Divergence Theorem requires the vector field to be continuously differentiable within the volume. The field `f(r) = (1/r^2) * r̂` has a singularity at `r = 0` (the origin), where it is undefined. However, the theorem can still be applied by considering the surface integral, which effectively calculates the contribution from the singularity at the origin. This is a standard technique for fields of this type (like the electric field of a point charge).\n\n3.  **Apply the Divergence Theorem:**\n    We will calculate the right-hand side of the theorem, the surface integral `∮_S (f . dS)`.\n\n    *   **The Surface (S):** The surface `S` is the surface of the sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n    *   **The Vector Field (f) on the Surface:** On this surface, the radial distance `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, the vector field on the surface is:\n        `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r̂`\n    *   **The Differential Surface Area Vector (dS):** For a sphere, the differential surface area element `dS` always points radially outward. Therefore, its direction is `r̂`. In spherical coordinates, its magnitude is `dS = R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ`. So, the vector is:\n        `dS = (R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r̂`\n    *   **The Dot Product (f . dS):** Now, we compute the dot product of the field and the surface element:\n        `f . dS = [(1/R^2) * r̂] . [(R^2 * sin(θ) dθ dφ) * r̂]`\n        Since `r̂ . r̂ = 1`, the terms `1/R^2` and `R^2` cancel out:\n        `f . dS = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Surface Integral:**\n    Now we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration in spherical coordinates for a full sphere are `θ` from `0` to `π`, and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n\n    `∮_S (f . dS) = ∫_{φ=0}^{2π} ∫_{θ=0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\n    We can separate the integrals:\n    `∮_S (f . dS) = (∫_{φ=0}^{2π} dφ) * (∫_{θ=0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ)`\n\n    *   **First integral (φ):**\n        `∫_{φ=0}^{2π} dφ = [φ]_0^{2π} = 2π`\n    *   **Second integral (θ):**\n        `∫_{θ=0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^{π} = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n    *   **Final Result:**\n        Multiplying the results of the two integrals:\n        `∮_S (f . dS) = (2π) * (2) = 4π`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    According to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to this surface integral.\n    `∫_V (∇.f) dV = 4π`\n\n    This result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
