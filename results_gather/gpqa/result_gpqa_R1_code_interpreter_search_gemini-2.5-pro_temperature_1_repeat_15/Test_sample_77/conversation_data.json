    "This question asks for the scalar and vector potentials generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's break down the problem based on the principles of classical electrodynamics.\n\n### 1. Conceptual Framework: Retarded Potentials\n\nThe electromagnetic fields (and thus potentials) at a point in space `r` and time `t` are not determined by the state of the sources at time `t`, but by their state at an earlier time, known as the **retarded time** (`tr`). This is because electromagnetic influences propagate at the finite speed of light, `c`.\n\nThe retarded time `tr` is the time at which the signal must have been emitted from the source's position, `s(tr)`, to reach the observation point `r` at time `t`. This causal connection is expressed by the equation:\n\n$t_r = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$\n\n### 2. Defining the Variables\n\nLet's clarify the notation provided in the question, which is standard for this problem:\n*   `q`: The electric charge of the point particle.\n*   `s(t)`: The trajectory of the charge, its position vector as a function of time.\n*   `r`: The position vector of the point where the field is being observed (the \"field point\").\n*   `tr`: The retarded time.\n*   `s(tr)`: The position of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   `v`: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time, i.e., $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt} |_{t=t_r}$.\n*   `d`: The vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point. Thus, $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n*   `d`: The magnitude of the vector `d`, i.e., $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$.\n*   `c`: The speed of light in a vacuum.\n*   `ε₀`: The permittivity of free space.\n*   `μ₀`: The permeability of free space.\n\nFrom the definition of retarded time, we have the important relation: $d = c(t - t_r)$.\n\n### 3. The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\n\nThe general solutions for the scalar potential `V` and vector potential `A` for time-varying charge and current distributions are given by the retarded potential integrals. For a point charge, these integrals evaluate to the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nThe derivation involves integrating over the charge distribution, which for a point charge is a Dirac delta function. A key subtlety in the derivation is accounting for the fact that the retarded time `tr` depends on the integration variable, which leads to a Jacobian factor in the denominator. The results are:\n\n**Scalar Potential (V):**\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\nThe term in the square brackets is evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\n\n**Vector Potential (A):**\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\nAgain, everything in the brackets is evaluated at `tr`.\n\n### 4. Matching with the Options\n\nNow, let's manipulate these standard forms to match the format given in the options. We can multiply the numerator and denominator of the expressions by `c`:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nLet's compare these results with the given choices:\n\n*   **A)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$. This is the quasi-static approximation, which neglects the full retardation effect in the denominator. Incorrect.\n*   **B)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$. Incorrect `V` and the expression for `A` is dimensionally and physically incorrect.\n*   **C)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$. This perfectly matches our derived expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n*   **D)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$. The sign in the denominator is incorrect. The minus sign is crucial; it represents a Doppler-like effect, increasing the potential when the charge moves towards the observer.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, which are accurately represented in option C. It is also worth noting that the potentials are related by $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$, which can be verified using the relation $\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 = 1/c^2$.\n\n<<<C>>>"
