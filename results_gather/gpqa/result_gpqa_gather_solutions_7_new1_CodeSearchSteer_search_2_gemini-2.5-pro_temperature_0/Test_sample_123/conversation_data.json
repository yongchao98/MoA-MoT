The key principles are the exponential law of radioactive decay and the special relativity concept of time dilation.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Survival Equation:**\n    *   The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive after a time `t_lab` in the laboratory's reference frame is given by `f = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)`.\n    *   `τ_lab` is the particle's mean lifetime as measured in the lab. Due to time dilation, it is related to the particle's proper lifetime `τ_proper` (its lifetime in its own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor `γ`: `τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`.\n    *   `t_lab` is the time it takes for the particles to travel the detector radius `R`. Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. So, `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n    *   Substituting these into the survival equation gives:\n        `f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ_proper))`\n\n3.  **Set up a Ratio to Solve the Problem:**\n    The term `K = R / (c * τ_proper)` is a constant because the detector radius and the particle's intrinsic properties are the same in both scenarios. The equation simplifies to `f = exp(-K / γ)`.\n\n    We can take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(f) = -K / γ`\n    Rearranging for the constant `K`:\n    `K = -γ * ln(f)`\n\n    Since `K` is the same for both scenarios, we can write:\n    `-γ₁ * ln(f₁) = -γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n\n4.  **Apply the Given Conditions:**\n    *   **Scenario 1:** `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`\n    *   **Scenario 2:** `γ₂ = ?`, `f₂ = 2/3`\n\n    Plugging these values into the equation from Step 3:\n    `-20 * ln(1/3) = -γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n\n5.  **Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (`γ₂`):**\n    The negative signs on both sides cancel out:\n    `20 * ln(1/3) = γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`:\n    `20 * (-ln(3)) = γ₂ * (-ln(3/2))`\n\n    The negative signs cancel again:\n    `20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\n    Now, isolate `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    Using the approximate values for natural logarithms: `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`.\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\n7.  **Conclusion and Final Check:**\n    The calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2.

This requires a larger time dilation effect, which corresponds to a higher Lorentz factor. Our result `γ₂ ≈ 54` is indeed greater than the initial `γ₁ = 20`, which confirms the physical reasoning.\n\n    Almost all candidate answers correctly derived the formula and calculated the value to be ~54. Several made errors in the final step of matching the calculated number to the correct letter option. The correct calculation leads to the number 54, which is option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Understanding the Physical Principles**\n\nThe problem combines two core concepts from modern physics:\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The fraction of unstable particles (`f`) that have not decayed after a certain time is described by an exponential function. In the particle's own rest frame (proper time `t_p`), this is `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`, where `τ` is the particle's proper mean lifetime.\n*   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** From the perspective of the stationary detector (the lab frame), the particle's internal clock runs slower. The time measured in the lab frame (`t_lab`) is related to the proper time by the Lorentz factor `γ`: `t_lab = γ * t_p`. Consequently, the particle's lifetime appears longer in the lab frame: `τ_lab = γ * τ`.\n\n### **2. Formulating the Governing Equation**\n\nFirst, we determine the time it takes for the particles to reach the detector wall in the lab frame (`t_lab`). Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`.\n*   Time of flight, `t_lab ≈ R / c`, where `R` is the detector radius (30 m).\n\nThe fraction of particles that survive this flight is given by the decay law using the lab-frame time of flight and the lab-frame lifetime:\n*   `f = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)`\n\nSubstituting the expressions for `t_lab` and `τ_lab`:\n*   `f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ))`\n\nThis equation relates the survival fraction `f` to the Lorentz factor `γ`. The term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant for this specific particle and detector setup. Let's call this constant `C`.\n*   `f = exp(-C / γ)`\n\n### **3. Solving for the Unknown Lorentz Factor**\n\nWe have two scenarios and can set up a system of equations.\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n*   Survival fraction, `f₁ = 1/3`\n*   Plugging these in: `1/3 = exp(-C / 20)`\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n*   Lorentz factor, `γ₂ = ?`\n*   Survival fraction, `f₂ = 2/3`\n*   Plugging these in: `2/3 = exp(-C / γ₂)`\n\nTo solve for `γ₂`, we can first find the constant `C` from Scenario 1 by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n*   `ln(1/3) = -C / 20`\n*   `-ln(3) = -C / 20`\n*   `C = 20 * ln(3)`\n\nNow, take the natural logarithm of the equation for Scenario 2 and substitute the value of `C`:\n*   `ln(2/3) = -C / γ₂`\n*   `ln(2/3) = -(20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n\nFinally, solve for `γ₂`:\n*   `γ₂ = - (20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3)`\n*   Using the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = -ln(b/a)`, we get `ln(2/3) = -ln(3/2)`.\n*   `γ₂ = - (20 * ln(3)) / (-ln(3/2))`\n*   `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n### **4. Calculation and Final Answer**\n\nUsing the approximate values for the natural logarithms (`ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`):\n*   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n*   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n*   `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThe calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately 54.\n\n### **Careful Points and Conclusion**\n\n*   **Correct Physics:** The derivation correctly uses the principles of exponential decay and time dilation.\n*   **Ultra-relativistic Approximation:** The approximation `v ≈ c` is justified by the problem statement and is standard for such problems.\n*   **Logical Consistency:** A higher survival fraction (2/3 vs 1/3) requires the particles to age less during their journey. This necessitates a larger time dilation effect, which corresponds to a higher Lorentz factor. Our result (`γ₂ ≈ 54`) is greater than the initial factor (`γ₁ = 20`), which is consistent with the physics.\n*   **Matching to Options:** The calculated value of ~54 corresponds to option D in the provided list. Many of the candidate answers correctly calculate the value but incorrectly map it to a lettered option.\n\nThe required Lorentz factor is 54.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is my step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Physics and Formulate the Core Equation**\n\nThe problem involves the decay of relativistic particles. The key principles are exponential decay and time dilation from special relativity.\n\n*   The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive after a certain time is given by the exponential decay law. This law is fundamentally based on the time experienced by the particle itself, known as its proper time, `t_p`. The formula is `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`, where `τ` is the particle's mean proper lifetime.\n*   From the laboratory's perspective, the particle travels a distance `R` (the detector radius) in a time `t_lab`. Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`, so `t_lab ≈ R/c`.\n*   Due to time dilation, the time measured in the lab frame (`t_lab`) is longer than the proper time (`t_p`) experienced by the particle. The relationship is `t_lab = γ * t_p`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor. Therefore, the proper time that passes for the particle during its journey is `t_p = t_lab / γ = (R/c) / γ`.\n*   Substituting this into the decay formula gives us the survival fraction as a function of the Lorentz factor:\n    `f = exp(-(R / (γ * c)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n**2. Use a Ratio to Solve for the Unknown**\n\nThe term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant for this specific particle and detector setup. Let's call this constant `K`. The equation simplifies to `f = exp(-K / γ)`.\n\nWe can solve for `γ` by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(f) = -K / γ`\n`γ * ln(f) = -K`\nSince `-K` is a constant, the product `γ * ln(f)` must be the same for both scenarios.\n\n*   **Scenario 1:** `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`\n*   **Scenario 2:** `γ₂ = ?`, `f₂ = 2/3`\n\nTherefore, we can set up the following equality:\n`γ₁ * ln(f₁) = γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n\n**3. Solve for the New Lorentz Factor (`γ₂`)**\n\nNow, we can plug in the known values and solve for `γ₂`:\n`20 * ln(1/3) = γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n\n`γ₂ = 20 * (ln(1/3) / ln(2/3))`\n\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = -ln(b/a)`, we can write `ln(1/3) = -ln(3)` and `ln(2/3) = -ln(3/2)`.\n`γ₂ = 20 * (-ln(3) / -ln(3/2)) = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\nThis is the final expression we need to calculate.\n\n**4. Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **Frame of Reference:** It is crucial to correctly use the proper time in the decay exponent, which is achieved by dividing the lab-frame travel time by the Lorentz factor `γ`.\n*   **Logical Check:** To have a larger fraction of particles survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), their internal clocks must run slower relative to the lab. This requires a larger time dilation effect, which means a higher Lorentz factor `γ`. Our final answer must be greater than 20.\n*   **Mapping to Options:** After calculating the numerical answer, it is essential to carefully match it to the correct lettered option.

The fraction of particles that survive a journey depends on how much time passes in their own reference frame (proper time), which is less than the time measured in the laboratory due to their high speed.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Survival Equation:**\n    *   The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive after a proper time `t_p` is given by the decay law: `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`, where `τ` is the particle's mean proper lifetime.\n    *   The time of flight in the lab frame is `t_lab = R / v`. Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. So, `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n    *   Due to time dilation, the proper time `t_p` experienced by the particle is related to the lab time `t_lab` by the Lorentz factor `γ`: `t_p = t_lab / γ`.\n    *   Substituting these into the decay law, we get the survival fraction as a function of the Lorentz factor:\n        `f = exp(-(R / (c * γ)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n3.  **Identify Constants and Variables:**\n    *   The detector radius `R`, the speed of light `c`, and the particle's proper lifetime `τ` are all constant for both scenarios. We can group them into a single constant, let's call it `K = R / (c * τ)`.\n    *   The equation simplifies to: `f = exp(-K / γ)`.\n\n4.  **Set Up Equations for Both Scenarios:**\n    *   **Scenario 1:** Given `f₁ = 1/3` and `γ₁ = 20`.\n        `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n    *   **Scenario 2:** Given `f₂ = 2/3`, we need to find `γ₂`.\n        `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\n5.  **Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (`γ₂`):**\n    *   A robust way to solve this is to take the natural logarithm of both equations and form a ratio to eliminate the unknown constant `K`.\n    *   From Scenario 1: `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`  => `K = -20 * ln(1/3) = 20 * ln(3)`\n    *   From Scenario 2: `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`  => `K = -γ₂ * ln(2/3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n    *   Since `K` is the same in both cases, we can set the two expressions for `K` equal to each other:\n        `20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n    *   Now, solve for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    *   Using the approximate values for natural logarithms: `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`.\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.7095`\n    *   `γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\n7.  **Conclusion and Final Answer Selection:**\n    *   The calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2.\n    *   Comparing this result to the given options:\n        A) 40\n        B) 28\n        C) 54\n        D) 68\n    *   The value 54.2 is closest to 54.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Frame of Reference:** It is crucial to use the proper time (`t_p`) in the exponent of the decay law, not the lab time (`t_lab`).\n*   **Time Dilation Formula:** Correctly apply the time dilation formula `t_p = t_lab / γ`. A common mistake is to invert the factor `γ`.\n*   **Logical Check:** To have a larger fraction of particles survive (2/3 vs 1/3), they must experience less proper time during their flight. This requires a larger time dilation effect, which means a higher Lorentz factor `γ`. Our result `γ₂ ≈ 54` is greater than `γ₁ = 20`, which is consistent with the physics.\n*   **Matching to Options:** After calculating the numerical value, it is essential to carefully match it to the correct lettered option provided in the original question.\n\nThe final answer is 54.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Lorentz factor.\n\n### **1. Understand the Physics**\n\nThe problem combines two core concepts from physics:\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The fraction of unstable particles, `f`, that survive after a certain proper time `t_p` (the time in the particle's own reference frame) is given by `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`, where `τ` is the particle's mean proper lifetime.\n*   **Time Dilation:** Due to special relativity, a moving particle's clock runs slower than a stationary observer's clock. The time measured in the lab frame, `t_lab`, is related to the proper time `t_p` by the Lorentz factor `γ`: `t_lab = γ * t_p`.\n\n### **2. Formulate the Governing Equation**\n\nWe need to express the survival fraction `f` in terms of the lab-frame quantities.\n\n*   The time it takes for a particle to travel the detector radius `R` in the lab frame is `t_lab = R / v`.\n*   The problem states the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" which means their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. So, `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n*   The proper time experienced by the particle during this flight is `t_p = t_lab / γ = (R / c) / γ`.\n*   Substituting this proper time into the decay equation gives the survival fraction as a function of the Lorentz factor:\n    `f = exp(-(R / (cγ)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γcτ))`\n\n### **3. Set Up a Ratio to Solve for the Unknown**\n\nThe term `R / (cτ)` is a constant because the detector radius `R`, the speed of light `c`, and the particle's proper lifetime `τ` do not change between the two scenarios. Let's call this constant `K`.\n\nThe equation simplifies to: `f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\nWe can now apply this to the two scenarios:\n\n*   **Scenario 1:** `f₁ = 1/3` when `γ₁ = 20`.\n    `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n*   **Scenario 2:** `f₂ = 2/3` when `γ₂ = ?`.\n    `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\nTo solve for `γ₂`, we can first take the natural logarithm of both equations:\n1.  `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`  =>  `K = -20 * ln(1/3) = 20 * ln(3)`\n2.  `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`  =>  `K = -γ₂ * ln(2/3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\nSince `K` is the same in both cases, we can set the two expressions for `K` equal to each other:\n`20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\n### **4.

This requires their internal clocks to run slower relative to the lab, which corresponds to a larger time dilation effect and thus a higher Lorentz factor. Our result (`γ₂ ≈ 54`) is indeed greater than the initial factor (`γ₁ = 20`), which confirms our answer is physically reasonable.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Lorentz factor.\n\n### **1. Understand the Underlying Physics**\n\nThe problem involves two key concepts from physics:\n*   **Exponential Decay:** Unstable particles decay over time. The fraction `f` of particles that survive after a time `t_p` in their own reference frame (proper time) is given by `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`, where `τ` is the particle's mean proper lifetime.\n*   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** A particle moving with a high velocity experiences time more slowly than a stationary observer. The time measured in the laboratory's frame (`t_lab`) is related to the particle's proper time (`t_p`) by the Lorentz factor `γ`: `t_lab = γ * t_p`.\n\n### **2. Formulate the Governing Equation**\n\nWe need to find the fraction of particles that survive the journey from the center to the wall of the detector.\n\n*   **Time of Flight (Lab Frame):** The particles travel a distance `R` (the detector radius) at a velocity `v`. Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time of flight in the lab frame is `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n*   **Proper Time of Flight:** The time that passes for the particle itself during this journey is `t_p = t_lab / γ = (R / c) / γ`.\n*   **Survival Fraction Formula:** We substitute this proper time into the decay equation:\n    `f = exp(-(R / (γc)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γcτ))`\n\nThe term `R / (cτ)` depends only on the detector's radius and the intrinsic properties of the particle, so it is a constant for both scenarios. Let's call this constant `K`. The equation simplifies to:\n`f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n### **3. Set Up Equations for Both Scenarios**\n\nWe can now use the given information to create two equations.\n\n*   **Scenario 1:** A fraction `f₁ = 1/3` of particles survive with a Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`.\n    `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\n*   **Scenario 2:** We want to find the Lorentz factor `γ₂` for which a fraction `f₂ = 2/3` of particles survive.\n    `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\n### **4. Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (γ₂)**\n\nThe most direct way to solve this is to first isolate the constant `K` in each equation by taking the natural logarithm (`ln`).\n\n*   From Scenario 1:\n    `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n    `-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n    `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n*   From Scenario 2:\n    `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n    `γ₂ = -K / ln(2/3)`\n\nNow, substitute the expression for `K` from the first step into the second:\n`γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3)`\n\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = -ln(b/a)`, we can simplify `ln(2/3)` to `-ln(3/2)`:\n`γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / (-ln(3/2))`\n`γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n### **5. Calculate the Numerical Value**\n\nUsing the approximate values for natural logarithms (`ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`):\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\n### **6.

The time in the exponent must be the proper time (`t_p`) experienced by the particle, and the lifetime must be the proper mean lifetime (`τ`).\n    `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`\n\n2.  **Relate Lab Time and Proper Time:** The particles travel a distance `R` (the detector radius) in the lab frame. Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time of flight in the lab frame is `t_lab ≈ R/c`. Due to time dilation, the proper time experienced by the particle is shorter than the lab time, related by the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n    `t_p = t_lab / γ = (R/c) / γ`\n\n3.  **Combine the Equations:** Substituting the expression for proper time into the survival equation gives the fraction of survivors as a function of the Lorentz factor:\n    `f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ)) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n4.  **Identify the Constant:** For a given particle type and detector setup, the radius `R`, the speed of light `c`, and the proper lifetime `τ` are all constants.

The key physical principles are:\n1.  **Exponential Decay:** The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive after a time `t'` in their own rest frame (proper time) is given by `f = exp(-t' / τ)`, where `τ` is the particle's proper mean lifetime.\n2.  **Time Dilation:** From the perspective of the laboratory (the detector), the particle's internal clock runs slower.

Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time of flight in the lab frame is `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n2.  **Proper Time of Flight:** The time that passes for the particle itself during this journey is the proper time `t' = t_lab / γ = (R/c) / γ`.\n3.  **Survival Fraction Formula:** We substitute this proper time `t'` into the exponential decay law:\n    `f = exp(-t' / τ) = exp(-(R / (γ * c)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n### **Step 3: Use the Two Scenarios to Solve for the Unknown**\n\nThe term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant because the detector radius and the particle's intrinsic properties do not change.

The time elapsed in the lab frame, `t_lab`, is related to the proper time `t_p` by the Lorentz factor `γ`: `t_lab = γ * t_p`. Therefore, the proper time experienced by the particle is `t_p = t_lab / γ`.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Equation for the System\nWe can combine these principles to find the fraction of particles that survive the trip to the detector wall.\n*   The time of flight in the lab frame is `t_lab = R / v`, where `R` is the detector radius and `v` is the particle's velocity.\n*   Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`. So, `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n*   The proper time experienced by the particle during this flight is `t_p = t_lab / γ = (R/c) / γ`.\n*   Substituting this `t_p` into the decay equation gives the survival fraction:\n    `f = exp(-(R / (c * γ)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n### Step 3: Use the Two Scenarios to Solve for the Unknown\nThe term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant because the detector radius and the particle's intrinsic properties are the same in both scenarios.

All calculations must correctly transform the lab-frame travel time into the proper time experienced by the particle.\n*   **Logical Check:** To increase the survival fraction from 1/3 to 2/3, more particles must survive the journey. This requires their time to be dilated more significantly, which means the Lorentz factor `γ` must be larger. The calculated result (`γ₂ ≈ 54`) is indeed larger than the initial value (`γ₁ = 20`), which confirms the physical reasoning.\n*   **Consistency of Constants:** The solution relies on the fact that the detector radius `R` and the particle's proper lifetime `τ` are constant between the two scenarios, allowing for their elimination by setting up a ratio.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the candidate answers correctly derive the formula and calculate the value to be approximately 54.2.

The solution involves combining the principles of exponential decay and special relativistic time dilation.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Formulate the Survival Equation:**\n    The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive after traveling a certain distance is governed by the exponential decay law. This law must be expressed in terms of the particle's own experienced time (proper time, `t_p`), not the time measured in the laboratory (`t_lab`).\n    The survival fraction is `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`, where `τ` is the particle's mean proper lifetime.\n\n2.  **Apply Time Dilation:**\n    According to special relativity, the time experienced by the moving particle (`t_p`) is shorter than the time measured by the stationary detector (`t_lab`) due to time dilation. The relationship is `t_p = t_lab / γ`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n    Substituting this into the survival equation gives: `f = exp(-(t_lab / γ) / τ)`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Lab Time of Flight:**\n    The particles travel from the center of the detector to the wall, a distance equal to the radius `R = 30 m`. Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time of flight in the lab frame is `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n\n4.  **Combine the Equations:**\n    By substituting the expression for `t_lab` into our survival equation, we get the final formula relating the survival fraction `f` to the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n    `f = exp(-(R / c) / (γ * τ)) = exp(-R / (γcτ))`\n\n5.  **Use the Two Scenarios to Solve for the Unknown:**\n    The term `K = R / (cτ)` is a constant because the detector radius and the particle's intrinsic properties (`τ`) are the same in both scenarios. The equation simplifies to `f = exp(-K / γ)`.\n\n    *   **Scenario 1:** `f₁ = 1/3` when `γ₁ = 20`.\n        `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n        Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`, which simplifies to `K = 20 * ln(3)`.\n\n    *   **Scenario 2:** `f₂ = 2/3` when `γ₂` is the unknown factor.\n        `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n        Taking the natural logarithm: `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`, which simplifies to `γ₂ = -K / ln(2/3)`.\n\n    Now, substitute the expression for `K` from the first scenario into the equation for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = -ln(b/a)`, we can simplify the expression:\n    `γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / -ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n    Using the approximate values `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`:\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055) ≈ 54.19`\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Reference Frames:** It is crucial to distinguish between the proper time (`t_p`) experienced by the particle and the time measured in the lab frame (`t_lab`). The exponential decay law must use the proper time in its exponent.\n*   **Ultra-relativistic Approximation:** The assumption that the particle's speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c` is justified by the problem statement and simplifies the calculation of the travel time.\n*   **Logical Consistency:** To have a larger fraction of particles survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), they must decay more slowly from the lab's perspective. This requires a larger time dilation effect, which in turn requires a higher Lorentz factor. Our result `γ₂ ≈ 54` is greater than `γ₁ = 20`, which is consistent with the physics.\n*   **Matching Calculation to Options:** The calculated value of ~54.2 corresponds directly to option A.\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem requires applying the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation, to the exponential decay of particles.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Formulate the Survival Equation:**\n    The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive a journey is determined by the exponential decay law.

Understanding the Physical Principles**\n\nThe problem combines two core concepts from modern physics:\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The fraction of unstable particles (`f`) that have not decayed after a certain time is described by an exponential function. In the particle's own rest frame (proper time `t_p`), this is `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`, where `τ` is the particle's proper mean lifetime.\n*   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** From the perspective of the stationary detector (the lab frame), the particle's internal clock runs slower. The time measured in the lab frame (`t_lab`) is related to the proper time by the Lorentz factor `γ`: `t_lab = γ * t_p`. Consequently, the particle's lifetime appears longer in the lab frame: `τ_lab = γ * τ`.\n\n### **2. Formulating the Governing Equation**\n\nFirst, we determine the time it takes for the particles to reach the detector wall in the lab frame (`t_lab`).

Understand the Physics and Formulate the Core Equation**\n\nThe problem involves the decay of relativistic particles. The key principles are exponential decay and time dilation from special relativity.\n\n*   The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive after a certain time is given by the exponential decay law. This law is fundamentally based on the time experienced by the particle itself, known as its proper time, `t_p`. The formula is `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`, where `τ` is the particle's mean proper lifetime.\n*   From the laboratory's perspective, the particle travels a distance `R` (the detector radius) in a time `t_lab`. Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`, so `t_lab ≈ R/c`.\n*   Due to time dilation, the time measured in the lab frame (`t_lab`) is longer than the proper time (`t_p`) experienced by the particle. The relationship is `t_lab = γ * t_p`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor. Therefore, the proper time that passes for the particle during its journey is `t_p = t_lab / γ = (R/c) / γ`.\n*   Substituting this into the decay formula gives us the survival fraction as a function of the Lorentz factor:\n    `f = exp(-(R / (γ * c)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n**2. Use a Ratio to Solve for the Unknown**\n\nThe term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant for this specific particle and detector setup. Let's call this constant `K`. The equation simplifies to `f = exp(-K / γ)`.\n\nWe can solve for `γ` by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(f) = -K / γ`\n`γ * ln(f) = -K`\nSince `-K` is a constant, the product `γ * ln(f)` must be the same for both scenarios.\n\n*   **Scenario 1:** `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`\n*   **Scenario 2:** `γ₂ = ?`, `f₂ = 2/3`\n\nTherefore, we can set up the following equality:\n`γ₁ * ln(f₁) = γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n\n**3.

Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. So, `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n    *   Due to time dilation, the proper time `t_p` experienced by the particle is related to the lab time `t_lab` by the Lorentz factor `γ`: `t_p = t_lab / γ`.\n    *   Substituting these into the decay law, we get the survival fraction as a function of the Lorentz factor:\n        `f = exp(-(R / (c * γ)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n3.  **Identify Constants and Variables:**\n    *   The detector radius `R`, the speed of light `c`, and the particle's proper lifetime `τ` are all constant for both scenarios.

Understand the Physics**\n\nThe problem combines two core concepts from physics:\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The fraction of unstable particles, `f`, that survive after a certain proper time `t_p` (the time in the particle's own reference frame) is given by `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`, where `τ` is the particle's mean proper lifetime.\n*   **Time Dilation:** Due to special relativity, a moving particle's clock runs slower than a stationary observer's clock. The time measured in the lab frame, `t_lab`, is related to the proper time `t_p` by the Lorentz factor `γ`: `t_lab = γ * t_p`.\n\n### **2. Formulate the Governing Equation**\n\nWe need to express the survival fraction `f` in terms of the lab-frame quantities.\n\n*   The time it takes for a particle to travel the detector radius `R` in the lab frame is `t_lab = R / v`.\n*   The problem states the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" which means their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. So, `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n*   The proper time experienced by the particle during this flight is `t_p = t_lab / γ = (R / c) / γ`.\n*   Substituting this proper time into the decay equation gives the survival fraction as a function of the Lorentz factor:\n    `f = exp(-(R / (cγ)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γcτ))`\n\n### **3. Set Up a Ratio to Solve for the Unknown**\n\nThe term `R / (cτ)` is a constant because the detector radius `R`, the speed of light `c`, and the particle's proper lifetime `τ` do not change between the two scenarios. Let's call this constant `K`.\n\nThe equation simplifies to: `f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\nWe can now apply this to the two scenarios:\n\n*   **Scenario 1:** `f₁ = 1/3` when `γ₁ = 20`.\n    `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n*   **Scenario 2:** `f₂ = 2/3` when `γ₂ = ?`.\n    `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\nTo solve for `γ₂`, we can first take the natural logarithm of both equations:\n1.  `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`  =>  `K = -20 * ln(1/3) = 20 * ln(3)`\n2.  `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`  =>  `K = -γ₂ * ln(2/3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\nSince `K` is the same in both cases, we can set the two expressions for `K` equal to each other:\n`20 * ln(3) = γ₂ * ln(3/2)`\n\n### **4.

Understand the Underlying Physics**\n\nThe problem involves two key concepts from physics:\n*   **Exponential Decay:** Unstable particles decay over time. The fraction `f` of particles that survive after a time `t_p` in their own reference frame (proper time) is given by `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`, where `τ` is the particle's mean proper lifetime.\n*   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** A particle moving with a high velocity experiences time more slowly than a stationary observer. The time measured in the laboratory's frame (`t_lab`) is related to the particle's proper time (`t_p`) by the Lorentz factor `γ`: `t_lab = γ * t_p`.\n\n### **2. Formulate the Governing Equation**\n\nWe need to find the fraction of particles that survive the journey from the center to the wall of the detector.\n\n*   **Time of Flight (Lab Frame):** The particles travel a distance `R` (the detector radius) at a velocity `v`. Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time of flight in the lab frame is `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n*   **Proper Time of Flight:** The time that passes for the particle itself during this journey is `t_p = t_lab / γ = (R / c) / γ`.\n*   **Survival Fraction Formula:** We substitute this proper time into the decay equation:\n    `f = exp(-(R / (γc)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γcτ))`\n\nThe term `R / (cτ)` depends only on the detector's radius and the intrinsic properties of the particle, so it is a constant for both scenarios. Let's call this constant `K`. The equation simplifies to:\n`f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n### **3. Set Up Equations for Both Scenarios**\n\nWe can now use the given information to create two equations.\n\n*   **Scenario 1:** A fraction `f₁ = 1/3` of particles survive with a Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`.\n    `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n\n*   **Scenario 2:** We want to find the Lorentz factor `γ₂` for which a fraction `f₂ = 2/3` of particles survive.\n    `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\n### **4. Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (γ₂)**\n\nThe most direct way to solve this is to first isolate the constant `K` in each equation by taking the natural logarithm (`ln`).\n\n*   From Scenario 1:\n    `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n    `-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n    `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n*   From Scenario 2:\n    `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n    `γ₂ = -K / ln(2/3)`\n\nNow, substitute the expression for `K` from the first step into the second:\n`γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3)`\n\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = -ln(b/a)`, we can simplify `ln(2/3)` to `-ln(3/2)`:\n`γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / (-ln(3/2))`\n`γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\n### **5. Calculate the Numerical Value**\n\nUsing the approximate values for natural logarithms (`ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`):\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\n### **6.

Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time of flight in the lab frame is `t_lab ≈ R/c`. Due to time dilation, the proper time experienced by the particle is shorter than the lab time, related by the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n    `t_p = t_lab / γ = (R/c) / γ`\n\n3.  **Combine the Equations:** Substituting the expression for proper time into the survival equation gives the fraction of survivors as a function of the Lorentz factor:\n    `f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ)) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n4.  **Identify the Constant:** For a given particle type and detector setup, the radius `R`, the speed of light `c`, and the proper lifetime `τ` are all constants.

The time measured in the lab frame, `t_lab`, is related to the proper time, `t_p`, by the Lorentz factor, `γ`, as `t_lab = γ * t_p`.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Governing Equation\nWe need to express the survival fraction `f` in terms of the lab-frame variables.\n*   The time it takes for a particle to travel the detector radius `R` in the lab frame is `t_lab = R / v`. Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`, so `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n*   The proper time experienced by the particle during this flight is `t_p = t_lab / γ = (R / c) / γ`.\n*   Substituting this proper time into the decay equation gives the survival fraction:\n    `f = exp(-t_p / τ) = exp(-(R / (c * γ)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n### Step 3: Use the Two Scenarios to Solve for the Unknown\nThe term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant because the detector radius and the particle's intrinsic properties do not change. Let's call this constant `A`. The equation simplifies to:\n`f = exp(-A / γ)`\n\nWe can solve for `A` by taking the natural logarithm:\n`ln(f) = -A / γ`  =>  `A = -γ * ln(f)`\n\nSince `A` is constant for both scenarios, we can write:\n`A = -γ₁ * ln(f₁) = -γ₂ * ln(f₂)`\n\n*   **Scenario 1:** `γ₁ = 20`, `f₁ = 1/3`\n*   **Scenario 2:** `γ₂ = ?`, `f₂ = 2/3`\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n`-20 * ln(1/3) = -γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n\nThe negative signs on both sides cancel out:\n`20 * ln(1/3) = γ₂ * ln(2/3)`\n\nNow, solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = 20 * (ln(1/3) / ln(2/3))`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Numerical Value\nUsing the properties of logarithms (`ln(1/x) = -ln(x)` and `ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b)`):\n`γ₂ = 20 * (-ln(3)) / (ln(2) - ln(3))`\n`γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / (ln(3) - ln(2))`\n`γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)`\n\nUsing the approximate values `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`:\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n*   **Physical Sanity Check:** To have a larger fraction of particles survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), they need to experience less proper time during their flight.

The key physical principles are:\n1.  **Exponential Decay:** The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive after a time `t'` in their own rest frame (proper time) is given by `f = exp(-t' / τ)`, where `τ` is the particle's proper mean lifetime.\n2.  **Time Dilation:** From the perspective of the laboratory (the detector), the particle's internal clock runs slower. The time elapsed in the lab frame (`t_lab`) is related to the proper time (`t'`) by the Lorentz factor `γ`: `t_lab = γ * t'`.\n\n### **Step 2: Formulate the Survival Equation**\n\nWe need to find the fraction of particles `f` that survive the journey to the detector wall.\n\n1.  **Time of Flight (Lab Frame):** The particles travel a distance `R` (the detector radius). Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time of flight in the lab frame is `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n2.  **Proper Time of Flight:** The time that passes for the particle itself during this journey is the proper time `t' = t_lab / γ = (R/c) / γ`.\n3.  **Survival Fraction Formula:** We substitute this proper time `t'` into the exponential decay law:\n    `f = exp(-t' / τ) = exp(-(R / (γ * c)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n### **Step 3: Use the Two Scenarios to Solve for the Unknown**\n\nThe term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant because the detector radius and the particle's intrinsic properties do not change. Let's call this constant `K`. The equation simplifies to:\n`f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\nWe can solve this for `γ` by first taking the natural logarithm:\n`ln(f) = -K / γ`\n`γ = -K / ln(f)`\n\nNow, let's set up a ratio between the two scenarios to eliminate the unknown constant `K`:\n\n*   **Scenario 1:** `f₁ = 1/3`, `γ₁ = 20`\n*   **Scenario 2:** `f₂ = 2/3`, `γ₂ = ?`\n\n`γ₂ / γ₁ = [-K / ln(f₂)] / [-K / ln(f₁)]`\n`γ₂ / γ₁ = ln(f₁) / ln(f₂)`\n\nNow, solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = γ₁ * (ln(f₁) / ln(f₂))`\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Numerical Value**\n\nSubstitute the known values into the equation:\n`γ₂ = 20 * (ln(1/3) / ln(2/3))`\n\nUsing the properties of logarithms (`ln(1/x) = -ln(x)`):\n`γ₂ = 20 * [-ln(3)] / [-ln(3/2)]`\n`γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n\nNow, we calculate the value:\n*   `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986`\n*   `ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`\n\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n`γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\n### **Step 5: Compare with Options and Conclude**\n\nThe calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately **54.2**.

The key concepts are the exponential decay law and the special relativity effect of time dilation.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Core Equation:** The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive after traveling a certain distance is determined by the time elapsed in their own reference frame (proper time).\n    *   The time of flight in the lab frame is `t_lab = R / v`. Given the particles are ultra-relativistic, their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`, so `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n    *   Due to time dilation, the particle's internal clock runs slower. The time elapsed in the particle's rest frame (proper time, `t_p`) is related to the lab time by the Lorentz factor, `γ`: `t_p = t_lab / γ`.\n    *   The fraction of surviving particles follows the exponential decay law based on the proper time: `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`, where `τ` is the particle's proper mean lifetime.\n    *   Substituting the expressions for time, we get the survival fraction as a function of the Lorentz factor:\n        `f = exp(-(R / (cγ)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γcτ))`\n\n3.  **Set Up a Ratio for the Two Scenarios:** The term `K = R / (cτ)` is a constant because the detector radius `R`, the speed of light `c`, and the particle's proper lifetime `τ` are the same in both scenarios.

The solution involves combining the principles of exponential decay and special relativistic time dilation.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Formulate the Survival Equation:**\n    The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive after traveling a certain distance is governed by the exponential decay law. This law must be expressed in terms of the particle's own experienced time (proper time, `t_p`), not the time measured in the laboratory (`t_lab`).\n    The survival fraction is `f = exp(-t_p / τ)`, where `τ` is the particle's mean proper lifetime.\n\n2.  **Apply Time Dilation:**\n    According to special relativity, the time experienced by the moving particle (`t_p`) is shorter than the time measured by the stationary detector (`t_lab`) due to time dilation. The relationship is `t_p = t_lab / γ`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n    Substituting this into the survival equation gives: `f = exp(-(t_lab / γ) / τ)`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Lab Time of Flight:**\n    The particles travel from the center of the detector to the wall, a distance equal to the radius `R = 30 m`. Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time of flight in the lab frame is `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n\n4.  **Combine the Equations:**\n    By substituting the expression for `t_lab` into our survival equation, we get the final formula relating the survival fraction `f` to the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n    `f = exp(-(R / c) / (γ * τ)) = exp(-R / (γcτ))`\n\n5.  **Use the Two Scenarios to Solve for the Unknown:**\n    The term `K = R / (cτ)` is a constant because the detector radius and the particle's intrinsic properties (`τ`) are the same in both scenarios. The equation simplifies to `f = exp(-K / γ)`.\n\n    *   **Scenario 1:** `f₁ = 1/3` when `γ₁ = 20`.\n        `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n        Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`, which simplifies to `K = 20 * ln(3)`.\n\n    *   **Scenario 2:** `f₂ = 2/3` when `γ₂` is the unknown factor.\n        `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n        Taking the natural logarithm: `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`, which simplifies to `γ₂ = -K / ln(2/3)`.\n\n    Now, substitute the expression for `K` from the first scenario into the equation for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / ln(2/3)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    Using the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = -ln(b/a)`, we can simplify the expression:\n    `γ₂ = -(20 * ln(3)) / -ln(3/2) = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)`\n    Using the approximate values `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`:\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055) ≈ 54.19`\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Reference Frames:** It is crucial to distinguish between the proper time (`t_p`) experienced by the particle and the time measured in the lab frame (`t_lab`). The exponential decay law must use the proper time in its exponent.\n*   **Ultra-relativistic Approximation:** The assumption that the particle's speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c` is justified by the problem statement and simplifies the calculation of the travel time.\n*   **Logical Consistency:** To have a larger fraction of particles survive (from 1/3 to 2/3), they must decay more slowly from the lab's perspective. This requires a larger time dilation effect, which in turn requires a higher Lorentz factor. Our result `γ₂ ≈ 54` is greater than `γ₁ = 20`, which is consistent with the physics.\n*   **Matching Calculation to Options:** The calculated value of ~54.2 corresponds directly to option A.\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem requires applying the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation, to the exponential decay of particles.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Formulate the Survival Equation:**\n    The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive a journey is determined by the exponential decay law.

The time it takes for them to travel the detector radius `R` is the lab time, `t_lab`. Since they are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`.\n    `t_lab ≈ R / c`\n    Time dilation relates the lab time to the proper time via the Lorentz factor, `γ`:\n    `t_lab = γ * t_p`\n    Therefore, the proper time experienced by the particle during its flight is:\n    `t_p = t_lab / γ = R / (γ * c)`\n\n3.  **Combine the Equations:**\n    Substitute the expression for proper time `t_p` into the survival equation:\n    `f = exp(-(R / (γ * c)) / τ) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n    The term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant for this specific particle and detector setup, as `R`, `c`, and `τ` do not change between the two scenarios. Let's call this constant `K`.\n    `f = exp(-K / γ)`\n\n4.  **Set up Equations for Both Scenarios:**\n    *   **Scenario 1:** Given `f₁ = 1/3` when `γ₁ = 20`.\n        `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`\n    *   **Scenario 2:** We need to find `γ₂` when `f₂ = 2/3`.\n        `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n\n5.  **Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (`γ₂`):**\n    A robust way to solve this is to take the natural logarithm of both equations and then find their ratio, which eliminates the constant `K`.\n    *   From Scenario 1: `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`\n    *   From Scenario 2: `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n\n    Dividing the second log equation by the first:\n    `ln(2/3) / ln(1/3) = (-K / γ₂) / (-K / 20)`\n    `ln(2/3) / ln(1/3) = 20 / γ₂`\n\n    Now, solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * [ln(1/3) / ln(2/3)]`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    Using the properties of logarithms (`ln(1/x) = -ln(x)` and `ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b)`):\n    `γ₂ = 20 * [-ln(3) / -ln(3/2)]`\n    `γ₂ = 20 * [ln(3) / ln(3/2)]`\n\n    Using the approximate values `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`:\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Time Frame:** It is crucial to use the proper time in the decay exponent, which requires converting the lab-frame travel time using the time dilation formula.\n*   **Constant Factors:** Recognizing that `R / (c * τ)` is a constant simplifies the problem significantly, avoiding the need to calculate the proper lifetime `τ`.\n*   **Logical Consistency:** For a larger fraction of particles to survive (2/3 vs 1/3), they must decay slower. This requires a larger time dilation effect, which in turn requires a higher Lorentz factor. Our result `γ₂ ≈ 54` is greater than `γ₁ = 20`, which is consistent with the physics.\n*   **Option Matching:** The calculated value of ~54.18 is closest to the numerical option 54. According to the provided list, 54 corresponds to option A.\n\nThe required Lorentz factor is approximately 54.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
