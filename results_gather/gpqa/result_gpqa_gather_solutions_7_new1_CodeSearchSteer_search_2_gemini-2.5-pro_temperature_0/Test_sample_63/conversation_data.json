Analyze the Products of Decomposition**\n\nThe problem describes heating a 7.20 g mixture of salts and analyzing the resulting gases.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This tube absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂). Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This implies the original salts do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** This tube reacts with an oxidizing gas. The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of oxygen atoms (O) that reacted with the copper to form CuO.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the three tubes, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nWe can use the law of conservation of mass to find the composition of the initial mixture. The total mass of the products must equal the initial mass of 7.20 g.\n\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n*   Mass of O atoms that reacted with Cu = 0.80 g.\n*   Mass of Gas C = Total Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O from CuO) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Note: The 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen *element* that was added to the copper. The total mass of the gas that delivered this oxygen would be higher. The correct way to use conservation of mass is to sum the masses of the final stable products.\n\nLet's identify Gas C.\n*   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   A non-reactive gas with a molar mass of 28 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂).\n\nSo, the decomposition produced H₂O, N₂, and some oxygen-containing gas that reacted with copper. Let's find the total moles of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in the 0.10 mol of N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (Moles of O in H₂O) + (Moles of O that reacted with Cu)\n    *   Moles of O = (1 × 0.20 mol) + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\nLet's verify the total mass from these elements:\n*   Mass = (0.40 mol H × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.0 g/mol)\n*   Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass, confirming our analysis.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. The overall molar ratio of the elements in the mixture (representing one formula unit of A plus one formula unit of B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\nTo get the simplest whole number ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20):\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\nTo eliminate the fraction, we multiply the entire ratio by 4:\nN : H : O = **4 : 8 : 5**\n\nThe combined formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**. Since the compounds are salts containing N, H, and O, they are likely ammonium salts. We need to find two common ammonium salts that add up to N₄H₈O₅.\n\n*   **Candidate 1: Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** → Formula: N₂H₄O₃\n*   **Candidate 2: Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)** → Formula: N₂H₄O₂\n\nLet's sum their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match. Therefore, the two salts are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\n**Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis result can also be found directly from the combined formula N₄H₈O₅:\nTotal atoms = 4 (N) + 8 (H) + 5 (O) = 17.\n\nMatching this result to the given options:\nA) 17\nB) 19\nC) 15\nD) 13\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe problem describes the decomposition of a salt mixture into gases, which are then analyzed by passing them through a series of tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂). Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This indicates the original salts do not contain elements like carbon or sulfur that would form acidic oxides.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The problem states CuO is formed, meaning an oxidizing gas transferred its oxygen to the copper. The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of these oxygen atoms.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the reactions, 2.24 L of an inert gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**. Given the context of decomposing nitrogen-containing salts, this inert gas is identified as nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### **2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Salts**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the original salt mixture. We can calculate the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in the 0.10 mol of N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that formed CuO.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O that formed CuO) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\nLet's verify the total mass of these elements:\n*   Mass = (0.40 mol H × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.0 g/mol)\n*   Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = **7.20 g**.\nThis matches the initial mass of the mixture, confirming our analysis.\n\n### **3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. The overall molar ratio of the elements in the combined formula of (A + B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n\nTo get the simplest whole number ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply to clear the fraction:\n*   Ratio = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n*   Multiplying by 4 gives the integer ratio: **N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5**\n\nSo, the combined formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**. Since the salts are composed of N, H, and O, they are almost certainly ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts of nitrogen oxyanions. We need to find two such salts whose formulas sum to N₄H₈O₅.\n\n*   **Candidate Salt 1:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃ (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n*   **Candidate Salt 2:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂ (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n\nLet's sum their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match. Therefore, the two salts in the equimolar mixture are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n### **4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**\n\n**Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 17\nB) 13\nC) 19\nD) 15\n\nThe calculated total number of atoms is 17, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products:** First, we will determine the identity and quantity (in moles) of each gaseous product formed during the heating process.\n    *   The mass increase in the tube with anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂ tells us the mass of water (H₂O) produced.\n    *   The lack of mass change in the Ca(OH)₂ solution indicates no acidic gases (like CO₂) were formed.\n    *   The mass increase in the tube with red-hot copper is due to oxygen atoms that formed CuO. We will determine the moles of oxygen atoms.\n    *   The volume of the final remaining gas (C) at STP allows us to calculate its moles. We will identify this gas based on its inertness and by verifying the law of conservation of mass.\n\n2.  **Determine Elemental Composition:** Using the moles of the products (H₂O, N₂, and the oxygen source for CuO), we will calculate the total moles of each element (Nitrogen, Hydrogen, Oxygen) present in the original 7.20 g salt mixture.\n\n3.  **Identify the Salts:** The problem states the mixture is equimolar. Based on the total elemental ratio (N:H:O), we can deduce the combined chemical formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B. Since the products are N₂, H₂O, etc., we will look for common ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions that fit this combined formula.\n\n4.  **Calculate Total Atoms:** Once the chemical formulas for salts A and B are identified, we will count the number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt and add them together to get the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Analyze the Products\n# Given data\nmass_mixture = 7.20  # g\nmass_increase_tube1 = 3.60 # g (mass of H2O)\nmass_increase_tube3 = 0.80 # g (mass of O atoms)\nvolume_gas_C_STP = 2.24 # L\n\n# Molar masses and constants\nM_H2O = 18.015  # g/mol\nM_O = 15.999    # g/mol\nV_molar_STP = 22.4 # L/mol\nM_N2 = 28.014   # g/mol\n\n# Calculate moles of products\nmoles_H2O = mass_increase_tube1 / M_H2O\nmoles_O_atoms_in_CuO = mass_increase_tube3 / M_O\nmoles_gas_C = volume_gas_C_STP / V_molar_STP\n\n# Verify the identity of Gas C by checking mass conservation\n# Total mass of products = mass(H2O) + mass(O) + mass(Gas C)\n# mass(Gas C) = mass_mixture - mass(H2O) - mass(O)\nmass_gas_C = mass_mixture - mass_increase_tube1 - mass_increase_tube3\n# Calculate molar mass of Gas C\nmolar_mass_gas_C = mass_gas_C / moles_gas_C\n# The molar mass is ~28 g/mol, confirming Gas C is Nitrogen (N2).\n\n# Step 2: Determine Elemental Composition\n# The gas reacting with Cu could be O2 or N2O.

Analyze the Products of Decomposition**\n\nThe problem describes heating a 7.20 g mixture of salts and analyzing the resulting gases. We can determine the identity and quantity of each gaseous product from the experimental data.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂.\n    *   The weight did not change, which means **no acidic gases** were produced. This rules out salts containing carbonate, sulfite, etc.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states CuO is formed, meaning the gas contained oxygen atoms that were transferred to the copper.\n    *   The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen atoms that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all tubes, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Mixture**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, the total mass of the products must equal the initial mass of the reactants. We can also determine the elemental composition of the original salts.\n\n*   First, let's identify Gas C. The total mass of the initial mixture is 7.20 g. The mass of the known products (H₂O and the oxygen that reacted with Cu) is 3.60 g + 0.80 g = 4.40 g.\n*   The mass of Gas C must be the remaining mass: 7.20 g - 4.40 g = 2.80 g.\n*   We can now calculate the molar mass of Gas C: Molar Mass = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   A non-reactive gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is **nitrogen (N₂)**.\n\nNow we can find the total moles of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture:\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in the 0.10 mol of N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (1 × moles of H₂O) + (moles of O atoms from Tube 3) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the initial substance was an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. The overall molar ratio of the elements in this mixture is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n\nTo find the simplest whole number ratio, we can divide all values by the smallest number (0.20):\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n\nTo eliminate the decimal, we multiply the entire ratio by 4:\nN : H : O = **4 : 8 : 5**\n\nThis means the combined chemical formula of one unit of salt A and one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**. Since the salts are composed of N, H, and O, and decompose into gases, they are very likely to be ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions.\n\nLet's test the most common candidates:\n*   **Salt Candidate 1:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₃**.\n*   **Salt Candidate 2:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\nLet's sum the atoms in one formula unit of each:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**\n\nThis sum perfectly matches the elemental ratio we calculated. Therefore, the salts A and B are **ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** and **ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means we need to sum the number of atoms in one formula unit of NH₄NO₃ and one formula unit of NH₄NO₂.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\n**Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Identify the Products and Their Quantities**\n\nThe problem describes the thermal decomposition of a salt mixture and the subsequent analysis of the gaseous products.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass increase = 3.60 g. This is the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂).\n    *   The weight did not change, meaning **no acidic gases** were produced. This rules out salts containing carbonate, sulfite, etc.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states CuO is formed, meaning the gas transferred oxygen atoms to the copper.\n    *   Mass increase = 0.80 g. This is the mass of the oxygen atoms that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Final Gas C:** The remaining gas is inert to the previous reagents.\n    *   Volume at STP = 2.24 L.\n    *   At Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP), 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Mixture**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial salt mixture.\n\n*   **Mass of Gas C:** We can find the mass of Gas C by subtracting the masses of the other products from the initial total mass.\n    *   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g (total) - 3.60 g (H₂O) - 0.80 g (O atoms) = 2.80 g.\n*   **Identity of Gas C:** We can now find the molar mass of Gas C.\n    *   Molar Mass = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   A gas with a molar mass of ~28 g/mol that is inert in this context is nitrogen (N₂).\n\nNow we can find the total moles of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture:\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N is in the 0.10 mol of N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that formed CuO.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O that formed CuO)\n    *   Moles of O = (1 × 0.20 mol) + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the initial substance was an **equimolar mixture** of two salts, A and B. The overall molar ratio of the elements in this mixture is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n\nTo get a simple integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply to clear fractions:\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\nMultiplying by 4 gives the integer ratio:\n**N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5**\n\nThis means that the combined chemical formula of one unit of salt A and one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**. Since the salts are composed of N, H, and O, and decompose into gases, they are very likely to be ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions. Let's find two common salts that sum to N₄H₈O₅.\n\n*   **Candidate Salt 1:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₃**.\n*   **Candidate Salt 2:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\nLet's sum the atoms in one formula unit of each:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**\n\nThis sum perfectly matches the elemental ratio we calculated. Therefore, the salts A and B are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Analysis of the Gaseous Products and Their Quantities\n\nThe problem describes the heating of a salt mixture and the subsequent analysis of the gaseous products. We can determine the identity and amount of each product from the experimental data.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases (e.g., CO₂). Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This indicates the original salts do not contain elements like carbon or sulfur that would form acidic oxides.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the formation of CuO, meaning 0.80 g of oxygen atoms from the gas stream reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n    *   This oxygen could have been delivered by O₂ gas (in which case 0.025 mol of O₂ reacted) or another oxygen-containing gas like N₂O (in which case 0.05 mol of N₂O reacted). Both possibilities lead to the same final conclusion.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remained at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n    *   Given the context of decomposing nitrogen-containing salts, this inert gas is identified as nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### 2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Salt Mixture\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, the elements in the products must have come from the original salts.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in the H₂O and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (1 × Moles of H₂O) + (Moles of O atoms that formed CuO) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen ends up as N₂ gas.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × Moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\nLet's verify the total mass: (0.40 mol H × 1 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14 g/mol) = 0.4 g + 4.0 g + 2.8 g = 7.20 g. This matches the initial mass, confirming our analysis.\n\n### 3. Identification of Salts A and B\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. The overall molar ratio of the elements in the combined salts (A+B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\nTo get a simple integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply by 4:\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25  =>  **4 : 8 : 5**\n\nSo, the combined chemical formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nWe need to find two common salts composed of N, H, and O that sum to this formula. The most logical candidates are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions:\n*   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** Formula is N₂H₄O₃.\n*   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** Formula is N₂H₄O₂.\n\nAdding their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match. Therefore, salts A and B are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n### 4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Products of Decomposition**\n\nThe problem describes heating a 7.20 g equimolar mixture of salts A and B, then analyzing the resulting gases.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂). Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This indicates the salts do not contain elements like carbon or sulfur.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen atoms binding to the copper to form CuO.\n    *   Molar mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n    *   This oxygen could have come from O₂ gas (in which case 0.025 mol of O₂ reacted) or another oxidizing gas like N₂O (in which case 0.05 mol of N₂O reacted). Both possibilities will be considered.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the reactions, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n    *   Given the context, this inert gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### **2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Salts**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, the elements in the products must have come from the original salts. Let's calculate the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in the H₂O and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles of O from H₂O) + (moles of O that formed CuO)\n    *   Moles of O = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in the final gas C (N₂) and potentially in the gas that reacted with copper if it was N₂O.\n    *   Let's check the total mass. Mass = (0.40 mol H × 1 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16 g/mol) = 0.4 g + 4.0 g = 4.4 g.\n    *   The remaining mass must be nitrogen: 7.20 g (total) - 4.4 g = 2.8 g.\n    *   Moles of N = 2.8 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   This corresponds to 0.10 mol of N₂ gas, which perfectly matches the amount of gas C collected. This confirms our analysis.\n\n### **3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe initial mixture contained 0.20 mol N, 0.40 mol H, and 0.25 mol O. The molar ratio of the elements is N:H:O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25. To get a simple integer ratio, we can multiply by 20, which gives **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nSince the mixture is equimolar, this formula represents the sum of one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B. The salts are composed of N, H, and O, which strongly suggests they are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. We need to find two such salts whose formulas add up to N₄H₈O₅.\n\n*   **Candidate Salt 1:** Ammonium nitrate, **NH₄NO₃** (formula N₂H₄O₃)\n*   **Candidate Salt 2:** Ammonium nitrite, **NH₄NO₂** (formula N₂H₄O₂)\n\nLet's sum their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match. Therefore, salts A and B are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\nThis identification is consistent with the decomposition products. Depending on the exact conditions, the decomposition can be viewed as:\n*   NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n*   NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O (N₂O then reacts with Cu: N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO)\n*   OR 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n\nBoth interpretations lead to the same identification of the salts.\n\n### **4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in one formula unit of each).\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Gaseous Products\nThe problem describes heating a mixture of salts and passing the resulting gases through a series of analytical tubes. By examining the changes in each tube, we can identify the products and their quantities.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This indicates the original salts do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the formation of CuO, meaning the gas stream contained an oxidizing agent that supplied 0.80 g of oxygen.\n    *   Molar mass of Oxygen (O) = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen could have been supplied by O₂ gas (requiring 0.025 mol of O₂) or another oxidizing gas like N₂O (requiring 0.05 mol of N₂O). Both possibilities will be considered.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all tubes, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Given the context, this inert gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### 2. Determination of Elemental Composition and Mass Conservation\nWe can determine the elemental makeup of the original 7.20 g mixture from the products.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Total Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in the final 0.10 mol of N₂ (and potentially from N₂O if that was the gas in tube 3, but that N₂ would also end up in the final gas C).\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in the H₂O and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O that formed CuO) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n\nLet's verify the total mass of these elements:\n*   Mass = (0.40 mol H × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.0 g/mol)\n*   Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass of the mixture, confirming that the salts A and B are composed only of Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen.\n\n### 3. Identification of Salts A and B\nThe problem states the initial mixture was equimolar. The overall molar ratio of the elements in the combined salts (A+B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\nTo get a simple integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply by 4:\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25  (multiplied by 4) → **4 : 8 : 5**\n\nSo, the combined chemical formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nSince the salts are composed of N, H, and O, and decompose into gases, they are very likely ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. We need to find two such salts whose formulas sum to N₄H₈O₅.\n*   **Candidate Salt 1:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Formula: **N₂H₄O₃**.\n*   **Candidate Salt 2:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂. Formula: **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\nSumming their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match. Therefore, the two salts in the equimolar mixture are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n### 4.

We can determine the identity and quantity of each gaseous product from the experimental data.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Using the molar mass of H₂O (≈18.0 g/mol):\n        Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂.\n    *   The weight did not change, which means no acidic gases were produced. This rules out salts containing carbonate, sulfite, etc., and indicates the original salts do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states CuO is formed, and the mass increased by 0.80 g.\n    *   This mass increase is due to oxygen atoms binding to the copper.\n    *   Using the molar mass of oxygen atoms (O ≈ 16.0 g/mol):\n        Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This means the gas passing through this tube delivered 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms. This could have been O₂ gas or another oxygen-containing gas like N₂O.\n\n*   **Final Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Given the context, this inert gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2.

Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. The total elemental content (0.20 mol N, 0.40 mol H, 0.25 mol O) comes from an equal number of moles of salt A and salt B. Therefore, the ratio of atoms in the combined formula unit of (A + B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n\nTo get a simple integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20):\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n\nTo eliminate the fraction, we multiply the entire ratio by 4:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\n\nSo, the combined formula for one molecule of salt A plus one molecule of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nSince the salts are composed of N, H, and O, they are likely ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions. Let's find two common salts whose formulas sum to N₄H₈O₅.\n\n*   **Candidate Salt 1:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Its formula is N₂H₄O₃.\n*   **Candidate Salt 2:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂.

The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of these oxygen atoms.\n    *   Molar Mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This is the total amount of oxygen atoms delivered by the gas that reacted in this tube.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Given the context of decomposing nitrogen-containing salts, this inert gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the original 7.20 g mixture. Let's calculate the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H atoms = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in the H₂O and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O in tube #3) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** We can find the mass of nitrogen by subtracting the masses of hydrogen and oxygen from the total mass.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of N = Total Mass - Mass(H) - Mass(O) = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\nThe initial mixture contained 0.20 mol N, 0.40 mol H, and 0.25 mol O.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. This means the combined formula of one unit of salt A and one unit of salt B must have an elemental ratio of N:H:O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n\n*   To get a simple integer ratio, divide by the smallest value (0.20): N:H:O = 1 : 2 : 1.25.\n*   Multiply by 4 to eliminate the decimal: **N:H:O = 4 : 8 : 5**.\n\nSo, the combined formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**. We need to find two common salts composed of N, H, and O that sum to this formula. The most logical candidates are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n\n*   **Salt Candidate 1:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Formula: **N₂H₄O₃**.\n*   **Salt Candidate 2:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂. Formula: **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\nLet's sum their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match. Therefore, salts A and B are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n**4.

The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This tube absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂). Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This implies the original salts do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen atoms binding to the copper to form CuO.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n    *   This oxygen came from an oxidizing gas in the mixture.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the three tubes, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n    *   Given the context, this inert gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n**2.

Let's calculate the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol H**.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles of O from H₂O) + (moles of O that formed CuO)\n    *   Moles of O = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol O**.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** The total nitrogen can be found by difference or by analyzing the nitrogen-containing products. Let's use the mass balance to confirm the identity of Gas C.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g\n    *   Mass of N = Total Mass - Mass(H) - Mass(O) = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g\n    *   Moles of N = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol N**.\n    *   Since Gas C has 0.10 mol, and it is N₂, it contains 0.10 mol × 2 = 0.20 mol of N atoms. This confirms our calculations.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe initial mixture contained 0.20 mol N, 0.40 mol H, and 0.25 mol O. The problem states the mixture is **equimolar**, meaning it contains `n` moles of salt A and `n` moles of salt B.\n\nThe overall molar ratio of the elements in the combined formula unit (A+B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\nTo get a simple integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply to clear fractions:\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\nMultiplying by 4 gives the integer ratio: **N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5**.\n\nSo, the combined formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nThe salts are composed of N, H, and O, and decompose into gases, which strongly suggests they are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. We need to find two such salts whose formulas sum to N₄H₈O₅.\n\n*   **Candidate Salt 1:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Formula: **N₂H₄O₃**.\n*   **Candidate Salt 2:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂. Formula: **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\nLet's sum their formulas:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**.\nThis is a perfect match. Therefore, the two salts are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of A and one formula unit of B.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = **8 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C in the provided list.\n\n*Note: Several candidate answers correctly calculated the number of atoms to be 17 but then selected the wrong letter.

The correct number is 17, which is option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Products and Their Molar Quantities**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   The molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This tube absorbs acidic gases. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases (like CO₂) were formed. This indicates the original salts do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen atoms binding to the copper to form CuO.\n    *   The molar mass of an oxygen atom (O) is approximately 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Mixture**\n\nWe can now find the total moles of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Total moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Total moles of O = (1 × 0.20 mol from H₂O) + (0.05 mol from Tube #3) = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** The remaining mass must be nitrogen. Let's verify this.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of N = Total Mass - Mass(H) - Mass(O) = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   The final gas C had 0.10 mol. If this gas is N₂, it contains 0.10 mol × 2 = 0.20 mol of N atoms. This matches our calculation, confirming Gas C is N₂.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe overall molar ratio of the elements in the combined salts (A+B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n\nTo find the simplest whole number ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20):\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n\nTo make all numbers integers, we multiply the ratio by 4:\nN : H : O = **4 : 8 : 5**\n\nThis means the combined chemical formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B is N₄H₈O₅. The problem states the mixture is equimolar. We need to find two common salts (composed of N, H, and O) that add up to this formula. The most plausible candidates are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n\n*   **Salt Candidate 1:** Ammonium nitrate, **NH₄NO₃** (formula N₂H₄O₃)\n*   **Salt Candidate 2:** Ammonium nitrite, **NH₄NO₂** (formula N₂H₄O₂)\n\nLet's sum their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**.

Analysis of the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe problem describes the heating of a salt mixture and the subsequent analysis of the gaseous products. We can determine the identity and quantity of each product from the experimental data.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution detects acidic gases (like CO₂). Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This rules out salts containing carbonate or other anions that would produce acidic gases upon decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen atoms binding to the copper to form CuO.\n    *   Molar mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n    *   This oxygen could have come from O₂ gas or another oxygen-containing gas like N₂O.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all tubes, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n### **2. Determining the Elemental Composition of the Salts**\n\nWe can use the law of conservation of mass to find the composition of the original 7.20 g mixture. The products contain only Hydrogen, Oxygen, and the elements in Gas C.\n\n*   **Mass of H₂O** = 3.60 g\n*   **Mass of Oxygen** that reacted with copper = 0.80 g\n*   **Mass of Gas C** = Initial Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O from gas) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n*   **Molar Mass of Gas C** = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   A gas with a molar mass of ~28 g/mol that is inert in these conditions is nitrogen (N₂).\n\nSo, the decomposition produced 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.10 mol N₂, and a gas that supplied 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms. The total mass of these products (3.60 g H₂O + 2.80 g N₂ + 0.80 g O) is 7.20 g, confirming our analysis.\n\nNow, let's find the total moles of each element in the original mixture:\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** From 0.20 mol H₂O → 2 × 0.20 = **0.40 mol H**.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** From 0.10 mol N₂ → 2 × 0.10 = **0.20 mol N**.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** From 0.20 mol H₂O and the 0.05 mol O that reacted with copper → (1 × 0.20) + 0.05 = **0.25 mol O**.\n\n### **3. Identifying Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. The overall molar ratio of the elements in the combined salts (A+B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n\nTo get a simple integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply to clear the fraction:\n1 : 2 : 1.25  (multiplied by 4) → **4 : 8 : 5**\n\nSo, the combined formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nGiven that the salts contain N, H, and O and decompose into gases, they are almost certainly ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. We need to find two such salts whose formulas sum to N₄H₈O₅.\n*   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** Formula is N₂H₄O₃.\n*   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** Formula is N₂H₄O₂.\n\nAdding their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match. Therefore, the two salts in the equimolar mixture are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n### **4. Calculating the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to calculate the total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\nThe total number of all atoms is the sum of the atoms in both salts:\nTotal Atoms = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1.

Since its weight did not change, **no acidic gases were produced**.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states CuO is formed, so the mass increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen atoms reacting with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Gas C:** The remaining gas, which passed through all tubes unreacted, has a volume of 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2.

Let's find the mass first: 7.20 g (initial) - 3.60 g (H₂O) - 0.80 g (O in CuO) = 2.80 g.\n*   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   A non-reactive gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂).\n\nNow we can find the total moles of each element in the original mixture:\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N is in the 0.10 mol of N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (1 × moles of H₂O) + (moles of O atoms) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states we have an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B.

The total mass of the initial mixture is 7.20 g. The mass of the known products (water and the oxygen that reacted with copper) is 3.60 g + 0.80 g = 4.40 g. The remaining mass must belong to Gas C.\n    *   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g - 4.40 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   We can now calculate the molar mass of Gas C: Molar Mass = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   A non-reactive gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n*   Now, we can find the total moles of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture:\n    *   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n        *   Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n    *   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in the 0.10 mol of N₂.\n        *   Moles of N = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with copper.\n        *   Moles of O = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O that formed CuO) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n### **3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the initial substance was an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. The overall molar ratio of the elements in this mixture is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n\nTo find the simplest whole number ratio, we can divide all values by the smallest number (0.20) and then multiply to clear the fraction:\n*   Divide by 0.20: N : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n*   Multiply by 4: N : H : O = **4 : 8 : 5**\n\nThis means the combined chemical formula of one unit of salt A and one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**. Since the salts are composed of N, H, and O, they are very likely to be ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions.\n\nLet's test common candidates:\n*   **Salt Candidate 1:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₃**.\n*   **Salt Candidate 2:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\nSumming the atoms in one formula unit of each:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**\n\nThis sum perfectly matches the elemental ratio we calculated. Therefore, the salts A and B are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\n### **4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means we need to sum the number of atoms in one formula unit of NH₄NO₃ and one formula unit of NH₄NO₂.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\n**Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 13\nB) 19\nC) 17\nD) 15\n\nThe calculated total number of atoms is 17, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"

Analyze the Products of Decomposition**\n\nThe problem describes heating a 7.20 g mixture of salts and analyzing the resulting gases.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This tube absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂). Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This implies the original salts do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** This tube reacts with an oxidizing gas. The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of oxygen atoms (O) that reacted with the copper to form CuO.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the three tubes, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nWe can use the law of conservation of mass to find the composition of the initial mixture. The total mass of the products must equal the initial mass of 7.20 g.\n\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n*   Mass of O atoms that reacted with Cu = 0.80 g.\n*   Mass of Gas C = Total Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O from CuO) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Note: The 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen *element* that was added to the copper. The total mass of the gas that delivered this oxygen would be higher. The correct way to use conservation of mass is to sum the masses of the final stable products.\n\nLet's identify Gas C.\n*   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   A non-reactive gas with a molar mass of 28 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂).\n\nSo, the decomposition produced H₂O, N₂, and some oxygen-containing gas that reacted with copper. Let's find the total moles of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in the 0.10 mol of N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (Moles of O in H₂O) + (Moles of O that reacted with Cu)\n    *   Moles of O = (1 × 0.20 mol) + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\nLet's verify the total mass from these elements:\n*   Mass = (0.40 mol H × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.0 g/mol)\n*   Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass, confirming our analysis.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. The overall molar ratio of the elements in the mixture (representing one formula unit of A plus one formula unit of B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\nTo get the simplest whole number ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20):\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\nTo eliminate the fraction, we multiply the entire ratio by 4:\nN : H : O = **4 : 8 : 5**\n\nThe combined formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**. Since the compounds are salts containing N, H, and O, they are likely ammonium salts. We need to find two common ammonium salts that add up to N₄H₈O₅.\n\n*   **Candidate 1: Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** → Formula: N₂H₄O₃\n*   **Candidate 2: Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)** → Formula: N₂H₄O₂\n\nLet's sum their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match. Therefore, the two salts are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\n**Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis result can also be found directly from the combined formula N₄H₈O₅:\nTotal atoms = 4 (N) + 8 (H) + 5 (O) = 17.\n\nMatching this result to the given options:\nA) 17\nB) 19\nC) 15\nD) 13\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe problem describes the decomposition of a salt mixture into gases, which are then analyzed by passing them through a series of tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂). Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This indicates the original salts do not contain elements like carbon or sulfur that would form acidic oxides.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The problem states CuO is formed, meaning an oxidizing gas transferred its oxygen to the copper. The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of these oxygen atoms.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms (O) = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the reactions, 2.24 L of an inert gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**. Given the context of decomposing nitrogen-containing salts, this inert gas is identified as nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### **2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Salts**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the original salt mixture. We can calculate the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in the 0.10 mol of N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that formed CuO.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O that formed CuO) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\nLet's verify the total mass of these elements:\n*   Mass = (0.40 mol H × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.0 g/mol)\n*   Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = **7.20 g**.\nThis matches the initial mass of the mixture, confirming our analysis.\n\n### **3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. The overall molar ratio of the elements in the combined formula of (A + B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n\nTo get the simplest whole number ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply to clear the fraction:\n*   Ratio = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n*   Multiplying by 4 gives the integer ratio: **N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5**\n\nSo, the combined formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**. Since the salts are composed of N, H, and O, they are almost certainly ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts of nitrogen oxyanions. We need to find two such salts whose formulas sum to N₄H₈O₅.\n\n*   **Candidate Salt 1:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃ (Formula: N₂H₄O₃)\n*   **Candidate Salt 2:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂ (Formula: N₂H₄O₂)\n\nLet's sum their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match. Therefore, the two salts in the equimolar mixture are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n### **4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**\n\n**Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 17\nB) 13\nC) 19\nD) 15\n\nThe calculated total number of atoms is 17, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Products:** First, we will determine the identity and quantity (in moles) of each gaseous product formed during the heating process.\n    *   The mass increase in the tube with anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂ tells us the mass of water (H₂O) produced.\n    *   The lack of mass change in the Ca(OH)₂ solution indicates no acidic gases (like CO₂) were formed.\n    *   The mass increase in the tube with red-hot copper is due to oxygen atoms that formed CuO. We will determine the moles of oxygen atoms.\n    *   The volume of the final remaining gas (C) at STP allows us to calculate its moles. We will identify this gas based on its inertness and by verifying the law of conservation of mass.\n\n2.  **Determine Elemental Composition:** Using the moles of the products (H₂O, N₂, and the oxygen source for CuO), we will calculate the total moles of each element (Nitrogen, Hydrogen, Oxygen) present in the original 7.20 g salt mixture.\n\n3.  **Identify the Salts:** The problem states the mixture is equimolar. Based on the total elemental ratio (N:H:O), we can deduce the combined chemical formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B. Since the products are N₂, H₂O, etc., we will look for common ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions that fit this combined formula.\n\n4.  **Calculate Total Atoms:** Once the chemical formulas for salts A and B are identified, we will count the number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt and add them together to get the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Analyze the Products\n# Given data\nmass_mixture = 7.20  # g\nmass_increase_tube1 = 3.60 # g (mass of H2O)\nmass_increase_tube3 = 0.80 # g (mass of O atoms)\nvolume_gas_C_STP = 2.24 # L\n\n# Molar masses and constants\nM_H2O = 18.015  # g/mol\nM_O = 15.999    # g/mol\nV_molar_STP = 22.4 # L/mol\nM_N2 = 28.014   # g/mol\n\n# Calculate moles of products\nmoles_H2O = mass_increase_tube1 / M_H2O\nmoles_O_atoms_in_CuO = mass_increase_tube3 / M_O\nmoles_gas_C = volume_gas_C_STP / V_molar_STP\n\n# Verify the identity of Gas C by checking mass conservation\n# Total mass of products = mass(H2O) + mass(O) + mass(Gas C)\n# mass(Gas C) = mass_mixture - mass(H2O) - mass(O)\nmass_gas_C = mass_mixture - mass_increase_tube1 - mass_increase_tube3\n# Calculate molar mass of Gas C\nmolar_mass_gas_C = mass_gas_C / moles_gas_C\n# The molar mass is ~28 g/mol, confirming Gas C is Nitrogen (N2).\n\n# Step 2: Determine Elemental Composition\n# The gas reacting with Cu could be O2 or N2O.

Analyze the Products of Decomposition**\n\nThe problem describes heating a 7.20 g mixture of salts and analyzing the resulting gases. We can determine the identity and quantity of each gaseous product from the experimental data.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂.\n    *   The weight did not change, which means **no acidic gases** were produced. This rules out salts containing carbonate, sulfite, etc.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states CuO is formed, meaning the gas contained oxygen atoms that were transferred to the copper.\n    *   The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen atoms that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all tubes, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Mixture**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, the total mass of the products must equal the initial mass of the reactants. We can also determine the elemental composition of the original salts.\n\n*   First, let's identify Gas C. The total mass of the initial mixture is 7.20 g. The mass of the known products (H₂O and the oxygen that reacted with Cu) is 3.60 g + 0.80 g = 4.40 g.\n*   The mass of Gas C must be the remaining mass: 7.20 g - 4.40 g = 2.80 g.\n*   We can now calculate the molar mass of Gas C: Molar Mass = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   A non-reactive gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is **nitrogen (N₂)**.\n\nNow we can find the total moles of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture:\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in the 0.10 mol of N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (1 × moles of H₂O) + (moles of O atoms from Tube 3) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the initial substance was an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. The overall molar ratio of the elements in this mixture is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n\nTo find the simplest whole number ratio, we can divide all values by the smallest number (0.20):\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n\nTo eliminate the decimal, we multiply the entire ratio by 4:\nN : H : O = **4 : 8 : 5**\n\nThis means the combined chemical formula of one unit of salt A and one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**. Since the salts are composed of N, H, and O, and decompose into gases, they are very likely to be ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions.\n\nLet's test the most common candidates:\n*   **Salt Candidate 1:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₃**.\n*   **Salt Candidate 2:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\nLet's sum the atoms in one formula unit of each:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**\n\nThis sum perfectly matches the elemental ratio we calculated. Therefore, the salts A and B are **ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)** and **ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means we need to sum the number of atoms in one formula unit of NH₄NO₃ and one formula unit of NH₄NO₂.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\n**Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Identify the Products and Their Quantities**\n\nThe problem describes the thermal decomposition of a salt mixture and the subsequent analysis of the gaseous products.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass increase = 3.60 g. This is the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂).\n    *   The weight did not change, meaning **no acidic gases** were produced. This rules out salts containing carbonate, sulfite, etc.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases.

This is the mass of the oxygen atoms that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Final Gas C:** The remaining gas is inert to the previous reagents.\n    *   Volume at STP = 2.24 L.\n    *   At Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP), 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Mixture**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the initial salt mixture.\n\n*   **Mass of Gas C:** We can find the mass of Gas C by subtracting the masses of the other products from the initial total mass.\n    *   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g (total) - 3.60 g (H₂O) - 0.80 g (O atoms) = 2.80 g.\n*   **Identity of Gas C:** We can now find the molar mass of Gas C.\n    *   Molar Mass = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   A gas with a molar mass of ~28 g/mol that is inert in this context is nitrogen (N₂).\n\nNow we can find the total moles of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture:\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N is in the 0.10 mol of N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that formed CuO.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O that formed CuO)\n    *   Moles of O = (1 × 0.20 mol) + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the initial substance was an **equimolar mixture** of two salts, A and B. The overall molar ratio of the elements in this mixture is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n\nTo get a simple integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply to clear fractions:\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\nMultiplying by 4 gives the integer ratio:\n**N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5**\n\nThis means that the combined chemical formula of one unit of salt A and one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**. Since the salts are composed of N, H, and O, and decompose into gases, they are very likely to be ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions. Let's find two common salts that sum to N₄H₈O₅.\n\n*   **Candidate Salt 1:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₃**.\n*   **Candidate Salt 2:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂. Its formula is **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\nLet's sum the atoms in one formula unit of each:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**\n\nThis sum perfectly matches the elemental ratio we calculated. Therefore, the salts A and B are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\n**4.

Analysis of the Gaseous Products and Their Quantities\n\nThe problem describes the heating of a salt mixture and the subsequent analysis of the gaseous products. We can determine the identity and amount of each product from the experimental data.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases (e.g., CO₂). Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This indicates the original salts do not contain elements like carbon or sulfur that would form acidic oxides.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the formation of CuO, meaning 0.80 g of oxygen atoms from the gas stream reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n    *   This oxygen could have been delivered by O₂ gas (in which case 0.025 mol of O₂ reacted) or another oxygen-containing gas like N₂O (in which case 0.05 mol of N₂O reacted). Both possibilities lead to the same final conclusion.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remained at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n    *   Given the context of decomposing nitrogen-containing salts, this inert gas is identified as nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### 2. Determination of the Elemental Composition of the Salt Mixture\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, the elements in the products must have come from the original salts.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in the H₂O and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (1 × Moles of H₂O) + (Moles of O atoms that formed CuO) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen ends up as N₂ gas.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × Moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\nLet's verify the total mass: (0.40 mol H × 1 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14 g/mol) = 0.4 g + 4.0 g + 2.8 g = 7.20 g. This matches the initial mass, confirming our analysis.\n\n### 3. Identification of Salts A and B\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. The overall molar ratio of the elements in the combined salts (A+B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\nTo get a simple integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply by 4:\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25  =>  **4 : 8 : 5**\n\nSo, the combined chemical formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nWe need to find two common salts composed of N, H, and O that sum to this formula. The most logical candidates are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions:\n*   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** Formula is N₂H₄O₃.\n*   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** Formula is N₂H₄O₂.\n\nAdding their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match. Therefore, salts A and B are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n### 4. Calculation of the Total Number of Atoms\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Products of Decomposition**\n\nThe problem describes heating a 7.20 g equimolar mixture of salts A and B, then analyzing the resulting gases.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂). Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This indicates the salts do not contain elements like carbon or sulfur.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen atoms binding to the copper to form CuO.\n    *   Molar mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n    *   This oxygen could have come from O₂ gas (in which case 0.025 mol of O₂ reacted) or another oxidizing gas like N₂O (in which case 0.05 mol of N₂O reacted). Both possibilities will be considered.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the reactions, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n    *   Given the context, this inert gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### **2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Salts**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, the elements in the products must have come from the original salts. Let's calculate the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in the H₂O and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles of O from H₂O) + (moles of O that formed CuO)\n    *   Moles of O = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in the final gas C (N₂) and potentially in the gas that reacted with copper if it was N₂O.\n    *   Let's check the total mass. Mass = (0.40 mol H × 1 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16 g/mol) = 0.4 g + 4.0 g = 4.4 g.\n    *   The remaining mass must be nitrogen: 7.20 g (total) - 4.4 g = 2.8 g.\n    *   Moles of N = 2.8 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   This corresponds to 0.10 mol of N₂ gas, which perfectly matches the amount of gas C collected. This confirms our analysis.\n\n### **3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe initial mixture contained 0.20 mol N, 0.40 mol H, and 0.25 mol O. The molar ratio of the elements is N:H:O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25. To get a simple integer ratio, we can multiply by 20, which gives **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nSince the mixture is equimolar, this formula represents the sum of one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B. The salts are composed of N, H, and O, which strongly suggests they are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. We need to find two such salts whose formulas add up to N₄H₈O₅.\n\n*   **Candidate Salt 1:** Ammonium nitrate, **NH₄NO₃** (formula N₂H₄O₃)\n*   **Candidate Salt 2:** Ammonium nitrite, **NH₄NO₂** (formula N₂H₄O₂)\n\nLet's sum their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match. Therefore, salts A and B are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\nThis identification is consistent with the decomposition products. Depending on the exact conditions, the decomposition can be viewed as:\n*   NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n*   NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O (N₂O then reacts with Cu: N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO)\n*   OR 2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n\nBoth interpretations lead to the same identification of the salts.\n\n### **4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B (i.e., in one formula unit of each).\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1.

By examining the changes in each tube, we can identify the products and their quantities.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This indicates the original salts do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the formation of CuO, meaning the gas stream contained an oxidizing agent that supplied 0.80 g of oxygen.\n    *   Molar mass of Oxygen (O) = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen could have been supplied by O₂ gas (requiring 0.025 mol of O₂) or another oxidizing gas like N₂O (requiring 0.05 mol of N₂O). Both possibilities will be considered.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all tubes, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Given the context, this inert gas is almost certainly nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### 2. Determination of Elemental Composition and Mass Conservation\nWe can determine the elemental makeup of the original 7.20 g mixture from the products.\n\n*   **Total Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Total Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in the final 0.10 mol of N₂ (and potentially from N₂O if that was the gas in tube 3, but that N₂ would also end up in the final gas C).\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Total Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in the H₂O and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (moles of O in H₂O) + (moles of O that formed CuO) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n\nLet's verify the total mass of these elements:\n*   Mass = (0.40 mol H × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.0 g/mol)\n*   Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass of the mixture, confirming that the salts A and B are composed only of Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen.\n\n### 3. Identification of Salts A and B\nThe problem states the initial mixture was equimolar. The overall molar ratio of the elements in the combined salts (A+B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\nTo get a simple integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply by 4:\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25  (multiplied by 4) → **4 : 8 : 5**\n\nSo, the combined chemical formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nSince the salts are composed of N, H, and O, and decompose into gases, they are very likely ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.

We can determine the identity and quantity of each gaseous product from the experimental data.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Using the molar mass of H₂O (≈18.0 g/mol):\n        Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂.\n    *   The weight did not change, which means no acidic gases were produced. This rules out salts containing carbonate, sulfite, etc., and indicates the original salts do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states CuO is formed, and the mass increased by 0.80 g.\n    *   This mass increase is due to oxygen atoms binding to the copper.\n    *   Using the molar mass of oxygen atoms (O ≈ 16.0 g/mol):\n        Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This means the gas passing through this tube delivered 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms.

Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Salt Mixture**\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, all atoms in the products must have come from the original salts. We can calculate the total moles of each element.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × (moles of H₂O) = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen is in the 0.10 mol of the final gas, N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × (moles of N₂) = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Moles of O from H₂O = 0.20 mol.\n    *   Moles of O that formed CuO = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Total moles of O = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n\nLet's verify the total mass of these elements:\n*   Mass = (0.40 mol H × 1.0 g/mol) + (0.20 mol N × 14.0 g/mol) + (0.25 mol O × 16.0 g/mol)\n*   Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass of the mixture, confirming our analysis.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. The total elemental content (0.20 mol N, 0.40 mol H, 0.25 mol O) comes from an equal number of moles of salt A and salt B. Therefore, the ratio of atoms in the combined formula unit of (A + B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n\nTo get a simple integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20):\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n\nTo eliminate the fraction, we multiply the entire ratio by 4:\nN : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5\n\nSo, the combined formula for one molecule of salt A plus one molecule of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nSince the salts are composed of N, H, and O, they are likely ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts of nitrogen-containing oxyanions. Let's find two common salts whose formulas sum to N₄H₈O₅.\n\n*   **Candidate Salt 1:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Its formula is N₂H₄O₃.\n*   **Candidate Salt 2:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂.

However, regardless of the specific gas (O₂ or N₂O), the total mass of the products must equal the initial mass.\n        *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.4 g\n        *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.0 g\n        *   Total mass of H and O = 4.4 g.\n        *   Mass of N = Initial mass - Mass(H+O) = 7.20 g - 4.4 g = 2.8 g.\n        *   Moles of N = 2.8 g / 14.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n        *   This confirms that the 0.10 mol of gas C is N₂ (0.10 mol N₂ contains 0.20 mol N atoms), and the gas in tube 3 did not contain nitrogen that wasn't accounted for.\n\n3.  **Identify Salts A and B:**\n    The initial 7.20 g mixture contains 0.40 mol H, 0.20 mol N, and 0.25 mol O.

We can determine the identity and quantity of each gaseous product from the experimental data.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂). Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This indicates the original salts do not contain elements like carbon or sulfur.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The problem states CuO is formed, meaning the gas stream contained oxygen atoms that were transferred to the copper.

Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. This means the combined formula of one unit of salt A and one unit of salt B must have an elemental ratio of N:H:O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25.\n\n*   To get a simple integer ratio, divide by the smallest value (0.20): N:H:O = 1 : 2 : 1.25.\n*   Multiply by 4 to eliminate the decimal: **N:H:O = 4 : 8 : 5**.\n\nSo, the combined formula for (A + B) is **N₄H₈O₅**. We need to find two common salts composed of N, H, and O that sum to this formula. The most logical candidates are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n\n*   **Salt Candidate 1:** Ammonium nitrate, NH₄NO₃. Formula: **N₂H₄O₃**.\n*   **Salt Candidate 2:** Ammonium nitrite, NH₄NO₂. Formula: **N₂H₄O₂**.\n\nLet's sum their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match. Therefore, salts A and B are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n**4.

Let's use the mass balance to confirm the identity of Gas C.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g\n    *   Mass of N = Total Mass - Mass(H) - Mass(O) = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g\n    *   Moles of N = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol N**.\n    *   Since Gas C has 0.10 mol, and it is N₂, it contains 0.10 mol × 2 = 0.20 mol of N atoms. This confirms our calculations.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe initial mixture contained 0.20 mol N, 0.40 mol H, and 0.25 mol O. The problem states the mixture is **equimolar**, meaning it contains `n` moles of salt A and `n` moles of salt B.\n\nThe overall molar ratio of the elements in the combined formula unit (A+B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\nTo get a simple integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply to clear fractions:\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\nMultiplying by 4 gives the integer ratio: **N : H : O = 4 : 8 : 5**.\n\nSo, the combined formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nThe salts are composed of N, H, and O, and decompose into gases, which strongly suggests they are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.

The correct number is 17, which is option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Products and Their Molar Quantities**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   The molar mass of H₂O is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This tube absorbs acidic gases. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases (like CO₂) were formed. This indicates the original salts do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen atoms binding to the copper to form CuO.\n    *   The molar mass of an oxygen atom (O) is approximately 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Initial Mixture**\n\nWe can now find the total moles of each element in the original 7.20 g mixture.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Total moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Total moles of O = (1 × 0.20 mol from H₂O) + (0.05 mol from Tube #3) = **0.25 mol**.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** The remaining mass must be nitrogen. Let's verify this.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n    *   Mass of N = Total Mass - Mass(H) - Mass(O) = 7.20 g - 0.40 g - 4.00 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Moles of N atoms = 2.80 g / 14.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n    *   The final gas C had 0.10 mol. If this gas is N₂, it contains 0.10 mol × 2 = 0.20 mol of N atoms. This matches our calculation, confirming Gas C is N₂.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe overall molar ratio of the elements in the combined salts (A+B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n\nTo find the simplest whole number ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20):\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n\nTo make all numbers integers, we multiply the ratio by 4:\nN : H : O = **4 : 8 : 5**\n\nThis means the combined chemical formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B is N₄H₈O₅. The problem states the mixture is equimolar. We need to find two common salts (composed of N, H, and O) that add up to this formula. The most plausible candidates are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n\n*   **Salt Candidate 1:** Ammonium nitrate, **NH₄NO₃** (formula N₂H₄O₃)\n*   **Salt Candidate 2:** Ammonium nitrite, **NH₄NO₂** (formula N₂H₄O₂)\n\nLet's sum their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**.

Analysis of the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe problem describes the heating of a salt mixture and the subsequent analysis of the gaseous products. We can determine the identity and quantity of each product from the experimental data.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution detects acidic gases (like CO₂). Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This rules out salts containing carbonate or other anions that would produce acidic gases upon decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen atoms binding to the copper to form CuO.\n    *   Molar mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n    *   This oxygen could have come from O₂ gas or another oxygen-containing gas like N₂O.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After passing through all tubes, 2.24 L of a non-reactive gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n### **2. Determining the Elemental Composition of the Salts**\n\nWe can use the law of conservation of mass to find the composition of the original 7.20 g mixture. The products contain only Hydrogen, Oxygen, and the elements in Gas C.\n\n*   **Mass of H₂O** = 3.60 g\n*   **Mass of Oxygen** that reacted with copper = 0.80 g\n*   **Mass of Gas C** = Initial Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O from gas) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n*   **Molar Mass of Gas C** = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n    *   A gas with a molar mass of ~28 g/mol that is inert in these conditions is nitrogen (N₂).\n\nSo, the decomposition produced 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.10 mol N₂, and a gas that supplied 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms. The total mass of these products (3.60 g H₂O + 2.80 g N₂ + 0.80 g O) is 7.20 g, confirming our analysis.\n\nNow, let's find the total moles of each element in the original mixture:\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** From 0.20 mol H₂O → 2 × 0.20 = **0.40 mol H**.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** From 0.10 mol N₂ → 2 × 0.10 = **0.20 mol N**.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** From 0.20 mol H₂O and the 0.05 mol O that reacted with copper → (1 × 0.20) + 0.05 = **0.25 mol O**.\n\n### **3. Identifying Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. The overall molar ratio of the elements in the combined salts (A+B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n\nTo get a simple integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20) and then multiply to clear the fraction:\n1 : 2 : 1.25  (multiplied by 4) → **4 : 8 : 5**\n\nSo, the combined formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nGiven that the salts contain N, H, and O and decompose into gases, they are almost certainly ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. We need to find two such salts whose formulas sum to N₄H₈O₅.\n*   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** Formula is N₂H₄O₃.\n*   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** Formula is N₂H₄O₂.\n\nAdding their formulas: (N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**. This is a perfect match. Therefore, the two salts in the equimolar mixture are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n### **4. Calculating the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to calculate the total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\nThe total number of all atoms is the sum of the atoms in both salts:\nTotal Atoms = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1.

We can identify the gaseous products and their quantities by analyzing the changes in each tube.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, **no acidic gases were produced**.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states CuO is formed, so the mass increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen atoms reacting with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Gas C:** The remaining gas, which passed through all tubes unreacted, has a volume of 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Salts**\n\nWe can use the law of conservation of mass to find the composition of the initial 7.20 g mixture. The total mass of the products must equal the initial mass.\n\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O atoms that reacted with Cu = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of Gas C = Moles × Molar Mass. Let's find the mass first: 7.20 g (initial) - 3.60 g (H₂O) - 0.80 g (O in CuO) = 2.80 g.\n*   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   A non-reactive gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂).\n\nNow we can find the total moles of each element in the original mixture:\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All H is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × 0.20 mol = **0.40 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All N is in the 0.10 mol of N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × 0.10 mol = **0.20 mol**.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the H₂O and in the gas that reacted with copper.\n    *   Moles of O = (1 × moles of H₂O) + (moles of O atoms) = 0.20 mol + 0.05 mol = **0.25 mol**.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states we have an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. The total moles of elements found (0.20 mol N, 0.40 mol H, 0.25 mol O) came from an equal number of moles of A and B.\n\nThe molar ratio of the elements in the combined formula unit of (A + B) is:\nN : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\n\nTo get a simple integer ratio, we can divide by the smallest value (0.20):\nN : H : O = 1 : 2 : 1.25\n\nTo make all numbers integers, we multiply the ratio by 4:\nN : H : O = **4 : 8 : 5**\n\nSo, the combined chemical formula for one unit of salt A plus one unit of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nThe salts are composed of N, H, and O, which strongly suggests they are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. We need to find two such salts whose formulas sum to N₄H₈O₅.\n*   **Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** The chemical formula is N₂H₄O₃.\n*   **Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** The chemical formula is N₂H₄O₂.\n\nLet's add their formulas together:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = **N₄H₈O₅**.\nThis is a perfect match. Therefore, the two salts are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = **8 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
