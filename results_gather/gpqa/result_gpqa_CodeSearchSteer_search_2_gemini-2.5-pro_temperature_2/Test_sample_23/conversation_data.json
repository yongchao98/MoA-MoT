    "The detailed breakdown of the problem and the verification of the chemical principles involved confirm the initial line of reasoning. Here is a step-by-step solution based on the provided information and chemical knowledge.\n\n**1. Identification of Hydrocarbon Z**\nThe substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. The formula for the mass fraction of hydrogen (%H) in a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ is:\n%H = (y × MolarMass of H) / (x × MolarMass of C + y × MolarMass of H)\nUsing integer atomic masses (C=12, H=1), we have:\n0.1428 = y / (12x + y)\nThis value is very close to 1/7.\n1/7 = y / (12x + y)  => 12x + y = 7y => 12x = 6y => y = 2x.\nThe empirical formula for Z is CH₂. A saturated hydrocarbon that fits the general formula CₙH₂ₙ is a cycloalkane.\nThe problem states that Z is a constituent of mixture Y and is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent matching this profile is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y gives only Z, which is stated to be unreactive towards further hydrogenation, confirming it is a saturated compound.\n\n**2. Identification of Mixture Y**\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. It is formed from the disproportionation of mixture X. Hydrogenation of Y yields only Z (cyclohexane). One component of Y is Z itself, which is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Let the other component be Y₂.\nSince Y₂ does not decolorize bromine water, it is expected to be saturated or aromatic. When hydrogenated, Y₂ must also produce cyclohexane. A logical candidate for Y₂ is benzene (C₆H₆). Benzene does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions and its hydrogenation product is cyclohexane.\nThus, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆). This composition fits all the given criteria.\n\n**3. Identification of Mixture X**\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are unsaturated. When heated with platinum, X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form Y (cyclohexane + benzene). This is a type of hydrogen transfer reaction. The classic example of this is the Zelinsky irreversible catalysis, where cycloalkenes disproportionate to form cycloalkanes and aromatic compounds.\nLet the components of X be X₁ and X₂. The overall reaction is:\nX₁ + X₂ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆\nSince hydrogenation of X gives only cyclohexane, both X₁ and X₂ must be C₆ hydrocarbons with a six-membered ring skeleton. The total number of hydrogen atoms in the products is 12 + 6 = 18. By conservation of mass, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants must also be 18.\nSo, H(X₁) + H(X₂) = 18.\nThe problem states that molecules in mixture X do not have conjugated multiple bonds. We need to find two non-conjugated, unsaturated, six-membered ring C₆ molecules that fulfill the hydrogen count. The candidates are:\n*   Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) - Has one double bond (not conjugated).\n*   1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) - Has two non-conjugated double bonds. (1,3-Cyclohexadiene is conjugated and thus excluded).\nLet's check the hydrogen atom count for this pair: 10 + 8 = 18. This matches the requirement.\nThe disproportionation reaction is:\nC₆H₁₀ (cyclohexene) + C₆H₈ (1,4-cyclohexadiene) --(Pt, heat)--> C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane) + C₆H₆ (benzene)\nThis is a balanced hydrogen-transfer reaction where the cyclohexene is dehydrogenated to benzene (loses 4 H) and the 1,4-cyclohexadiene is hydrogenated to cyclohexane (gains 4 H). Studies on platinum catalysts confirm such hydrogen transfer reactions between these species.\n\n**4. Calculation of the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component of X.\n*   Component 1: Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Component 2: 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) has 8 hydrogen atoms.\nTotal number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
