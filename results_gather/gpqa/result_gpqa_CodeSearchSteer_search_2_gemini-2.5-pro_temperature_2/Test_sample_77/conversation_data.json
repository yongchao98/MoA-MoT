    "The potentials requested are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, which describe the electromagnetic field of a moving point charge. The scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) are calculated at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$ but are dependent on the properties of the charge (position and velocity) at an earlier, or *retarded*, time $t_r$.\n\nThe retarded time $t_r$ is defined implicitly by the condition that the time elapsed, $t - t_r$, must equal the time it takes for light to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$, which is $\\vec{s}(t_r)$, to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\nMathematically, this is expressed as:\n$t - t_r = \\dfrac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$\n\nUsing the notation provided in the problem description:\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point.\n*   $d = |\\vec{d}|$ is the magnitude of this vector.\n*   $\\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time, $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=t_r}$.\n\nThe expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations. They are:\n\nScalar Potential:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nVector Potential:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n\nThe subscript $t_r$ signifies that all quantities within the brackets (charge $q$, distance vector $\\vec{d}$, and velocity $\\vec{v}$) are to be evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\nTo match the format of the given options, we can manipulate the denominator by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n$d - \\dfrac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c} = \\dfrac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\nSubstituting this back into the expressions for V and A:\n\nFor the scalar potential V:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nFor the vector potential A:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{\\frac{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions match exactly with option A. Option B has an incorrect sign in the denominator. Options C and D use the form for a static potential, which is not correct for a moving charge as it does not account for the retardation effects captured in the denominator term.\n\n<<<A>>>"
