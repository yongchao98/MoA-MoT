    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe fundamental principle we'll use is the conservation of energy. In this annihilation process, the total initial energy of the proton and antiproton is converted into the total final energy of the four A particles. The process is governed by Einstein's mass-energy equivalence principle, $E=mc^2$.\n\n**2. Initial State Energy**\n\n*   The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving.\" We can approximate its kinetic energy as zero, meaning it is at rest. The proton is also assumed to be at rest.\n*   The initial energy ($E_i$) of the system is therefore the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton ($m_p$) and the antiproton ($m_{\\bar{p}}$).\n*   Since a particle and its antiparticle have the same mass, the total initial energy is $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 m_p c^2$.\n*   The rest mass energy of a proton is approximately 938.3 MeV.\n*   So, $E_i = 2 \\times 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**3. Final State Energy**\n\n*   The final state consists of two particles $A^+$ and two particles $A^-$. All four particles have the same mass, $m_A$.\n*   The problem gives the rest mass energy of particle A as $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   Since the initial momentum is zero, the four final particles must be moving to conserve momentum. By symmetry, we can assume they all have the same speed ($v$) and thus the same total energy ($E_A$).\n*   The total final energy ($E_f$) is the sum of the energies of the four particles: $E_f = 4 \\times E_A$.\n*   The total energy of a single moving particle A is given by the relativistic energy formula: $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n*   Therefore, $E_f = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n\n**4. Solving for Velocity**\n\n*   According to the law of conservation of energy, $E_i = E_f$.\n*   $2 m_p c^2 = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$.\n*   We can now solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2 m_A c^2}$\n*   Plugging in the values:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{938.3 \\text{ MeV}}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ MeV}} = \\frac{938.3}{600} \\approx 1.5638$\n*   Now we use the definition of $\\gamma$ to solve for the velocity, $v$:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n    $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n    $1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n*   Substituting the value of $\\gamma$:\n    $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n    $v/c \\approx 0.7688$\n*   Therefore, the velocity of particle A is $v \\approx 0.77c$.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
