    "Here's a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and an evaluation of each statement:\n\n*   **Compound A** (C3H6) is propene (CH3-CH=CH2). It undergoes an addition reaction with bromine.\n*   **Compound B** is 1,2-dibromopropane, formed by the addition of Br2 across the double bond of propene.\n*   **Compound C** is propyne (CH3-C≡CH), formed by the dehydrohalogenation of 1,2-dibromopropane with alcoholic KOH.\n*   **Compound D** is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene), produced by the cyclic trimerization of propyne passing through a red-hot iron tube.\n*   **Compound E** is 2-nitromesitylene (2-nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene), formed by the nitration of mesitylene with a mixture of concentrated nitric acid and sulfuric acid.\n*   **Compound F** is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (mesidine), which results from the reduction of the nitro group in compound E using iron scrap and hydrochloric acid.\n*   **Compound G** is mesitylenediazonium chloride, formed by the diazotization of mesidine with nitrous acid.\n*   **Compound H** is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol (mesitylol), formed by the reaction of the diazonium salt (G) with a basic solution (NaOH).\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement:\n\n**A) C is a flammable gas.**\nCompound C is propyne. With a boiling point of -23.2 °C, it is a gas at room temperature. Sources confirm that propyne is a colorless, highly flammable gas. This statement is correct.\n\n**B) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\nCompound D is mesitylene (1,3,5-trimethylbenzene). Due to the high symmetry of the molecule, all three aromatic protons are chemically equivalent, and all nine methyl protons are also equivalent to each other. This results in two signals in the 1H NMR spectrum: a singlet for the three aromatic hydrogens and another singlet for the nine methyl hydrogens. This statement is correct.\n\n**C) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\nCompound F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline, also known as mesidine. Aromatic amines are common intermediates in the synthesis of dyes. Specifically, 2,4,6-trimethylaniline is used as an intermediate for dyes such as Acid Blue 129. This statement is correct.\n\n**D) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\nCompound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is used to detect phenols, typically giving a distinct color change to violet, blue, green, or red-brown. However, phenols where the hydroxyl group is sterically hindered, like 2,4,6-trimethylphenol (with two methyl groups in the ortho positions), often fail to give a positive test. A negative result means no characteristic color change occurs, and the solution would retain the yellowish color of the ferric chloride reagent itself. The statement that it \"gives a yellow color\" is misleading because this indicates a negative test, not a positive, characteristic reaction for phenols. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\n<<<D>>>"
