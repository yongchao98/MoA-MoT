    "To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the moles of each component.**\n    *   The solution contains potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH₂PO₄) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O). In solution, these dissociate to provide the acidic component H₂PO₄⁻ and the basic component HPO₄²⁻, respectively.\n    *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 moles of H₂PO₄⁻.\n    *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 moles of HPO₄²⁻.\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial molar concentrations.**\n    *   The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 0.200 L.\n    *   Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻ = Moles / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.03674 M.\n    *   Concentration of HPO₄²⁻ = Moles / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.02809 M.\n\n3.  **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺].**\n    *   The solution is a buffer governed by the second dissociation of phosphoric acid, which involves H₂PO₄⁻ and its conjugate base HPO₄²⁻. The relevant equilibrium is:\n        H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    *   The equilibrium expression for this reaction is given by the acid dissociation constant Ka₂:\n        Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    *   Rearranging to solve for [H⁺]:\n        [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ( [H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻] )\n        [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n        [H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M.\n\n4.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion [PO₄³⁻] concentration.**\n    *   The orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is produced from the third dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n        HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    *   The equilibrium for this step is defined by Ka₃:\n        Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   Now, rearrange the formula to solve for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, [PO₄³⁻]:\n        [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ( [HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺] )\n        [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n        [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is approximately 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
