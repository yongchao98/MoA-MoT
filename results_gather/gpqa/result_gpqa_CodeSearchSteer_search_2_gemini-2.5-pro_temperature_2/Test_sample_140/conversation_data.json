    "The reaction of 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of possible organic products.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates\n\nThe strong base, amide ion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position ortho to the bromine atom. In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two such positions:\n1.  **C6:** This carbon has a hydrogen atom (H).\n2.  **C2:** This carbon has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThis leads to the formation of two different benzyne intermediates:\n\n*   **Pathway A: Removal of H from C6:** The amide ion removes the proton from the C6 position. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion from C1, resulting in a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains in the molecule. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**. Due to the kinetic isotope effect, breaking the C-H bond is faster than breaking the C-D bond, making this the major pathway.\n*   **Pathway B: Removal of D from C2:** The amide ion removes the deuteron from the C2 position. The bromide ion is subsequently eliminated from C1, forming a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the ring. This intermediate is **non-deuterated benzyne**.\n\n### Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates\n\nThe amide ion (NH₂⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the triple bond of the benzyne intermediates. The resulting anion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia).\n\n**Addition to 3-Deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n\nThis intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a deuterium at C2. The incoming amino group can add to either carbon of the triple bond:\n*   **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C1. This leads to the formation of **2-deuterioaniline** (amino group at C1, deuterium at C2).\n*   **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group attaches to C6. This results in the formation of **3-deuterioaniline** (amino group at C6, deuterium at C2).\n\n**Addition to non-deuterated Benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n\nThis intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium. Attack by the amide ion at either C1 or C2 of the triple bond, followed by protonation, will lead to a single product:\n*   **Attack at C1 or C2:** The final product is **aniline** with no deuterium label.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the products from all possible pathways, we get three distinct organic products:\n1.  2-deuterioaniline\n2.  3-deuterioaniline\n3.  Aniline\n\nTherefore, there are a total of three possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>"
