    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identifying Substance B**: The melting point of Substance B is \"very close to 277 K\". This is approximately 4°C. Standard water (H₂O) melts at 273.15 K (0°C). However, heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), melts at 276.97 K (3.82°C). This strongly indicates that **Substance B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n2.  **Identifying Substance X**: Substance X incorporates a \"heavier isotope,\" which we can now infer is Deuterium (D). A \"very close analog\" of X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. This points towards common deuterated reagents. The clue that the reaction of X with a keto acid produces a compound with 2 oxygen atoms is crucial. A keto acid possesses both a ketone and a carboxylic acid functional group (e.g., R-CO-COOH), totaling 3 oxygen atoms. Reducing both the ketone and the carboxylic acid groups yields a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH), which contains 2 oxygen atoms. While both Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) and Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) are common reducing agents, LiAlH₄ is significantly more powerful. NaBH₄ is generally not strong enough to reduce carboxylic acids. Therefore, to reduce both groups in the keto acid, the much stronger reagent is required. This identifies the \"close analog\" as LiAlH₄, meaning **Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n3.  **Identifying Gas W**: The reaction of Substance X (LiAlD₄) releases Gas W, whose molecules contain an equal number of protons and neutrons. Let's consider the reaction between LiAlD₄ and a liquid. Given that B is D₂O, the reaction likely involves deuterium. A violent reaction of LiAlD₄ with heavy water (Y) would produce deuterium gas (D₂).\n    *   **Reaction**: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂\n    *   A molecule of D₂ gas contains two deuterium atoms. Each deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fitting the description of Gas W. Other gases like Helium-4 also have equal protons and neutrons but are not plausible products of this reaction.\n\n4.  **Confirming Other Substances and Reactions**:\n    *   **Liquid Y**: The reaction partner that reacts violently with LiAlD₄ to produce D₂ gas is logically **heavy water (D₂O)**. LiAlH₄ is known to react violently with water.\n    *   **Precipitate G**: The products of the reaction, other than the gas, are Lithium deuteroxide (LiOD) and Aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃), which would form a solid precipitate, G.\n    *   **Heating G**: When heated, aluminum hydroxide (and by analogy, Al(OD)₃) decomposes to form the oxide and water (in this case, D₂O). This confirms that heating G releases B (D₂O).\n\nWith all substances identified, we can proceed to the calculation.\n\n### Calculation\n\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n\n*   **Substance X**: LiAlD₄\n*   **Constituent elements**: Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n*   **Lightest element**: Hydrogen (Atomic Number 1), present as Deuterium (D or ²H).\n*   **Heaviest element**: Aluminum (Atomic Number 13).\n*   **Atomic Masses of Isotopes**:\n    *   The atomic mass of Deuterium (²H) is 2.\n    *   The atomic mass of the stable isotope of Aluminum (²⁷Al) is 27.\n\nThe calculation requires summing the masses of *all atoms* of the lightest and heaviest elements in the molecule:\n\n*   **Total mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen as Deuterium)**: There are 4 deuterium atoms in LiAlD₄.\n    *   Mass = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8\n*   **Total mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum)**: There is 1 aluminum atom in LiAlD₄.\n    *   Mass = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27\n\n**Cumulative Atomic Mass** = (Total mass from Deuterium) + (Total mass from Aluminum)\nCumulative Atomic Mass = 8 + 27 = 35\n\nTherefore, the cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<B>>>"
