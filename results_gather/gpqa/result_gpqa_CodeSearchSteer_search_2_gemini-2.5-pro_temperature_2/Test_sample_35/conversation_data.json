    "The observation described involves detecting a cosmologically redshifted spectral line. The key is to identify the line's rest-frame energy and then associate it with a known transition in the Milky Way's interstellar medium (ISM).\n\nFirst, it is crucial to identify the spectral line in question. The famous 21-cm line is produced by neutral hydrogen atoms. This line corresponds to the energy difference between two hyperfine levels in the hydrogen atom's ground state, resulting from the alignment of the electron's and proton's spins. The rest-frame energy of a photon from this transition is approximately 5.87 micro-electron volts (µeV).\n\nThe problem states that the detected absorption line has an energy of 3.9 µeV. Since the light is coming from a structure 2.1 gigaparsecs (Gpc) away, it has been stretched by the expansion of the universe, a phenomenon known as cosmological redshift. The observed energy (E_obs) is lower than the energy at which the photon was emitted (E_rest).\n\nThe redshift (z) can be calculated using the formula: 1 + z = E_rest / E_obs.\nUsing the rest-frame energy of the 21-cm line and the observed energy:\n1 + z = 5.87 µeV / 3.9 µeV ≈ 1.5\nThis gives a redshift of z ≈ 0.5.\n\nA redshift of z=0.5 corresponds to a light travel time distance of about 5 billion light-years, which is equivalent to approximately 1.5 Gpc. More precise calculations using standard cosmological models show that a redshift of z≈0.5 corresponds to a comoving distance of roughly 2 Gpc (about 6.5 billion light-years), which aligns well with the stated distance of 2.1 Gpc.\n\nHaving identified the line as the 21-cm line of neutral hydrogen, the final step is to determine what it observes in our own galaxy. The interstellar medium is comprised of multiple phases, including cold, warm, and hot gas. The 21-cm line is an excellent tracer of the atomic component of the interstellar medium in both its cold and warm phases. However, absorption lines are most prominently seen in the Cold Neutral Medium (CNM), where the hydrogen is atomic and has temperatures around 100 K. The Warm Neutral Medium (WNM), with temperatures of thousands of Kelvin, contributes more to broad 21-cm emission profiles. The strong absorption signature implied by the problem is characteristic of cold atomic gas.\n\nTherefore, the absorption line in the Milky Way that corresponds to this transition is most likely associated with the cold atomic interstellar medium.\n\n<<<A>>>"
