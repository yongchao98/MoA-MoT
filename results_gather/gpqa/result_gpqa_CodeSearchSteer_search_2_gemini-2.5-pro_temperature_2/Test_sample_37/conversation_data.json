    "The reaction described is a classic example of the Stork enamine alkylation, which allows for the selective alkylation of a ketone.\n\nThe overall process can be broken down into three main steps:\n\n1.  **Formation of the Enamine:** The starting material is the (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium cation. This is an iminium ion, an intermediate in enamine synthesis. The first reagent, **(i) LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide)**, is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. Its role here is to deprotonate the iminium ion at one of the α-carbons to form a neutral enamine. For an unsymmetrical ketone like pentan-2-one, deprotonation can occur at either the C1 methyl group or the C3 methylene group. Formation of the enamine at the less substituted C1 position is generally favored under kinetic control, which is typical for reactions involving LDA. The solvent DME (1,2-dimethoxyethane) is a polar aprotic solvent suitable for this step.\n\n2.  **Alkylation:** The enamine formed in the previous step is nucleophilic at the α-carbon. The second step involves adding **(ii) CH₃CH₂I (ethyl iodide)**. The enamine attacks the electrophilic ethyl group in an Sₙ2 reaction, forming a new carbon-carbon bond at the less substituted α-carbon (the C1 position of the original ketone). This step results in a new, larger iminium salt.\n\n3.  **Hydrolysis:** The final step is the addition of **(iii) H₃O⁺ (aqueous acid)**. The iminium salt intermediate is hydrolyzed back into a ketone, yielding the alkylated product.\n\nFollowing this sequence:\n\n*   Starting ketone: Pentan-2-one (CH₃–C(=O)–CH₂–CH₂–CH₃)\n*   Alkylation with an ethyl group (–CH₂CH₃) at the less substituted C1 position.\n*   The product B is CH₃CH₂–CH₂–C(=O)–CH₂–CH₂–CH₃, which is **heptan-4-one**.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence of reagents (A) is (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺, and the product (B) is heptan-4-one.\n\n<<<C>>>"
