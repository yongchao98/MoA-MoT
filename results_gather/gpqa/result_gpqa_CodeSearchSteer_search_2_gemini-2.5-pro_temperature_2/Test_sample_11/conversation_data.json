    "The initial verification of my hand calculation confirms that the physics principles (conservation of energy and momentum) and the derived formulas are correct. The search results provide the accepted values for the particle masses and confirm the decay process.\n\n*   **Pi(+) Rest Mass:** 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   **mu(+) Rest Mass:** 105.7 MeV/c², or more precisely 105.66 MeV/c². The value in the prompt (105.7) is a good approximation.\n*   **Decay Process:** The decay of a charged pion (π⁺) into a muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (νμ) is a primary decay mode.\n*   **Energy Calculation:** The kinetic energy of the decay products for a two-body decay from a stationary particle are fixed. Several sources perform the same calculation. One source explicitly calculates the muon kinetic energy to be 4.12 MeV, corresponding to the energy of the neutrino being much higher, which aligns with my calculation. Another source calculates the muon kinetic energy as 4.08 MeV and the neutrino energy as 29.65 MeV using slightly different mass values, which is very close to my result. A third source also confirms the method. A high-precision measurement determines the muon kinetic energy as Tμ+ = 4.11984 MeV.\n\nMy calculated values were:\n*   KE_mu = 4.12 MeV\n*   KE_nu = 29.8 MeV\n\nThese values are consistent with the cited sources and match option A. The minor differences in some sources come from using slightly different input values for the masses of the pion and muon. Based on the values given in the question, my calculation is accurate.\n\nTherefore, the kinetic energy of the muon is approximately 4.12 MeV, and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is approximately 29.8 MeV.\n\nFinal check of the steps:\n1.  **Conservation of Energy:** E_pion = E_muon + E_neutrino\n2.  **Stationary Pion:** E_pion = m_pion * c² = 139.6 MeV\n3.  **Particles' Energy:** E_muon = KE_muon + m_muon * c²; E_neutrino = KE_neutrino (assuming massless neutrino)\n4.  139.6 MeV = (KE_muon + 105.7 MeV) + KE_neutrino\n    KE_muon + KE_neutrino = 33.9 MeV\n5.  **Conservation of Momentum:** |p_muon| = |p_neutrino|\n6.  For a massless neutrino, E_neutrino = p_neutrino * c. So, KE_neutrino = p_neutrino * c.\n7.  p_muon * c = KE_neutrino\n8.  **Relativistic Energy for Muon:** E_muon² = (p_muon * c)² + (m_muon * c²)²\n    (KE_muon + m_muon * c²)² = (p_muon * c)² + (m_muon * c²)²\n9.  Substituting from above: (KE_muon + 105.7)² = (KE_neutrino)² + (105.7)²\n    and KE_neutrino = 33.9 - KE_muon\n10. (KE_muon + 105.7)² = (33.9 - KE_muon)² + (105.7)²\n    Solving this equation gives KE_muon ≈ 4.12 MeV.\n11. Then KE_neutrino = 33.9 - 4.12 = 29.78 MeV ≈ 29.8 MeV.\n\nThe calculation is sound and confirmed by multiple sources.\n\nFinal Answer: A) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\n\n<<<A>>>"
