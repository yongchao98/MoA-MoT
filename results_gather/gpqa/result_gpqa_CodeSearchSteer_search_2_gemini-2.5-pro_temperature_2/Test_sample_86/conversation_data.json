    "To identify the correct ¹H NMR data, we must first deduce the most likely chemical structure from the information provided.\n\n### Structural Analysis:\n\n1.  **Aromatic Ring:** The compound has a 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring (C₆).\n2.  **Total Carbons:** There are 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contribute 2 carbons.\n3.  **Substituents:** The compound is di-substituted. The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (a halogen attached directly to the ring).\n4.  **Putting it Together:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X, where X = F, Cl, Br, or I).\n    *   The other substituent must be a two-carbon chain containing a carbonyl group. The most common and stable such group is an acetyl group (-C(=O)CH₃).\n    *   Therefore, the compound is a haloacetophenone.\n\n### ¹H NMR Prediction:\n\nNow, let's predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for a haloacetophenone. The substitution pattern on the benzene ring (ortho, meta, or para) is crucial.\n\n*   **Para (1,4) substitution:** Due to symmetry, this pattern results in a characteristic signal for the aromatic protons: two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons.\n*   **Ortho (1,2) and Meta (1,3) substitution:** These patterns are less symmetrical and would produce more complex splitting patterns for the four aromatic protons, not two simple doublets of equal integration.\n\nGiven the options, we look for the one that matches a para-substituted pattern. The most likely structure is a **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\nLet's predict the signals for para-haloacetophenone:\n*   **Aromatic Protons:** We expect two doublets in the aromatic region (typically 7.0-8.0 ppm), each representing two chemically equivalent protons.\n*   **Methyl Protons:** The acetyl group's methyl protons (-CH₃) are adjacent to a carbonyl group and have no neighboring protons, so they will appear as a singlet, integrating to 3 protons. This signal typically appears around 2.0-2.5 ppm.\n\n### Evaluating the Options:\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton, not a ketone. This is incorrect.\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   This data does not show the typical signals for a di-substituted benzene ring, nor does the integration match our predicted structure. This is incorrect.\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d):** These two doublets, each for two protons, perfectly match the pattern of a para-disubstituted aromatic ring. Both the acetyl and halogen are electron-withdrawing groups, shifting the protons downfield.\n    *   **2.3 (3H, s):** This singlet for three protons is characteristic of an acetyl methyl group. The chemical shift is within the expected range.\n    *   This option perfectly matches the predicted spectrum for a para-haloacetophenone, such as 4-chloroacetophenone.\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   There are no signals in the aromatic proton region (typically > 6.5 ppm). This is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:** The NMR data in option C is fully consistent with the structure of a para-haloacetophenone, which fits all the criteria described in the prompt.\n\n<<<C>>>"
