    "To clearly distinguish between two quantum energy levels, the difference in their energies must be greater than the \"smearing\" or uncertainty in the energy of each level. This energy uncertainty is a fundamental consequence of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and is related to the lifetime of the quantum state.\n\nThe time-energy formulation of the uncertainty principle states that the uncertainty in a state's energy (ΔE) multiplied by its lifetime (Δt) is at least on the order of the reduced Planck constant (ħ). A common approximation for this energy broadening, also known as the natural linewidth, is given by the formula:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / Δt\n\nwhere:\n*   **ΔE** is the uncertainty in energy (the linewidth).\n*   **ħ** (the reduced Planck constant) is approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n*   **Δt** is the lifetime of the state (τ).\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy uncertainty for each of the two states:\n\n1.  **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime (τ₁) = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty (ΔE₁) ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n2.  **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime (τ₂) = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty (ΔE₂) ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nFor the two energy levels to be clearly resolved, the energy difference between them must be significantly larger than their individual energy widths. Specifically, the separation should be greater than the broader of the two linewidths. The state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has the larger energy uncertainty of approximately 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nTherefore, the energy difference must be greater than this value. Let's examine the options:\n*   **A) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This is much smaller than the required 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   **B) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This is about 1,000 times larger than the energy uncertainty of the broader state, allowing for clear resolution.\n*   **C) 10⁻⁸ eV:** This is smaller than the energy uncertainty of State 1 (6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV).\n*   **D) 10⁻⁹ eV:** This is much smaller than the required energy uncertainty.\n\nOnly an energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is large enough to ensure that the two energy levels can be clearly distinguished.\n\n<<<B>>>"
