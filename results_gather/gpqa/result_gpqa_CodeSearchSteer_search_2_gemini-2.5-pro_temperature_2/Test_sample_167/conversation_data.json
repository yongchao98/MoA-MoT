    "All four of the listed issues are indeed recognized as significant sources of error in genomics data analysis. The key aspect of the question is \"difficult-to-spot erroneous results\". Let's evaluate each option in that context:\n\n1.  **Mutually incompatible data formats:** While a gross incompatibility, such as providing a BAM file where a FASTQ is expected, will cause a program to crash immediately, more subtle format inconsistencies can lead to hard-to-spot errors. For example, slight variations in GTF/GFF or VCF file specifications can be misinterpreted by parsers without generating an overt error, leading to incorrect annotations or variant calls that are not obviously wrong. An analysis may complete, but the underlying data has been silently corrupted or misinterpreted. Therefore, this is a valid source of difficult-to-spot errors.\n\n2.  **The \"chr\" / \"no chr\" confusion:** This is a classic and very common source of errors that are difficult to detect. It occurs when different input files (e.g., an alignment file and a gene annotation file) use different naming conventions for chromosomes (e.g., \"1\" vs \"chr1\"). Analyses like feature counting or variant annotation will often run to completion but yield no or few overlaps. This lack of results might be misinterpreted as a true biological finding rather than a simple data format mismatch. This makes the error particularly insidious and hard to spot.\n\n3.  **Reference assembly mismatch:** This is another major and extremely common source of hard-to-spot errors. If reads are aligned to one version of a reference genome (e.g., hg19) but are analyzed using annotation files based on a different version (e.g., hg38), the genomic coordinates will not correspond. This leads to completely incorrect results, such as variants being mapped to the wrong genes or features. Since the process may not generate an error message, and coordinates can appear valid at first glance, the resulting erroneous conclusions can be very difficult to identify.\n\n4.  **Incorrect ID conversion:** Errors in converting between different gene, transcript, or protein identifiers (e.g., Ensembl, RefSeq, Entrez) are a well-documented and pervasive problem. Software like Excel is infamous for auto-converting certain gene symbols into dates, which is an error that can silently corrupt data tables. These conversions can be irreversible and can contaminate public databases. A study in 2016 found that such errors were widespread in the scientific literature. These mistakes lead to analyses being performed on the wrong set of genes, which is a fundamental error that is not easily detectable from the final results.\n\nAll four points describe issues that can cause an analysis to produce plausible-looking but completely incorrect results without triggering obvious errors. They are all notorious pitfalls in bioinformatics. Therefore, all four are common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results.\n\n<<<D>>>"
