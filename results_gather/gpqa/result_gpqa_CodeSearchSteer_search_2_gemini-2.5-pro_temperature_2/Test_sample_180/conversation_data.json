    "### Breakdown of the Scenario\n\nHere is an analysis of the hypothetical situation:\n\n1.  **Neutrino Sources:** The Sun produces neutrinos from several nuclear reactions. For the energy range in question (700-900 keV), the primary contributors under normal conditions are:\n    *   **The pp-II branch:** This branch produces mono-energetic (line) neutrinos from the electron capture of Beryllium-7 (⁷Be). The vast majority (about 90%) of these neutrinos have a distinct energy of 861 keV. This falls directly into the second energy band (Band 2: 800-900 keV).\n    *   **The pp-III branch:** This branch produces Boron-8 (⁸B) neutrinos, which have a continuous energy spectrum extending up to about 15 MeV. These neutrinos would normally contribute to the flux in both Band 1 (700-800 keV) and Band 2 (800-900 keV).\n    *   **The CNO cycle:** Neutrinos from the Carbon-Nitrogen-Oxygen (CNO) cycle, specifically from ¹³N and ¹⁵O decays, also have continuous energy spectra that extend into the specified energy range. Their flux, however, is significantly lower than the primary pp-chain fluxes.\n\n2.  **The Hypothetical Change:** The pp-III branch has stopped. This means the reaction that produces Boron-8 (⁸B) has ceased, and consequently, the flux of ⁸B neutrinos drops to zero.\n\n3.  **The Time Delay:** Neutrinos travel from the Sun to the Earth in about 8.3-8.5 minutes. Since the pp-III branch is said to have stopped about 8.5 minutes ago, the effects of this shutdown are just now becoming observable on Earth.\n\n### Calculating the Flux Ratio\n\nWith the pp-III branch stopped, we must re-evaluate the neutrino sources in each energy band:\n\n*   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n    *   The ⁸B neutrino flux is now zero.\n    *   The ⁷Be neutrinos are at 861 keV, so they do not contribute to this band.\n    *   The only remaining sources of neutrinos in this energy window are from the CNO cycle (`¹³N` and `¹⁵O`).\n\n*   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n    *   The ⁸B neutrino flux is now zero.\n    *   The extremely strong mono-energetic line of ⁷Be neutrinos at 861 keV falls squarely in this band and is produced by the pp-II branch, which is still active.\n    *   There is also a smaller contribution from the continuous spectrum of CNO neutrinos in this range.\n\n### Conclusion on the Ratio\n\nThe flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV) is now overwhelmingly dominated by the high-flux ⁷Be neutrino line. The flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV) consists only of the much weaker CNO neutrinos.\n\nAccording to standard solar models, the total flux of ⁷Be neutrinos is on the order of 5 x 10⁹ neutrinos/cm²/s, while the combined CNO fluxes (`¹³N` + `¹⁵O`) are about two orders of magnitude smaller, approximately 5 x 10⁸ neutrinos/cm²/s.\n\nFurthermore, the ⁷Be flux is concentrated in a single energy line, creating a massive spike in flux density within Band 2. The CNO flux is spread out over a broad energy spectrum, so only a small fraction of it falls within Band 1.\n\nTherefore:\n*   **Flux (Band 1)** is very low.\n*   **Flux (Band 2)** is very high.\n\nThe ratio of Flux (Band 1) / Flux (Band 2) will be significantly less than 1. An estimation based on the relative total fluxes suggests a ratio of roughly (a fraction of 5 x 10⁸) / (5 x 10⁹), which points towards a value in the hundredths. The value 0.01 is a very reasonable approximation of this ratio.\n\nThe correct option is D, which represents a ratio of 0.01 (10⁻²).\n\n<<<D>>>"
