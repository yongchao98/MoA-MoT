    "To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], among all cobalt-containing species, we need to calculate the mole fraction (α₂) of this complex. The mole fraction represents the ratio of the concentration of a specific complex to the total concentration of the central metal ion.\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co(II) ion and all its thiocyanato complexes:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃⁻] + [Co(SCN)₄²⁻]\n\nThe formation of each complex is described by its overall stability constant (βn):\n[Co(SCN)⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]\n[Co(SCN)₂] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²\n[Co(SCN)₃⁻] = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³\n[Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴\n\nThe mole fraction for each species (αn) can be calculated using the general formula, which is particularly useful in systems with multiple competing equilibria. The mole fraction of the [Co(SCN)₂] complex (α₂) is given by:\n\nα₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)\nα₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁*[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂*[SCN⁻]² + β₃*[SCN⁻]³ + β₄*[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nGiven values are:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M (Since the thiocyanate concentration is much higher than the total cobalt concentration, we can assume the free ligand concentration is approximately equal to the total concentration)\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, let's calculate each term in the denominator of the mole fraction equation:\n*   β₁ * [SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n*   β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   β₃ * [SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   β₄ * [SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nNow, substitute these values into the denominator:\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThe numerator for α₂ is:\nNumerator = β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 0.4\n\nNow, we can calculate the mole fraction α₂:\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThus, approximately 16.9% of the cobalt in the solution exists as the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex.\n\n<<<D>>>"
