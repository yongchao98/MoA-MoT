    "The final product of the reaction sequence is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**. This is achieved through a multi-step synthesis starting with the identification of the initial compound, followed by a series of classic organic reactions.\n\n**1. Identification of the Starting Material**\n\nThe molecular formula is C8H9NO, and the ¹H-NMR data provides the necessary clues to determine its structure:\n*   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** A triplet in this downfield region is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO) adjacent to a methylene (-CH2-) group.\n*   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet integrating to two protons corresponds to the methylene group (-CH2-) coupled to the aldehyde proton.\n*   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each for two protons, strongly indicate a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical of an amino (-NH2) group.\n\nAssembling these pieces, the starting material is identified as **2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal**. The formula (C8H9NO) and all NMR signals are consistent with this structure.\n\n**2. The Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material, 2-(4-aminophenyl)ethanal, is subjected to a three-step reaction:\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO₂ + HCl:** This reagent combination generates nitrous acid (HNO₂) in situ, which reacts with the primary aromatic amine group (-NH₂) in a **diazotization reaction**. This converts the amino group into a diazonium salt, forming 2-(4-diazoniumphenyl)ethanal.\n\n*   **Step 2: H₂O, Heat:** The diazonium salt is unstable and, upon warming in water, undergoes hydrolysis. The diazonium group (-N₂⁺) is an excellent leaving group and is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group, yielding **2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal**.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat:** This step involves an **aldol condensation**. The product from step 2, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanal, possesses acidic α-hydrogens (on the carbon between the phenyl ring and the aldehyde). In the presence of a strong base (KOH), one molecule acts as a nucleophilic enolate, which then attacks the carbonyl group of a second molecule.\n    *   This initially forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde addition product, **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (Option C).\n    *   However, the reaction is conducted under **heat**, which promotes a subsequent dehydration (or condensation) step. A water molecule is eliminated, forming a stable α,β-unsaturated double bond that is conjugated with both the carbonyl group and a phenyl ring. This results in the final product.\n\nThe final, dehydrated product is named **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
