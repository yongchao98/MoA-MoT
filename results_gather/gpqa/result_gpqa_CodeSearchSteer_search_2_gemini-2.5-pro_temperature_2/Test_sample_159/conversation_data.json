    "As N becomes infinitely large, an N-sided polygon with a constant apothem 'a' approaches a circle with a radius 'a'. Therefore, this problem is equivalent to finding the angular distance between the first two minima of the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nThe diffraction pattern formed by a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern, which consists of a central bright disk surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings.\n\nThe angular positions of the minima (dark rings) are given by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x). The condition for the minima is:\n\nsin(θ) ≈ θ = (zₘ * λ) / (2 * π * a)\n\nwhere:\n*   θ is the angular position of the minimum.\n*   λ is the wavelength of the light.\n*   a is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   zₘ are the zeros of the Bessel function J₁(x), where m = 1, 2, 3, ... corresponds to the first, second, third, ... minimum.\n\nThe first two zeros of the Bessel function J₁(x) are approximately:\n*   z₁ ≈ 3.8317\n*   z₂ ≈ 7.0156\n\nNow, we can calculate the angular positions of the first two minima:\n\nThe angular position of the first minimum (m=1) is:\nθ₁ = (3.8317 * λ) / (2 * π * a) ≈ 0.6098 * λ / a\n\nThe angular position of the second minimum (m=2) is:\nθ₂ = (7.0156 * λ) / (2 * π * a) ≈ 1.1166 * λ / a\n\nThe angular distance between these first two minima is the difference between their angular positions:\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁\nΔθ = (1.1166 * λ / a) - (0.6098 * λ / a)\nΔθ = 0.5068 * λ / a\n\nThis value is approximately 0.506 λ / a.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.610 λ / a (This is the position of the first minimum, not the distance between the first and second)\nB) 1.220 λ /a (This is related to the diameter D=2a, giving 1.22 λ/D for the first minimum)\nC) 0.500 λ / a\nD) 0.506 λ / a\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
