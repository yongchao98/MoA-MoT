    "To solve this problem, we must calculate the energy of the absorbed photon that causes the diatomic molecule to transition from its fundamental state to the next lowest possible energy state. From this energy, we can then determine the photon's momentum.\n\n### 1. Identify the Initial and Final States\n*   **Fundamental State**: The ground state for a molecule in the rotation-vibration model corresponds to the lowest vibrational and rotational quantum numbers. Therefore, the vibrational quantum number `v` is 0, and the rotational quantum number `J` is 0. The initial state is (v=0, J=0).\n*   **Next Lowest Energy State**: The energy of a state (v, J) is the sum of its vibrational and rotational energy. Vibrational energy level gaps are typically much larger than rotational energy gaps. The question asks for a transition to the *next state with the lowest possible energy*. Although a purely rotational transition (from J=0 to J=1) would require the least energy, such transitions are typically weak and occur in the microwave region. Given the context of vibrational angular frequency (ω) and the options provided, it is understood that the question refers to a rovibrational transition, which involves a change in both `v` and `J`.\n*   **Selection Rules**: For a rovibrational transition from v=0, the selection rules are Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1. Starting from J=0, a transition with ΔJ = -1 is not possible. Therefore, the only allowed transition to the next vibrational level is with ΔJ = +1.\n*   **Final State**: The final state is (v=1, J=1).\n\n### 2. Calculate the Transition Energy (ΔE)\nThe energy of a state (v, J) in the non-rigid rotor model is given by:\n`E(v, J) = (v + 1/2)ħω + (ħ² / 2I) * J(J+1)`\nwhere:\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration\n*   `I` is the moment of inertia\n\nThe energy of the transition (ΔE) is the energy of the photon, calculated as the difference between the final and initial state energies:\nΔE = E(1, 1) - E(0, 0)\nΔE = [ (1 + 1/2)ħω + (ħ² / 2I) * 1(1+1) ] - [ (0 + 1/2)ħω + (ħ² / 2I) * 0(0+1) ]\nΔE = [ (3/2)ħω + 2(ħ² / 2I) ] - [ (1/2)ħω + 0 ]\nΔE = ħω + (ħ² / I)\n\n### 3. Calculate the Moment of Inertia (I)\nThe moment of inertia is calculated as `I = μR²`, where `μ` is the reduced mass.\n*   **Reduced Mass (μ)**:\n    μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)\n    μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.8182 amu\n*   **Convert to kilograms**: 1 amu ≈ 1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n    μ ≈ 1.8182 * 1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg ≈ 3.0191 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n*   **Moment of Inertia (I)**:\n    I = (3.0191 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)²\n    I = 1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\n### 4. Calculate the Energy Components\n*   **Vibrational Energy Change (ħω)**:\n    ΔE_vib = (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s)\n    ΔE_vib = 4.2183 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n*   **Rotational Energy Change (ħ²/I)**:\n    ΔE_rot = (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²)\n    ΔE_rot ≈ 9.209 x 10⁻²³ J\n\n### 5. Calculate Total Transition Energy (ΔE)\nΔE = ΔE_vib + ΔE_rot\nΔE = 4.2183 x 10⁻²⁰ J + 0.009209 x 10⁻²⁰ J\nΔE ≈ 4.2192 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n*(Note that the rotational energy contribution is negligible compared to the vibrational energy).*\n\n### 6. Calculate the Photon's Momentum (p)\nThe momentum of a photon is related to its energy by the formula `p = E / c`, where `c` is the speed of light (≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s).\np = ΔE / c\np = (4.2192 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3 x 10⁸ m/s)\np ≈ 1.4064 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThis result corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
