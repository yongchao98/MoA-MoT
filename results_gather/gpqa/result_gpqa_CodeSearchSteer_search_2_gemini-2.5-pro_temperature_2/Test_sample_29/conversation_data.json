    "The first step is to calculate the wavelength of the emitted light from its energy. The relationship between energy (E) and wavelength (λ) is given by the equation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. A convenient formula for this conversion is λ (nm) = 1240 / E (eV).\n\nGiven the energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV:\nλ_emitted = 1240 / 2.3393 eV ≈ 530 nm\n\nThe color of light with a wavelength of approximately 530 nm is green. However, the problem asks for the color of light *absorbed* by the compound, not emitted. The color of light a substance absorbs is the complementary color to the color it emits or transmits.\n\nSince the emitted light is in the yellow-green region of the spectrum, we need to find the complementary color of yellow. The complementary color to yellow is blue or violet. Specifically, yellow pigments absorb blue light. Therefore, the organic compound absorbs blue light.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\nA) Red\nB) Blue\nC) Yellow\nD) Violet\n\nThe compound emits yellow-green light, so it absorbs light in the blue-violet region of the spectrum. Of the choices given, blue is the correct answer.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the wavelength of the emitted light using the provided energy value. The relationship between energy (E) in electron volts (eV) and wavelength (λ) in nanometers (nm) is approximately:\n\nλ (nm) = 1240 / E (eV)\n\nGiven that the energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV, the wavelength of the emitted light is:\n\nλ_emitted = 1240 / 2.3393 eV ≈ 530 nm\n\nA wavelength of 530 nm corresponds to green light, though it is very close to the yellow-green region of the visible spectrum.\n\nThe color of light that a compound absorbs is complementary to the color of light that it transmits or emits. Since the textile dye emits light in the yellow-green to green range, it must absorb the complementary color.\n\nLooking at a color wheel, the complementary color of yellow is blue or violet/purple, and the complementary color of green is red or magenta. Specifically, yellow pigments are known to absorb blue light. Therefore, the organic compound absorbs light in the blue-violet region.\n\nBased on the given options:\nA) Red\nB) Blue\nC) Yellow\nD) Violet\n\nThe most appropriate answer is blue, as it is the complementary color to the yellow part of the emitted yellow-green light.\n\n<<<B>>>"
