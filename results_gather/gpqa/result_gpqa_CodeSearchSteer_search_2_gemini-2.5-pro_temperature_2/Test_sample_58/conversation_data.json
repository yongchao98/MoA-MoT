    "Here is a step-by-step determination of the pH of the final solution.\n\n**1. Initial Moles Calculation**\n\nFirst, calculate the number of moles of each substance before any reaction occurs. Moles are calculated by multiplying the molarity (M) by the volume in liters (L).\n\n*   **Acetic Acid (CH₃COOH - a weak acid):**\n    *   Moles = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.050 moles\n*   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl - a strong acid):**\n    *   Moles = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.080 moles\n*   **Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)₂ - a strong base):**\n    *   Moles = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 moles\n\n**2. Dissociation of Strong Species**\n\nStrong acids and strong bases completely dissociate in water. It is important to determine the total moles of hydrogen ions (H⁺) from the strong acid and hydroxide ions (OH⁻) from the strong base.\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl:** Since HCl is a strong acid, it fully dissociates, so moles of H⁺ = 0.080 moles.\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:** Barium hydroxide is a strong base that releases two hydroxide ions for each molecule. Therefore, moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 moles = 0.180 moles.\n\n**3. Neutralization Reactions**\n\nThe acids and bases will neutralize each other. The reaction proceeds in steps, starting with the strong acid and strong base.\n\n*   **Strong Acid-Strong Base Neutralization:** The H⁺ from HCl will react with the OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂.\n    *   Initial moles of H⁺ = 0.080 mol\n    *   Initial moles of OH⁻ = 0.180 mol\n    *   The strong acid (H⁺) is the limiting reactant and will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 moles.\n\n*   **Weak Acid-Strong Base Neutralization:** The remaining strong base (OH⁻) will then react with the weak acid (CH₃COOH).\n    *   Moles of CH₃COOH = 0.050 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ available = 0.100 mol\n    *   The weak acid (CH₃COOH) is the limiting reactant in this step and will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining after this reaction = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 moles.\n\n**4. Final Solution Composition and pH Calculation**\n\nAfter all reactions are complete, the solution contains an excess of strong base (OH⁻). The presence of a strong base in excess will be the primary determinant of the solution's pH.\n\n*   **Moles of excess OH⁻:** 0.050 moles\n*   **Total Volume of the Solution:** 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n*   **Concentration of OH⁻:** [OH⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n*   **Calculate pOH:** pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n*   **Calculate pH:** pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe final pH of the solution is approximately 12.62.\n\n<<<A>>>"
