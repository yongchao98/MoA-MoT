    "Based on the principles of particle physics and kinetic theory of gases, we can analyze the two different mean free paths.\n\n1.  **Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules (λ1):** This is the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule. This is governed by the kinetic theory of gases. The collision is between two neutral molecules of similar size and mass. The mean free path (λ1) is inversely proportional to the gas density and the kinetic collision cross-section of the molecules. The formula is λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * π * d²), where 'n' is the number density of the gas molecules and 'd' is their kinetic diameter.\n\n2.  **Mean Free Path of Electrons (λ2):** This is the average distance an electron from the beam travels before being scattered by a residual gas molecule. Here, the projectile is a tiny, high-energy (1000 kV), charged particle (the electron), and the target is a much larger, neutral, and nearly stationary gas molecule.\n\nThe fundamental difference lies in the **collision cross-section**, which is the effective area for a collision to occur.\n\n*   The gas-gas collision cross-section is related to the physical size of the molecules.\n*   The electron-gas collision cross-section is determined by the long-range electromagnetic interaction between the electron and the entire gas molecule (its nucleus and electron cloud).\n\nBecause the electron is a charged particle, it can be deflected (scattered) by a gas molecule's electromagnetic field from a much greater distance than would be required for two neutral gas molecules to physically collide. This long-range interaction results in a significantly larger effective collision cross-section for electron-gas scattering compared to the kinetic cross-section for gas-gas collisions.\n\nSince the mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section (σ) via the formula λ = 1 / (nσ), and the collision cross-section for electron-gas interactions (σ₂) is larger than that for gas-gas interactions (σ₁), the resulting mean free path for the electron (λ2) must be smaller than the mean free path for the gas molecule (λ1).\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that **λ2 < λ1**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
