    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n### 1. Normalize the Initial State Vector\n\nThe initial state of the system is given by the column matrix:\n|ψ⟩_unnormalized = `[[-1], [2], [1]]`\n\nTo find the probability, the state vector must be normalized. First, we calculate the norm squared of the state:\n⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6\n\nThe normalization factor is 1/√6. Therefore, the normalized state vector is:\n|ψ⟩ = (1/√6) * `[[-1], [2], [1]]`\n\n### 2. First Measurement: Operator P\n\nThe first measurement is of the observable P, with the desired outcome being the eigenvalue 0. The matrix for P is:\nP = `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector `|p₀⟩` corresponding to the eigenvalue λ = 0.\nP|p₀⟩ = 0 * |p₀⟩\n\nLet `|p₀⟩ = [[x], [y], [z]]`. The equation becomes:\n1.  y/√2 = 0  => y = 0\n2.  x/√2 + z/√2 = 0  => x = -z\n\nSo, the eigenvector is of the form `[[k], [0], [-k]]`. For normalization:\nk² + 0² + (-k)² = 1\n2k² = 1 => k = 1/√2\n\nThus, the normalized eigenvector for the eigenvalue 0 is:\n|p₀⟩ = `[[1/√2], [0], [-1/√2]]`\n\n### 3. Probability of Measuring P = 0\n\nThe probability of measuring P=0 is the squared absolute value of the inner product of the state |ψ⟩ and the eigenvector |p₀⟩.\nProb(P=0) = |⟨p₀|ψ⟩|²\n\n⟨p₀|ψ⟩ = `[1/√2, 0, -1/√2]` * (1/√6) * `[[-1], [2], [1]]`\n⟨p₀|ψ⟩ = (1/√6) * [ (1/√2)*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/√2)*1 ]\n⟨p₀|ψ⟩ = (1/√6) * [ -1/√2 - 1/√2 ] = (1/√6) * (-2/√2) = (1/√6) * (-√2) = -1/√3\n\nProb(P=0) = (-1/√3)² = 1/3\n\n### 4. State Collapse\n\nAfter measuring P=0, the state of the system collapses to the corresponding eigenvector |p₀⟩. The new state of the system is:\n|ψ'⟩ = |p₀⟩ = `[[1/√2], [0], [-1/√2]]`\n\n### 5. Second Measurement: Operator Q\n\nNow, we measure the observable Q on the new state |ψ'⟩, and we want to find the probability of getting the result -1. The matrix for Q is:\nQ = `[[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`\n\nSince Q is a diagonal matrix, its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements (1, 0, -1) and its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. The eigenvector `|q₋₁⟩` corresponding to the eigenvalue -1 is:\n|q₋₁⟩ = `[[0], [0], [1]]`\n\n### 6. Probability of Measuring Q = -1\n\nThe probability of measuring Q=-1 in the state |ψ'⟩ is the squared absolute value of the inner product of |ψ'⟩ and |q₋₁⟩.\nProb(Q=-1 | P=0) = |⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩|²\n\n⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩ = `[0, 0, 1]` * `[[1/√2], [0], [-1/√2]]`\n⟨q₋₁|ψ'⟩ = 0*(1/√2) + 0*0 + 1*(-1/√2) = -1/√2\n\nProb(Q=-1 | P=0) = (-1/√2)² = 1/2\n\n### 7. Total Probability\n\nThe total probability of measuring P=0 and then immediately measuring Q=-1 is the product of the two probabilities calculated:\nTotal Probability = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 | P=0)\nTotal Probability = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
