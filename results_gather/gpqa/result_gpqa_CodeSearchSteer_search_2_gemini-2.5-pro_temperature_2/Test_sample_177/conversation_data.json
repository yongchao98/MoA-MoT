    "To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ and assess the renormalizability of the theory, we follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Mass Dimensions of Fields and Lagrangian\n\nIn natural units (where ħ = c = 1), the action, `S = ∫d⁴x L`, is dimensionless. Since the four-volume element `d⁴x` has a mass dimension of [x]⁴ = (M⁻¹)⁴ = M⁻⁴, the Lagrangian density `L` must have a mass dimension of M⁴.\n\n*   **Fermion Field (ψ):** The kinetic term for a fermion in the Lagrangian is `ψ-bar(iγ^μ ∂_μ - m)ψ`. For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, knowing that the derivative `∂_μ` has a dimension of M¹ and mass `m` has a dimension of M¹, the term `ψ-bar * ψ` must have a dimension of M³. Since `[ψ-bar] = [ψ]`, we find that `2[ψ] = 3`, which gives `[ψ] = M^(3/2)`.\n\n*   **Electromagnetic Field Strength Tensor (F^μν):** The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is `(-1/4)F_μν * F^μν`. For this to have a mass dimension of 4, `[F_μν]²` must be M⁴, which means `[F^μν]` has a mass dimension of M².\n\n*   **Sigma Tensor (σ_μν):** The term `σ_μν` is composed of gamma matrices `(i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]`. Gamma matrices are dimensionless quantities. Therefore, `[σ_μν] = M⁰`.\n\n### 2. Mass Dimension of the Coupling Constant (κ)\n\nNow we analyze the interaction term `L_int = κ * ψ-bar * σ_μν * ψ * F^μν`. We equate its mass dimension to 4:\n\n[L_int] = [κ] * [ψ-bar] * [σ_μν] * [ψ] * [F^μν]\nM⁴ = [κ] * M^(3/2) * M⁰ * M^(3/2) * M²\nM⁴ = [κ] * M³ * M²\nM⁴ = [κ] * M⁵\n\nSolving for the mass dimension of κ:\n[κ] = M⁴ / M⁵\n**[κ] = M⁻¹**\n\nThe mass dimension of κ is -1.\n\n### 3. Renormalizability of the Theory\n\nA key criterion for determining if a theory is renormalizable is the mass dimension of its coupling constants.\n*   If a coupling constant has a **positive** mass dimension, the theory is super-renormalizable.\n*   If a coupling constant is **dimensionless** (mass dimension 0), the theory is renormalizable.\n*   If a coupling constant has a **negative** mass dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable.\n\nSince the mass dimension of κ is -1, which is negative, the theory described by this interaction is **not renormalizable**. In non-renormalizable theories, new and more severe divergences appear at higher orders of perturbation theory, requiring an infinite number of counterterms to cancel them, which removes the theory's predictive power.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mass dimension of κ is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
