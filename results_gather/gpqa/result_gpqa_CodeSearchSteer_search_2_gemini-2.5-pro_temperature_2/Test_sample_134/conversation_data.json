    "To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson X, its mass ($m_X = 6$ GeV) must be greater than or equal to twice the mass of the produced fermion ($m_X \\geq 2m_f$). Below is a list of the masses of the relevant fermions and the corresponding threshold for the decay of X into a fermion-antifermion pair:\n\n**Leptons:**\n*   **Electron ($e^-$):** The mass of an electron is approximately 0.511 MeV/c². Thus, $2m_e \\approx 1.022$ MeV, which is significantly less than 6 GeV. The decay $X \\rightarrow e^+e^-$ is kinematically allowed.\n*   **Muon ($\\mu^-$):** The mass of a muon is about 105.7 MeV/c². This means $2m_{\\mu} \\approx 211.4$ MeV, which is less than 6 GeV. The decay $X \\rightarrow \\mu^+\\mu^-$ is kinematically allowed.\n*   **Tau ($\\tau^-$):** The mass of a tau lepton is approximately 1780 MeV/c² or 1.78 GeV/c². So, $2m_{\\tau} \\approx 3.56$ GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. The decay $X \\rightarrow \\tau^+\\tau^-$ is kinematically allowed.\n\n**Quarks:**\n*   **Up (u):** The mass of an up quark is about 2.2 MeV/c². Thus, $2m_u \\approx 4.4$ MeV, which is much less than 6 GeV. The decay $X \\rightarrow u\\bar{u}$ is kinematically allowed.\n*   **Down (d):** The mass of a down quark is approximately 4.7 MeV/c². Thus, $2m_d \\approx 9.4$ MeV, which is less than 6 GeV. The decay $X \\rightarrow d\\bar{d}$ is kinematically allowed.\n*   **Strange (s):** The mass of a strange quark is about 95 MeV/c². Thus, $2m_s \\approx 190$ MeV, which is less than 6 GeV. The decay $X \\rightarrow s\\bar{s}$ is kinematically allowed.\n*   **Charm (c):** The mass of a charm quark is approximately 1.27 GeV/c². Thus, $2m_c \\approx 2.54$ GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. The decay $X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}$ is kinematically allowed.\n*   **Bottom (b):** The mass of a bottom quark is about 4.18 GeV/c². Thus, $2m_b \\approx 8.36$ GeV, which is greater than 6 GeV. Therefore, the decay $X \\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ is **not** kinematically allowed.\n*   **Top (t):** The mass of a top quark is approximately 173 GeV/c². So, $2m_t \\approx 346$ GeV, which is significantly greater than 6 GeV. The decay $X \\rightarrow t\\bar{t}$ is **not** kinematically allowed.\n\nBased on this analysis, the boson X can decay into up, down, strange, and charm quarks, as well as electrons, muons, and tau leptons. The decays into bottom and top quarks are forbidden as they would require more energy than the mass of the X boson.\n\nNow, let's examine the given options:\n\nA) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ - Incorrect because it includes the decay to bottom quarks.\nB) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ - This option correctly lists all the kinematically allowed decays among the fundamental fermions.\nC) $X\\rightarrow b\\bar{b},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ - Incorrect because it includes the decay to bottom quarks and omits the decay to muons.\nD) $X\\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},t\\bar{t},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$ - Incorrect because it includes the decay to top quarks.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B, as it accurately reflects the kinematically allowed decays.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.\n<<<B>>>"
