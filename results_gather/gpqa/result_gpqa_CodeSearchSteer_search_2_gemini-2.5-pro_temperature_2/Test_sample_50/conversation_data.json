    "The problem asks for the net potential energy of a system composed of a point charge `q` placed at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` (where `d > R`). This classic electrostatics problem is typically solved using the method of images.\n\n### Method of Images\nThe electric field outside the grounded conducting sphere is identical to the field created by the original charge `q` and an \"image charge,\" which is placed at a specific point inside the sphere. The value and position of this image charge are chosen to ensure that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero, which is the condition for a grounded conductor.\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center, the image charge `q'` is:\n*   **Magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Position:** Located at a distance `d'` from the center, along the same line as the original charge, where `d' = R^2 / d`\n\nSince `d > R`, the image charge is located inside the sphere. The image charge has the opposite sign to the real charge.\n\n### Calculating the Potential Energy\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d` from the center of the sphere. The force on the charge `q` is due to the electric field created by the induced charges on the sphere. By the method of images, this force is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'` on the real charge `q`.\n\nThe force `F` on the charge `q` when it is at an arbitrary distance `x` from the center is the Coulomb force between `q` and the corresponding image charge `q'(x) = -qR/x` at a distance `x'(x) = R^2/x`. The distance between `q` and `q'` is `x - x' = x - R^2/x`.\n\n`F(x) = k * q * q' / (x - x')^2`\n`F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R*x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\nThis force is attractive. The potential energy `U` is the work done by an external agent against this electrostatic force to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d`.\n\n`U = - ∫[∞, d] F(x) dx`\n`U = - ∫[∞, d] [-k * q^2 * R*x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n`U = k * q^2 * R ∫[∞, d] [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\nTo solve the integral, we use the substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, so `du = 2x dx`.\n`∫ [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx = (1/2) ∫ [1 / u^2] du = -1 / (2u) = -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))`\n\nNow, evaluating the definite integral for `U`:\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [-1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))]` from `∞` to `d`\n`U = k * q^2 * R * {[-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))] - [-1 / (2(∞^2 - R^2))]}`\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nAlternatively, it is a known result that the potential energy of the interaction between a point charge and an induced charge on a conductor is half the interaction energy between the point charge and its image charge.\n\nThe potential at the location of charge `q` due to the image charge `q'` is:\n`V_image = k * q' / (d - d') = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d) = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\nThe potential energy of the system is `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`.\n`U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)] = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) `U = - (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)`\nB) `U = -(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)`\nC) `U = - kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)`\nD) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThe calculated formula matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
