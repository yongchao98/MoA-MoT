    "To determine which statement accurately describes the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation, we must examine the fundamental assumptions made in its derivation.\n\n1.  **Carrier Type:** The model assumes that the current is carried by only one type of charge carrier (either electrons or holes). This is known as a single-carrier, or unipolar, device.\n2.  **Contacts:** For the current to be limited by the space charge within the semiconductor and not by the injection of carriers, the injecting contact must be Ohmic. An Ohmic contact is defined as a contact with no energy barrier to charge injection, acting as an infinite reservoir of carriers. A Schottky contact, which has an energy barrier, would invalidate this assumption.\n3.  **Traps:** The basic Mott-Gurney law is derived for an ideal semiconductor with no trap states within the bandgap that could capture mobile carriers. This is the \"trap-free\" condition. The presence of traps would alter the current-voltage relationship.\n4.  **Current Components:** The derivation assumes that the current is dominated by the drift of carriers under the influence of the applied electric field. The current arising from the diffusion of carriers (due to concentration gradients) is considered negligible.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options based on these points:\n\n*   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.** This is incorrect because the Mott-Gurney law applies to single-carrier devices.\n*   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.** This is incorrect because a Schottky contact presents an injection barrier, violating the assumption of an Ohmic contact required for SCLC.\n*   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.** This is incorrect because the current described by the equation is fundamentally a drift current; neglecting it would mean there is no current.\n*   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.** This statement correctly identifies all the key assumptions: it is for a single type of carrier (\"single-carrier\"), in a material without traps (\"trap-free\"), with an Ohmic contact (\"no carrier injection barrier\"), where the current mechanism is drift-dominated (\"negligible diffusion current\").\n\n<<<D>>>"
