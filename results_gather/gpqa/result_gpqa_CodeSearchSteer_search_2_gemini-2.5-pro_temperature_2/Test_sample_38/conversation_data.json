    "The problem requires finding the value of the normalization constant \"a\". According to the Born rule in quantum mechanics, the total probability of finding a particle in all possible locations must be equal to 1. This is achieved by integrating the square of the modulus of the wave function over the entire space where the particle can exist and setting the result to 1. This process is known as normalization of the wave function.\n\nThe given wave function is Ψ(x) = ( a / √(1 + x) ) - 0.5i. The problem states that the particles are only found in the region between x=1 and x=3. Therefore, the normalization condition is:\n\n∫₁³ |Ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the square of the modulus, |Ψ(x)|². For a complex number z = u + iv, the modulus squared is |z|² = u² + v². Alternatively, it can be calculated as |z|² = z*z, where z* is the complex conjugate.\n\nIn this case, the real part is u = a / √(1 + x) and the imaginary part is v = -0.5.\n\nSo, |Ψ(x)|² = (a / √(1 + x))² + (-0.5)²\n|Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\nNow, we integrate this expression from x = 1 to x = 3:\n\n∫₁³ [a² / (1 + x) + 0.25] dx = 1\n\nWe can split the integral into two parts:\n\n∫₁³ [a² / (1 + x)] dx + ∫₁³ 0.25 dx = 1\n\nFor the first part:\na² ∫₁³ [1 / (1 + x)] dx = a² [ln(1 + x)] from 1 to 3\n= a² (ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1))\n= a² (ln(4) - ln(2))\nUsing the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B):\n= a² ln(4/2) = a² ln(2)\n\nFor the second part:\n∫₁³ 0.25 dx = [0.25x] from 1 to 3\n= 0.25 * (3 - 1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5\n\nNow, we substitute these results back into the normalization equation:\n\na² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n\nSolving for \"a\":\na² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\na² ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nUsing the approximate value of ln(2) ≈ 0.6931:\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931\na² ≈ 0.7214\na ≈ √0.7214\na ≈ 0.849\n\nThis value is closest to the option 0.85.\n\n<<<A>>>"
