    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\nThis reaction is the acid-catalyzed or auto-catalyzed α-bromination of a ketone. One of the hydrogen atoms on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-hydrogen) is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone.**\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\nWhen an α-halo ketone with an available α'-hydrogen (a hydrogen on the α-carbon on the other side of the carbonyl) is treated with a strong base, it undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the formation of a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate, followed by nucleophilic attack by hydroxide and subsequent ring opening, resulting in a ring contraction. The six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to a five-membered ring carboxylic acid.\n*   **Product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.**\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\nThionyl chloride is a standard reagent used to convert carboxylic acids into acid chlorides. Pyridine is typically added as a solvent and to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product 3 is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.**\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃)**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild reducing agent specifically used to reduce highly reactive acid chlorides to aldehydes. The bulky tert-butoxy groups moderate the reactivity of the hydride, allowing the reaction to stop at the aldehyde stage without further reduction to the alcohol.\n*   **Product 4 is cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde.**\n\n**Determining the Number of Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde**. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's structure and symmetry.\n\nThe structure consists of a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO). Let's count the total number of hydrogen atoms:\n*   1 aldehyde proton\n*   1 proton on the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde group (C1)\n*   2 protons on C2\n*   2 protons on C3\n*   2 protons on C4\n*   2 protons on C5\nTotal = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10 hydrogen atoms.\n\nNow, we assess their chemical equivalence. The carbon atom C1, which is bonded to the aldehyde group and a hydrogen atom, is a **chiral center**. It is attached to four different groups: 1) the -CHO group, 2) an -H atom, 3) the -CH₂- group of C2, and 4) the -CH₂- group of C5.\n\nA molecule with a single chiral center is asymmetric. In an asymmetric molecule, no protons can be interchanged by symmetry operations. Therefore, all protons that are in constitutionally different positions are chemically distinct. Furthermore, protons on the same carbon (geminal protons) near a chiral center are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct.\n\n1.  **Aldehyde proton:** Unique. (1st distinct type)\n2.  **Alpha proton (on C1):** Unique. (2nd distinct type)\n3.  **Protons on C2:** These two protons are adjacent to a stereocenter, making them diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct from each other. (3rd and 4th distinct types)\n4.  **Protons on C5:** For the same reason, these two protons are diastereotopic and distinct from each other. They are also distinct from the protons on C2. (5th and 6th distinct types)\n5.  **Protons on C3:** These two protons are diastereotopic due to the chirality in the molecule. They are distinct from each other. (7th and 8th distinct types)\n6.  **Protons on C4:** These two protons are also diastereotopic and distinct from each other and from the protons on C3. (9th and 10th distinct types)\n\nSince all ten hydrogen atoms are in chemically unique environments due to the lack of symmetry, there are 10 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in total.\n\n<<<D>>>"
