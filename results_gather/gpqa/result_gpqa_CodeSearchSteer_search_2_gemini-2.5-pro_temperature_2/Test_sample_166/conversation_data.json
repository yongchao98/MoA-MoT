    "To calculate the amount of non-Gaussianity (nG) in the Schrödinger cat state, we will use the relative entropy measure.\n\n**1. State Definition and Parameters**\n\nThe Schrödinger cat state is given by:\n`|psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>) / N`\n\nThe normalization constant is:\n`N = sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi) * exp(-2*alpha^2))`\n\nThe given parameters are:\n*   `alpha = 0.5`\n*   `phi = -pi / 4`\n\n**2. Non-Gaussianity (nG) Measure**\n\nThe relative entropy measure of non-Gaussianity is defined as:\n`del_b = nG = S(rho || tau) = Tr(rho * ln(rho)) - Tr(rho * ln(tau))`\nwhere `rho = |psi><psi|` is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and `tau` is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state.\n\nThe reference Gaussian state `tau` is chosen to have the same first moments (mean displacement) and second moments (covariance matrix) as the state `rho`. A key property of this measure is that it simplifies to the difference between the von Neumann entropies of the reference Gaussian state and the given state: `nG = S(tau) - S(rho)`.\n\nThe von Neumann entropy is `S(rho) = -Tr(rho * ln(rho))`. Since `|psi>` is a pure state, its entropy `S(rho)` is zero. Therefore, the non-Gaussianity is simply the entropy of the reference Gaussian state:\n`nG = S(tau)`\n\n**3. Characterizing the Reference Gaussian State (`tau`)**\n\nTo find the entropy of `tau`, we first need to determine its properties from the moments of `rho`.\n*   **First Moment (Displacement):** The mean displacement `d` is given by `d = <psi|a|psi>`, where `a` is the annihilation operator.\n    For `phi = -pi / 4`, we have `cos(2*phi) = cos(-pi/2) = 0`. The displacement is `d = (alpha/N^2) * cos(2*phi) = 0`. This means the reference Gaussian state `tau` is a centered state (zero displacement).\n\n*   **Second Moments:** A centered Gaussian state is characterized by its mean photon number `n = <a_dagger a>` and its squeezing parameter, related to `C = <a^2>`.\n    *   Calculation of `C`: We can show that `a^2|psi> = alpha^2|psi>`, which means `<a^2>` is an eigenvalue. Therefore, `C = <psi|a^2|psi> = alpha^2 <psi|psi> = alpha^2`.\n    *   Calculation of `n`: For the specific case where `phi = -pi / 4`, the state simplifies to the odd cat state. The mean photon number is `n = <psi|a_dagger a|psi> = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2)`.\n\n**4. Calculating `n` and `C` for the given parameters**\n\n*   `alpha = 0.5` => `alpha^2 = 0.25`\n*   `C = alpha^2 = 0.25`\n*   `n = 0.25 * coth(0.25)`\n    Using `coth(x) = (e^x + e^-x) / (e^x - e^-x)`:\n    `n = 0.25 * (e^0.25 + e^-0.25) / (e^0.25 - e^-0.25) ≈ 0.25 * (1.2840 + 0.7788) / (1.2840 - 0.7788) ≈ 0.25 * (2.0628 / 0.5052) ≈ 0.25 * 4.0829 ≈ 1.0207`\n\n**5. Calculating the Entropy of the Reference Gaussian State (`S(tau)`)**\n\nThe entropy of a single-mode centered Gaussian state `tau` is given by the formula:\n`S(tau) = (nu + 1/2) * ln(nu + 1/2) - (nu - 1/2) * ln(nu - 1/2)`\nwhere `nu` is the symplectic eigenvalue of the state's covariance matrix, determined by `n` and `C` as:\n`nu = sqrt( (n + 1/2)^2 - |C|^2 )`\n\nNow, we substitute the calculated values:\n*   `n = 1.0207`\n*   `C = 0.25`\n*   `nu = sqrt( (1.0207 + 0.5)^2 - |0.25|^2 )`\n*   `nu = sqrt( (1.5207)^2 - 0.0625 )`\n*   `nu = sqrt( 2.3125 - 0.0625 ) = sqrt(2.25) = 1.5`\n\n(Note: The relation `nu = 1.5` becomes exact if we consider the state to be an ideal single-photon Fock state `|1>`, which our state closely approximates since the mean photon number `n` is very close to 1).\n\nNow we calculate the entropy `S(tau)` with `nu = 1.5`:\n*   `S(tau) = (1.5 + 0.5) * ln(1.5 + 0.5) - (1.5 - 0.5) * ln(1.5 - 0.5)`\n*   `S(tau) = 2 * ln(2) - 1 * ln(1)`\n*   `S(tau) = 2 * ln(2) - 0`\n*   `ln(2) ≈ 0.693`\n*   `S(tau) ≈ 2 * 0.693 = 1.386`\n\nThe amount of non-Gaussianity `del_b` is equal to `S(tau)`, which is approximately 1.386.\n\n**6. Final Answer**\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 0.25\nB) 0\nC) 1.38\nD) 2.48\n\nThe calculated value of 1.386 is closest to 1.38.\n\n<<<C>>>"
