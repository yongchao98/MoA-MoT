    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the permitted and non-permitted partial waves based on the provided conservation laws and quantum mechanical principles.\n\n### **Initial State: `1S0`**\nThe initial state of the two-nucleon (NN) system is given by the term symbol `1S0`.\n*   Spin multiplicity `2S+1 = 1` implies total spin `S(NN)_initial = 0`.\n*   Orbital angular momentum `L = S` implies `L(NN)_initial = 0`.\n*   Total angular momentum `J = 0` implies `J(NN)_initial = 0`.\n\nThe parity of the initial state is given by `P = (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### **Final State: `NN_final + X`**\nThe system decays into a final two-nucleon state (`NN_final`) and a particle `X`.\n\n**Particle X:**\n*   Intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n*   It is emitted in a partial wave with orbital angular momentum `l_X` (s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3).\n\n**Final NN State:**\n*   The problem states the final NN system has an isospin `T(NN)_final = 0`.\n*   Its other quantum numbers (S, L, J) are given by the term symbols in the options.\n\n### **Conservation Laws and Constraints**\n\n1.  **Pauli Statistics for the Final NN State:** The problem explicitly states that the final NN state must satisfy the relation `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. Given `T(NN)_final = 0`, this becomes:\n    `0 = S(NN)_final + L(NN)_final + 1 (mod 2)`\n    This equation holds true only if `S(NN)_final + L(NN)_final` is an odd number. A state where `S+L` is even is therefore forbidden for a `T=0` two-nucleon system.\n\n2.  **Parity Conservation:** The total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n    `P(initial) = P(final)`\n    `P(NN_initial) = P(NN_final) * P(X_intrinsic) * P(orbital_X)`\n    `(-1)^(L_initial) = (-1)^(L_final) * (-1) * (-1)^(l_X)`\n    Since `L_initial = 0`, we have:\n    `+1 = (-1)^(L_final + l_X + 1)`\n    This requires the exponent `(L_final + l_X + 1)` to be an even number, which means `L_final + l_X` must be an odd number.\n\n3.  **Angular Momentum Conservation:** The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state. We assume the spin of particle X is zero, a common case for emitted mesons like pions which have negative intrinsic parity.\n    `vec(J_initial) = vec(J_final_NN) + vec(l_X)`\n    Since `J_initial = 0`, this implies `vec(J_final_NN) + vec(l_X) = 0`. This can only be true if the magnitudes are equal, so `J_final_NN = l_X`.\n\n### **Analysis of the Options**\n\nWe will check each option against the three conditions derived above. A transition is forbidden if it violates any one of these rules.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `S=3`, `L=2`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X = 1`.\n*   **1. Pauli Check**: `S+L = 3+2 = 5` (odd). **Allowed**.\n*   **2. Parity Check**: `L+l_X = 2+1 = 3` (odd). **Allowed**.\n*   **3. Ang. Mom. Check**: `J = l_X` -> `1 = 1`. **Allowed**.\n    *Note: While a two-nucleon system cannot have a total spin S=3, this decay is consistent with the specific rules given in the prompt.*\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S=1`, `L=1`, `J=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`-wave): `l_X = 0`.\n*   **1. Pauli Check**: `S+L = 1+1 = 2` (even). **Forbidden**. The rule `S+L` must be odd for a `T=0` state is violated.\n*   **2. Parity Check**: `L+l_X = 1+0 = 1` (odd). **Allowed**.\n*   **3. Ang. Mom. Check**: `J = l_X` -> `0 = 0`. **Allowed**.\nSince this option violates the Pauli statistics rule for the final state, this transition is not permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S=1`, `L=0`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X = 1`.\n*   **1. Pauli Check**: `S+L = 1+0 = 1` (odd). **Allowed**.\n*   **2. Parity Check**: `L+l_X = 0+1 = 1` (odd). **Allowed**.\n*   **3. Ang. Mom. Check**: `J = l_X` -> `1 = 1`. **Allowed**.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S=1`, `L=2`, `J=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`-wave): `l_X = 3`.\n*   **1. Pauli Check**: `S+L = 1+2 = 3` (odd). **Allowed**.\n*   **2. Parity Check**: `L+l_X = 2+3 = 5` (odd). **Allowed**.\n*   **3. Ang. Mom. Check**: `J = l_X` -> `3 = 3`. **Allowed**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe only transition that violates the conditions given in the problem is **B) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**. The proposed final state (`3P0` with `T=0`) is inconsistent with the Pauli statistics requirement that `S+L` must be odd for a `T=0` two-nucleon system.\n\n<<<B>>>"
