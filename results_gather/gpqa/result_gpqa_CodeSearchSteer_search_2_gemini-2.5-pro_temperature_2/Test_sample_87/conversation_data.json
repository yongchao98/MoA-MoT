    "The experiment describes an active immune response in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). The oral delivery of viral proteins leads to their uptake in Peyer's patches, which are critical secondary lymphoid organs in the intestine. Here, B cells that recognize the antigen become activated.\n\nThe isolation of a *proliferating* cell population that shows *high variability* specifically in the *variable heavy chain gene* points to a process known as affinity maturation, which occurs within germinal centers. Peyer's patches are known to contain these germinal centers where B cells mature.\n\nBased on these facts, we can evaluate the options:\n\n*   **A) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate and adaptive immune response involving a cascade of proteins, but it does not cause genetic mutations in the variable genes of B cells.\n*   **B) VDJ recombination:** This genetic recombination process creates the initial, vast diversity of B cell receptors. However, it occurs in developing B cells in the bone marrow, *before* they encounter an antigen. The process described in the question happens *after* antigen exposure in a secondary lymphoid organ.\n*   **C) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a cellular mechanism that deliberately introduces point mutations into the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes in activated B cells. This process occurs in proliferating B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches. Its purpose is to generate B cell variants, some of which will have a higher affinity for the antigen. This directly explains the \"high variability\" observed in the \"variable heavy chain gene\" of the proliferating cells.\n*   **D) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process also occurs in activated B cells in germinal centers. However, it changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain, not the variable region. This switches the antibody's isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgA, which is common in the gut), thereby altering its effector function without changing its antigen specificity. Since the high variability was found in the *variable* gene, CSR is not the primary process being observed.\n\nTherefore, the high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating B cells in the Peyer's patches is a hallmark of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
