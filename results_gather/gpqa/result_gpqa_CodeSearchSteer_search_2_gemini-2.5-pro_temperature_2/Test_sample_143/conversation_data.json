    "To determine the mean decay distance of the X meson, we will follow these steps:\n1.  Calculate the proper mean lifetime (τ) of the particle from its decay width (Γ).\n2.  Determine the Lorentz factor (γ) and the velocity factor (β) from the particle's energy and mass.\n3.  Calculate the mean decay distance in the laboratory frame.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Proper Mean Lifetime (τ)\nThe proper mean lifetime (τ) of a particle is related to its decay width (Γ) by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The formula is:\nτ = ħ / Γ\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nThe given values are:\n*   Decay width, Γ_X = 320 MeV\n*   Reduced Planck constant, ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻²² MeV·s\n\nPlugging these values in:\nτ = (6.582 × 10⁻²² MeV·s) / 320 MeV\nτ ≈ 2.057 × 10⁻²⁴ s\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Lorentz Factor (γ) and Velocity (β)\nThe Lorentz factor (γ) is the ratio of the total energy (E) to the rest mass energy (m*c²). In high-energy physics, mass is often given in units of energy (MeV/c² or GeV/c²), making the calculation straightforward.\n\nGiven:\n*   Total energy, E_X = 8 GeV\n*   Rest mass, m_X = 1.2 GeV\n\nγ = E_X / m_X = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 20/3 ≈ 6.667\n\nThe velocity factor β = v/c is related to the Lorentz factor by:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - β²)\n\nRearranging for β:\nβ = √(1 - 1/γ²)\nβ = √(1 - 1/(20/3)²) = √(1 - 9/400) = √(391/400)\nβ ≈ 0.98867\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Mean Decay Distance\nThe mean decay distance (d) in the laboratory frame is the distance the particle travels, on average, before decaying. Due to time dilation, the lifetime in the lab frame is longer than the proper lifetime by a factor of γ. The formula for the decay distance is:\nd = v * γ * τ = β * c * γ * τ\n\nWe can group the terms as d = (γβ) * c * τ. Let's calculate the product γβ:\nγβ = (20/3) * (√391 / 20) = √391 / 3 ≈ 6.591\n\nNow, we calculate the decay distance:\n*   c (speed of light) ≈ 3 × 10⁸ m/s\n*   τ ≈ 2.057 × 10⁻²⁴ s\n*   γβ ≈ 6.591\n\nd ≈ 6.591 * (3 × 10⁸ m/s) * (2.057 × 10⁻²⁴ s)\nd ≈ 4.0655 × 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\nAlternatively, we can use the convenient constant ħc (reduced Planck constant times the speed of light).\n*   ħc ≈ 197.3 MeV·fm (where 1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m)\n\nThe formula for decay distance becomes:\nd = γβ * (ħc / Γ)\nd ≈ 6.591 * (197.3 MeV·fm / 320 MeV)\nd ≈ 6.591 * 0.6166 fm\nd ≈ 4.0655 fm\nd ≈ 4.0655 × 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
