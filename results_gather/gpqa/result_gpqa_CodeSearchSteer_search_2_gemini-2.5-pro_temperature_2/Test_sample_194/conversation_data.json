    "To determine the maximum orbital period for the second planet to show both transit and occultation events, we first need to understand the geometric conditions required for a transit.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Key Relationships\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit to transit its star, its orbital plane must be closely aligned with our line of sight. The geometry of a transit is described by the impact parameter (`b`), which is the projected distance between the center of the planet and the center of the star at mid-transit, normalized by the star's radius.\n\nThe impact parameter is related to the orbit's semi-major axis (`a`) and its inclination (`i`) by the formula:\n`b = (a * cos(i)) / R_s`\nwhere `R_s` is the stellar radius.\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law, the square of a planet's orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (`a`). For two planets orbiting the same star, this gives the relationship:\n`(P₂/P₁)² = (a₂/a₁รา`\n\n### Step 2: Using the First Planet to Determine the System's Inclination\n\nWe are given the following for the first planet:\n*   Orbital Period (P₁) = 3 days\n*   Impact Parameter (b₁) = 0.2\n\nSince both planets are in the same orbital plane, their orbital inclination (`i`) is the same. We can establish a relationship between the two planets. From the impact parameter formula, we can say:\n`b₁ / a₁ = cos(i) / R_s`\n`b₂ / a₂ = cos(i) / R_s`\n\nTherefore:\n`b₁ / a₁ = b₂ / a₂`\nwhich rearranges to:\n`a₂ / a₁ = b₂ / b₁`\n\n### Step 3: Deriving the Period of the Second Planet\n\nNow we can combine this geometric relationship with Kepler's Third Law:\n`(P₂/P₁)² = (a₂/a₁รา = (b₂/b₁)³`\n\nSolving for P₂ gives:\n`P₂ = P₁ * (b₂ / b₁)⁽³ᐟ²⁾`\n\n### Step 4: Determining the Maximum Impact Parameter (b₂) for a Transit\n\nFor a transit event to occur, the planet must pass in front of the stellar disk. The limiting case for this is when the center of the planet passes exactly over the edge (limb) of the star. In this situation, the projected distance between the centers is equal to the star's radius.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible impact parameter for the center of the planet to transit is `b₂ = 1`. The specific radii of the planet and the star are not needed for this definition of a transit event, as the impact parameter is a normalized value. For a transit and occultation to both be observed, this geometric condition must be met.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Maximum Period (P₂)\n\nWe now have all the necessary values:\n*   `P₁ = 3` days\n*   `b₁ = 0.2`\n*   `b₂ = 1.0`\n\nPlugging these into our derived equation:\n`P₂ = 3 * (1.0 / 0.2)⁽³ᐟ²⁾`\n`P₂ = 3 * (5)⁽³ᐟ²⁾`\n`P₂ = 3 * (5 * √5)`\n`P₂ = 3 * (5 * 2.236)`\n`P₂ = 3 * 11.18`\n`P₂ ≈ 33.54` days\n\nThe maximum orbital period for the second planet to exhibit transit and occultation events is approximately 33.5 days.\n\n<<<C>>>"
