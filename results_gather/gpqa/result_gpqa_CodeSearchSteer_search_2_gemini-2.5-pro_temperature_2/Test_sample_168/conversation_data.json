    "The problem describes two types of nuclear decay, which are analogous to two modes of double-beta decay.\n\n1.  **Original Decay (2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V):** This corresponds to the standard, observed two-neutrino double beta decay (2νββ). In this process, the decay energy is shared among four final-state particles (the two B nuclei recoil, but the two E and two V light particles carry most of the kinetic energy). Because the energy can be distributed among these particles in a continuous variety of ways, the sum of the kinetic energies of the two E particles has a continuous spectrum. This spectrum is broad, peaks at a relatively low energy, and extends up to the endpoint, Q. The endpoint value, Q, is determined by the mass difference between the initial and final particles: Q = (m₂ₐ - m₂ₒ - 2mₑ - 2mᵥ)c², where 'm' represents the respective masses.\n\n2.  **Exotic Decay (2A -> 2B + 2E + M):** This corresponds to a hypothetical neutrinoless double-beta decay where a single, exotic massless particle M is emitted. This is often called Majoron-emitting neutrinoless double beta decay (0νββM).\n\nTo compare the total energy spectrum of the E particles in both cases, we need to consider two aspects: the shape of the spectrum and the value of the endpoint.\n\n*   **Spectrum Shape:** In the exotic decay, the decay energy is shared among three final-state particles (two E particles and the massless particle M). Since the energy is still shared among multiple particles in a variable way, the resulting sum energy spectrum of the two E particles remains continuous. However, the distribution of this energy, governed by the available phase space, changes because there is one fewer particle in the final state compared to the original decay. The shape is \"adjusted\"; specifically, the peak of the energy distribution for the Majoron-emitting decay is shifted to higher energies compared to the two-neutrino mode. This eliminates options A and B, which state the spectrum becomes discrete.\n\n*   **Endpoint Value:** The endpoint represents the maximum possible combined kinetic energy of the two E particles. This maximum occurs when the other light, emitted particles (2V in the first case, M in the second) carry away zero kinetic energy. The total energy released in each decay is determined by the difference in rest mass between the parent and daughter particles.\n    *   **Original Decay Endpoint (Q₁):**  The energy released is `Q₁ = m(2A)c² - ( m(2B)c² + 2m(E)c² + 2m(V)c² )`. The particles 'V' are described as \"light,\" which corresponds to neutrinos. Neutrinos have a very small but non-zero mass.\n    *   **Exotic Decay Endpoint (Q₂):** The energy released is `Q₂ = m(2A)c² - ( m(2B)c² + 2m(E)c² + m(M)c² )`. The particle 'M' is stipulated to be *massless*, so m(M) = 0.\n\n    Comparing the two endpoints:\n    `Q₂ = m(2A)c² - m(2B)c² - 2m(E)c²`\n    `Q₁ = Q₂ - 2m(V)c²`\n\n    Since the mass of the V particles (neutrinos) is greater than zero, `2m(V)c²` is a positive value. Therefore, `Q₂ > Q₁`. The total energy released in the exotic decay is greater than in the original decay, which means the endpoint of the E particle energy spectrum increases.\n\nCombining these findings, the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.\n\n<<<C>>>"
