    "The identity of the final product, **4**, is determined by a four-step reaction sequence. The number of chemically distinct hydrogens is then found by analyzing the symmetry of product **4**.\n\n**Step-by-step reaction analysis:**\n\n1.  **Formation of Product 1:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is a norbornadiene derivative that acts as a dienophile. 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, in the presence of sodium iodide, serves as a precursor for the in-situ generation of *o*-xylylene, a reactive diene. Since two equivalents of the *o*-xylylene precursor are used, a double Diels-Alder reaction occurs, with one molecule of *o*-xylylene adding to each of the two double bonds of the norbornadiene system. This results in the formation of a large, polycyclic adduct, **1**.\n\n2.  **Formation of Product 2:** Product **1** is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid. Aqueous mineral acids like H₂SO₄ are commonly used to remove the acid-labile *tert*-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) protecting group, and by extension, *tert*-butyl ethers. The *tert*-butoxy group on product **1** is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl (-OH) group, yielding the corresponding alcohol, **2**.\n\n3.  **Formation of Product 3:** Product **2** is subjected to a Parikh-Doering oxidation. This reaction uses the SO₃-pyridine complex in DMSO to mildly oxidize primary and secondary alcohols to aldehydes and ketones, respectively. The secondary alcohol at the C7-bridge position of product **2** is oxidized to a ketone, forming the polycyclic ketone **3**.\n\n4.  **Formation of Product 4:** Product **3** is heated to 150°C. This temperature induces a retro-Diels-Alder reaction, reversing the initial cycloaddition. The molecule fragments, releasing two molecules of *o*-xylylene and one molecule of 7-oxobicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (also known as 7-norbornadienone). This latter molecule is known to be unstable and readily undergoes a cheletropic extrusion of carbon monoxide (CO) to form the highly stable aromatic compound, benzene. The two highly reactive *o*-xylylene molecules, being unable to react with other species, dimerize. The thermal dimerization of *o*-xylylene predominantly proceeds via a [4+2] cycloaddition, where one molecule acts as the diene and the other as the dienophile. This leads to the formation of (4ar,10ar)-4a,9,10,10a-tetrahydrophenanthrene, which is the final product **4**.\n\n**Analysis of chemically distinct hydrogens in product 4:**\n\nThe structure of product **4**, (4ar,10ar)-4a,9,10,10a-tetrahydrophenanthrene, possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry. This symmetry element makes pairs of hydrogen atoms chemically equivalent.\n*   **Aromatic Hydrogens:** There are eight aromatic protons on the two outer benzene rings. Due to the C₂ symmetry, the protons at positions 1 and 8 are equivalent, as are 2 and 7, 3 and 6, and 4 and 5. This results in **four** distinct signals for the aromatic protons.\n*   **Bridgehead (Methine) Hydrogens:** The two protons at the bridgehead positions (4a and 10a) are equivalent due to the C₂ axis. This gives **one** signal.\n*   **Methylene Hydrogens:** There are two methylene groups (-CH₂-) at positions 9 and 10. The two protons within each methylene group are diastereotopic (chemically non-equivalent) because of the rigid, chiral structure of the molecule. However, the C₂ symmetry makes the \"upper\" proton on C9 equivalent to the \"upper\" proton on C10, and the \"lower\" proton on C9 equivalent to the \"lower\" on C10. This results in **two** distinct signals for the four methylene protons.\n\nIn total, the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product **4** is 4 (aromatic) + 1 (methine) + 2 (methylene) = **7**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
