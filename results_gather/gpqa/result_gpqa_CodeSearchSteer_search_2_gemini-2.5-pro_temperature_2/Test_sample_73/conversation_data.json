    "The problem describes a classic scenario of radioactive decay, which is governed by the principles of the exponential distribution. A key feature of this process is that it is \"memoryless\". This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed.\n\nHere is a step-by-step calculation to determine the decay probability:\n\n**1. Define the Decay Probability**\n\nThe probability of an atom surviving for a time `t` is given by the formula:\nP(survival, t) = e⁻ˡᵗ\nwhere `λ` is the decay constant.\n\nConsequently, the probability of an atom decaying within time `t` is:\nP(decay, t) = 1 - e⁻ˡᵗ\n\n**2. Calculate the Decay Constant (λ)**\n\nWe are given that the probability of the atom decaying within 100 minutes is 32%.\n\nP(decay, 100) = 0.32\n1 - e⁻¹⁰⁰ˡ = 0.32\n\nSolving for the exponential term, we get:\ne⁻¹⁰⁰ˡ = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\n**3. Apply the Memoryless Property**\n\nWe need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes. Because radioactive decay is a memoryless process, the 50 minutes of survival do not affect the future probability. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the probability that a new atom will decay in a 150-minute interval.\n\nP_target = P(decay, 150) = 1 - e⁻¹⁵⁰ˡ\n\n**4. Determine the Final Probability**\n\nWe can find the value of e⁻¹⁵⁰ˡ from our known value of e⁻¹⁰⁰ˡ:\n\ne⁻¹⁵⁰ˡ = (e⁻¹⁰⁰ˡ)¹·⁵ = (0.68)¹·⁵\n\nNow, we calculate the value of (0.68)¹·⁵:\n(0.68)¹·⁵ ≈ 0.55985\n\nFinally, we substitute this back into our probability formula:\nP_target = 1 - 0.55985 ≈ 0.44015\n\nThis probability, when expressed as a percentage, is approximately 44%.\n\nBased on the calculation, the correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
