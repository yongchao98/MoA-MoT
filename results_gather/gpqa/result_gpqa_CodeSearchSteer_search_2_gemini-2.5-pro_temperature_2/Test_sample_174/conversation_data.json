    "The problem describes an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution. In the long-wavelength approximation (where the size of the spheroid is much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation), such a distribution can be modeled as a simple oscillating electric dipole. The key characteristics of the radiation from this dipole determine the answer.\n\n### Angular Dependence of Radiated Power\n\nFor a simple electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (dP/dΩ) is given by a function proportional to sin²(θ), where θ is the angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis).\n\nThe formula is:\n*   *dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)*\n    where C is a constant that depends on the frequency and the magnitude of the dipole moment.\n\nThe maximum power, A, is radiated at θ = 90°, where sin²(90°) = 1.\n*   *A = C * sin²(90°) = C*\n\nWe need to find the fraction of this maximum power radiated at θ = 30°.\n*   *Power at 30° = C * sin²(30°)*\n*   Since sin(30°) = 1/2, sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4.\n*   *Power at 30° = C * (1/4) = A / 4*\n\nTherefore, the fraction of the maximum power A radiated at an angle of 30° is **1/4**.\n\n### Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power\n\nThe power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is strongly dependent on the frequency (ω) of oscillation. The total radiated power is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency (P ∝ ω⁴).\n\nThe relationship between angular frequency (ω), speed of light (c), and wavelength (λ) is:\n*   *ω = 2πc / λ*\n\nSubstituting this into the power relation, we get:\n*   *P ∝ (2πc / λ)⁴ ∝ 1 / λ⁴ ∝ λ⁻⁴*\n\nThis means the radiated power per unit solid angle, *f*, is proportional to λ⁻⁴. This inverse fourth-power relationship is also characteristic of Rayleigh scattering, which explains why the sky is blue.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining these two results:\n*   The fraction of maximum power at θ = 30° is **1/4**.\n*   The function for radiated power per unit solid angle, *f*, has a wavelength dependence of **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nMatching this with the given options, the correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
