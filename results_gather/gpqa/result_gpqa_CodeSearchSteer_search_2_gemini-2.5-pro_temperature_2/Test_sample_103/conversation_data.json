    "The ratio of the orbital periods is determined by analyzing the relationship between the observed wavelength shifts and the orbital parameters of the exoplanets. The steps to solve the problem are as follows:\n\n1.  **Relate Wavelength Shift to Radial Velocity:** The periodic shift of a spectral line (Δλ) detected via the radial velocity (RV) method is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r) along the line of sight. The amplitude of this shift, Δλ_max, is therefore proportional to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity, K.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Ratio of RV Amplitudes:** Given that the periodic shift for the host of planet #1 is 5 miliangstrom and for the host of planet #2 is 7 miliangstrom, the ratio of their RV amplitudes is:\n    K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n\n3.  **Use the Radial Velocity Amplitude Formula:** The amplitude of the radial velocity (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by the formula:\n    K = ( (2πG) / P )¹ᐟ³ \\* ( m_p \\* sin(i) / M_star²ᐟ³ )\n    Where:\n    *   P is the orbital period\n    *   m_p is the mass of the planet\n    *   M_star is the mass of the star\n    *   i is the orbital inclination\n    *   G is the gravitational constant\n\n4.  **Apply Given Conditions:** The problem states that the stars have the same mass (M_star₁ = M_star₂) and that the detected planets both have masses \"similar to that of Neptune\". In the RV method, the quantity that can be determined is the planet's *minimum mass*, which is m_p \\* sin(i). Therefore, the most direct interpretation is that the minimum masses are similar (m_p₁\\*sin(i)₁ ≈ m_p₂\\*sin(i)₂).\n\n5.  **Determine the Period Ratio:** By setting up a ratio of the RV amplitudes (K₂ / K₁) and canceling the terms that are equal (G, M_star, and m_p\\*sin(i)), we can find the relationship between the amplitudes and the periods:\n    K₂ / K₁ = (P₁ / P₂)¹ᐟ³\n\n6.  **Solve for P₂ / P₁:** Now, substitute the known value of K₂ / K₁:\n    1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)¹ᐟ³\n\n    To solve for the period ratio, cube both sides:\n    P₁ / P₂ = 1.4³ = 2.744\n\n    The question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio P₂ / P₁:\n    P₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis result shows that the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
