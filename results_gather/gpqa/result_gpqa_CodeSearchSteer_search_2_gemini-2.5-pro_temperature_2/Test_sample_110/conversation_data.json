    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition. The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), creates a nucleophile from the ketone, which then attacks the α,β-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate). Michael additions are a form of conjugate addition.\n\n2.  **Enolate Formation**: The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This ketone has two α-carbons (carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group): C2 and C6.\n    *   **C2** is substituted with both an ethyl and a methyl group, so it has no α-hydrogens to be removed.\n    *   **C6** is substituted with a methyl group and has one α-hydrogen.\n    Therefore, the bulky base t-BuOK must deprotonate C6 to form the enolate. Steric hindrance at C2 prevents any reaction there.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: The enolate formed at C6 attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (`CH2=CH-COOEt`). This is a 1,4-conjugate addition. A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate moiety.\n\n4.  **Product Structure A**: After the attack and subsequent protonation (during workup), the resulting molecule is 6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. To match this structure with the given options, we must analyze the provided names.\n    *   The name in options B and D is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   Let's analyze this name: The parent chain is ethyl propanoate. A substituted cyclohexyl ring is attached to carbon 3 of the propanoate.\n    *   On the cyclohexyl ring substituent, the point of attachment is C1. C1 also has a methyl group. C2 is a carbonyl group (oxo). C3 has an ethyl and a methyl group.\n    *   This structure `(EtOOC-CH2-CH2)-C1(Me)-C2(=O)-C3(Et,Me)-...` perfectly matches the connectivity of the product derived from the Michael addition, where the original C6 of the ketone becomes C1, the original C1 becomes C2, and the original C2 becomes C3. Thus, product A corresponds to the name in options B and D.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (KOH, H₂O)\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a nitro-Michael addition. The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group. The resulting carbanion (a nitronate) attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Nitronate Formation**: KOH removes a proton from the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (`CH3-CH2-CH2-NO2`), creating the nucleophilic nitronate anion, `CH3-CH2-CH⁻-NO2`.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack**: This nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon (C3) of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, `CH3-CH=CH-CN`).\n\n4.  **Product Structure B**: A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. The product structure is:\n    ```\n        NO₂\n         |\n    CH₃-CH₂-CH\n              |\n         CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN\n    ```\n5.  **IUPAC Naming**: To name this product, we find the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (the nitrile, -CN). The chain has 6 carbons. Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon: `N≡C¹-C²H₂-C³H(CH₃)-C⁴H(NO₂)-C⁵H₂-C⁶H₃`. The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    The correct IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This matches the name given for product B in options C and D.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The product of **Reaction A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**. This narrows the choice to options B and D.\n*   The product of **Reaction B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**. This narrows the choice to options C and D.\n\nThe only option that correctly identifies both products is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
