    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Core Physics Principle**\n\nThe problem states that the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This is a critical piece of information because it means we can use the **Boltzmann equation** to describe the distribution of atoms among their different energy levels.\n\nThe Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy states. For a higher energy level 2 (with energy E₂) and a lower energy level 1 (with energy E₁), the ratio of their populations (N₂/N₁) is given by:\n\nN₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T)]\n\nwhere:\n*   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights of the levels (which we won't need for this problem).\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant (1.380649 × 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n**2. Define the Ratio and Check for Consistency**\n\nThe problem observes \"the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)\". This could be either N₁/N₂ or N₂/N₁. We are also told that this ratio *decreases* when the star has spots (i.e., when the temperature is lower). Let's test which definition of the ratio fits this observation.\n\n*   T_nospots = 6000 K (hotter)\n*   T_spots = 5500 K (cooler)\n\nLet's assume the observed ratio R is N₂/N₁.\nR(T) = N₂/N₁ ∝ exp(-ΔE / kT), where ΔE = E₂ - E₁ is positive.\n*   When T decreases (from 6000 K to 5500 K), the term 1/T increases.\n*   This makes the exponent (-ΔE/kT) more negative.\n*   This, in turn, makes exp(-ΔE/kT) smaller.\nSo, as the temperature decreases, the ratio N₂/N₁ decreases. This is consistent with the problem statement that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Therefore, the ratio being measured is of the higher energy level population to the lower energy level population (R = N₂/N₁).\n\n**3. Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE)**\n\nThe energy difference between the two levels corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given wavelength. The energy of a photon (E) is related to its wavelength (λ) by the formula:\n\nE = h * c / λ\n\nwhere:\n*   h is Planck's constant (6.62607015 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n*   c is the speed of light (~3.00 × 10⁸ m/s).\n*   λ is the wavelength (1448 Å = 1448 × 10⁻¹⁰ m).\n\nLet's calculate the term ΔE/k which will be used in the Boltzmann equation:\n\nΔE / k = (h * c) / (λ * k)\nΔE / k = (6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s * 3.00 × 10⁸ m/s) / (1448 × 10⁻¹⁰ m * 1.381 × 10⁻²³ J/K)\nΔE / k ≈ 99413 K\n\n**4. Calculate the Factor of Change**\n\nThe question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it does. This is the ratio of the ratios:\n\nFactor = R_nospots / R_spots\n\nLet's write this out using the Boltzmann equation:\n\nFactor = { (g₂/g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)] } / { (g₂/g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_spots)] }\n\nThe statistical weights (g₂/g₁) cancel out. We can simplify the expression using the properties of exponents:\n\nFactor = exp[ -ΔE / (k * T_nospots) + ΔE / (k * T_spots) ]\nFactor = exp[ (ΔE/k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nFactor = exp[ 99413 * (1/5500 - 1/6000) ]\nFactor = exp[ 99413 * ( (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) ) ]\nFactor = exp[ 99413 * (500 / 33,000,000) ]\nFactor = exp[ 99413 / 66000 ]\nFactor = exp(1.50626)\n\nCalculating the final value:\n\nFactor ≈ 4.5098\n\nThis value is approximately 4.5.\n\n<<<C>>>"
