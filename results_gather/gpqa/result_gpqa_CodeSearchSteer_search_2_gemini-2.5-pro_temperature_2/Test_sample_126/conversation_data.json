    "When 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated, it undergoes a-sigmatropic rearrangement known as the Cope rearrangement. This type of reaction involves the reorganization of electrons in a 1,5-diene system through a cyclic, six-membered transition state. Although the starting material contains a 1,6-diene system within its main chain, the reaction proceeds through this pathway to form a new structural isomer.\n\nThe reaction involves the breaking of the sigma bond between carbons 4 and 5, and the formation of a new sigma bond between carbons 2 and 7. Simultaneously, the Ï€-bonds shift, resulting in new double bonds between carbons 3 and 4, and carbons 5 and 6.\n\nThis rearrangement leads to a change in the carbon skeleton of the molecule. The product formed is 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene. This can be determined by tracing the connectivity of the atoms after the rearrangement and naming the resulting structure according to IUPAC nomenclature. This reaction establishes an equilibrium between the starting material and the product. While the starting material may be more thermodynamically stable due to more substituted double bonds, the formation of the product is the result of the thermal rearrangement process.\n\n<<<A>>>"
