    "To determine which of the given organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism, each molecule must be assessed for chirality. A molecule is chiral, and thus optically active, if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This typically arises from the presence of a chiral center or an axis of chirality.\n\n1.  ***Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate***: This compound belongs to a class of molecules known as biphenyls. Due to the presence of bulky substituents (nitro groups and dimethyl dicarboxylate groups) at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'), free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is hindered. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, can lead to a stable, twisted conformation where the two rings are not in the same plane. If the substitution pattern removes all planes of symmetry, the molecule becomes chiral, existing as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). In this specific molecule, the four bulky groups prevent the rings from becoming coplanar, and the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry, resulting in axial chirality. Therefore, it is optically active.\n\n2.  ***Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate***: This molecule, also known as methyl lactate, possesses a carbon atom at the second position that is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom attached to four distinct groups is defined as a chiral center. The presence of this chiral center makes the molecule asymmetric, leading to two enantiomeric forms that are mirror images of each other. Consequently, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is optically active.\n\n3.  ***Benzophenone***: The chemical structure of benzophenone consists of a central carbonyl group bonded to two phenyl rings. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the carbonyl group. It does not contain any chiral centers. While heavily substituted benzophenones can be forced into a chiral conformation, the parent benzophenone molecule is achiral and therefore not optically active.\n\n4.  ***Dimethyl fumarate***: This molecule is the trans-isomer of an alkene, with a double bond between the second and third carbon atoms. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry (the molecular plane itself). Due to these symmetry elements, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and cannot exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nBased on this analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate (1) and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2) are the compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<B>>>"
