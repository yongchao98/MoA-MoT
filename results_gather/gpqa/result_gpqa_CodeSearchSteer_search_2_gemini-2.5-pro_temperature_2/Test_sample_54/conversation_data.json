    "### Analysis of the Unknown Compound\n\nBased on the provided ¹H NMR data and chemical principles, the unknown compound is identified as **Trans-propenyl acetate**. Here is a detailed breakdown of the spectral data that leads to this conclusion:\n\n1.  **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, singlet):** This signal indicates the presence of three equivalent protons that have no adjacent protons to couple with. The chemical shift of ~2.1 ppm is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon, specifically an acetyl group (CH₃-C=O).\n\n2.  **Signals at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm:** These two signals are in the chemical shift region for vinylic protons (protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond). Their presence indicates a -CH=CH- group.\n\n3.  **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** The signal at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a coupling constant (J) of 16.0 Hz. This large coupling constant is a definitive indicator of a *trans* stereochemical relationship between the two vinylic protons. For comparison, a *cis* relationship typically shows a smaller coupling constant, usually in the range of 6-15 Hz.\n\n4.  **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This signal, representing one proton, is split into a doublet of quartets. This means the proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   The **doublet** splitting arises from coupling with the other vinylic proton at 7.0 ppm (consistent with the *trans* relationship).\n    *   The **quartet** splitting indicates coupling with a group of three equivalent protons, which must be the methyl group observed at 1.6 ppm.\n\n5.  **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, doublet):** This signal corresponds to a methyl group (3H). It is split into a doublet, which means it is adjacent to a single proton. This confirms its coupling to the vinylic proton at 5.5 ppm.\n\n### Assembling the Structure\n\nPutting all the pieces together:\n*   An acetyl group: -OCOCH₃ (from the 2.1 ppm singlet).\n*   A propenyl group: CH₃-CH=CH- (from the signals at 1.6 ppm, 5.5 ppm, and 7.0 ppm).\n\nThis forms the structure **CH₃-CH=CH-O-C(=O)CH₃**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe molecule has a total of 8 protons (3+1+1+3), which matches the sum of the integrations in the NMR data. Butenyl acetate would have 10 protons and can be ruled out. The large coupling constant (16.0 Hz) confirms the *trans* configuration of the double bond. Therefore, the compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<B>>>"
