    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded proton.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Reaction Analysis**\n\n1.  **Product 1 Formation:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is subjected to harsh conditions (heating at 240°C with excess strong base, KOH). The provided IR absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ strongly indicates the formation of a ketone, likely with a strained ring system. Although the given ¹H NMR data is anomalous for common adamantane derivatives, the reaction conditions and IR data point towards the formation of a ketone with the formula C₁₀H₁₄O. The most plausible product under these conditions involving rearrangement is **adamantanone** (2-adamantanone).\n\n2.  **Product 2 Formation:** The ketone (Product 1) is then heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide. This reagent is characteristic of the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which converts a ketone to an alcohol. However, for the next step (ozonolysis) to occur, a carbon-carbon double bond is required. The condition \"heated with an excess\" suggests that the initially formed alcohol, 2-adamantanol, undergoes a subsequent dehydration and rearrangement. Such rearrangements of adamantane derivatives on Lewis acidic surfaces are known to yield **protoadamantene** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]dec-4-ene). Thus, Product 2 is an alkene.\n\n3.  **Product 3 Formation:** Ozone (O₃), followed by a reductive workup with dimethyl sulfide (DMS), is used to cleave the double bond in Product 2. The ozonolysis of protoadamantene cleaves the double bond in its seven-membered ring. This ring-opening reaction transforms the tricyclic protoadamantene into a bicyclic product, **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde**.\n\n### **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 3**\n\nThe final task is to determine the coupling pattern for the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton in the final product, bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde.\n\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** The aldehyde protons (-CHO) are the most deshielded non-exchangeable protons in the molecule, typically appearing at δ 9-10 ppm in an NMR spectrum. Due to the symmetry of the molecule, the two aldehyde protons are chemically equivalent and will produce a single signal pattern.\n\n*   **Coupling Analysis:**\n    *   **³J Coupling (Through 3 Bonds):** The aldehyde proton is attached to the aldehyde carbon, which in turn is bonded to a methine carbon of the bicyclic ring (C3 or C7). There is only one proton on this methine carbon. According to the n+1 rule, this coupling will split the aldehyde proton's signal into a **doublet**.\n    *   **⁴J Coupling (Through 4 Bonds):** In rigid bicyclic systems like bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane, long-range coupling across four bonds can be significant, particularly when the bonds form a 'W' or 'M' shape. In the stable chair-chair conformation of the molecule, such a 'W' pathway exists between the aldehyde proton and the axial protons on the carbons two positions away (e.g., from the CHO on C3 to the axial protons on C2 and C4). Due to the molecule's symmetry, the aldehyde proton couples with two equivalent axial protons. This coupling will split the signal into a **triplet**.\n\nCombining these effects, the signal for the aldehyde proton is first split into a doublet by the adjacent methine proton (³J) and each peak of that doublet is then further split into a triplet by the two equivalent long-range axial protons (⁴J). The resulting pattern is a **doublet of triplets**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
