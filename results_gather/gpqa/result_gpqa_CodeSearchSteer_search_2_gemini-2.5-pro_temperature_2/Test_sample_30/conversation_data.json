    "Here is the step-by-step synthesis and analysis of the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid.**\nThis reaction is the electrophilic nitration of toluene. The methyl group (-CH₃) is an ortho-, para-directing group. The major product, due to less steric hindrance, is the para-substituted isomer.\n*   **Product 1:** *p*-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene).\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄.**\nProduct 1 (*p*-nitrotoluene) is subjected to oxidation. For the next step of the reaction to be plausible, the methyl group must be oxidized to an aldehyde. While these specific reagents can also lead to a carboxylic acid, the formation of an aldehyde is a common intermediate step and necessary for the subsequent reaction.\n*   **Product 2:** *p*-nitrobenzaldehyde (4-nitrobenzaldehyde).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide.**\nThis reaction is a base-catalyzed crossed aldol condensation, specifically known as the Claisen-Schmidt condensation. The enolate of acetone attacks the carbonyl group of *p*-nitrobenzaldehyde. The resulting aldol addition product then undergoes dehydration to form a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone. The trans-isomer (E) is the thermodynamically more stable and major product.\n*   **Product 3:** (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n**Structure of Product 3:**\nThe structure of (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one is:\n\n```\n      NO₂\n      |\n     / \\\n // \\\\\n \\ /--CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃\n    |\n```\nThis molecule has an extended conjugated system, which favors a planar arrangement of the benzene ring and the enone (`-CH=CH-C=O-`) moiety.\n\n**Determining the Molecular Symmetry Group of Product 3:**\nTo find the molecular point group, we must identify the symmetry elements present in the molecule's most stable conformation.\n\n1.  **Axes of Rotation (Cₙ):** There are no C₂, C₃, or higher-order rotation axes in the molecule.\n2.  **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule does not possess a center of inversion. For example, inverting the nitro group through the center of the molecule does not result in an equivalent group.\n3.  **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** Let's consider the plane that contains the benzene ring, the nitro group, and the enone system (`-CH=CH-C=O-`).\n    *   This molecular plane contains most of the atoms.\n    *   The methyl group (-CH₃) at the end of the chain, however, has hydrogen atoms that lie outside this plane. Strictly speaking, because of the tetrahedral geometry of the methyl carbon, this plane is not a true symmetry element.\n    *   However, in chemical contexts, it is common practice to consider the time-averaged symmetry, where the rotating methyl group is treated as being symmetric with respect to the plane of the main molecular framework. Under this reasonable approximation, the molecular plane acts as a mirror plane (σ).\n\nA molecule that possesses only a single plane of symmetry (and the identity element, E) belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n\n**Comparing with the given options:**\n*   A) D₂h: Requires high symmetry, including three perpendicular C₂ axes. Incorrect.\n*   B) C₂h: Requires a C₂ axis and a perpendicular mirror plane. Incorrect.\n*   C) Cₛ: Requires only a single plane of symmetry. This fits the structure when considering the plane of the molecule. Correct.\n*   D) C₃: Requires a three-fold axis of rotation. Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of product 3 is Cₛ.\n\n<<<C>>>"
