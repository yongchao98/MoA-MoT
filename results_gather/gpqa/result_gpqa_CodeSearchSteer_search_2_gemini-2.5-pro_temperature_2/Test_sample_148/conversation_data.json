    "The observations point to the presence of two distinct chemical species that are isomers of each other. Let's analyze the data in detail:\n\n*   **¹H NMR:** The spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. Since they have roughly equal integrals that sum to the expected value of one proton, and spin-spin coupling is ruled out, this indicates the proton exists in two different chemical environments in a roughly 1:1 ratio. In a standard (achiral) NMR experiment, enantiomers give identical signals, so this observation makes a simple mixture of enantiomers unlikely. Diastereomers, however, have different physical properties and would be expected to give distinct signals in an NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **LC-MS:** The analysis by liquid chromatography (LC) separates two components, which then enter the mass spectrometer (MS). The fact that there are two distinct peaks demonstrates that the two components have different interactions with the chromatography column, a characteristic of diastereomers. Enantiomers would only separate on a specialized chiral column, while diastereomers can often be separated on standard, achiral columns. The MS data shows that both separated peaks have the same mass, which is consistent with the expected molecule. This rules out contamination with a precursor (which would have a different mass) and 'double coupling' (which would result in a larger mass). Molecules that are isomers of one another will have the same mass spectrum.\n\nBased on this evidence, the two species are isomers that are not mirror images of each other; by definition, they are diastereomers. There are two common ways this can occur in peptide synthesis:\n\n1.  **Cis-Trans Isomerism:** The partial double-bond character of the amide (peptide) bond restricts free rotation. This can lead to the existence of both *cis* and *trans* geometric isomers. These isomers, also known as rotamers, are a type of diastereomer. The interconversion between them can be slow on the NMR timescale, causing separate peaks to be observed for the protons near the affected amide bond, like the alpha-proton. This is a very common phenomenon in peptides, especially around proline residues, but it can occur with other amino acids as well. These rotamers can also be separated by LC.\n\n2.  **Epimerization:** During the chemical synthesis, particularly during amino acid activation or coupling steps, the acidic alpha-proton can be partially removed and then re-added, which can scramble the stereochemistry at that carbon center. This process, called epimerization, converts some of the desired stereoisomer (e.g., L-amino acid) into its opposite (D-amino acid). If this happens at one of the chiral centers in a peptide that has other chiral centers, the resulting product will be a mixture of diastereomers (e.g., an L-L-L peptide contaminated with some L-D-L peptide). These diastereomers would have distinct NMR spectra and different retention times on an LC column, but identical masses, matching all the observations.\n\nBoth *cis-trans* isomerism and epimerization result in a mixture of diastereomers. Therefore, this is the most encompassing and accurate explanation for the combined NMR and LC-MS data.\n\n*   **A) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** Incorrect. This would lead to a different, larger mass.\n*   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Incorrect. Enantiomers are not distinguishable in a standard ¹H NMR experiment.\n*   **D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** Incorrect. A precursor would have a different mass.\n\n<<<B>>>"
