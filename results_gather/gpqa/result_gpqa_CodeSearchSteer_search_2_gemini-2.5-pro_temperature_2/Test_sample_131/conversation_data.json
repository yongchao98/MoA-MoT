    "To solve this, we must analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each potential compound and then determine which 1:1 mixture matches the provided spectral data. All listed compounds share the molecular formula C10H14.\n\n**1. Analysis of Individual Compounds:**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, this molecule has only two types of protons. The two aromatic protons are equivalent and will produce one singlet. The four methyl groups (12 protons) are also equivalent, producing a second singlet.\n    *   *Spectrum:* 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 aliphatic singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has two adjacent aromatic protons. These protons are not equivalent and will split each other's signals (ortho-coupling), resulting in a pair of doublets, not singlets. Therefore, this compound cannot be in the mixture.\n    *   *Spectrum:* 2 aromatic doublets, multiple aliphatic singlets.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** The four aromatic protons are equivalent due to symmetry, creating one aromatic singlet. However, the protons of the two equivalent ethyl groups will be split by each other, producing a quartet for the -CH2- groups and a triplet for the -CH3 groups. The problem states there are only singlets in the aliphatic region, so this compound is ruled out.\n    *   *Spectrum:* 1 aromatic singlet, 1 aliphatic quartet, 1 aliphatic triplet.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has lower symmetry. It has two aromatic protons at positions C4 and C6. They are in different chemical environments and are expected to produce two separate signals. As they are meta to each other, the coupling constant is very small, and they often appear as two distinct singlets. Similarly, the four methyl groups are chemically distinct and are expected to produce four separate singlets.\n    *   *Spectrum (Predicted):* 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 4 aliphatic singlets (3H each).\n\n**2. Analysis of the Mixture Options:**\n\nThe experimental data for the 1:1 mixture shows:\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:** Incorrect. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene would show doublets in the aromatic region.\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Incorrect. 1,4-diethylbenzene would show a quartet and a triplet in the aliphatic region.\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** Incorrect. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene would show doublets in the aromatic region.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This is the only plausible option as the other options contain compounds that are definitively inconsistent with the data. Let's see how this mixture fits the observed spectrum.\n\n    *   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)** contributes one aromatic singlet (2H) and one aliphatic singlet (12H).\n    *   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)** contributes two aromatic singlets and, in principle, four aliphatic singlets.\n\n    For the mixture to match the data, we must assume a case of \"accidental equivalence\" where different protons have the same chemical shift by coincidence.\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** The mixture has two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio. This can be explained if one singlet comes from the two aromatic protons of Durene, and the second singlet comes from the two aromatic protons of Isodurene being accidentally equivalent (appearing at the same chemical shift).\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** The mixture has three aliphatic singlets with a ratio of 2:1:1. The total number of aliphatic protons is 24 (12 from Durene, 12 from Isodurene). A 2:1:1 ratio corresponds to 12H, 6H, and 6H. This fits perfectly if:\n        *   The signal with integral 12H (the \"2\" part of the ratio) is from the four equivalent methyl groups of Durene.\n        *   The two signals with integral 6H each (the \"1:1\" part of the ratio) come from the four methyl groups of Isodurene, which happen to be accidentally equivalent in two pairs.\n\nThis combination is the only one that can account for the number of signals and their integration ratios.\n\n<<<B>>>"
