    "### Analysis of Relativistic Particle Decay\n\nTo determine the necessary Lorentz factor, we can use the survival equation for relativistic particles, which accounts for time dilation. The fraction of particles, P, that survive after traveling a distance R is given by:\n\nP = e<sup>-R / (γ * c * τ)</sup>\n\nWhere:\n*   **R** is the distance traveled (the detector radius, 30 m).\n*   **γ** (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **c** is the speed of light.\n*   **τ** (tau) is the proper mean lifetime of the particle.\n\nThe term `c * τ` represents the mean distance a particle would travel at the speed of light before decaying, without considering relativistic effects.\n\n### Step-by-step Calculation\n\n1.  **Use the initial condition to find a constant.**\n    We are given that when the Lorentz factor (γ₁) is 20, one-third (1/3) of the particles reach the detector. Let's define a constant `K = R / (c * τ)` that depends on the detector size and the particle's proper lifetime.\n\n    P₁ = 1/3 = e<sup>-K / γ₁</sup>\n    1/3 = e<sup>-K / 20</sup>\n\n    By taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we can solve for K:\n    ln(1/3) = -K / 20\n    -ln(3) = -K / 20\n    K = 20 * ln(3)\n\n2.  **Use the desired condition to find the new Lorentz factor.**\n    We want to find the new Lorentz factor (γ₂) that allows two-thirds (2/3) of the particles to reach the detector.\n\n    P₂ = 2/3 = e<sup>-K / γ₂</sup>\n\n    Again, we take the natural logarithm:\n    ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂\n    -ln(1.5) = -K / γ₂\n    γ₂ = K / ln(1.5)\n\n3.  **Substitute and solve for γ₂.**\n    Now, substitute the expression for K from the first step into the equation for γ₂:\n\n    γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(1.5)\n\n    Using the approximate values for the natural logarithms (ln(3) ≈ 1.0986 and ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055):\n    γ₂ ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055\n    γ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055\n    γ₂ ≈ 54.18\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
