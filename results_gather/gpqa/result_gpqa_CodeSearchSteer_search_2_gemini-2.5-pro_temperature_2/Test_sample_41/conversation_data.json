    "The problem can be solved by combining the principles of planetary equilibrium temperature and Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand Equilibrium Temperature**\nA planet's equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is reached when the energy it absorbs from its star balances the energy it radiates back into space. The formula shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's orbital distance (d) from its star, assuming the planet's albedo and the star's luminosity are constant. This relationship can be expressed as:\n\nT_eq ∝ d^(-1/2)\n\nThis means that the orbital distance `d` is proportional to the inverse square of the equilibrium temperature:\n\nd ∝ T_eq^(-2)\n\n**2. Apply Kepler's Third Law**\nKepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (which is the orbital distance `d` for a circular orbit). This is written as:\n\nP² ∝ d³\n\nTherefore, the orbital period `P` is proportional to the orbital distance to the power of 3/2:\n\nP ∝ d^(3/2)\n\n**3. Combine the Physical Principles**\nBy substituting the relationship between distance and temperature into Kepler's law, we can find a direct relationship between the orbital period and the equilibrium temperature:\n\nP ∝ (T_eq^(-2))^(3/2)\nP ∝ T_eq^(-3)\n\nThis shows that the orbital period is inversely proportional to the cube of the equilibrium temperature.\n\n**4. Calculate the Temperature Ratio**\nThe problem provides the temperature ratios between adjacent planets:\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 1.4\n*   T_eq2 / T_eq3 ≈ 2.3\n\nTo find the temperature ratio between Planet 1 and Planet 3, we multiply these values:\nT_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3) = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22\n\n**5. Determine the Orbital Period Ratio**\nUsing the relationship P ∝ T_eq^(-3), we can set up a ratio for the orbital periods of Planet 3 and Planet 1:\n\nP3 / P1 = (T_eq3 / T_eq1)^(-3) = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)³\n\nNow, we can substitute the calculated temperature ratio:\n\nP3 / P1 = (3.22)³ ≈ 33.39\n\nThe result is approximately 33.4. The information regarding the planets' masses, the specific albedo value (as long as it is equal for all planets), and the TTV discovery method are not necessary for this calculation.\n\nBased on the calculation, the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of approximately 33.4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
