    "The problem requires calculating the equilibrium concentration of free calcium ions (Ca²⁺) from a solution initially containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\nThe key steps are:\n1.  **Write the dissociation equilibrium:** The Ca-EDTA complex ([Ca-EDTA]²⁻) dissociates into free calcium ions (Ca²⁺) and EDTA ions (Y⁴⁻).\n    [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Use the formation constant (K_f):** The problem provides the formation constant, K_f (also written as KCa-EDTA), which describes the formation of the complex.\n    K_f = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n3.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:** We start with 0.02 M of the complex and assume no initial free Ca²⁺ or EDTA. The change in concentration as the complex dissociates is represented by 'x'.\n\n    *   **Initial:**\n        *   [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = 0.02 M\n        *   [Ca²⁺] = 0 M\n        *   [Y⁴⁻] = 0 M\n    *   **Change:**\n        *   [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = -x\n        *   [Ca²⁺] = +x\n        *   [Y⁴⁻] = +x\n    *   **Equilibrium:**\n        *   [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] = 0.02 - x\n        *   [Ca²⁺] = x\n        *   [Y⁴⁻] = x\n\n4.  **Solve the equilibrium expression:** Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression.\n    5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n\n5.  **Simplify and solve for x:** Because the formation constant is very large, the dissociation will be minimal. This means 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can therefore approximate (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\n    Rearranging the equation to solve for x²:\n    x² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\n    x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻²) / (5 x 10¹⁰)\n    x² ≈ 0.4 x 10⁻¹²\n    x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n\n    Now, we take the square root to find x:\n    x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is equal to x.\n\nTherefore, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<C>>>"
