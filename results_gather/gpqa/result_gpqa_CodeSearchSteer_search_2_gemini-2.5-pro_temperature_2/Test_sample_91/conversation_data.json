    "Here is the step-by-step calculation to determine the enthalpy of formation.\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Molar Mass**\n\nThe chemical structure of the molecule (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2 needs to be analyzed to count the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms.\n\n*   Carbons (C):\n    *   (CH3)2C: 3 carbons\n    *   =CH-: 1 carbon\n    *   -CH2-: 1 carbon\n    *   -CH(CH3)-: 2 carbons\n    *   -CH2-: 1 carbon\n    *   -CH=: 1 carbon\n    *   =C(CH3)2: 3 carbons\n    *   Total Carbon atoms = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12\n\n*   Hydrogens (H):\n    *   (CH3)2: 6 hydrogens\n    *   =CH-: 1 hydrogen\n    *   -CH2-: 2 hydrogens\n    *   -CH(CH3)-: 4 hydrogens\n    *   -CH2-: 2 hydrogens\n    *   -CH=: 1 hydrogen\n    *   =C(CH3)2: 6 hydrogens\n    *   Total Hydrogen atoms = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n*   Molar Mass of C12H22 (using C=12 g/mol, H=1 g/mol for consistency with the integer energy values):\n    *   Molar Mass = (12 * 12 g/mol) + (22 * 1 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n\n**2. Count the Number of Each Type of Bond**\n\nBased on the structure, we can count the covalent bonds:\n\n*   **C-H bonds:** As counted above, there are **22** C-H bonds.\n*   **C=C bonds:** The structure contains two double bonds (`C=C`). So, there are **2** C=C bonds.\n*   **C-C bonds:**\n    *   Two C-C single bonds connecting the two methyl groups to the first carbon.\n    *   A single bond between the `CH` and `CH2` groups.\n    *   A single bond between the `CH2` and `CH(CH3)` groups.\n    *   A single bond between the `CH` on the main chain and the methyl group carbon in `CH(CH3)`.\n    *   A single bond between the `CH(CH3)` group and the next `CH2` group.\n    *   A single bond between the `CH2` group and the `CH` of the second double bond.\n    *   Two C-C single bonds connecting the two methyl groups to the last carbon.\n    *   Total C-C bonds = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = **9** C-C bonds.\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound (ΔH_atom, compound)**\n\nThis is the total energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound.\n\n*   ΔH_atom, compound = (No. of C-C bonds × BE(C-C)) + (No. of C=C bonds × BE(C=C)) + (No. of C-H bonds × BE(C-H))\n*   ΔH_atom, compound = (9 × 200 kJ/mol) + (2 × 300 kJ/mol) + (22 × 400 kJ/mol)\n*   ΔH_atom, compound = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n    *(This corresponds to option D, but it is the enthalpy of atomization, not formation).*\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Enthalpy to Form Gaseous Atoms from Elements in their Standard States (ΔH_atom, elements)**\n\nWe need to form 12 moles of gaseous carbon atoms (C(g)) and 22 moles of gaseous hydrogen atoms (H(g)) from their standard states, which are C(graphite) and H2(g).\n\n*   For Carbon: 12 C(graphite) → 12 C(g)\n    *   Energy = 12 mol × Enthalpy of atomization of C = 12 × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ.\n*   For Hydrogen: 11 H2(g) → 22 H(g)\n    *   This requires breaking 11 moles of H-H bonds.\n    *   Energy = 11 mol × Bond energy of H-H = 11 × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ.\n*   Total enthalpy for atomization of elements = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is calculated using Hess's Law:\nΔH_f = ΔH_atom, elements - ΔH_atom, compound\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n**6. Convert to Match the Options**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's examine the given options:\nA) 1900 kJ/g - The numerical value matches, but the units are kJ/g.\nB) 67.4 kJ/mol - Does not match.\nC) 11.44 kJ/g - Let's convert our result to kJ/g.\nD) 11200 kJ/mol - This is the enthalpy of atomization of the compound.\n\n*   Conversion to kJ/g:\n    *   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = ΔH_f (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\n    *   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol ≈ **11.445 kJ/g**.\n\nThis value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
