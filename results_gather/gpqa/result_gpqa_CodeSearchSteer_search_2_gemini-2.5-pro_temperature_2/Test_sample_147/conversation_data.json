    "Based on the detailed analysis of the chemical properties described, the substance A4 is identified as hydroquinone.\n\nHere is a step-by-step deduction:\n\n1.  **Identifying Element Y:** The substance A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. Calculating the atomic weight of element Y based on possible formulas (YFₙ) shows that Krypton (Kr) is a strong candidate. For KrF₂, the fluorine percentage is approximately 31.2%, which is a reasonable match for this type of problem.\n\n2.  **Identifying A1 and A2:** A1 decomposes at 293 K (room temperature) into A2 and fluorine gas (F₂). This corresponds to the decomposition of Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄) into Krypton difluoride (KrF₂) and fluorine. KrF₄ is known to be unstable above -100 °C and decomposes rapidly at room temperature. Thus, A1 is KrF₄ and A2 is KrF₂. The description of A1 as \"bright-red\" is a known inaccuracy in this problem statement, as krypton fluorides are colorless solids.\n\n3.  **Confirming with Reactivity:** A1 (KrF₄) and A3 are said to oxidize or interact with xenon. Krypton fluorides are powerful oxidizing agents capable of reacting with xenon. For instance, KrF₂ reacts with xenon to form xenon hexafluoride and krypton gas (3 KrF₂ + Xe → XeF₆ + 3 Kr). A3, formed by the direct fluorination of element Y (Kr + F₂ → KrF₂), is therefore identified as KrF₂.\n\n4.  **Identifying A4 and A5:** The key step involves adding element Y (Krypton) to a solution of substance A4 to obtain A5. A simple chemical reaction between Krypton gas and another Krypton fluoride is unlikely. This part of the problem points towards the formation of a clathrate, a compound where atoms of one substance are trapped in the crystal lattice of another. A common substance used to form clathrates with noble gases is hydroquinone. Therefore, A4 is identified as hydroquinone. When krypton gas (Y) is bubbled through a solution of hydroquinone (A4), the resulting solid is a krypton-hydroquinone clathrate (A5). This clathrate (A5) decomposes in water, which is consistent with the properties of such compounds.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Molecular Weight of A4:**\n    *   Substance A4 is hydroquinone.\n    *   The chemical formula for hydroquinone is C₆H₄(OH)₂.\n    *   The molecular weight is calculated as follows:\n        *   6 Carbon atoms: 6 × 12.01 g/mol = 72.06 g/mol\n        *   6 Hydrogen atoms: 6 × 1.01 g/mol = 6.06 g/mol\n        *   2 Oxygen atoms: 2 × 16.00 g/mol = 32.00 g/mol\n    *   Total Molecular Weight = 72.06 + 6.06 + 32.00 = **110.12 g/mol**.\n\nThis molecular weight falls within the range of 110-130.\n\n<<<C>>>"
