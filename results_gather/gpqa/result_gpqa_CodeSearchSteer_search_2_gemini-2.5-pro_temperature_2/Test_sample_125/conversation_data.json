    "An in-depth analysis of the two reactions and the subsequent chromatographic separation leads to the following conclusions:\n\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\n**Reaction I:**\nThe starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, a chiral ketone. It is reduced by lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), an achiral reagent. The reduction of the ketone at the third carbon atom creates a new stereocenter. Because the original molecule already has a stereocenter at the fifth carbon, the products will be diastereomers. The two products formed are (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated by standard chromatography techniques.\n\n**Reaction II:**\nThe starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, an achiral molecule. It is reduced by an excess of sodium borohydride (NaBH4), which will convert both ketone groups into hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol. The product, pentane-2,4-diol, has two stereocenters at carbons 2 and 4. This results in the formation of three stereoisomers: a pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) and a meso compound ((2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol), which is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\nThe final mixture contains five distinct compounds:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC:**\nThis technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It can separate diastereomers, but it cannot resolve enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I ((3S, 5S) and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) will be separated, yielding **two peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will be separated from them, yielding **one peak**.\n*   The enantiomers from Reaction II ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) will not be resolved and will elute together as a single peak. This gives a **second peak** for the products of Reaction II.\n*   The products from Reaction I (methoxy-alcohols) and Reaction II (diols) are structurally different molecules and will not elute at the same time.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram will be 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC:**\nA chiral stationary phase is designed to interact differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation. It also separates diastereomers.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I are separable: **two peaks**.\n*   The three stereoisomers from Reaction II will all be separated. The meso compound will be resolved from the enantiomers because they are diastereomers. The two enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) will also be resolved from each other by the chiral column. This gives a total of **three peaks** from Reaction II.\n\nThus, the total number of peaks observed in the chiral HPLC will be the sum of all distinct stereoisomers formed: 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\nBased on this analysis, there will be 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<B>>>"
