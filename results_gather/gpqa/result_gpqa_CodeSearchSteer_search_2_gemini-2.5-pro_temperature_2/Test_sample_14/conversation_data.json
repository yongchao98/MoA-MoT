    "To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we need to compare their geometric transit probabilities.\n\n### 1. Transit Probability Formula\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the probability of it transiting its host star is approximately the ratio of the star's radius (R_star) to the planet's semi-major axis (a).\n\n*   **Transit Probability (p) ∝ R_star / a**\n\n### 2. Relating Semi-Major Axis to Known Quantities\nWe can express the semi-major axis (a) using Kepler's Third Law, which relates the orbital period (P), the host star's mass (M_star), and the semi-major axis.\n\n*   **P² ∝ a³ / M_star**\n\nSolving for 'a', we get:\n\n*   **a ∝ (M_star * P²)^(1/3)**\n\n### 3. Combined Proportionality\nBy substituting the expression for 'a' into the transit probability formula, we can see how the probability depends on the star's mass and radius, and the planet's orbital period:\n\n*   **p ∝ R_star / [ (M_star * P²)^(1/3) ]**\n*   **p ∝ R_star * M_star^(-1/3) * P^(-2/3)**\n\n### 4. Calculating the Ratio of Probabilities\nNow, we can find the ratio of the transit probability of Planet_1 (p₁) to that of Planet_2 (p₂):\n\n*   **p₁ / p₂ = [R_s1 * M_s1^(-1/3) * P₁^(-2/3)] / [R_s2 * M_s2^(-1/3) * P₂^(-2/3)]**\n\nWe can group the terms for comparison:\n\n*   **p₁ / p₂ = (R_s1 / R_s2) * (M_s1 / M_s2)^(-1/3) * (P₁ / P₂)^(-2/3)**\n\n### 5. Plugging in the Given Values\nAccording to the problem description:\n*   The host stars have the same radii: **R_s1 = R_s2**  => (R_s1 / R_s2) = 1\n*   The star hosting Planet_1 has twice the mass of the star hosting Planet_2: **M_s1 = 2 * M_s2** => (M_s1 / M_s2) = 2\n*   The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2: **P₁ = P₂ / 3** => (P₁ / P₂) = 1/3\n\nSubstituting these ratios into our equation:\n\n*   **p₁ / p₂ = (1) * (2)^(-1/3) * (1/3)^(-2/3)**\n*   **p₁ / p₂ = 2^(-1/3) * 3^(2/3)**\n*   **p₁ / p₂ = (3²)^(1/3) / 2^(1/3)**\n*   **p₁ / p₂ = (9 / 2)^(1/3)**\n*   **p₁ / p₂ = (4.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65096**\n\n### Conclusion\nThe calculation shows that the transit probability for Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than for Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
