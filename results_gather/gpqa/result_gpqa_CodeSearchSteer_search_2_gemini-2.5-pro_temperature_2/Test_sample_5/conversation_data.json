    "To find the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical particle, we first need to express the given potential in Cartesian coordinates. The potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ) as:\n\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\n\nThe conversion from polar to Cartesian coordinates is:\nx = r cos(θ)\ny = r sin(θ)\nr^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\nSubstituting these into the potential energy equation:\n\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k(r cos(θ))^2\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 kx^2\nV(x, y) = (1/2 k + 3/2 k)x^2 + 1/2 ky^2\nV(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n\nThis potential is in the form of a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator, as it can be separated into two independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator potentials for the x and y directions.\n\nV(x,y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y), where:\nV_x(x) = 1/2 (4k)x^2\nV_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2\n\nThe time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system is separable. The total energy E is the sum of the energies for each dimension, E = E_x + E_y.\n\nFor a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with a potential of the form V(z) = 1/2 mω^2z^2, the energy eigenvalues are given by E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω.\n\nFirst, we find the angular frequency (ω) for the x-dimension:\n1/2 mω_x^2 = 1/2 (4k)\nω_x^2 = 4k/m\nω_x = 2√(k/m)\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for the x-dimension are:\nE_nx = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ(2√(k/m)) = (2n_x + 1)ħ√(k/m)\n\nNext, we find the angular frequency for the y-dimension:\n1/2 mω_y^2 = 1/2 k\nω_y^2 = k/m\nω_y = √(k/m)\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for the y-dimension are:\nE_ny = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ√(k/m)\n\nThe total energy E is the sum of E_nx and E_ny:\nE = E_nx + E_ny\nE = (2n_x + 1)ħ√(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ√(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2)ħ√(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ√(k/m)\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
