    "To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization, we must follow a series of systematic steps to determine the amount of heat released during the reaction.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n**1. Calculate the Moles of H+ Ions from the Acids:**\nFirst, we determine the number of moles of hydrogen ions (H+) contributed by each acid.\n\n*   **From Hydrochloric Acid (HCl):** HCl is a strong acid and dissociates completely into H+ and Cl-.\n    *   Moles of H+ = Molarity × Volume\n    *   Moles of H+ from HCl = 0.2 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.10 mol\n\n*   **From Sulfuric Acid (H₂SO₄):** H₂SO₄ is a strong acid that dissociates to provide two H+ ions per molecule.\n    *   Moles of H₂SO₄ = Molarity × Volume\n    *   Moles of H₂SO₄ = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.09 mol\n    *   Moles of H+ from H₂SO₄ = 2 × 0.09 mol = 0.18 mol\n\n*   **Total Moles of H+:**\n    *   Total Moles of H+ = Moles from HCl + Moles from H₂SO₄\n    *   Total Moles of H+ = 0.10 mol + 0.18 mol = 0.28 mol\n\n**2. Calculate the Moles of OH- Ions from the Base:**\nNext, we find the number of moles of hydroxide ions (OH-) from the base.\n\n*   **From Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)₂):** Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base that dissociates to yield two OH- ions per molecule.\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = Molarity × Volume\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.5 mol/L × 0.200 L = 0.10 mol\n    *   Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol\n\n**3. Identify the Limiting Reactant:**\nThe neutralization reaction is the combination of H+ and OH- ions to form water:\nH⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq) → H₂O(l)\n\nWe compare the total moles of H+ (0.28 mol) with the total moles of OH- (0.20 mol). Since there are fewer moles of OH-, it is the limiting reactant. This means that only 0.20 moles of water can be formed before the hydroxide ions are completely consumed.\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Neutralization:**\nThe standard enthalpy of neutralization for the reaction between a strong acid and a strong base is a constant value, approximately -13.7 kcal/mol (or -57.1 kJ/mol). This value represents the heat evolved when one mole of water is formed.\n\n*   **Heat Evolved (in kcal):**\n    *   ΔH = (moles of water formed) × (enthalpy of neutralization per mole)\n    *   ΔH = 0.20 mol × (-13.7 kcal/mol)\n    *   ΔH = -2.74 kcal\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n*   A) -2.72 kcal\n*   B) -16.0 kJ\n*   C) -11.42 kcal\n*   D) -3.80 kcal\n\nThe calculated value of -2.74 kcal is extremely close to option A. The minor difference can be attributed to using a slightly more precise value for the enthalpy of neutralization than -13.7 kcal/mol.\n\n***Note on Precipitation:*** It is important to recognize that a secondary reaction occurs in this mixture: the precipitation of barium sulfate (BaSO₄) from Ba²⁺ and SO₄²⁻ ions.\n*   Moles of Ba²⁺ = 0.10 mol\n*   Moles of SO₄²⁻ = 0.09 mol\nThis precipitation reaction also releases heat (exothermic). However, the term \"enthalpy of neutralization\" specifically refers to the heat change from the H⁺ and OH⁻ reaction. The question explicitly asks for the enthalpy of neutralization, not the total enthalpy change of mixing. Therefore, the heat of precipitation is not included in this calculation.\n\nFinal calculation confirms that the enthalpy of neutralization is determined by the limiting reactant (OH- ions) and the standard heat of neutralization per mole of water formed.\n\n<<<A>>>"
