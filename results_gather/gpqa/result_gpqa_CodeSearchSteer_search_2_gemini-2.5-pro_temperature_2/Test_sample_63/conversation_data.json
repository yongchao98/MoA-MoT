    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the products of the thermal decomposition.**\n\nThe mixture of gases formed upon heating is passed through three tubes. We can determine the composition of the gas mixture by analyzing the changes in each tube:\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong dehydrating agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 18.0 g/mol\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.2 mol\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is a lime water solution, used to detect acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂). Since the weight of the tube did not change, no acidic gases were produced in the reaction.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After passing through the three tubes, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol\n\n**2. Identify Gas C and verify the Law of Conservation of Mass.**\n\nThe total mass of the products should equal the initial mass of the reactants (7.20 g). Let's calculate the mass of the known gaseous products:\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n\nThe remaining mass must be that of Gas C:\n*   Mass of Gas C = Initial mass - Mass of H₂O - Mass of O₂\n*   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g\n\nNow we can determine the molar mass of Gas C:\n*   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass of Gas C / Moles of Gas C\n*   Molar Mass of Gas C = 2.80 g / 0.1 mol = 28.0 g/mol\n\nA gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol that is unreactive towards the reagents in the tubes is very likely nitrogen gas (N₂). This makes sense, as the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts often produces N₂.\n\n**3. Determine the empirical formula of the initial salt mixture.**\n\nThe initial mixture of salts A and B contained only the elements that appear in the products (N, H, and O). Let's find the total moles of each element in the products:\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** From 0.1 mol of N₂ → 0.1 mol × 2 = 0.2 mol of N atoms\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** From 0.2 mol of H₂O → 0.2 mol × 2 = 0.4 mol of H atoms\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** From 0.2 mol of H₂O and 0.025 mol of O₂ → (0.2 mol × 1) + (0.025 mol × 2) = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol of O atoms\n\nThe molar ratio of the elements in the salt mixture is N : H : O = 0.2 : 0.4 : 0.25. To get a simple integer ratio, we can multiply by 20:\n*   N: 0.2 × 20 = 4\n*   H: 0.4 × 20 = 8\n*   O: 0.25 × 20 = 5\n\nSo, the combined empirical formula for the equimolar mixture of salts A and B is N₄H₈O₅.\n\n**4. Identify Salts A and B.**\n\nWe are looking for two salts, A and B, which are in an equimolar mixture and whose formulas sum to N₄H₈O₅. The presence of nitrogen and hydrogen strongly suggests the ammonium cation (NH₄⁺). Let's consider common ammonium salts containing oxygen:\n*   Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) has the formula N₂H₄O₂.\n*   Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) has the formula N₂H₄O₃.\n\nLet's add the formulas of these two salts together:\n(N₂H₄O₂) + (N₂H₄O₃) = N₄H₈O₅\n\nThis matches the empirical formula of our mixture. Therefore, the salts A and B are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\n**5. Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nThe final step is to find the total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = 8 atoms\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = 9 atoms\n\nTotal number of atoms = (Atoms in Salt A) + (Atoms in Salt B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<D>>>"
