    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three reactions to determine the final products.\n\n**Reaction 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat) ---> A**\n\nThis reaction's identity is the most ambiguous. However, since the problem is framed in the context of sigmatropic rearrangements, we should consider variants of the Claisen rearrangement. The provided options for product A are either `6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine` or `(Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine`. Determining the exact mechanism to form either of these products from the given starting materials is complex and may depend on a specific, non-obvious named reaction variant or potential typos in the reactants. To resolve this, we will first analyze reactions B and C, which are more standard examples.\n\n**Reaction 2: (3R,4S)-3,4-dimethylhexa-1,5-diyne + Heat ---> B**\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a thermal-sigmatropic rearrangement, specifically a Cope rearrangement of a 1,5-diyne.\n*   **Reactant:** The starting material is (3R,4S)-3,4-dimethylhexa-1,5-diyne (C₈H₁₀), which is a *meso* compound.\n*   **Mechanism:** The Cope rearrangement is followed by subsequent cyclization reactions. The initial shift would produce a highly reactive bis-allene intermediate (`3,4-dimethyl-1,2,4,5-hexatetraene`). This intermediate rapidly undergoes further rearrangement and electrocyclization. The established product for the thermal rearrangement of this specific diyne is a diethylidenecyclobutene derivative.\n*   **Product Analysis:** We must choose between `(1Z,2E)-1,2-diethylidenecyclobutane` (C₈H₁₂) and `(3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene` (C₈H₁₀). Since the reaction is a rearrangement, the molecular formula of the product must be the same as the reactant (C₈H₁₀). The cyclobutane product has an incorrect formula (C₈H₁₂), as it would require the addition of hydrogen. The cyclobutene product has the correct formula. Therefore, product B must be `(3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene`. This eliminates options A and D.\n\n**Reaction 3: 2-((vinyloxy)methyl)but-1-ene + Heat ---> C**\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a classic thermal-sigmatropic rearrangement, specifically a Claisen rearrangement.\n*   **Reactant:** The substrate, `2-((vinyloxy)methyl)but-1-ene`, is an allyl vinyl ether.\n    *   **Allyl group:** `CH₂=C(Et)-CH₂–`\n    *   **Vinyl ether group:** `–O–CH=CH₂`\n*   **Mechanism:** In a Claisen rearrangement, the C-O bond of the ether cleaves as a new C-C bond forms, and the π-bonds shift. This concerted pericyclic reaction proceeds through a six-membered chair-like transition state. The rearrangement of an allyl vinyl ether yields a γ,δ-unsaturated carbonyl compound.\n*   **Product Analysis:** The rearrangement transforms the vinyl ether portion (`-O-CH=CH₂`) into an aldehyde-containing fragment (`-CH₂-CHO`). A new C-C bond forms between the terminal carbons of the original allyl and vinyl systems. The product is `4-methylenehexanal`. The alternative option is `4-methylenehexan-1-ol`, which would require a reduction step that is not indicated. Thus, product C is `4-methylenehexanal`. This result eliminates option B.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the definitive analyses of reactions 2 and 3, we can conclude:\n*   Product B is `(3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene`.\n*   Product C is `4-methylenehexanal`.\n\nThis combination of products B and C is only present in option C. Therefore, product A must be `(Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine`, even though its formation mechanism is not straightforward.\n\nThe final products are:\n*   A = (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine\n*   B = (3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene\n*   C = 4-methylenehexanal\n\n<<<C>>>"
