    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2.\n\nThe abundance of an element X relative to Y in a star, compared to the Sun, is given by the notation:\n`[X/Y] = log10(nX/nY)_star - log10(nX/nY)_sun`\n\nWe can express the abundance of an element relative to hydrogen ([X/H]) using other relative abundances. For instance:\n`[A/B] = log10(nA/nH)_star - log10(nB/nH)_star - (log10(nA/nH)_sun - log10(nB/nH)_sun)`\n`[A/B] = (log10(nA/nH)_star - log10(nA/nH)_sun) - (log10(nB/nH)_star - log10(nB/nH)_sun)`\n`[A/B] = [A/H] - [B/H]`\nTherefore, `[A/H] = [A/B] + [B/H]`.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the silicon-to-hydrogen abundance ratio for Star_1 ([Si/H]_1).**\n\nWe are given:\n*   `[Fe/H]_1 = 0` dex\n*   `[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3` dex\n\nUsing the relationship `[A/H] = [A/B] + [B/H]`, we can find `[Si/H]_1`:\n`[Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1`\n`[Si/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3` dex\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the silicon-to-hydrogen abundance ratio for Star_2 ([Si/H]_2).**\n\nWe are given:\n*   `[Mg/H]_2 = 0` dex\n*   `[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3` dex\n\nUsing the same relationship, we have:\n`[Mg/H]_2 = [Mg/Si]_2 + [Si/H]_2`\nWe can rearrange this to solve for `[Si/H]_2`:\n`[Si/H]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Mg/Si]_2`\n`[Si/H]_2 = 0 - 0.3 = -0.3` dex\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the ratio of silicon atoms in the two stars.**\n\nThe ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres is the ratio of their number densities, `nSi_1 / nSi_2`. Assuming the hydrogen density (`nH`) is the primary component and serves as a common reference in the photosphere, this ratio can be approximated by the ratio of their abundance fractions relative to hydrogen: `(nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2`.\n\nLet's work with the logarithms:\n`log10( (nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2 ) = log10(nSi/nH)_1 - log10(nSi/nH)_2`\n\nWe know that `[Si/H] = log10(nSi/nH)_star - log10(nSi/nH)_sun`.\nSo, `log10(nSi/nH)_star = [Si/H] + log10(nSi/nH)_sun`.\n\nSubstituting this into the ratio equation:\n`log10(Ratio) = ([Si/H]_1 + log10(nSi/nH)_sun) - ([Si/H]_2 + log10(nSi/nH)_sun)`\n\nThe solar silicon abundance term, `log10(nSi/nH)_sun`, cancels out:\n`log10(Ratio) = [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2`\n`log10(Ratio) = 0.3 - (-0.3) = 0.6`\n\nTo find the actual ratio, we take the antilogarithm:\n`Ratio = 10^0.6`\n`Ratio â‰ˆ 3.981`\n\nThis value is approximately 3.9. The masses of the stars, the LTE assumption, and the EW method are contextual details about how the abundances were derived and are not needed for the calculation itself. The provided solar abundances for iron and magnesium are also not required if the properties of the abundance notation are used directly.\n\nThe calculated ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately 3.9.\n\n<<<D>>>"
