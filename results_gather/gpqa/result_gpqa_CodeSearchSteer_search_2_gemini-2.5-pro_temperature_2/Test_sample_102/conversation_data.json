    "To determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful analysis of the directing effects of each substituent is necessary.\n\nThe target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring: an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2) at positions 1, 3, and 5, respectively. This substitution pattern places all groups meta to one another.\n\nA breakdown of the directing effects of the functional groups involved is as follows:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Amino group (-NH2):** Strongly activating and an *ortho, para*-director.\n\nLet's evaluate the proposed reaction sequences:\n\n*   **Option B and C:** These sequences can be ruled out due to chemically unfeasible steps. Option C proposes a Friedel-Crafts acylation on 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. This reaction fails because the benzene ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group. Option B proposes a Friedel-Crafts acylation on 3-bromoaniline. This reaction also fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing the reaction.\n*   **Option D:** This sequence is illogical as it begins by forming aniline from benzene via nitration and reduction, only to convert it back to benzene through diazotization and deamination in the subsequent steps. This renders the initial steps useless.\n\n*   **Option A:** Let's analyze this sequence step-by-step:\n    1.  **i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n    2.  **ii) Br2/FeBr3 (Bromination):** The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position, yielding 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **iii) HNO3/H2SO4 (Nitration):** This is the key step. On 3-bromoacetophenone, we have two directing groups: the acetyl group at position 1 (a *meta*-director) and the bromo group at position 3 (an *ortho, para*-director). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. The bromo group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. In such cases of competing directors, the *meta*-directing effect of the deactivating acetyl group typically dictates the position of the incoming electrophile, directing it to position 5, which is meta to both existing substituents. Thus, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one is successfully synthesized.\n\nThe subsequent steps (iv through vii) in option A would modify the already-formed product and are therefore unnecessary for its synthesis. However, the initial three steps constitute a valid and logical synthetic pathway to the desired compound. Among the given choices, this is the only option that contains a chemically sound route to the target molecule.\n\n<<<A>>>"
