    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the starspots and then determine the size of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same signal.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Light Curve Amplitude from Starspots\n\nThe brightness of a star, or its flux (F), is related to its effective temperature (Teff) by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, F ∝ T⁴. When the spotted hemisphere faces the observer, a fraction of the stellar disk is cooler, leading to a decrease in the total observed flux.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n*   Star's effective temperature, Teff\\_star = 6000 K\n*   Spot temperature, Teff\\_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n*   Spot filling factor on the visible hemisphere at minimum brightness, f\\_spot = 20% = 0.20\n\nThe maximum flux (F\\_max) is observed when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us. We can normalize this to 1. The minimum flux (F\\_min) occurs when the spotted hemisphere is visible. The flux in this case is a combination of the flux from the normal stellar surface and the cooler spotted area.\n\nThe relative flux drop, which is the amplitude of the signal (A\\_spot), is calculated as follows:\n\nA\\_spot = (F\\_max - F\\_min) / F\\_max\n\nThis can be expressed in terms of the temperatures and the spot filling factor:\n\nA\\_spot = f\\_spot \\* (1 - (Teff\\_spot / Teff\\_star)⁴)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nA\\_spot = 0.20 \\* (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)\nA\\_spot = 0.20 \\* (1 - (5/6)⁴)\nA\\_spot = 0.20 \\* (1 - 625 / 1296)\nA\\_spot = 0.20 \\* ( (1296 - 625) / 1296 )\nA\\_spot = 0.20 \\* (671 / 1296)\nA\\_spot ≈ 0.20 \\* 0.51775\nA\\_spot ≈ 0.10355\n\nSo, the star's brightness varies by about 10.36% due to the spots.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Equivalent Exoplanet Radius\n\nThe dimming caused by an exoplanet transit is known as the transit depth. This depth is the ratio of the planet's projected area (π \\* Rpl²) to the star's projected area (π \\* Rstar²). This provides a direct relationship between the transit depth and the relative radii of the planet and star.\n\nThe amplitude of the exoplanet signal (A\\_planet) is:\n\nA\\_planet = (π \\* Rpl²) / (π \\* Rstar²) = (Rpl / Rstar)²\n\nTo produce the same amplitude as the starspots, we set A\\_planet equal to A\\_spot:\n\n(Rpl / Rstar)² = 0.10355\n\nNow, we solve for the relative radius (Rpl/Rstar) by taking the square root:\n\nRpl / Rstar = √0.10355\nRpl / Rstar ≈ 0.3218\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.39\nB) ~0.11\nC) ~0.07\nD) ~0.32\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
