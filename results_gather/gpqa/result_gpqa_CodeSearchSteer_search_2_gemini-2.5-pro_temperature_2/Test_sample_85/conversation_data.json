    "This problem requires understanding the selective reactivity of two different reducing agents and tracing the stereochemistry of the reactions.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Starting Materials and Products**\n\n*   **Starting Materials:** The options are enantiomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule contains two functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-C(=O)O-isobutyl`). It has a single chiral center at the C3 position.\n*   **Products:** The products are `(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one` and its `(S)`-enantiomer. These are six-membered ring esters, known as delta-lactones. They are formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`. The chiral center in the product is at the C4 position.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reagents:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺\n*   **Reactant A → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ reduces the isobutoxy ester group of the starting material to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    2.  This forms the intermediate `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n    3.  The acid workup (H⁺) catalyzes the cyclization (lactonization) of this intermediate to form the final product, `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and lactonization reactions do not affect the chiral center at C3 (which becomes C4 in the lactone). Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product. To produce the `(R)`-lactone, the starting material A must have the `(R)` configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reagents:** B + BH₃ + H⁺\n*   **Reactant B → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group of the starting material to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n    2.  This forms `isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`.\n    3.  The subsequent acid workup (H⁺) first hydrolyzes the isobutyl ester to a carboxylic acid, yielding `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n    4.  This intermediate then undergoes acid-catalyzed lactonization to form the final product, `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in Reaction A, none of the steps in this pathway affect the chiral center. The stereochemistry is retained from the starting material to the final product. To produce the `(S)`-lactone, the starting material B must have the `(S)` configuration.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### **Step 4: Final Answer**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
