    "To determine the speed of light in the glass as measured by an observer in the laboratory, we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. This is necessary because the speeds involved are comparable to the speed of light. The problem is a classic example related to the Fizeau experiment, which was crucial in the development of special relativity.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Speed of light in the glass's rest frame:** The speed of light within the glass, from the perspective of an observer moving with the glass, is given by `u' = c/n`. The problem states that the speed of light in a vacuum, `c`, should be taken as 1. Therefore, the speed of light in the glass's rest frame is `u' = 1/n`.\n\n2.  **Velocity of the medium:** The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity `v` in the same direction as the light beam, as measured by the observer in the laboratory.\n\n3.  **Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:** When two velocities are in the same direction, the formula for their addition in special relativity is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n    Where:\n    *   `u` is the resultant velocity as seen by the stationary observer (in the laboratory).\n    *   `u'` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) in the moving frame (the glass).\n    *   `v` is the velocity of the moving frame (the glass) relative to the stationary observer.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\n4.  **Substituting the given values:** We substitute `u' = 1/n` and `c = 1` into the formula:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + ((1/n) * v) / 1^2)`\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n5.  **Simplifying the expression:** To clear the fractions within the main fraction, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis final expression represents the speed of light in the moving glass as measured by the observer in the laboratory.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\nB) 1\nC) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\nD) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n\nThe calculated speed matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
