    "### Analysis of the Reaction\n\n1.  **Reactant:** The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n    *   The structure contains a six-membered ring (cyclohexene).\n    *   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   A formyl group (aldehyde, -CHO).\n    *   A vinyl group (-CH=CH2).\n    *   A carbon-carbon double bond within the cyclohexene ring.\n\n2.  **Reagents:** The reaction is carried out with red phosphorus (Red P) and an excess of hydriodic acid (HI).\n\n3.  **Type of Reaction:** The combination of red phosphorus and HI is a powerful reducing agent. It is known for the complete reduction of oxygen-containing functional groups, as well as unsaturations like double and triple bonds, to the corresponding alkane.\n    *   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH3).\n    *   Aldehydes (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH3).\n    *   Alkenes (C=C) are reduced to alkanes (C-C).\n    *   This reduction cleaves the C-O bonds and saturates C=C bonds, but it does not break the carbon-carbon bonds of the ring structure.\n\n### Determining the Product and Its Formula\n\nLet's determine the molecular formula of the starting material and the product.\n\n*   **Reactant: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**\n    *   Carbons: 6 in the ring, 1 in COOH, 1 in CHO, 2 in vinyl = **C10**\n    *   The structure has:\n        *   One ring\n        *   One C=C bond in the ring\n        *   One C=C bond in the vinyl group\n        *   One C=O bond in the carboxylic acid\n        *   One C=O bond in the formyl group\n    *   The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the reactant is the sum of rings and π-bonds: 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C) + 1 (C=C) + 1 (C=O) + 1 (C=O) = 5.\n\n*   **Product:** The reduction with Red P / HI will perform the following transformations:\n    *   The cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a **cyclohexane ring**.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 1 will become a **methyl group** (-CH3).\n    *   The formyl group (-CHO) at position 2 will become a **methyl group** (-CH3).\n    *   The vinyl group (-CH=CH2) at position 5 will become an **ethyl group** (-CH2CH3).\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane ring. Its molecular formula will have the same number of carbon atoms as the reactant.\n*   **Product Carbons:** C10\n*   Since all double bonds (both C=C and C=O) are removed and the structure becomes a single, saturated ring, it is a derivative of a cycloalkane. A cycloalkane with 10 carbon atoms would be C10H20. The product is a substituted cyclohexane which is a mono-cyclic alkane.\n*   The general formula for a mono-cyclic saturated hydrocarbon is CnH2n.\n*   For our product with C10, the formula is **C10H20**.\n\n### Calculating the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (also known as the degree of unsaturation) can be calculated from the molecular formula or by inspecting the structure.\n\n**Method 1: Using the product's structure**\nThe IHD is the number of rings plus the number of π (pi) bonds in the molecule.\n*   The product, a substituted cyclohexane, has **one ring**.\n*   It is fully saturated, meaning it has **zero π bonds**.\n*   Therefore, IHD = 1 (for the ring) + 0 (for pi bonds) = 1.\n\n**Method 2: Using the molecular formula**\nThe formula for IHD for a hydrocarbon CxHy is: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2).\n*   The product's formula is C10H20.\n*   IHD = 10 + 1 - (20 / 2)\n*   IHD = 11 - 10\n*   IHD = 1\n\nBoth methods confirm that the index of hydrogen deficiency for the final product is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>"
