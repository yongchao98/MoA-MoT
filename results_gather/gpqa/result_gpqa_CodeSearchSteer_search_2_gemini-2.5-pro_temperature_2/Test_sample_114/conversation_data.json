    "Here's a step-by-step solution to the problem based on the principles of special relativity.\n\n### 1. Understand the Physical Principles\nThis problem involves an inelastic collision where an electron and a positron annihilate, creating two photons. To solve this, we must use the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. Since the particles are moving at relativistic speeds (indicated by Lorentz factors greater than 1), we must use the relativistic formulas for energy and momentum.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Initial Total Energy\nThe total energy of a relativistic particle is given by the formula E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light. Let m_e be the rest mass of an electron (the positron has the same mass).\n\n*   **Energy of the electron (E_e):**\n    With a Lorentz factor (γ_e) of 4, the electron's energy is:\n    E_e = 4 * m_e * c²\n\n*   **Energy of the positron (E_p):**\n    With a Lorentz factor (γ_p) of 2, the positron's energy is:\n    E_p = 2 * m_e * c²\n\n*   **Total initial energy (E_initial):**\n    The total energy before the collision is the sum of their individual energies:\n    E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4 m_e c² + 2 m_e c² = 6 m_e c²\n\n### 3. Apply Conservation of Energy\nAfter the collision, two photons are produced, and the problem states they have the same energy (let's call it E_γ). The total final energy (E_final) is the sum of the energies of these two photons.\n\n*   E_final = E_γ + E_γ = 2 * E_γ\n\nAccording to the law of conservation of energy, E_initial = E_final.\n6 m_e c² = 2 * E_γ\nE_γ = 3 m_e c²\n\nSo, each photon has an energy of 3 m_e c².\n\n### 4. Calculate the Initial Total Momentum\nThe momentum of a relativistic particle can be calculated using the formula p = √(γ² - 1) * mc. The direction of motion is crucial. Let's assume the electron moves along the positive x-axis.\n\n*   **Momentum of the electron (p_e):**\n    p_e = √(4² - 1) * m_e * c = √(15) * m_e * c (in the +x direction)\n\n*   **Momentum of the positron (p_p):**\n    The positron moves from the right, so its momentum is in the negative x-axis direction.\n    p_p = √(2² - 1) * m_e * c = √(3) * m_e * c (in the -x direction)\n\n*   **Total initial momentum (P_initial):**\n    Momentum is a vector, so we sum the components. The initial motion is entirely along the horizontal axis.\n    P_initial_x = p_e - p_p = (√15 - √3) * m_e * c\n    P_initial_y = 0\n\n### 5. Apply Conservation of Momentum\nThe total momentum of the system must be conserved. Let's analyze the momentum of the two photons after the collision.\n\n*   **Momentum of a photon (p_γ):**\n    The momentum of a photon is related to its energy by p_γ = E_γ / c.\n    p_γ = (3 m_e c²) / c = 3 m_e c\n\nThe problem states one photon moves \"upper-right\" and the other \"lower-right\". Since the initial momentum had no vertical (y-axis) component, the vertical components of the photons' momenta must cancel each other out. This means they are emitted at symmetric angles, θ and -θ, with respect to the horizontal axis.\n\n*   **Total final momentum (P_final):**\n    The horizontal (x-component) of the final momentum is the sum of the horizontal components of each photon's momentum:\n    P_final_x = p_γ * cos(θ) + p_γ * cos(-θ) = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ)\n    Substituting the value of p_γ:\n    P_final_x = 2 * (3 m_e c) * cos(θ) = 6 m_e c * cos(θ)\n\n    The vertical (y-component) of the final momentum is:\n    P_final_y = p_γ * sin(θ) + p_γ * sin(-θ) = p_γ * sin(θ) - p_γ * sin(θ) = 0. This is consistent with the initial conditions.\n\nNow, we equate the initial and final horizontal momentum:\nP_initial_x = P_final_x\n(√15 - √3) * m_e * c = 6 m_e c * cos(θ)\n\n### 6. Calculate the Angle\nWe can now solve for the angle θ. The terms m_e and c cancel out.\n\ncos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6\n\nLet's use the approximate values:\n*   √15 ≈ 3.873\n*   √3 ≈ 1.732\n\ncos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 = 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568\n\nNow we find the angle θ:\nθ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°\n\nThe question asks for the angle **between** the directions of the photons, which is the sum of the two angles: θ + |-θ| = 2θ.\n\nTotal Angle = 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°\n\nThis value is very close to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
