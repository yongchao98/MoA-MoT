    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the chemical reactions to determine the number of carbon atoms in product 3.\n\n**Step 1: trans-cinnamaldehyde + methylmagnesium bromide → product 1**\n\n*   *trans*-cinnamaldehyde (C9H8O) has a backbone of 9 carbon atoms.\n*   The reaction with methylmagnesium bromide, a Grignard reagent, involves the methyl group (containing one carbon atom) attacking the aldehyde's carbonyl carbon. This forms a secondary alcohol.\n*   The resulting product, 4-phenyl-3-buten-2-ol (product 1), now has 10 carbon atoms (9 from the cinnamaldehyde + 1 from the methylmagnesium bromide).\n\n**Step 2: product 1 + pyridinium chlorochromate → product 2**\n\n*   Product 1 (4-phenyl-3-buten-2-ol) is a secondary alcohol.\n*   Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) is an oxidizing agent that converts secondary alcohols into ketones.\n*   This oxidation reaction does not change the number of carbon atoms.\n*   Therefore, product 2, which is 4-phenyl-3-buten-2-one, also contains 10 carbon atoms.\n\n**Step 3: product 2 + (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane → product 3**\n\n*   There appears to be a typo in the question, which should state that *product 2* is treated to form product 3.\n*   Product 2 is an α,β-unsaturated ketone. The reagent, (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane (also known as dimethyloxosulfonium methylide or the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent), is a sulfur ylide.\n*   In reactions with α,β-unsaturated ketones, this specific ylide adds a methylene group (-CH2-) across the carbon-carbon double bond to form a cyclopropane ring. This is known as a Michael addition followed by intramolecular substitution.\n*   This reaction adds one more carbon atom to the molecule.\n*   Thus, product 3 is formed by adding one carbon atom (from the methylene group) to the 10 carbon atoms of product 2.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe final carbon count is 10 + 1 = 11.\n\n<<<C>>>"
