    "To identify the unknown compound, we must analyze the provided spectroscopic data and match it to one of the four possible structures.\n\n### Spectroscopic Analysis:\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectroscopy**:\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this data confirms the functional group but does not differentiate between the isomers.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectroscopy**:\n    *   **No vinyl hydrogens**: This indicates the compound is saturated, lacking carbon-carbon double bonds. All four options are saturated molecules.\n    *   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**: This complex splitting pattern indicates a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: a single proton (giving a doublet, d), a set of two equivalent protons (giving a triplet, t), and a set of three equivalent protons (giving a quartet, q).\n    *   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**: This pattern indicates a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: a single proton (d), a set of two protons (t), and a second, different set of two protons (t).\n\n### Structural Evaluation for NMR Signals:\n\nWe must now examine the structure of each option to see which one would produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**:\n    *   This structure has a proton at the C3 position that is adjacent to the C2-methine (1H), the C4-methylene (2H), and the methylene of the C3-ethyl group (2H). This proton's signal would be a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *   However, this molecule contains no methyl groups directly attached to a methine, which is required to produce the \"quartet\" portion of a dtq signal. Therefore, it cannot be compound A.\n\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**:\n    *   The proton at the C3 position is adjacent to the C2-methylene (2H), the C4-methine (1H), and the C3-methyl (3H). This would give a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   However, the structure lacks a proton that is adjacent to a methine and two different methylene groups, which is required for a dtt signal. Therefore, it cannot be compound B.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**:\n    *   The proton at the C3 position is adjacent to the C2-methine (1H), the C4-methylene (2H), and the C3-methyl (3H). This signal would be a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   Similar to compound B, this structure lacks a proton that could produce a dtt signal. Therefore, it cannot be compound D.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid)**:\n    Let's analyze the most likely structure derived from this formula, which is 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid:\n    `CH₃-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH₂-COOH`\n    *   The proton at the **C3 position** (`-CH(CH₂CH₃)-`) is coupled to the C2-methylene (2H), the C4-methine (1H), and the methylene of its own ethyl group (2H). This gives a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *   The proton at the **C4 position** (`-CH(CH₃)-`) is coupled to the C5-methylene (2H), the C3-methine (1H), and the methyl group at C4 (3H). This gives a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This structure is the only one that has protons which would give rise to both of the complex splitting patterns observed in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the spectroscopic data, the unknown compound is identified as the structure corresponding to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
