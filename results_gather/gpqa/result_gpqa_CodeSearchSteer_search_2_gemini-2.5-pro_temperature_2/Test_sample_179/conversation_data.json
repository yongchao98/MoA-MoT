    "### Calculation of the Minimum Energy of the System\n\nThe minimum energy of the described system of 13 charged particles can be calculated by summing the electrostatic potential energies between all unique pairs of particles. The total energy `U_total` can be split into two components:\n1.  **`U_p`**: The potential energy from the interaction between the central charge and the 12 charges on the sphere.\n2.  **`U_s`**: The potential energy from the interactions among the 12 charges on the sphere.\n\n#### Physical Constants\nThe calculation requires the following physical constants:\n*   **Coulomb's constant (k):** `k ≈ 8.98755 × 10^9 N·m²/C²`\n*   **Elementary charge (e):** `e = 1.602176634 × 10^-19 C`\n\nEach particle has a charge `q = 2e`.\n\n#### 1. Potential Energy `U_p` (Center-Sphere Interaction)\n\nThe 12 particles on the sphere are at a fixed distance `r = 2 m` from the central particle. The potential energy between the central charge and one of the charges on the sphere is given by Coulomb's law. The total energy for all 12 charges interacting with the central one is:\n\n*   `U_p = 12 * (k * q_center * q_sphere) / r`\n*   `U_p = 12 * (k * (2e) * (2e)) / r = 48 * k * e² / r`\n*   `U_p = 48 * (8.98755 × 10^9 N·m²/C²) * (1.602176634 × 10^-19 C)² / 2 m`\n*   `U_p ≈ 5.537 × 10^-27 J`\n\n#### 2. Potential Energy `U_s` (Sphere-Sphere Interaction)\n\nTo achieve the minimum energy state, the 12 charges on the surface of the sphere will arrange themselves to be as far apart as possible. This is a classic physics problem known as the Thomson problem. For N=12 particles, the minimum energy configuration is achieved when the particles are at the vertices of a regular icosahedron.\n\nThe potential energy `U_s` is the sum of the potential energies for all `C(12, 2) = 66` pairs of charges on the sphere.\n*   `U_s = Σ (k * q_i * q_j) / r_ij = k * (2e)² * Σ (1 / r_ij)`\n\nThe sum `Σ (1 / r_ij)` depends on the distances between the vertices of the icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius `r = 2 m`. This sum can be expressed using a dimensionless constant `E_N` derived from the solution to the Thomson problem for `N=12` on a unit sphere. The value for `N=12` is well-established as `E_12 ≈ 49.165333`.\n\nThe sum of inverse distances for a sphere of radius `r` is `(E_12 / r)`.\n*   `U_s = k * (4e²) * (E_12 / r)`\n*   `U_s = (8.98755 × 10^9) * 4 * (1.602176634 × 10^-19)² * (49.165333 / 2)`\n*   `U_s ≈ 2.269 × 10^-26 J`\n\n#### 3. Total Minimum Energy\n\nThe total minimum energy of the system is the sum of `U_p` and `U_s`.\n*   `U_total = U_p + U_s`\n*   `U_total ≈ (5.537 × 10^-27 J) + (2.269 × 10^-26 J)`\n*   `U_total ≈ (0.5537 × 10^-26 J) + (2.269 × 10^-26 J)`\n*   `U_total ≈ 2.8227 × 10^-26 J`\n\nCorrect to three decimal places, the minimum energy of the system is `2.822 × 10^-26 J`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
