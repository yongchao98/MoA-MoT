    "The solution is determined by elucidating the structure of the final product through a four-step chemical synthesis and then analyzing its symmetry to determine the number of chemically distinct protons for ¹H NMR spectroscopy.\n\n### **Reaction Sequence Analysis**\n\n1.  **Product 1:** Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride. This corresponds to a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction for the alpha-bromination of a carboxylic acid. The reagents convert acetic acid (CH₃COOH) into bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH). The use of acetic anhydride and pyridine is a known procedure for this transformation.\n\n2.  **Product 2:** Product 1 (bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid. This is a standard Fischer esterification reaction, where the carboxylic acid is converted into an ester. The product is ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Product 3:** Product 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile, displacing the bromide in an Sɴ2 reaction. This yields ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Product 4:** Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane.\n    *   First, the strong base NaH deprotonates the acidic α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, which is positioned between the electron-withdrawing cyano and ester groups.\n    *   The resulting carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing one bromine atom.\n    *   With excess NaH, the second acidic proton on the α-carbon (if available, which in this case is not quite right—it's the remaining proton on the now-substituted α-carbon) is removed, creating another carbanion.\n    *   This new nucleophilic center then undergoes an intramolecular Sɴ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentyl chain and displacing the second bromine atom to form a six-membered ring. This type of reaction, a double alkylation leading to cyclization, is a standard method in organic synthesis.\n    The final product, 4, is **1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane**.\n\n### **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 4**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the chemical equivalence of the protons in 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane. Protons are chemically equivalent if they can be interchanged by a symmetry operation (like a plane of symmetry or an axis of rotation) or by a rapid conformational change.\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is:\n```\n        CN\n        |\n      (C1) -- C(=O)OCH₂CH₃\n      /  \\\n  (C2)H₂--(C6)H₂\n    |       |\n  (C3)H₂--(C5)H₂\n      \\  /\n      (C4)H₂\n```\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent due to free rotation. They will produce **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are equivalent to each other. They will produce a second, distinct signal. That is **1 signal**.\n    *   Total from the ethyl group: **2 signals**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The key feature of the ring is the C1 carbon, which is attached to four different groups: a cyano group (-CN), an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃), C2 of the ring, and C6 of the ring. This makes C1 a chiral center.\n    *   The presence of a chiral center removes all planes of symmetry from the molecule.\n    *   Because there is no plane of symmetry bisecting the molecule, the left and right sides of the ring are not equivalent. This means that C2 is not equivalent to C6, and C3 is not equivalent to C5.\n    *   Furthermore, for any given methylene group (CH₂) in a chiral molecule, the two geminal protons (e.g., the axial and equatorial protons on C2) are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent.\n    *   Applying this analysis to the entire ring:\n        *   Protons on C2 are distinct from each other -> **2 signals**.\n        *   Protons on C6 are distinct from each other and from C2 protons -> **2 signals**.\n        *   Protons on C3 are distinct from each other -> **2 signals**.\n        *   Protons on C5 are distinct from each other and from C3 protons -> **2 signals**.\n        *   Protons on C4 are distinct from each other -> **2 signals**.\n    *   Total from the cyclohexane ring: 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = **10 signals**.\n\nCombining the signals from the ethyl group and the cyclohexane ring, the total number of distinct hydrogen signals is 10 (from the ring) + 2 (from the ethyl group) = 12.\n\nTherefore, 12 distinct hydrogen signals will be observable in the ¹H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n<<<A>>>"
