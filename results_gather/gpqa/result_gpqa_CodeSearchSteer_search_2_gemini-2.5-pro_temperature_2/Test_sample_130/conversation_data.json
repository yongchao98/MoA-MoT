    "This problem describes a multi-step organic synthesis and requires the interpretation of NMR data to determine the structure of the major product. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Identifying the Anhydride:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to an anhydride.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum shows a single peak at 7 ppm, indicating that all protons are chemically equivalent and are in the vinylic (alkene) region.\n    *   The ¹³C NMR spectrum shows two peaks: one at ~165 ppm, characteristic of a carbonyl carbon in an anhydride, and one at ~137 ppm, characteristic of a vinylic carbon.\n    *   This data is perfectly consistent with **maleic anhydride**. It has two equivalent vinylic protons and two sets of equivalent carbons (two carbonyl carbons and two vinylic carbons), matching the spectral data provided.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Reaction:** The anhydride (maleic anhydride) reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. This is a classic **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a bicyclic product. The diene is the tetramethylcyclopentadiene, and the dienophile is maleic anhydride.\n\n3.  **Determining the Products:** The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   According to the \"endo rule,\" the *endo* product is formed faster and is typically the major product under kinetic control (lower temperatures).\n    *   The *exo* product is sterically less hindered and therefore more stable, making it the thermodynamic product, which would be favored at higher temperatures.\n    *   Given that a major and minor product were formed, it is safe to assume the reaction followed the typical kinetic pathway, making the **endo product the major isomer** and the **exo product the minor isomer**.\n\n4.  **Analyzing the Product Structures and NOESY Data:**\n    *   A 2D NOESY NMR spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (through-space interaction), typically within 5 Å. The key information is a cross-peak present in the major product but absent in the minor one. This indicates a specific spatial proximity that exists only in the *endo* isomer.\n    *   **Structure of the *Endo* Product (Major):** In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the one-carbon bridge (the CH₂ group from the original cyclopentadiene).\n    *   **Structure of the *Exo* Product (Minor):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the CH₂ bridge.\n    *   **Spatial Proximity:** The crucial difference lies in the position of the two protons on the anhydride part of the molecule (let's call them H_anhydride) relative to the protons on the CH₂ bridge (H_bridge).\n        *   In the **endo (major) product**, the H_anhydride protons are tucked under the main ring system and are very close to the H_bridge protons.\n        *   In the **exo (minor) product**, the H_anhydride protons are pointed away from the CH₂ bridge, resulting in a much greater distance between them.\n    *   Therefore, a strong NOESY cross-peak between the H_anhydride protons and the H_bridge protons is expected for the major *endo* isomer but would be absent or very weak for the minor *exo* isomer.\n\n5.  **Assigning the NMR Signals:** Now we match the resonances given in the options to the protons in the product.\n    *   The two H_anhydride protons are adjacent to carbonyl groups and part of a strained bicyclic system. A chemical shift of **~3.5 ppm for a 2H singlet** is a reasonable assignment for these protons.\n    *   The CH₂ bridge protons are part of a saturated, strained ring system. A chemical shift of **~1.5 ppm for a 1H doublet** is a reasonable assignment for one of these protons (it would be coupled to the other proton on the same carbon).\n    *   The two singlets integrating to 6H each (~1.0 ppm and ~1.7 ppm) correspond to the two different pairs of methyl groups.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The unique cross-peak observed only in the major product must connect the H_anhydride protons with one of the H_bridge protons. This corresponds to the interaction between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
