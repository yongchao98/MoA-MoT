    "To find the probability that the measurement of the observable `P` will yield the value 0, we must follow the principles of quantum mechanics. This involves finding the eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue 0 and then projecting the system's state vector onto this eigenvector.\n\nHere is a step-by-step calculation:\n\n**1. Define the State and Operator**\n\n*   The state of the system at time *t* is given by the column matrix `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]ᵀ`.\n*   The observable is represented by the matrix `P`:\n    ```\n    | 0        1/√2    0    |\n    | 1/√2     0       1/√2 |\n    | 0        1/√2    0    |\n    ```\n\n**2. Find the Eigenvalues of the Operator P**\n\nThe possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator. To find them, we solve the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`, where `λ` is an eigenvalue and `I` is the identity matrix.\n\n`det(P - λI) = det( [-λ, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, -λ, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, -λ] )`\n`= -λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2`\n`= -λ³ + λ = λ(1 - λ²) = 0`\n\nThe solutions to this equation give the eigenvalues: `λ = 0`, `λ = 1`, and `λ = -1`.\n\n**3. Find the Eigenvector for the Eigenvalue 0**\n\nWe are interested in the probability of measuring 0, so we need to find the eigenvector `|v₀⟩` corresponding to this eigenvalue by solving `P|v₀⟩ = 0|v₀⟩`.\n\nLet `|v₀⟩ = [x, y, z]ᵀ`. The equation becomes:\n*   `(1/√2)y = 0`, which implies `y = 0`.\n*   `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0`, which implies `x + z = 0`, or `x = -z`.\n\nThe eigenvector is of the form `[x, 0, -x]`. To make this a unit vector (normalize it), we choose `x = 1/√2`.\n`|v₀⟩ = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]ᵀ`.\n\n**4. Normalize the State Vector `|ψ⟩`**\n\nThe probability must be calculated using a normalized state vector. The squared norm of `|ψ⟩` is:\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\nThe normalized state vector, `|ψ_norm⟩`, is:\n`|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]ᵀ`.\n\n**5. Calculate the Probability**\n\nThe probability of measuring an eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the inner product (or projection) of the normalized state vector and the corresponding eigenvector.\n`Prob(λ=0) = |⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩|²`\n\nFirst, calculate the inner product `⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩`:\n`⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩ = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2] * (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]ᵀ`\n`= (1/√12) * ((1)*(-1) + (0)*(2) + (-1)*(1))`\n`= (1/√12) * (-1 - 1)`\n`= -2/√12 = -2/(2√3) = -1/√3`\n\nNow, square the magnitude of this result to find the probability:\n`Prob(λ=0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3`.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 is 1/3.\n\n<<<D>>>"
