    "Based on a thorough analysis of the provided spectral data, the unidentified compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n### **Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry:** The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 and the M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of about 32% (a 3:1 ratio) strongly indicate the presence of one chlorine atom. The molecular formula for 4-chlorobenzoic acid is C₇H₅ClO₂, which has a molecular weight of approximately 156.57 g/mol, consistent with the mass spectrum.\n\n2.  **IR Spectroscopy:** A very broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is a classic characteristic of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid, broadened by hydrogen bonding. The strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of an aromatic carboxylic acid. Both of these key peaks are present in the provided data.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The singlet at a highly deshielded chemical shift of 11.0 ppm corresponds to the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   The two doublets in the aromatic region, one at 8.02 ppm (2H) and another at 7.72 ppm (2H), are characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxyl group are shifted further downfield (8.02 ppm) than the two protons adjacent to the chlorine atom (7.72 ppm). This matches the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid precisely.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nEach piece of spectral data—the molecular weight and isotope pattern from the mass spectrum, the characteristic carboxylic acid stretches in the IR spectrum, and the specific chemical shifts and splitting patterns of the aromatic and carboxylic acid protons in the ¹H NMR spectrum—is fully consistent with the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid and rules out the other possibilities.\n\n<<<D>>>"
