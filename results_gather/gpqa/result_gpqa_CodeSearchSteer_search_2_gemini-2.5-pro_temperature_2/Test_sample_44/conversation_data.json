    "To determine the energies of the system, we must first understand how four identical spin-1/2 particles (which are fermions) occupy the available energy levels in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n### Key Principles\n\n*   **Energy Levels of an Infinite Well:** The energy for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L is given by `En = n^2 * (π^2 * ħ^2 / 2mL^2)`. The problem defines this base energy unit as `E`, so the energy levels are `En = n^2 * E`, where `n = 1, 2, 3, ...` are the principal quantum numbers.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Since the particles are identical spin-1/2 fermions, no two particles can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state is defined by the quantum number `n` and the spin `m_s` (spin up or spin down). This means each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n### Calculation of Energy States\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the individual particles.\n\n#### Ground State Energy\nFor the ground state, the particles must fill the lowest available energy levels.\n*   Two particles fill the `n=1` level. Their combined energy is `2 * E₁ = 2 * (1² * E) = 2E`.\n*   The remaining two particles fill the `n=2` level. Their combined energy is `2 * E₂ = 2 * (2² * E) = 8E`.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum: `2E + 8E = 10E`.\n\n#### First Excited State Energy\nTo get the first excited state, we promote one particle from the highest occupied energy level of the ground state (`n=2`) to the next lowest unoccupied energy level (`n=3`).\n*   Two particles remain in the `n=1` level: Energy = `2 * E₁ = 2E`.\n*   One particle remains in the `n=2` level: Energy = `1 * E₂ = 1 * (2² * E) = 4E`.\n*   One particle is promoted to the `n=3` level: Energy = `1 * E₃ = 1 * (3² * E) = 9E`.\n\nThe total first excited state energy is: `2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n#### Second Excited State Energy\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest total energy above the first excited state. We must consider different ways to excite the system from the ground state and find the one with the lowest energy after the first excitation.\n*   **Option 1: Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.**\n    *   Configuration: One particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, and one in `n=3`.\n    *   Energy: `(1 * 1²E) + (2 * 2²E) + (1 * 3²E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E`.\n*   **Option 2: Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3.**\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in `n=1` and two in `n=3`.\n    *   Energy: `(2 * 1²E) + (2 * 3²E) = 2E + 18E = 20E`.\n*   **Option 3: Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.**\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, and one in `n=4`.\n    *   Energy: `(2 * 1²E) + (1 * 2²E) + (1 * 4²E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E`.\n\nComparing the energies of these possible excited states (18E, 20E, 22E), the lowest one after the first excited state (15E) is 18E. Thus, the second excited state energy is 18E.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe energies for the three states are:\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
