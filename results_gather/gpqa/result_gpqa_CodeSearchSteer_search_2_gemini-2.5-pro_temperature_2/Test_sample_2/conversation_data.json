    "The problem requires calculating the expectation value of a given operator for a spin-half particle in a specific quantum state. This is a standard calculation in quantum mechanics.\n\n### State Vector and Operator\n\nThe state of the spin-half particle is a linear superposition of the spin-up `|↑⟩` and spin-down `|↓⟩` states:\n`|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩`\n\nIn matrix form, with `|↑⟩` as `[1, 0]` and `|↓⟩` as `[0, 1]`, the state vector is:\n`|ψ⟩ = [[0.5], [√3/2]]`\n\nThe operator for which we need to find the expectation value is:\n`O = 10σ_z + 5σ_x`\n\nThe Pauli matrices `σ_z` and `σ_x` have the following matrix representations:\n`σ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`\n`σ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n\nSubstituting these into the operator equation gives:\n`O = 10*[[1, 0], [0, -1]] + 5*[[0, 1], [1, 0]] = [[10, 5], [5, -10]]`\n\n### Calculation of the Expectation Value\n\nThe expectation value of an operator `O` for a state `|ψ⟩` is given by the formula `⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩`. This can be calculated using two primary methods.\n\n#### Method 1: Direct Matrix Multiplication\n\n1.  First, we find the bra vector `⟨ψ|`, which is the conjugate transpose of `|ψ⟩`. Since the components are real, it is simply the transpose:\n    `⟨ψ| = [0.5, √3/2]`\n2.  Next, we multiply the operator `O` by the ket `|ψ⟩`:\n    `O|ψ⟩ = [[10, 5], [5, -10]] * [[0.5], [√3/2]] = [[10*0.5 + 5*√3/2], [5*0.5 - 10*√3/2]] = [[5 + 2.5√3], [2.5 - 5√3]]`\n3.  Finally, we compute the inner product of `⟨ψ|` with `O|ψ⟩`:\n    `⟨O⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [[5 + 2.5√3], [2.5 - 5√3]]`\n    `⟨O⟩ = 0.5*(5 + 2.5√3) + (√3/2)*(2.5 - 5√3)`\n    `⟨O⟩ = 2.5 + 1.25√3 + 1.25√3 - (5*3)/2`\n    `⟨O⟩ = 2.5 + 2.5√3 - 7.5`\n    `⟨O⟩ = -5 + 2.5√3`\n\n#### Method 2: Linearity of Expectation Value\n\nWe can calculate the expectation values for `σ_z` and `σ_x` separately.\n`⟨O⟩ = ⟨10σ_z + 5σ_x⟩ = 10⟨σ_z⟩ + 5⟨σ_x⟩`\n\n1.  **Expectation value of `σ_z`:**\n    For a state `a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩`, `⟨σ_z⟩ = |a|² - |b|²`.\n    `⟨σ_z⟩ = (0.5)² - (√3/2)² = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5`\n    So, `10⟨σ_z⟩ = 10 * (-0.5) = -5`.\n\n2.  **Expectation value of `σ_x`:**\n    For a state `a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩`, `⟨σ_x⟩ = 2 * Re(a*b)`.\n    `a* = 0.5`, `b = √3/2`\n    `⟨σ_x⟩ = ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩ = [(1/2)⟨↑| + (√3/2)⟨↓|] σ_x [(1/2)|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩]`\n    Since `σ_x|↑⟩ = |↓⟩` and `σ_x|↓⟩ = |↑⟩`, this becomes:\n    `⟨σ_x⟩ = [(1/2)⟨↑| + (√3/2)⟨↓|] [(1/2)|↓⟩ + (√3/2)|↑⟩] = (1/2)*(√3/2) + (√3/2)*(1/2) = √3/4 + √3/4 = √3/2`\n    So, `5⟨σ_x⟩ = 5 * (√3/2) = 2.5√3`.\n\n3.  **Total Expectation Value:**\n    Adding the two parts together:\n    `⟨O⟩ = -5 + 2.5√3`\n\n### Numerical Result\n\nTo find the numerical value, we use the approximation `√3 ≈ 1.732`.\n`⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 2.5 * 1.732`\n`⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 4.33`\n`⟨O⟩ ≈ -0.67`\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the value is **-0.7**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
