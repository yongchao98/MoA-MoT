    "The calculation relies on the relationship between the total mass of a binary system, its period, and the radial velocity amplitudes of its constituent stars. For a double-lined spectroscopic binary—a system where the spectral lines of both stars can be observed—the total mass (M_total = m1 + m2) can be derived from Kepler's Third Law.\n\nFor a circular orbit, the formula is:\n\nM_total = (P * (K1 + K2)^3) / (2 * π * G * sin^3(i))\n\nWhere:\n*   **P** is the orbital period.\n*   **K1** and **K2** are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities for each star.\n*   **G** is the gravitational constant.\n*   **i** is the inclination of the orbit to the line of sight.\n\nSince both systems are described as \"eclipsing,\" it is a standard assumption that the inclination angle *i* is close to 90 degrees. In this case, sin(i) ≈ 1, which simplifies the formula significantly. The statement that the radial velocity variations are sinusoidal is indicative of circular orbits.\n\nWe can find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 by setting up a ratio of their total masses (M1_total / M2_total). By using a ratio, the constant terms (2 * π * G * sin^3(i)) cancel out, simplifying the calculation to:\n\n(M1_total / M2_total) = [P1 * (K1a + K1b)^3] / [P2 * (K2a + K2b)^3]\n\nHere is the given information for each system:\n\n**System 1:**\n*   Period (P1) = 2 years\n*   Radial velocity amplitude of star A (K1a) = 10 km/s\n*   Radial velocity amplitude of star B (K1b) = 5 km/s\n*   Total velocity amplitude (K1_total) = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s\n\n**System 2:**\n*   Period (P2) = 1 year\n*   Radial velocity amplitude of star A (K2a) = 15 km/s\n*   Radial velocity amplitude of star B (K2b) = 10 km/s\n*   Total velocity amplitude (K2_total) = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the ratio equation:\n\nRatio = [2 years * (15 km/s)^3] / [1 year * (25 km/s)^3]\nRatio = (2 * 3375) / 15625\nRatio = 6750 / 15625\nRatio = 0.432\n\nThe mass of system_1 is approximately 0.432 times the mass of system_2. This value is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
