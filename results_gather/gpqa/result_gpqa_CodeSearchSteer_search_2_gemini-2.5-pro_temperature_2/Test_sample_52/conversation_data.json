    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structural Information:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two substituents attached.\n    *   **FTIR shows an ester group:** The molecule contains a -COO- functional group.\n    *   **No –CH₂ groups:** This is a critical constraint that eliminates many potential structures.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A disubstituted benzene ring has four protons. The presence of only two signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely a *para* (1,4) arrangement, which would show two distinct sets of two equivalent protons.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). One vinyl proton is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet), and the second vinyl proton is split by both the first vinyl proton and the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (creating a doublet of quartets). This confirms the presence of a -C₃H₅ substituent.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH₃ groups:** One of these methyl groups belongs to the propenyl substituent identified above. The second methyl group must be part of the ester-containing substituent, and it must be attached in a way that does not create a -CH₂- group. The two simplest possibilities are a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃) or an acetoxy group (-OCOCH₃).\n\n3.  **Construct the Molecular Fragments:**\n    *   Aromatic ring: C₆H₄\n    *   Substituent 1 (from vinyl signals): Propenyl group, -C₃H₅\n    *   Substituent 2 (from ester and methyl signals): An ester group with a methyl and no methylene groups. This can be either a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃, formula C₂H₃O₂) or an acetoxy group (-OCOCH₃, formula C₂H₃O₂).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Molecular Formula:**\n    Combine the formulas of the fragments.\n    *   **Carbons:** 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 2 (ester part) = 11 carbons.\n    *   **Hydrogens:** 4 (ring) + 5 (propenyl) + 3 (methyl ester/acetoxy part) = 12 hydrogens.\n    *   **Oxygens:** 2 (from the ester group) = 2 oxygens.\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This formula is consistent with example molecules like ethyl cinnamate.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Other Options:**\n    *   **C₁₁H₁₄O₂:** This formula has two more hydrogens than C₁₁H₁₂O₂. Its degree of unsaturation is 5, which is inconsistent with having an aromatic ring (4), a C=C double bond (1), and a C=O double bond (1) simultaneously. An example would be 4-isopropylphenyl acetate, which lacks the required vinyl hydrogens.\n    *   **C₁₂H₁₂O₂ and C₁₂H₁₄O₂:** To arrive at these formulas while keeping the propenyl group and the \"di-substituted\" and \"no -CH₂-\" rules would require structural arrangements that contradict the provided constraints. For example, adding another methyl group to C₁₁H₁₂O₂ would result in a tri-substituted ring to make C₁₂H₁₄O₂.\n\nBased on the logical deduction from the spectral data, the only possible chemical formula among the choices is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<C>>>"
