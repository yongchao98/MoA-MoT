    "### Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures is Approximately 0.53\n\nBased on the provided data, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet 1 and Planet 2 is calculated to be approximately 0.53. This result is derived by relating the planets' equilibrium temperatures to their orbital distances and using the radial velocity data to determine those distances.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its semi-major axis (orbital distance). Therefore, to find the temperature ratio, the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes must first be determined.\n\nThe steps to reach the solution are as follows:\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**: The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (`T_eq1 / T_eq2`) simplifies to the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes (`sqrt(a₂ / a₁)`), given that they share the same star and have the same albedo.\n2.  **Radial Velocity Data**: The Doppler shift (`Δλ`) induced by each planet on the star is proportional to the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (`K`). The problem states `Δλ₁` is 0.03 Å and `Δλ₂` is 0.04 Å, making the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes (`K₁ / K₂`) equal to 3/4.\n3.  **Determining Orbital Distance**: For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (`K`) is proportional to the planet's mass (`M_p`) and inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis (`a`). By rearranging this relationship, the semi-major axis (`a`) is found to be proportional to the square of the planet's mass divided by the square of the radial velocity semi-amplitude (`M_p² / K²`).\n4.  **Calculation**:\n    *   The ratio of the semi-major axes (`a₂ / a₁`) can be expressed as `(M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²`.\n    *   Substituting the known mass ratio (5/7) and the radial velocity ratio (3/4), we get `a₂ / a₁ = (5/7)² * (3/4)² = 225/784`.\n    *   Finally, the temperature ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2` is `sqrt(225 / 784)`, which equals 15/28.\n\nThis fraction, 15/28, is approximately 0.5357, which corresponds to the provided answer choice. The superfluous information about the star's mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii, cancels out during the calculation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
