    "To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with parallax, we can make the following assumptions and derivations:\n\n**Assumptions:**\n1.  Stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number of stars per unit volume is constant. Let's call this constant density ρ.\n2.  Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (d) to the star. This is given by the formula d = 1/plx.\n\n**Derivation:**\n1.  Consider a thin spherical shell of space with radius *d* and thickness *dd*. The volume of this shell (*dV*) is the surface area of the sphere (4πd²) multiplied by the thickness (*dd*).\n    *   dV = 4πd² dd\n\n2.  With a uniform stellar density (ρ), the number of stars (*dN*) within this thin shell is the density multiplied by the volume of the shell.\n    *   dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² dd\n\n3.  The goal is to find how the number of stars changes with parallax, which is the quantity *dN/d(plx)*. To do this, we need to express *d* and *dd* in terms of *plx* and *d(plx)*.\n    *   From the parallax formula, d = 1/plx.\n    *   To find *dd*, we differentiate the above expression with respect to *plx*:\n        *   dd/d(plx) = -1/plx²\n        *   dd = -(1/plx²) d(plx)\n    *   Since we are concerned with the number of stars in a shell of a certain thickness, we can take the magnitude of the change, so `dd = (1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n\n4.  Now, substitute the expressions for *d* and *dd* back into the equation for *dN*:\n    *   dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) d(plx)\n\n5.  Simplify the expression:\n    *   dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) d(plx)\n\n6.  To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we divide by *d(plx)*:\n    *   dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴\n\nSince 4, π, and ρ are constants, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to 1/plx⁴. This relationship is a known result in astronomy.\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx as ~ 1/plx⁴.\n\n<<<C>>>"
