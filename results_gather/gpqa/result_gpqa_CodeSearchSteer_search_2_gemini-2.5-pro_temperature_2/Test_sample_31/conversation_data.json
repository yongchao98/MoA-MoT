    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the energy of the Lithium-6 nucleus.\n\n**1. Identify the Nucleus and its Components**\nThe nucleus is specified as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons.\n*   Lithium has an atomic number (Z) of 3, meaning it has 3 protons.\n*   The problem states it has 3 neutrons (N).\n*   The mass number (A) is the sum of protons and neutrons: A = 3 + 3 = 6.\n*   Therefore, the nucleus is **Lithium-6 ($^{6}$Li)**.\n\n**2. Determine the Rest Mass Energy (E₀)**\nTo calculate the total energy, we first need the rest mass of the nucleus. This can be calculated from the masses of its constituent protons and neutrons, and subtracting the mass defect, which is equivalent to the binding energy.\n\n*   **Mass of 3 protons:** The mass of a single proton is approximately 938.272 MeV/c².\n    *   3 * 938.272 MeV/c² = 2814.816 MeV/c²\n*   **Mass of 3 neutrons:** The mass of a single neutron is approximately 939.565 MeV/c².\n    *   3 * 939.565 MeV/c² = 2818.695 MeV/c²\n*   **Total mass of constituent nucleons:**\n    *   2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV/c²\n*   **Binding Energy of Lithium-6:** The binding energy per nucleon for ⁶Li is 5.332 MeV. Since there are 6 nucleons, the total binding energy is:\n    *   6 * 5.332 MeV = 31.992 MeV\n*   **Rest Mass Energy of the Nucleus (E₀):** The rest mass energy of the nucleus is the total mass of its parts minus the binding energy.\n    *   E₀ = 5633.511 MeV - 31.992 MeV = 5601.519 MeV\n*   **Convert to GeV:**\n    *   E₀ = 5.601519 GeV\n\n**3. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**\nThe speed of the nucleus is given as v = 0.96c. The Lorentz factor is calculated as:\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.96²)\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216)\n*   γ = 1 / √0.0784\n*   γ = 1 / 0.28\n*   γ ≈ 3.5714\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Relativistic Energy (E)**\nThe total energy is the product of the Lorentz factor and the rest mass energy.\n*   E = γ * E₀\n*   E ≈ 3.5714 * 5.601519 GeV\n*   E ≈ 20.0051 GeV\n\n**5. Compare with the Options**\nThe calculated energy is approximately 20.0051 GeV. Comparing this with the given choices:\n*   A) 21.419 GeV\n*   B) 20.132 GeV\n*   C) 18.475 GeV\n*   D) 23.069 GeV\n\nThe calculated value of 20.0051 GeV is closest to option B, 20.132 GeV. The minor difference can be attributed to using more precise values for the masses of protons, neutrons, and the binding energy.\n\nUsing the precise atomic mass of Lithium-6 (6.015122 u) and the conversion factor 1 u = 931.494 MeV/c² gives a rest mass energy for the atom, from which the electron masses must be subtracted.\n*   Atomic rest energy: 6.015122 u * 931.494 MeV/u ≈ 5603.0 MeV = 5.603 GeV\n*   E = 3.5714 * 5.603 GeV ≈ 20.01 GeV, which is still closest to B.\n\nFinal check with slightly different values:\nMass of proton: 1.007276 u\nMass of neutron: 1.008665 u\nMass of Li-6 nucleus = 6.013476 u\nRest Mass Energy E₀ = 6.013476 u * 931.5 MeV/u ≈ 5601.52 MeV ≈ 5.6015 GeV\nTotal Energy E = 3.5714 * 5.6015 GeV ≈ 20.005 GeV.\n\nThe value is consistently near 20 GeV. The closest answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
