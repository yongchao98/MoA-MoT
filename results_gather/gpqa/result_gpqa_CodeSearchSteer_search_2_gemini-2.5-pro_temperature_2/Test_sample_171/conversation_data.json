    "To solve this problem, we must use the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of atoms among different energy levels in a system that is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\nThe Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (`N_b`) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state (`N_a`) as:\n\n*N_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-(E_b - E_a) / (k * T)]*\n\nWhere:\n*   `g_b` and `g_a` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the energy levels.\n*   `E_b - E_a` is the energy difference between the two levels, which is given as approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J.\n*   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   `T` is the temperature of the gas.\n\nThe problem compares the \"excitation\" in two stars. This excitation refers to the population of a specific energy level relative to the ground state. Let's denote the population of this specific excited state as `N_excited` and the ground state as `N_ground`.\n\nFor the two stars, we can write the following expressions:\n\n*   **For Star 1 (temperature T₁):** `(N_excited / N_ground)₁ = C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₁)]`\n*   **For Star 2 (temperature T₂):** `(N_excited / N_ground)₂ = C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₂)]`\n\nHere, `C` represents the ratio of statistical weights `(g_excited / g_ground)`, which is constant for the same energy levels in the same type of atom (iron). `ΔE` is the energy difference `E_excited - E_ground`.\n\nThe problem states that the excitation in star 1 is twice that in star 2:\n`(N_excited / N_ground)₁ = 2 * (N_excited / N_ground)₂`\n\nSubstituting the Boltzmann expressions:\n`C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₁)] = 2 * C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₂)]`\n\nWe can cancel the constant `C` from both sides:\n`exp[-ΔE / (k * T₁)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₂)]`\n\nNow, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n`ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T₁)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T₂)])`\n`-ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T₂)`\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for `ln(2)`:\n`ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T₂) - ΔE / (k * T₁)`\n`ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁)`\n`ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [(T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂)]`\n\nThe problem provides the energy difference `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J`. The Boltzmann constant, `k`, has a defined value of approximately 1.380649 × 10⁻²³ J/K. Therefore, the ratio `ΔE / k` is very close to 1.\n\nSubstituting `ΔE / k ≈ 1`:\n`ln(2) = [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ]`\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
