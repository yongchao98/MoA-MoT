    "The \"impulse\" approximation in many-body nuclear calculations is a simplification that allows the complex interaction between a probe and a nucleus to be treated as a sum of interactions with individual, free nucleons. This approximation is jointly implied by the following three assumptions:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.** The core idea of the impulse approximation is to break down the many-body problem into a series of two-body interactions. It assumes the probe interacts with just one nucleon at a time, while the other nucleons in the nucleus act as spectators. This is often the first and most fundamental assumption cited when defining the approximation.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.** This assumption implies the neglect of final state interactions (FSI). After the probe interacts with the chosen nucleon, neither the probe nor the struck nucleon re-interacts with the remaining (A-1) nucleons. Similarly, the incoming probe is assumed not to interact with other nucleons before hitting the target nucleon. This is crucial for treating the event as a clean, single interaction.\n\n3.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.** The approximation assumes that the interaction with the probe happens over a very short timescale. During this brief \"impulse,\" the forces binding the nucleon within the nucleus are considered negligible compared to the force of the interaction itself. Consequently, the nucleon can be treated as if it were a free particle during the collision.\n\nThe third option presented, \"The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic,\" is not a necessary assumption for the impulse approximation. The impulse approximation simplifies the interactions between *nucleons* within a nucleus; it does not typically make assumptions about the *sub-structure* of the nucleons themselves. In fact, relativistic treatments of the nucleons are often employed alongside the impulse approximation.\n\nTherefore, the three assumptions that jointly define the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
