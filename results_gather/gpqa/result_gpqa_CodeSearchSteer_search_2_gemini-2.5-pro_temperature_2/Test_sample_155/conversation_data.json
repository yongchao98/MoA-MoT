    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reactions and the resulting chromatograms.\n\n### Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene. Treatment with mCPBA is an epoxidation reaction that occurs via *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond. Since the starting material is symmetrical and achiral, epoxidation from either face produces a racemic mixture (a 50:50 mix of two enantiomers) of the *trans*-epoxide, specifically (4R,5R)-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening:** The subsequent addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) catalyzes the opening of the epoxide ring. This is an Sₙ2-like reaction where a water molecule attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite the C-O bond (*anti*-attack), resulting in an *anti*-dihydroxylation product.\n    *   The attack on the (4R,5R)-epoxide results in (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The attack on the (4S,5S)-epoxide also results in (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 1:** Both pathways lead to the same single product: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. This molecule has two stereocenters but possesses an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound, which is achiral.\n\n### Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene. The *syn*-addition of the oxygen atom from mCPBA results in the formation of a *cis*-epoxide. Because the starting alkene is symmetrical, the resulting product, (4R,5S)-epoxyoctane, is a meso compound.\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening:** The acid-catalyzed ring opening proceeds via *anti*-attack by water.\n    *   Attack at one carbon of the meso epoxide results in (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon (which is equally likely) results in (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n3.  **Product of Reaction 2:** This reaction produces a racemic mixture (a 50:50 mix) of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe final mixture, which is a combination of the products from both reactions, contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n*   **Meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n*   **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n*   **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe meso-diol is a diastereomer of the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols, which are enantiomers of each other.\n\n### Chromatographic Observation\n\nThe mixture is analyzed using two types of HPLC.\n\n1.  **Standard (Achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates molecules based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore cannot be separated; they will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **two peaks**: one for the meso-diol and a second, single peak for the co-eluting (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase to create a chiral environment.\n    *   This chiral environment allows for the separation of enantiomers because they form transient diastereomeric complexes with the stationary phase at different rates.\n    *   Consequently, all three stereoisomers in the mixture will be separated from each other.\n    *   The chromatogram will show **three peaks**: one for the meso-diol, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<C>>>"
