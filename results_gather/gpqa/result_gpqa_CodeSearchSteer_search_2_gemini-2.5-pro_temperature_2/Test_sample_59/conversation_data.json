    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time experienced by the astronaut, which is affected by time dilation due to the spacecraft's high velocity. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n### 1. Distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud\n\nThe Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. Its distance from Earth is approximately 163,000 light-years. This means it would take light 163,000 years to travel this distance.\n\n### 2. Time of Travel from an Earth Observer's Perspective\n\nFor an observer on Earth, the time it would take the spacecraft to reach Earth is the distance divided by the speed. Since the speed is very close to the speed of light (0.99999987*c), the travel time from Earth's perspective would be slightly more than 163,000 years.\n\n*   **Distance (d):** 163,000 light-years\n*   **Velocity (v):** 0.99999987 * c\n*   **Time (Δt) from Earth's perspective:** d / v = 163,000 light-years / (0.99999987 * c) ≈ 163,000.21 years\n\n### 3. Time Experienced by the Astronaut (Time Dilation)\n\nDue to the effects of special relativity, time for the astronaut moving at a high velocity will pass much slower than for a stationary observer on Earth. This phenomenon is known as time dilation. The formula to calculate the time experienced by the astronaut (the proper time, Δt₀) is:\n\nΔt₀ = Δt * √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Lorentz factor, which is the part under the square root:\n\n*   v/c = 0.99999987\n*   (v/c)² = (0.99999987)² ≈ 0.99999974\n*   1 - (v/c)² = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026\n*   √(1 - v²/c²) = √0.00000026 ≈ 0.00051\n\nNow, we can calculate the time experienced by the astronaut:\n\n*   Δt₀ = 163,000.21 years * 0.00051 ≈ 83.13 years\n\nThe astronaut's age upon arrival would be their initial age plus the travel time they experienced:\n\n*   **Arrival Age:** 22 years + 83.13 years = 105.13 years\n\nSince the average lifetime of these aliens is 150 solar years, the astronaut will survive the journey. The travel time from the astronaut's point of view is approximately 83 years.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) 72 years\nB) 81 years\nC) 77 years\nD) The astronaut will die before reaching to the Earth.\n\nThe calculated travel time of approximately 83 years is closest to 81 years. The minor difference can be attributed to slight variations in the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud and the precision of the constants used.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible answer is 81 years.\n\n<<<B>>>"
