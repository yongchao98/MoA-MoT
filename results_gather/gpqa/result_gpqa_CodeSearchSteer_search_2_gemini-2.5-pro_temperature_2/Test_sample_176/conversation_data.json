    "The calculation I performed appears to be correct and logical based on the physical principles involved. The search results confirm the validity of the Stefan-Boltzmann law (L = 4πR²σT⁴), Wien's displacement law (λ_peak = b/T), and the non-relativistic Doppler shift for light (λ_obs ≈ λ_rest * (1 + v/c)).\n\nThe key steps were:\n1.  **Luminosity Ratio**: The ratio of the luminosities of the two stars is given by L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴.\n2.  **Radius Ratio**: The problem states R₁/R₂ = 1.5. Therefore, (R₁/R₂)² = 2.25.\n3.  **Temperature Ratio**: The temperature of a black body is inversely proportional to its peak emission wavelength (λ_peak) in its rest frame, as per Wien's Law (T ∝ 1/λ_rest). This means T₁/T₂ = λ_rest₂ / λ_rest₁.\n4.  **Doppler Shift**: The observed peak wavelength (λ_obs) is affected by the star's radial velocity (v). For Star 1, v₁ = 0, so its observed peak wavelength is the same as its rest wavelength (λ_obs₁ = λ_rest₁). For Star 2, with v₂ = 700 km/s, the observed wavelength is shifted: λ_obs₂ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n5.  **Connecting the Pieces**: The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same (λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂). This implies that λ_rest₁ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + v₂/c).\n6.  **Final Calculation**: By substituting this relationship into the temperature ratio, we get T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c). The final luminosity ratio is therefore L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n*   v₂ = 700 km/s\n*   c ≈ 300,000 km/s\n*   v₂/c = 700 / 300,000 ≈ 0.002333\n*   L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + 0.002333)]⁴\n*   L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (1 / 1.002333)⁴\n*   L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (0.99767)⁴\n*   L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907\n*   L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis result is closest to option B. The information about the masses of the stars is not needed for this calculation and serves as a distractor.\n\nThe luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<B>>>"
