    "To eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, the gene responsible for its synthesis must be rendered non-functional. This is most effectively achieved by a mutation that halts the production of the protein or drastically alters its structure. The most severe mutations are typically those that cause a premature stop in protein synthesis or shift the entire reading frame of the gene.\n\nLet's analyze the effect of each mutation on the gene's protein-coding sequence:\n\n**Intact Gene:** The gene begins with `ATG`, the start codon, and is read in triplets (codons).\n`5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT…`\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT…`\n    This sequence has a single base change in the third codon, from `CTC` to `TAC`. This is a **missense mutation**, which substitutes one amino acid (Leucine) for another (Tyrosine). While this could potentially affect the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it. Many missense mutations result in proteins that are still functional to some degree.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT…`\n    This sequence has a single base change in the third codon, from `CTC` to `TAA`. The codon `TAA` is one of the three **stop codons** (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). This type of change is called a **nonsense mutation**. It signals the machinery to stop protein synthesis prematurely. The resulting protein would be only two amino acids long and almost certainly non-functional, thus eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT…` (upon careful inspection, a `T` has been *inserted* after the second codon).\n    Original: `ATG TTT CTC…`\n    Mutant: `ATG TTT T AC G CTG G…`\n    This insertion of a single nucleotide causes a **frameshift mutation**. This alters the entire downstream reading frame, changing every subsequent amino acid and likely resulting in a completely non-functional protein that terminates early. This is also a very strong candidate for eliminating the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT AC GCT ACT…` (upon careful inspection, the codon `GGT` has been *deleted*).\n    This is a deletion of three nucleotides, which removes exactly one codon. This is an **in-frame deletion** and removes one amino acid from the protein but does not alter the rest of the reading frame. Like a missense mutation, this may or may not eliminate the protein's function.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBoth the nonsense mutation (Mutant 2) and the frameshift mutation (Mutant 3) are highly likely to cause a complete loss of protein function. However, a nonsense mutation that introduces a stop codon so early in the sequence is the most definitive and direct way to ensure that a functional protein is not produced. It provides a clear signal to terminate protein synthesis almost immediately after it begins. Therefore, it represents the highest probability of successfully eliminating the targeted compound.\n\n<<<B>>>"
