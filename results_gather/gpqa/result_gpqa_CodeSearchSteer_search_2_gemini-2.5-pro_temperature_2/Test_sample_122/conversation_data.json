    "This is a problem of special relativity, specifically concerning time dilation.\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference**:\n    *   The Galaxy's reference frame (let's call it S). This is the \"stationary\" frame from which we want to measure the distance.\n    *   The supernova ejecta's reference frame (let's call it S'). This is the \"moving\" frame.\n\n2.  **Identify the given information**:\n    *   The velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is **v = 60,000 km/s**.\n    *   The time that has passed in the ejecta's reference frame is **Δt' = 50 s**. This is the proper time because it is measured by a clock in the moving frame.\n    *   The speed of light is **c ≈ 300,000 km/s**.\n\n3.  **Determine what to calculate**:\n    *   We need to find the distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's reference frame (S). This distance is given by the formula: `Distance = velocity × time`.\n    *   The velocity is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time must be the time measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (S), which we will call **Δt**.\n\n4.  **Apply Time Dilation**:\n    According to the theory of special relativity, time in a moving reference frame appears to pass slower relative to a stationary observer. This phenomenon is called time dilation. The relationship between the time in the stationary frame (Δt) and the proper time in the moving frame (Δt') is given by:\n    Δt = γ * Δt'\n    where **γ** (the Lorentz factor) is:\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)**:\n    *   First, calculate the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light:\n        v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2\n    *   Now, substitute this value into the Lorentz factor formula:\n        γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)\n    *   √(0.96) ≈ 0.9798\n    *   γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206\n\n6.  **Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (Δt)**:\n    *   Using the time dilation formula:\n        Δt = γ * Δt' ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s\n\n7.  **Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame**:\n    *   Distance = v * Δt\n    *   Distance ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km\n\nTo get a more precise result without intermediate rounding:\n*   Distance = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt') = (v * Δt') / √(1 - v²/c²)\n*   Distance = (60,000 km/s * 50 s) / √(0.96)\n*   Distance = 3,000,000 km / √(0.96)\n*   Distance ≈ 3,061,862 km\n\nThis calculated value is very close to the option B.\n\n*   Option C (3,000,000 km) would be the answer if relativistic effects were ignored (i.e., if γ = 1).\n*   The correct answer must account for time dilation, which results in a longer time interval and therefore a greater distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nThus, 3,060,000 km is the correct choice.\n\n<<<B>>>"
