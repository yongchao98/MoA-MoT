    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Calculation of the Relative Speed (`v_rel`)\n\nTo find the relative speed of the two astronauts, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Let `v1` be the velocity of the first astronaut (0.6 c) and `v2` be the velocity of the second astronaut (0.5 c), both measured from a stationary reference frame. The velocity of the second astronaut relative to the first is given by the formula:\n\n`v_rel = (v2 - v1) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\n*   `v1 = 0.6 c`\n*   `v2 = 0.5 c`\n\n`v_rel = (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n`v_rel = -0.1c / (1 - 0.3c^2 / c^2)`\n`v_rel = -0.1c / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = -0.1c / 0.7`\n`v_rel ≈ -0.1428c`\n\nThe magnitude of the relative speed is the absolute value, which is approximately 0.14c.\n\n### 2. Calculation of the Total Energy (`E`)\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic system is the sum of the total energies of its individual components. The total energy `E` of a single particle is given by the formula `E = γmc^2`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `m` is the rest mass, and `c` is the speed of light.\n\nThe Lorentz factor `γ` is calculated as `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`.\n\n**Energy of the first astronaut (`E1`):**\n\n*   Mass `m1 = 2m`\n*   Velocity `v1 = 0.6c`\n*   Lorentz factor `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n*   `E1 = γ1 * m1 * c^2 = 1.25 * (2m) * c^2 = 2.5 mc^2`\n\n**Energy of the second astronaut (`E2`):**\n\n*   Mass `m2 = 3m`\n*   Velocity `v2 = 0.5c`\n*   Lorentz factor `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2 / c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75)`\n*   `sqrt(0.75) ≈ 0.866`, so `γ2 ≈ 1 / 0.866 ≈ 1.1547`\n*   `E2 = γ2 * m2 * c^2 ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c^2 ≈ 3.4641 mc^2`\n\n**Total energy of the system (`E_total`):**\n\n`E_total = E1 + E2`\n`E_total = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2`\n`E_total = 5.9641 mc^2`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately **0.14c**, and the total energy of the system is approximately **5.96 mc^2**. Comparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   **A) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2**\n*   B) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\n*   C) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\n*   D) v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\n\nThe calculated values match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
