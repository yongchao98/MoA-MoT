    "Here is the step-by-step analysis of the provided chemical reactions to determine the appropriate reagents.\n\n### Reaction 1:\n**butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\nThis reaction is a classic example of cyanohydrin formation. The process involves the nucleophilic addition of a cyanide ion (CN⁻) to the carbonyl carbon of a ketone (butan-2-one).\n\n1.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The cyanide ion (from NaCN) attacks the partially positive carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.\n2.  **Protonation:** The negatively charged oxygen on the alkoxide intermediate needs to be protonated to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group. This requires a proton source.\n\nFor this reaction to proceed efficiently, a source of protons is necessary. While NaCN provides the nucleophile, reagent 'A' must be an acid to supply the H+ for the final step. Often, cyanohydrin formation is carried out by generating hydrocyanic acid (HCN) *in situ*. This is achieved by adding a strong acid to a solution of sodium cyanide. The notation **H₃O⁺** represents a hydronium ion, which is characteristic of an acidic solution (e.g., from HCl or H₂SO₄). Therefore, H₃O⁺ is the suitable reagent for 'A'.\n\n### Reaction 2:\n**2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\nThis reaction shows the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), a reaction known as nitrile hydrolysis. Specifically, it is the hydrolysis of a cyanohydrin to an α-hydroxy acid.\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** The conversion of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid is a hydrolysis reaction that can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base.\n2.  **Reagent's Role:** The reaction is typically carried out by heating the nitrile with an aqueous solution of a strong mineral acid, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl) or sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). While weak acids like acetic acid (CH₃COOH) could theoretically catalyze the reaction, the process would be impractically slow. Strong acids are required for an effective conversion.\n\nConsidering the options, **HCl** (hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid and a standard reagent for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   For the first reaction (cyanohydrin formation), the required reagent **A** is a proton source, correctly represented by **H₃O⁺**.\n*   For the second reaction (nitrile hydrolysis), the required reagent **B** is a strong acid catalyst, such as **HCl**.\n\nCombining these findings, the correct pair of reagents is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.\n\n<<<C>>>"
