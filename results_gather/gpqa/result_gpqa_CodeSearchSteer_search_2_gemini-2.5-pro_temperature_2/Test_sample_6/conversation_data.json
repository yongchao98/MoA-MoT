    "To determine the energy at which a high-energy gamma-ray's lifetime would be limited by its interaction with a Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon to produce an electron-positron pair ($\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$), we must consider the threshold energy for this process.\n\nThe creation of an electron-positron pair from two photons is known as pair production. For this interaction to occur, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame of the two photons must be at least the combined rest mass energy of the electron and the positron. The rest mass energy of an electron is approximately 0.511 MeV. Since a positron has the same mass, the minimum required energy is twice this value, about 1.022 MeV.\n\nThe threshold condition for pair production is most favorably met in a head-on collision. The relationship between the energies of the high-energy gamma-ray ($E_\\gamma$) and the low-energy CMB photon ($E_{CMB}$) is given by the formula:\n\n$E_\\gamma \\cdot E_{CMB} \\ge (m_e c^2)^2$\n\nHere, $m_e c^2$ represents the rest mass energy of an electron. We are given the average energy of a CMB photon as $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{eV}$.\n\nThe rest mass energy of an electron ($m_e c^2$) is 0.511 MeV, which is equivalent to $0.511 \\times 10^6$ eV. We can now calculate the threshold energy for the gamma-ray:\n\n$E_\\gamma \\ge \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n\n$E_\\gamma \\ge \\frac{0.2611 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n\n$E_\\gamma \\ge 0.2611 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}$\n\nThe question asks for the energy in giga-electronvolts (GeV), and since 1 GeV = $10^9$ eV, we convert our result:\n\n$E_\\gamma \\ge \\frac{0.2611 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}}$\n\n$E_\\gamma \\ge 0.2611 \\times 10^6 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n$E_\\gamma \\ge 2.611 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n\nA) 3.9*1e5 GeV\nB) 2.6*1e5 GeV\nC) 1.8*1e5 GeV\nD) 9.5*1e4 GeV\n\nThe calculated value of approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV matches option B. Therefore, gamma-rays with this energy would have their lifetimes significantly limited by annihilation with CMB photons.\n\n<<<B>>>"
