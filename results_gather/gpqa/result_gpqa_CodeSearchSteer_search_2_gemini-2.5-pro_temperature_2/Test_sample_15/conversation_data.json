    "An optically active compound must be chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This generally requires the presence of a chiral center and the absence of any internal planes of symmetry or centers of inversion. Here is a breakdown of each compound:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule is an alkene. Since the atoms attached to the carbon-carbon double bond lie in the same plane, and the molecule lacks a chiral center, it has a plane of symmetry and is therefore not optically active.\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name itself specifies a single, distinct stereoisomer with `R` and `S` configurations at its chiral centers (3a and 7a). A specific enantiomer like this is, by definition, optically active. The complex bicyclic structure prevents a plane of symmetry that would render it a meso compound.\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This compound has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the `(2R,3S)` configuration results in an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral and thus not optically active.\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This stereoisomer also has two chiral centers. Unlike its `(2R,3S)` counterpart, the `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry. This compound is one of a pair of enantiomers (`(2R,3R)` and `(2S,3S)`) and is therefore optically active.\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The `(R)` designation indicates that this is a specific enantiomer. The carbon atom attached to the hydroxyl group (C1) is a chiral center, as it is bonded to four different groups. This molecule is chiral and optically active.\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: In this molecule, the three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (cis). This arrangement creates multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane can pass through one hydroxyl group and the opposite carbon atom. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and not optically active.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: An analysis of the structure, cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2, reveals no chiral centers. The carbon atom at position 3 of the butane chain is attached to two identical methyl groups, so it is not chiral. The molecule has a plane of symmetry and is therefore not optically active.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>"
