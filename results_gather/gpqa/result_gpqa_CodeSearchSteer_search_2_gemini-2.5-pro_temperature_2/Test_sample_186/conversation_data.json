    "An analysis of the stars listed determines that three would be detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph coupled with a single 8m Very Large Telescope (VLT) at the Paranal Observatory. The criterion for detection is achieving a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 in a one-hour exposure.\n\nA key performance metric for ESPRESSO when used with a single VLT Unit Telescope (1-UT mode) indicates that it can achieve an S/N of 10 for a star with an apparent V magnitude of 17.1 in a total exposure time of one hour. Therefore, any star with an apparent magnitude brighter than or equal to 17.1 (i.e., a smaller magnitude number) and visible from the observatory's location will be detectable.\n\nThe Paranal Observatory is located in the southern hemisphere at a latitude of approximately -24.6 degrees. This location determines which stars are visible in the sky.\n\nHere is a star-by-star evaluation:\n\n*   **a) Canopus:** This is the second brightest star in the night sky, with a very bright apparent V magnitude of approximately -0.74. Its declination is about -52 degrees, making it easily observable from the southern hemisphere location of Paranal. Since its magnitude is significantly brighter than the 17.1 limit, **Canopus is detectable**.\n\n*   **b) Polaris:** The North Star has an apparent V magnitude of about 1.98. However, its declination is approximately +89 degrees. Due to its extreme northern position in the sky, Polaris is not visible from the Paranal Observatory in the southern hemisphere. Thus, **Polaris is not detectable** from Paranal.\n\n*   **c) Star at 10 pc:** To determine its detectability, we first calculate its apparent magnitude (m) from its absolute magnitude (M=15) and distance (d=10 pc) using the formula `m = M + 5 * log10(d/10)`.\n    `m = 15 + 5 * log10(10/10) = 15 + 5 * 0 = 15`.\n    An apparent magnitude of 15 is brighter than the 17.1 limit. The star's declination of 0 degrees means it lies on the celestial equator and is observable from Paranal. Therefore, **this star is detectable**.\n\n*   **d) Star at 200 pc:** Using the same formula with d=200 pc:\n    `m = 15 + 5 * log10(200/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(20) ≈ 15 + 6.5 = 21.5`.\n    An apparent magnitude of 21.5 is much fainter than the 17.1 limit. Consequently, **this star is not detectable**.\n\n*   **e) Star at 5 pc:** Using the formula with d=5 pc:\n    `m = 15 + 5 * log10(5/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(0.5) ≈ 15 - 1.5 = 13.5`.\n    An apparent magnitude of 13.5 is brighter than the 17.1 limit. **This star is detectable**.\n\n*   **f) Star at 50 pc:** Using the formula with d=50 pc:\n    `m = 15 + 5 * log10(50/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(5) ≈ 15 + 3.5 = 18.5`.\n    An apparent magnitude of 18.5 is fainter than the 17.1 limit, so **this star is not detectable**.\n\nIn summary, the three detectable stars are Canopus, the star at 10 pc (m=15), and the star at 5 pc (m=13.5).\n\n<<<B>>>"
