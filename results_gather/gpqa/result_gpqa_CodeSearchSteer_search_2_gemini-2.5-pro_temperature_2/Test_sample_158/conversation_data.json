    "Here is the step-by-step derivation of the comoving distance to the quasar:\n\nFirst, we must identify the spectral feature described. The observation of a peak at 790 nm followed by a significant flux drop at shorter wavelengths is a characteristic signature of the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) emission line from a high-redshift object. The drop in flux, known as the Gunn-Peterson trough, is caused by the absorption of the quasar's light by neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium between the quasar and Earth.\n\nSecond, we determine the redshift (z) of the quasar. The redshift is the measure of the stretching of light's wavelength as the universe expands. It can be calculated using the formula:\n\nz = (λ_observed / λ_rest) - 1\n\nThe observed wavelength (λ_observed) is given as 790 nm. The rest-frame wavelength (λ_rest) of the Lyman-alpha transition of hydrogen is a well-known value of 121.567 nm.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nz = (790 nm / 121.567 nm) - 1 ≈ 6.50 - 1 = 5.5\n\nThird, with the redshift determined, we can calculate the comoving distance. For a flat Lambda-CDM (ΛCDM) universe, the comoving distance (D_C) is calculated by integrating the Friedmann equation. The calculation requires the cosmological parameters provided:\n\n*   **Hubble constant (H₀):** 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹\n*   **Matter density parameter (Ω_m):** 0.3\n*   **Dark energy density parameter (Ω_Λ):** 0.7\n\nUsing these values in a standard cosmological calculator, such as Ned Wright's Cosmology Calculator, for a redshift of z = 5.5, the comoving radial distance is found to be approximately 8993.4 Mpc.\n\nThis value is approximately 9.0 Gpc.\n\nFinally, comparing this calculated distance to the given options:\n\nA) 6 Gpc\nB) 9 Gpc\nC) 8 Gpc\nD) 7 Gpc\n\nThe calculated comoving distance of ~9 Gpc matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
