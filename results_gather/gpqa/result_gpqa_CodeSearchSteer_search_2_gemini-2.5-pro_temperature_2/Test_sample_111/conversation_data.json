    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n### 1. Normalize the State Vector |alpha>\n\nThe given state is proportional to `(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>`. Let's call the unnormalized state `|ψ>`:\n`|ψ> = (1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>`\n\nTo normalize it, we need to find the normalization constant C such that `|alpha> = C |ψ>` and `<alpha|alpha> = 1`.\n\nThe inner product `<ψ|ψ>` is:\n`<ψ|ψ> = [(1-i) <up| + (2+i) <down|] ⋅ [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>]`\n`<ψ|ψ> = (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i)`\n`<ψ|ψ> = (1² - i²) + (2² - i²) = (1 - (-1)) + (4 - (-1)) = 2 + 5 = 7`\n\nThe normalization condition `<alpha|alpha> = |C|² <ψ|ψ> = 1` implies:\n`|C|² * 7 = 1  =>  |C| = 1/sqrt(7)`\n\nWe choose the real, positive constant `C = 1/sqrt(7)`. So the normalized state is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>]`\n\nIn matrix form, with `|up> = [1, 0]^T` and `|down> = [0, 1]^T`, this is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [1+i, 2-i]^T`\n\n### 2. Find Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of the Operator A\n\nThe operator A has matrix elements `Aij = hbar/2` for `i ≠ j` and `0` otherwise. In the `{|up>, |down>}` basis, this gives the matrix:\n`A = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`:\n`det([[ -λ, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -λ]]) = (-λ)(-λ) - (hbar/2)(hbar/2) = λ² - (hbar/2)² = 0`\nThis gives the eigenvalues: `λ₁ = +hbar/2` and `λ₂ = -hbar/2`.\n\nNow we find the corresponding eigenvectors:\n\n*   **For λ₁ = +hbar/2:**\n    `(hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * [x, y]^T = (hbar/2) * [x, y]^T`\n    `[[y], [x]] = [[x], [y]]`\n    This implies `x = y`. The unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, 1]^T`. Normalizing it gives the eigenvector:\n    `|v₁> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 1]^T = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> + |down>)`\n\n*   **For λ₂ = -hbar/2:**\n    `(hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * [x, y]^T = (-hbar/2) * [x, y]^T`\n    `[[y], [x]] = [[-x], [-y]]`\n    This implies `y = -x`. The unnormalized eigenvector is `[1, -1]^T`. Normalizing it gives the eigenvector:\n    `|v₂> = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, -1]^T = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> - |down>)`\n\n### 3. Calculate the Probabilities\n\nThe probability of measuring the system in an eigenstate `|v_i>` is given by `P(λ_i) = |<v_i|alpha>|²`.\n\n*   **Probability for λ₁ = +hbar/2:**\n    `P(λ₁) = |<v₁|alpha>|²`\n    `<v₁|alpha> = [(1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| + <down|)] ⋅ [(1/sqrt(7)) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n    `<v₁|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [(1+i) + (2-i)] = 3/sqrt(14)`\n    `P(λ₁) = |3/sqrt(14)|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.6428`\n\n*   **Probability for λ₂ = -hbar/2:**\n    `P(λ₂) = |<v₂|alpha>|²`\n    `<v₂|alpha> = [(1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| - <down|)] ⋅ [(1/sqrt(7)) * ((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n    `<v₂|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [(1+i) - (2-i)] = (1/sqrt(14)) * (-1 + 2i)`\n    `P(λ₂) = |(-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)|² = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = (1+4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571`\n\nThe probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of A are approximately **0.64** and **0.36**.\n\n### 4. Find the Average Value of the Operator A\n\nThe average (or expectation) value of the operator A is given by `<A> = Σ P(λ_i) * λ_i`.\n`<A> = P(λ₁)λ₁ + P(λ₂)λ₂`\n`<A> = (9/14) * (hbar/2) + (5/14) * (-hbar/2)`\n`<A> = (hbar/2) * (9/14 - 5/14) = (hbar/2) * (4/14) = (hbar/2) * (2/7)`\n`<A> = hbar/7`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value is `hbar/7`. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
