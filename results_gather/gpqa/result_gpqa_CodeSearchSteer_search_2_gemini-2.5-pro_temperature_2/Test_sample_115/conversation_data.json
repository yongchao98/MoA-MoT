    "Here is a step-by-step identification of the compounds:\n\n**1. Identification of Compound A**\n\n*   The proton NMR (¹H NMR) spectrum of Compound A shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6 protons (6H) and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4 protons (4H).\n*   A 6H triplet is characteristic of two equivalent methyl groups (-CH₃), each adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂).\n*   A 4H quartet is characteristic of two equivalent methylene groups (-CH₂), each adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   These signals indicate the presence of two equivalent ethyl groups (CH₃-CH₂-).\n*   The simplest alkane containing two equivalent ethyl groups is n-butane (CH₃CH₂CH₂CH₃). While the signal for the internal -CH₂- groups is technically a complex multiplet due to coupling with protons on both sides, it is often simplified in introductory problems as a quartet, split only by the adjacent methyl group. Therefore, Compound A is n-butane.\n\n**2. Formation of Compound B**\n\n*   Compound A (n-butane) undergoes monobromination to form Compound B. The bromination of an alkane is a free-radical substitution.\n*   Bromine can substitute a hydrogen on either carbon 1 or carbon 2 of n-butane. Substitution at carbon 2 is statistically and electronically favored, leading to 2-bromobutane as the major product. Thus, Compound B is 2-bromobutane.\n\n**3. Formation of Compound C**\n\n*   Compound B (2-bromobutane) reacts with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH). This is a classic dehydrohalogenation reaction (E2 elimination).\n*   The elimination of HBr from 2-bromobutane can produce but-1-ene (Hofmann product) and but-2-ene (Zaitsev product). But-2-ene is the major product and can exist as two geometrical isomers: *cis*-but-2-ene and *trans*-but-2-ene.\n*   The problem states that Compound C has two geometrical isomers, which corresponds to the cis and trans isomers of but-2-ene. The reaction will proceed using the *cis*-isomer of Compound C.\n\n**4. Formation of Compound D**\n\n*   The *cis*-isomer of Compound C (*cis*-but-2-ene) is the dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction.\n*   The diene is (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol.\n*   The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition to form a six-membered ring, which will be a trimethylcyclohexenol.\n\n**Stereochemistry of the Diels-Alder Reaction:**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** Since the reaction starts with *cis*-but-2-ene, the two methyl groups (which will be at positions C5 and C6 of the product ring) must be *cis* to each other in the final product.\n*   **Diene:** The (1E,3E) geometry of the diene means that its terminal substituents (the -OH at C1 and the -CH₃ at C4) will be *trans* to each other in the product.\n*   **Pathway (Exo vs. Endo):** The Diels-Alder reaction can proceed through an *endo* or *exo* transition state. The *endo* product is often the kinetic favorite, but the *exo* product is more thermodynamically stable and can be favored when there is significant steric hindrance. In this case, analysis of the final product's stereochemistry reveals an *exo* addition took place.\n    *   In the *exo* pathway, the methyl group at C4 of the diene ends up *cis* to the methyl group at the adjacent C5 from the dienophile.\n*   **Summary of relative stereochemistry for the exo product:**\n    1.  The methyl groups at C5 and C6 are **cis**.\n    2.  The methyl group at C4 and the methyl group at C5 are **cis**.\n\n**Analyzing the Options:**\n\nWe use the rule that for adjacent chiral centers on a ring, (R,S) or (S,R) configurations indicate a *cis* relationship, while (R,R) or (S,S) indicate a *trans* relationship.\n\n*   A) (1S,4R)-4,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol: Incorrect substitution pattern.\n*   B) (1S,4R,5S,6S)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol: The methyl groups at C5 (S) and C6 (S) are *trans*. This contradicts the use of a *cis*-dienophile.\n*   C) (1S,4S)-4,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol: Incorrect substitution pattern.\n*   D) (1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol:\n    *   Methyls at C5 (S) and C6 (R) are **cis**. This matches our requirement.\n    *   Methyl at C4 (R) and methyl at C5 (S) are **cis**. This matches the *exo* pathway.\n\nTherefore, Compound D is (1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol.\n\n<<<D>>>"
