    "The problem involves determining the probability of a specific outcome when measuring the individual orbital angular momentum components of a two-electron system that is in a coupled angular momentum state.\n\n**1. Understand the initial state:**\nThe system of two electrons is in a coupled state described by the quantum numbers $|l, m\\> = |2, -1\\>$. Here, `l = 2` is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, and `m = -1` is the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum.\n\n**2. Understand the measurement and desired outcome:**\nA measurement of the z-components of the individual electron orbital angular momenta, `L_1z` and `L_2z`, is performed. We want to find the joint probability of obtaining the eigenvalue of `-ħ` for *both* `L_1z` and `L_2z`. An eigenvalue of `-ħ` corresponds to the magnetic quantum number `m` being -1. Therefore, we are looking for the probability of finding the first electron in the state `m_1 = -1` and the second electron in the state `m_2 = -1`.\n\n**3. Apply the rules of angular momentum addition:**\nIn quantum mechanics, when angular momenta are combined, the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the z-components of the individual angular momenta. This is expressed as `m = m_1 + m_2`.\n\n**4. Analyze the quantum numbers:**\n*   The initial state has a total magnetic quantum number `m = -1`.\n*   The desired final state has individual magnetic quantum numbers `m_1 = -1` and `m_2 = -1`.\n\nFor this outcome to be possible, the sum of the individual `m` values must equal the total `m` value of the system.\nLet's calculate the sum for the desired outcome: `m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2`.\n\n**5. Compare the initial and final states:**\nThe total `m` quantum number of the initial state is `m = -1`. The total `m` quantum number required for the desired outcome is `m_1 + m_2 = -2`.\n\nSince `-1 ≠ -2`, there is a contradiction. The law of conservation of the z-component of angular momentum dictates that a measurement cannot find the system in a state where the sum of individual `m` values does not equal the initial total `m` value.\n\n**6. Conclusion on Probability:**\nThe probability of measuring an outcome is given by the square of the amplitude of the corresponding state in the initial state's superposition. The coupled state `|l=2, m=-1>` can be expressed as a linear combination of the uncoupled states `|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2>`. However, it is only a combination of states for which `m_1 + m_2 = -1`. The state `|m_1=-1, m_2=-1>` is not part of this combination because its `m` value (`-2`) is different.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient for the state `|m_1=-1, m_2=-1>` in the expansion of `|l=2, m=-1>` is zero. The probability, which is the square of this coefficient, is also zero.\n\n<<<D>>>"
