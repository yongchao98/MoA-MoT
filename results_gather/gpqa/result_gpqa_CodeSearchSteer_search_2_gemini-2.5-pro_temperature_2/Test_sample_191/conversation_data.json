    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the situation based on the principles of electrostatics:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction in the Cavity**: The positive charge `+q` placed inside the cavity will attract the free electrons within the conductor. These electrons will accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity. By Gauss's Law, a total charge of `-q` will be induced on the inner surface of the cavity. This is because the electric field inside the material of a conductor must be zero in electrostatic equilibrium.\n\n2.  **Charge on the Outer Surface**: The spherical conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface of the cavity, a charge of `+q` is left behind on the outer surface of the spherical conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality.\n\n3.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface**: The crucial concept here is electrostatic shielding (also known as the Faraday cage effect). The conductor's material isolates the outer surface from the electric influences of the charges inside the cavity. As a result, the `+q` charge on the outer surface will distribute itself uniformly, as if the charges inside the cavity did not exist. The spherical symmetry of the outer surface ensures this uniform distribution.\n\n4.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: For any point outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution, the electric field is identical to that of a single point charge located at the center of the sphere, with a charge equal to the total charge on the sphere's surface. In this case, the total charge on the outer surface is `+q`.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P**: The point P is at a distance `L` from the center of the spherical conductor. Therefore, the electric field at P is determined solely by the uniformly distributed `+q` charge on the outer surface. It is calculated as if a point charge `+q` were located at the conductor's center.\n\nThe formula for the electric field from a point charge is:\n\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{\\text{charge}}{{\\text{distance}}^2}$\n\nSubstituting the values from the problem:\n\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe other information provided, such as the cavity's radius `r`, its distance from the center `s`, the distance `l`, and the angle `Î¸`, is irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor due to electrostatic shielding.\n\nComparing this result with the given options, the correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
