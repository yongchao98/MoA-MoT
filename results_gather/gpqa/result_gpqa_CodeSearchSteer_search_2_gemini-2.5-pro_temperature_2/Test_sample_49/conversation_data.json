    "To determine the number of loops in the Feynman diagram, we need to analyze the provided mathematical expression. The crucial part of the expression for this purpose is the factor `1/(4pi)^6`.\n\nIn quantum field theory, calculations for Feynman diagrams that contain loops involve integrating over the momenta of the particles within those loops. For a four-dimensional spacetime, each loop integration typically introduces a factor of `1/(4π)^2` into the final mathematical expression for the diagram's amplitude.\n\nLet L be the number of loops in the diagram. The general factor associated with L loops is `(1/(4π)^2)^L`, which simplifies to `1/(4π)^(2L)`.\n\nThe expression scribbled on your colleague's note is:\n`alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`\n\nBy comparing the general loop factor `1/(4π)^(2L)` with the factor `1/(4π)^6` present in the note, we can set up the following equation:\n\n`2L = 6`\n\nSolving for L, we get:\n\n`L = 3`\n\nThe other components of the expression relate to different aspects of the diagram:\n*   `alpha^3 * g^2` represents the coupling constants associated with the vertices of the diagram. The powers indicate the number and type of interaction points.\n*   `sqrt(2)` and `8` are numerical factors that arise from the specific symmetries and structure of the diagram.\n*   `(Q/M)^2` is a ratio of energy scales (or masses), which typically appears from the evaluation of the loop integrals.\n\nWhile these factors provide more detail about the specific physical process, the power of `4π` is the most direct indicator of the number of loops. Therefore, the Feynman diagram contained 3 loops.\n\n<<<B>>>"
