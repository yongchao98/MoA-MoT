    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct option:\n\n### Part A: Tautomerism\n\nTautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible isomers. For keto-enol tautomerism, the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group) is typically required.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone):** The structure of benzoquinone features a six-membered ring with two ketone (C=O) groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. Lacking an alpha-hydrogen, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha-carbons, and each is bonded to hydrogen atoms. The presence of these alpha-hydrogens allows the compound to undergo tautomerism. It can convert to its highly stable enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is aromatic. This equilibrium strongly favors the aromatic enol form.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\nA compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. A common feature of chiral molecules is the presence of a chiral center— a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** This molecule is the methyl ester of lactic acid. The second carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  A hydroxyl group (–OH)\n    2.  A hydrogen atom (–H)\n    3.  A methyl group (–CH₃)\n    4.  An ester group (–COOCH₃)\n    Since it possesses a chiral carbon, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and thus exhibits optical isomerism, existing as (R) and (S) enantiomers.\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which has a *trans* carbon-carbon double bond. Its structure is CH₃OOC–CH=CH–COOCH₃. The molecule is planar and does not contain any chiral centers. Therefore, it is achiral and does not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   (A) The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   (B) The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis combination matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
