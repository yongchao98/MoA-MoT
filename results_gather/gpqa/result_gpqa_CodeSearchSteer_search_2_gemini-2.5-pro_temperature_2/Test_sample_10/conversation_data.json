    "Here is an analysis of each statement:\n\n*   **Statement A:** Research indicates a linear correlation exists between the *in vitro* frameshifting rate and the number of conformations a pseudoknot can adopt. Specifically, optical tweezer experiments show that the frameshifting signals of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 adopt two conformations when under tension, which is consistent with their comparable frameshifting rates. Therefore, this statement is correct.\n\n*   **Statement B:** Programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) is a crucial mechanism in coronaviruses where the ribosome slips back by one nucleotide at a specific \"slippery site.\" This process is stimulated by a downstream RNA pseudoknot structure. It occurs at the overlap of Open Reading Frame 1a (ORF1a) and ORF1b, allowing for the translation of two different polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab. Studies have shown that the frameshifting pseudoknots of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are nearly identical in topology and conformation. Thus, this statement is also correct.\n\n*   **Statement C:** The SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14 complex functions as a heterodimer. The nsp14 protein has a 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN) domain that is responsible for proofreading, removing mismatched nucleotides during RNA synthesis to ensure replication fidelity. Nsp10 acts as a cofactor that binds to and significantly enhances the exonuclease activity of nsp14. This enzymatic activity involves the *hydrolysis* or *breakdown* of RNA, specifically excising mismatched nucleotides from both single-stranded and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). The statement that the complex *prevents* the breakdown of dsRNA is a direct contradiction of its known function as a proofreading exonuclease that actively degrades RNA to correct errors. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\n*   **Statement D:** The SARS-CoV-2 accessory protein ORF3a has been shown to induce apoptosis. Studies have found that ORF3a triggers the activation and cleavage of caspase-8. Caspase-8 activation is a hallmark of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. The same studies observed that the expression levels of Bcl-2, a key regulator of the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway, were not affected. This evidence supports the conclusion that ORF3a induces apoptosis primarily via the extrinsic pathway. Therefore, this statement is correct.\n\nThe incorrect statement is C because the nsp10/nsp14-ExoN complex causes the breakdown of RNA as part of its proofreading function, rather than preventing it.\n\n<<<C>>>"
