    "This is a chemistry calculation problem that does not require a Google search. Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n**1. Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\n\n*   Initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH):\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.02000 L = 0.001 mol\n*   Total volume after adding water:\n    *   Volume = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.04000 L\n*   New concentration of acetic acid:\n    *   Molarity = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.04000 L = 0.025 M\n\n**2. Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). This creates a buffer solution. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation can be used:\n\npH = pKa + log([CH₃COO⁻]/[CH₃COOH])\n\n*   First, find the pKa:\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   At 25% titration, the ratio of the conjugate base to the acid is:\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻]/[CH₃COOH] = 25% / (100% - 25%) = 25 / 75 = 1/3\n*   Now, calculate the pH:\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253\n    *   Rounding gives a pH of **4.26**.\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution contains only the conjugate base, which hydrolyzes water, making the solution basic.\n\n*   First, determine the total volume at the equivalence point. We need to find out how much NaOH was added.\n    *   Moles of NaOH = Moles of CH₃COOH = 0.001 mol\n    *   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n    *   Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n*   Next, calculate the concentration of the acetate ion ([CH₃COO⁻]):\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n*   The acetate ion reacts with water in a hydrolysis reaction:\n    *   CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n*   Calculate Kb for the acetate ion:\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰\n*   Use Kb to find the hydroxide concentration [OH⁻]:\n    *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    *   Assuming x is very small, we can simplify: x² ≈ 5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02 = 1.082 × 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 × 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 × 10⁻⁶ M\n*   Calculate the pOH and then the pH:\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48 = **8.52**\n\nThe calculated values are pH ≈ 4.26 at 25% titration and pH ≈ 8.52 at the equivalence point.\n\n<<<A>>>"
