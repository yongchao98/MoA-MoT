  "question": "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

    "By analyzing the provided DNA sequence, the reason for the failed protein expression becomes clear.\n\nFirst, the sequence can be broken down into codons (three-base units) starting from the `ATG` start codon:\n\n*   **`ATG`**: This is the start codon, coding for Methionine (Met).\n*   **`TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC`**: This sequence codes for the amino acids YPYDVPDYA, which is the correct sequence for the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag. This eliminates option B, as there is no missense mutation in the tag.\n*   **`AAA`**: This codon is immediately after the HA-tag sequence and codes for the amino acid Lysine (Lys). This would be the first amino acid of the GADD45G protein.\n*   **`TGA`**: This codon immediately follows `AAA`. In the standard genetic code, `TGA` is a stop codon, along with `TAA` and `TAG`.\n\nThe presence of this premature `TGA` stop codon means that when the ribosome translates the messenger RNA produced from this construct, it will build a short peptide (Met-HA-tag-Lys) and then immediately terminate the process. The full-length GADD45G protein will not be synthesized.\n\nThis directly supports option D. The other options are incorrect:\n*   A) The issue is a `TGA` codon, not `UAA` (or `TAA` in DNA). Furthermore, tRNAs do not exist for stop codons; they are recognized by release factors that terminate translation.\n*   B) As established, the antigenic determinant (HA-tag) sequence is correct.\n*   C) While linkers can be important, their absence does not typically cause a complete failure of expression. A more fundamental issue like a premature stop codon is a more direct cause for the observed problem.\n\n<<<D>>>"
