    "Here's a step-by-step identification of the final product:\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Structure of Compound X from IR and NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's analyze the provided spectroscopic data to identify the starting material, Compound X.\n\n*   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The broad band at **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n    *   The strong absorption at **1720 cm⁻¹** is indicative of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹** suggest the presence of C=C stretching from an aromatic ring.\n\n    This data strongly suggests that Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This broad singlet in the downfield region is a classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets, each integrating to two protons, indicate a *para*-substituted benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the signal at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n    *   **Side-chain analysis (2.9 ppm, 1.7 ppm, 1.4 ppm, 0.9 ppm):** These signals describe the alkyl substituent.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to a methylene group (-CH₂) situated between two different groups, likely the methyl group (from 0.9 ppm) and a methine group (from 2.9 ppm).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (a methine group, -CH-).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton, located at the benzylic position, is consistent with a methine group (-CH-) attached to the benzene ring, a methyl group, and a methylene group.\n\n    Assembling these pieces, the alkyl group is **sec-butyl**: `-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)`. The proton of the CH group is the signal at 2.9 ppm, the CH₃ protons are at 1.4 ppm, the CH₂ protons are at 1.7 ppm, and the terminal CH₃ protons are at 0.9 ppm.\n\nCombining the aromatic carboxylic acid and the *para*-sec-butyl substituent, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option C.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Product of the Reaction**\n\nCompound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) is treated with red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n\n*   This combination of reagents is a powerful reducing agent used for the complete reduction of several functional groups, including carboxylic acids.\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced all the way to a methyl group (-CH₃). The general reaction is R-COOH + 6HI → R-CH₃ + 3I₂ + 2H₂O. The red phosphorus is used to regenerate HI from the iodine (I₂) produced during the reaction, allowing the use of catalytic amounts of HI.\n*   The aromatic ring and the sec-butyl side chain are stable under these conditions and will not be altered.\n\nTherefore, the reaction converts the carboxyl group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid into a methyl group, while the rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n\nThe final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n### **Step 3: Match the Product with the Given Options**\n\n*   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure.\n*   B) **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene** - This matches the predicted product.\n*   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material (Compound X).\n*   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - The alkyl group is incorrect; it should be sec-butyl, not isobutyl.\n\nThe final product is correctly identified as 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
