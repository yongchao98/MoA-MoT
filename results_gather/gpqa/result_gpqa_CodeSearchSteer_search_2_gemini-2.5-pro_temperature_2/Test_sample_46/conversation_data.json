    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU is calculated as `C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`. For this compound, it is `9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5`. A DoU of 5 typically indicates the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, such as a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### 2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct medium-to-strong bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a clear indicator of a primary amine (-NH2). These bands correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations, respectively.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. The frequency of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for an aromatic ester (a benzoate ester). Saturated esters appear at slightly higher frequencies (around 1735 cm⁻¹), while amides appear at lower frequencies (1650-1690 cm⁻¹).\n\n**Conclusion from IR:** The compound possesses a primary amine group (-NH2) and an aromatic ester group.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal represents three protons, and its triplet (t) multiplicity indicates it is adjacent to a -CH2- group. This is the characteristic signal for the methyl (-CH3) part of an ethyl group.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal corresponds to two protons, and its quartet (q) multiplicity means it is adjacent to a -CH3 group. This signal is for the methylene (-CH2-) part of an ethyl group. The downfield chemical shift (4.5 ppm) is indicative of the -CH2- being attached to an electron-withdrawing oxygen atom, specifically in an ester (-O-CH2-).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical for the -NH2 protons of an amine on an aromatic ring. Broadening occurs due to hydrogen bonding and quadrupole effects from the nitrogen atom.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm), each integrating to two protons, strongly suggests a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is ortho to the electron-donating amine (-NH2) group. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is ortho to the electron-withdrawing ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3) group.\n\n### 4. Evaluation of Potential Structures\n\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a benzamide, not an ester, so its C=O IR peak would be at a lower frequency. It is also meta-substituted, which would result in a more complex NMR splitting pattern in the aromatic region, not two doublets.\n*   **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR. It also contains a formyl proton (H-C=O) which would produce a unique singlet around 8-8.5 ppm in the NMR, which is not observed.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure is fully consistent with all the data.\n    *   **Formula:** C9H11NO2, correct.\n    *   **Functional Groups:** Contains a primary amine (-NH2) and an aromatic ethyl ester, matching the IR data.\n    *   **NMR:** It has an ethyl group which would give a triplet and quartet. It has a para-substituted ring with an electron-donating group (-NH2) and an electron-withdrawing group (-COOEt), which would produce two doublets in the aromatic region. It has amine protons that would show up as a broad singlet. All observed signals, chemical shifts, integrations, and multiplicities match perfectly with those expected for this compound, also known as Benzocaine.\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is a phenyl ester, not an ethyl ester. The C=O IR frequency would be higher (~1760 cm⁻¹). In the NMR, the quartet would be from a -CH2- group next to a carbonyl (~2.2-2.5 ppm), not an oxygen (~4.5 ppm).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of the IR and ¹H NMR data, the compound is identified as **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
