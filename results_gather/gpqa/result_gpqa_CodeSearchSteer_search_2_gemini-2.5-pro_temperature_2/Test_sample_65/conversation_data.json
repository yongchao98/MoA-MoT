    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is built upon fundamental principles of quantum field theory, which dictates the symmetries that all operators within the theory must respect.\n\nAt its core, the SMEFT is a local, unitary, and Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory. This foundational structure imposes several key symmetry requirements on the operators that can be included in the SMEFT Lagrangian.\n\n*   **Lorentz and Poincare Symmetry:** The operators in SMEFT are constructed to be invariant under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. This is a fundamental requirement for a theory that describes particle physics consistently across different inertial frames. Poincare symmetry extends Lorentz symmetry to include spacetime translations, and it is also a fundamental symmetry of the SMEFT framework.\n\n*   **CPT Symmetry:** The CPT theorem is a cornerstone of quantum field theory, stating that any local, unitary, and Lorentz-invariant theory must be symmetric under the combined operations of Charge Conjugation (C), Parity (P), and Time Reversal (T). Since SMEFT adheres to these principles, all of its operators must respect CPT symmetry.\n\n*   **CP Symmetry:** Unlike CPT symmetry, CP symmetry is known to be violated in the Standard Model, for instance, in the weak interactions. The SMEFT framework not only incorporates the Standard Model's source of CP violation but can also introduce new, higher-dimensional operators that are CP-odd. This allows for the exploration of additional sources of CP violation beyond the Standard Model. Therefore, not all operators in the SMEFT are required to respect CP symmetry.\n\nBased on these principles, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\n<<<D>>>"
