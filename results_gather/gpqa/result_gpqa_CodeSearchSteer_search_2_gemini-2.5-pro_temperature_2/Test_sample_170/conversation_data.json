    "To arrange the given substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic substitution reaction with bromine, we must analyze the directing effects and activating/deactivating nature of each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\nFirst, the substituents are classified based on their directing effects:\n\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position, resulting in a very low yield of the para-isomer. The substances with these groups are:\n    *   **4) C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene):** The nitro group (-NO2) is a very strong deactivating, meta-directing group. Bromination of nitrobenzene yields almost exclusively the meta-isomer, with the para-isomer forming in only trace amounts (less than 1%).\n    *   **6) C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is a deactivating, meta-directing group. While it primarily yields the meta product, the para-isomer is formed in a small but measurable amount (around 3%).\n    *   **2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate):** The ester group (-COOC2H5) is also a deactivating, meta-directing group, similar in effect to the carboxylic acid group. For the related methyl benzoate, the para yield is about 5%. We can expect a similar result for ethyl benzoate. The deactivating strength follows the order -NO2 > -COOH > -COOR, which means the para yield will be inversely related to this trend.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The distribution between these two positions depends on steric and electronic factors.\n    *   **1) ะก6H5-CH3 (Toluene):** The methyl group (-CH3) is an activating, ortho, para-directing group. For the bromination of toluene, the yield of the para-isomer is significant, around 67%.\n    *   **5) C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is also an activating, ortho, para-directing group. Due to its larger size compared to the methyl group, there is greater steric hindrance at the ortho positions, which favors the formation of the para-isomer. The bromination of ethylbenzene yields about 62% of the para isomer. Some sources suggest an even higher para yield than for toluene due to the steric bulk. As the alkyl group size increases, the proportion of the para-isomer generally increases.\n    *   **3) C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The chlorine atom (-Cl) is a deactivating but ortho, para-directing group. The strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect of chlorine deactivates the ortho positions more significantly than the para position, leading to a very high yield of the para-isomer, typically around 87-90%.\n\nBased on these points, we can establish the order of increasing para-isomer yield:\n\n1.  **Nitrobenzene (4)** will have the lowest yield of the para-isomer (<1%).\n2.  **Benzoic acid (6)** will have a slightly higher but still very low yield (~3%).\n3.  **Ethyl benzoate (2)** will follow, with a para yield of around 5%.\n4.  **Toluene (1)** will have a much higher para yield of about 67%.\n5.  **Ethylbenzene (5)** will have a para yield that is typically cited as higher than that of toluene due to increased steric hindrance at the ortho position. However, some sources report values around 62-67%, similar to toluene. Given the general principle of sterics, we place it after toluene. Let's reconsider this based on specific bromination data that shows the ortho/para ratio for toluene as 33:67 and for ethylbenzene as 38:62. This indicates toluene gives slightly more para product. Let's reorder: 5 < 1.\n6.  **Chlorobenzene (3)** gives the highest proportion of the para-isomer (~87-90%).\n\nLet's refine the order with the contradictory data on Toluene vs Ethylbenzene.\nOrder so far: 4 < 6 < 2 < ...\nComparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):\n- Toluene (1): para ~67%\n- Ethylbenzene (5): para ~62%\nSo, the order seems to be 5 < 1.\nThis gives the sequence: 4 < 6 < 2 < 5 < 1 < 3.\n\nLet's recheck the options. None of them match this sequence. There is a common understanding that larger alkyl groups lead to more para product due to sterics. This would mean 1 < 5. Let's assume this widely taught principle holds precedence over specific conflicting data points which can vary with reaction conditions.\n\nLet's retry the order assuming para yield increases with the size of the alkyl group:\nOrder of o,p-directors: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\nCombining with the m-directors:\n**4 (-NO2) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC2H5) < 1 (-CH3) < 5 (-C2H5) < 3 (-Cl)**\n\nThis complete sequence corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
