    "The reaction of an epoxide with an organocuprate, such as lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), is a nucleophilic ring-opening reaction. Based on established principles of organic chemistry, two main rules govern the outcome of this specific reaction:\n\n1.  **Regioselectivity**: Organocuprates are soft nucleophiles and react under conditions that favor an S_N_2 (bimolecular nucleophilic substitution) mechanism. This means the nucleophile—in this case, a methyl group (Me⁻) from the cuprate—attacks the less sterically hindered carbon atom of the epoxide ring.\n2.  **Stereoselectivity**: The S_N_2 reaction proceeds via a \"backside attack,\" where the nucleophile approaches the carbon atom from the side opposite to the leaving group (the epoxide oxygen). This causes an inversion of the stereochemical configuration at the carbon atom that is attacked.\n\nFollowing these principles for the given reaction:\n\n*   **Starting Material**: (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring fused to an epoxide ring. The carbons of the epoxide are C1 and C6.\n*   **Analysis of Attack Site**:\n    *   Carbon C1 is substituted with a methyl group and is also bonded to C2 and C6, making it a highly substituted (quaternary) carbon.\n    *   Carbon C6 has no methyl substituent and is bonded to C1 and C5, making it a less substituted (tertiary) carbon.\n    *   According to the rule of regioselectivity, the incoming methyl nucleophile will attack the less hindered carbon, which is **C6**.\n*   **Analysis of Stereochemistry**:\n    *   The nucleophilic attack occurs at C6 with inversion of configuration. The original stereochemistry at C6 is given as (S). Therefore, in the product, the configuration at this carbon will become (R).\n    *   The configurations of the other chiral centers (C1, C3, and C4) are not directly involved in the reaction and are retained.\n    *   The reaction opens the epoxide ring, and upon workup, an alcohol (-OH) group forms at C1. A new methyl group is added to C6.\n*   **Determining the Product Structure**:\n    *   The product is a tetramethyl-substituted cyclohexanol. According to IUPAC naming conventions, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as C1 in the product.\n    *   The original C1 (with its R configuration) becomes the new C1.\n    *   The original C6 (which was S) is attacked, its configuration inverts to R, and it becomes the new C2.\n    *   The original C4 (R configuration) becomes the new C4.\n    *   The original C3 (R configuration) becomes the new C5.\n*   **Conclusion**: Combining these findings, the resulting product has the configuration (1R, 2R, 4R, 5R). The chemical name is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
