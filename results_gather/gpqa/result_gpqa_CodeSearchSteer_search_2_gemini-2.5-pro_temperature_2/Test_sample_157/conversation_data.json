    "A dominant-negative mutation occurs when a mutant protein interferes with the function of the wild-type protein. In this scenario, the transcription factor must form a dimer to be active. The mutation Y is in the dimerization domain. This allows the mutant subunit to form a dimer with a wild-type subunit. However, the resulting heterodimer is inactive because the mutant \"poisons\" the complex.\n\nThis sequestration of the wild-type protein into non-functional dimers leads to a loss-of-function phenotype because it effectively reduces the amount of active, functional wild-type protein. This is in contrast to a simple recessive mutation (like mutation X), where the remaining wild-type allele can still produce enough functional protein to maintain a normal phenotype. Dominant-negative mutations are often more severe than recessive loss-of-function mutations because they actively inhibit the function of the remaining wild-type allele.\n\nTherefore, the presence of the Y mutation leads to the inactivation of the wild-type protein it pairs with, causing a loss-of-function of the wild-type allele itself. While the formation of an aberrant dimer might lead to its degradation, the primary and most direct consequence described is the functional loss of the wild-type protein.\n\n*   **A) protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype:** While possible, protein aggregation is not the defining or most direct mechanism for this type of dominant-negative mutation.\n*   **B) loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype:** This is incorrect. The phenotype would be mutant, not wild-type. Also, if the mutant subunit couldn't dimerize at all, it wouldn't interfere with the wild-type subunits, which could still form functional dimers amongst themselves.\n*   **C) protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele:** This is the most accurate description. The mutant protein dimerizes with and inactivates the wild-type protein, causing a \"loss-of-function of the wild-type allele\". The abnormal heterodimer may then be targeted for degradation.\n*   **D) change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype:** This is incorrect. A dominant-negative mutation causes a loss-of-function, not a gain-of-function.\n\n<<<C>>>"
