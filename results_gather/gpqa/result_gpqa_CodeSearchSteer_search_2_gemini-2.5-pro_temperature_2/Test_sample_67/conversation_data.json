    "The analysis performed prior to the search is confirmed by the search results. The physical phenomenon described is known as Larmor precession. When a magnetic moment is exposed to a magnetic field, it precesses around the direction of the field. The frequency of this precession is called the Larmor frequency.\n\nThe theoretical steps undertaken align with standard quantum mechanical treatments of spin dynamics. These steps are:\n1.  Defining the initial state of the spin-1/2 particle. Initially, it is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction, which means it is in the \"spin up\" state with respect to the z-axis.\n2.  Describing the new Hamiltonian after the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction. The new Hamiltonian is `H = -γ * B * Sy`, where `Sy` is the spin operator for the y-component.\n3.  The time evolution of the initial state under this new Hamiltonian causes the expectation value of the z-component of the spin, `<Sz(t)>`, to oscillate.\n4.  This oscillation can be understood as the precession of the spin vector around the new magnetic field direction (the y-axis).\n\nThe frequency of this precession is the Larmor frequency, which is given by the formula `ω = γB`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `B` is the magnitude of the magnetic field. This result was derived using three different, yet consistent, methods:\n*   **Time evolution of the state vector:** Calculating `|ψ(t)⟩` and then finding the expectation value `<μz(t)>`.\n*   **Ehrenfest theorem:** Using the Heisenberg equation of motion for the expectation value `<Sz>`.\n*   **Energy-frequency relation:** Using the relation `ω = ΔE/ħ`, where `ΔE` is the energy difference between the new energy eigenstates that constitute the initial state.\n\nAll methods yield that the oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
