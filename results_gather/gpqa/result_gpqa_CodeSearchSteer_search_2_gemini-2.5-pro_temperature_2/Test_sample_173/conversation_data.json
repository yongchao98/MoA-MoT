    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Define the initial and final states:**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of rest mass `M` is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final State:** Two fragments with rest masses `m1` and `m2`. They are in motion, and their total kinetic energy comes from the conversion of mass.\n\n**2. Determine the rest masses of the fragments:**\n\nWe are given two conditions:\n*   One fragment is twice as massive as the other: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\nNow, we can solve this system of equations:\n*   Substitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the second equation: `(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n*   This simplifies to `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`, which gives `m2 = 0.33 * M`.\n*   Then, `m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`.\n\nLet's find their rest-mass energies:\n*   `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * M*c^2 = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`. This is the more massive fragment.\n*   `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * M*c^2 = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n**3. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value):**\n\nThe Q-value of the fission is the mass-energy that was converted into kinetic energy.\n*   `Q = (Initial Rest-Mass Energy) - (Final Rest-Mass Energy)`\n*   `Q = M*c^2 - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: `Q = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation:**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`, where `p` is momentum.\n*   Since the initial nucleus was at rest, by conservation of momentum, the fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let the magnitude of the momentum be `p`.\n*   `T1 = p^2 / (2*m1)`\n*   `T2 = p^2 / (2*m2)`\n*   The ratio of the kinetic energies is `T1 / T2 = m2 / m1`.\n*   Since `m1 = 2*m2`, we have `T1 / T2 = 1/2`, or `T2 = 2 * T1`.\n\nNow use the total kinetic energy:\n*   `T1 + T2 = Q`\n*   `T1 + 2*T1 = Q`\n*   `3 * T1 = Q`\n*   `T1_classical = Q / 3 = 3 GeV / 3 = 1 GeV`\n*   `T1_classical = 1000 MeV`.\n\n**5. Calculate the correct T1 using relativistic dynamics:**\n\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy `E`, momentum `p`, and rest mass `m` is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\nKinetic energy `T` is given by `E = T + m*c^2`.\n*   Rearranging the energy-momentum relation, we get `(p*c)^2 = E^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = (T + m*c^2)^2 - (m*c^2)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2`.\n*   Again, by conservation of momentum, `p1 = p2`, so `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n*   `T1^2 + 2*T1*m1*c^2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2*c^2`\n*   Substitute `T2 = Q - T1`:\n*   `T1^2 + 2*T1*m1*c^2 = (Q - T1)^2 + 2*(Q - T1)*m2*c^2`\n*   `T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)` (all energies in GeV)\n*   `T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n*   Cancel `T1^2` from both sides:\n*   `396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n*   `396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n*   `396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n*   `600*T1 = 603`\n*   `T1_correct = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n*   `T1_correct = 1005 MeV`.\n\n**6. Find the difference:**\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\n*   `ΔT1 = T1_correct - T1_classical`\n*   `ΔT1 = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThe difference is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>"
