    "To determine the correct statement, each claim made by the senior scientist must be evaluated based on established knowledge in industrial chemistry and catalysis. The goal is to produce a polymer with regular branches, like linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), using only ethylene. This requires a dual-catalyst system where one catalyst selectively oligomerizes ethylene into short α-olefins (e.g., 1-butene, 1-hexene), and a second catalyst copolymerizes these *in-situ* generated α-olefins with ethylene.\n\n**A) Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.**\nThe essential additional step is the selective oligomerization of ethylene to form α-olefins. Research and industrial practice show that this statement is incorrect. Chromium-based catalysts, which are standard for this reaction, are almost always activated by aluminum-based compounds such as methylaluminoxane (MAO) or modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO). These activators are crucial for generating the active catalytic species. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n**B) Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.**\nTandem catalysis, where oligomerization and polymerization occur in the same process, is a known industrial strategy. Phillips Petroleum Company (a US-based company) was the first to industrialize the selective trimerization of ethylene to 1-hexene in 2003. Furthermore, research literature describes an instance at an industrial plant where the *in-situ* generation of comonomers was discovered, leading to the development of specialized catalysts that perform both reactions. This indicates that technologies combining these steps are indeed used industrially. Therefore, this statement appears to be correct.\n\n**C) Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.**\nNoble metals like palladium can catalyze the oligomerization of ethylene to form short-chain α-olefins. However, noble metals (such as palladium, platinum, rhodium, etc.) are significantly more expensive than base metals like chromium. Their high cost is a well-known barrier that generally prevents their use in the large-scale production of commodity plastics like polyethylene, where cost-effectiveness is paramount. Therefore, this statement is factually correct.\n\n**D) One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.**\nGroup VIa (or Group 6) of the periodic table includes Chromium (Cr), Molybdenum (Mo), and Tungsten (W). Chromium-based catalyst systems are the cornerstone of modern industrial processes for the selective oligomerization of ethylene into 1-hexene and 1-octene. The development of these catalysts, particularly those based on chromium with specific ligands and activators, was a major breakthrough that enabled the efficient production of LLDPE from a single ethylene feedstock. Therefore, this statement is correct and central to the described technology.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nUpon analysis, statements B, C, and D all appear to be factually correct. However, Statement D describes the fundamental chemical principle that is most critical and specific to the industrial solution for the scientist's problem. The use of Group VIa metals, specifically chromium, is the key enabling technology for the selective oligomerization step. While statements B (commercial status) and C (a costly alternative) are also true, Statement D addresses the core identity of the standard, practical catalyst used for the essential reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
