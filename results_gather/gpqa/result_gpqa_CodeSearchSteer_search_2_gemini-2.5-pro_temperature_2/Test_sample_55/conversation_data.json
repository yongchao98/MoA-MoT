    "The transition of a hydrogen atom from the |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> ground state via two sequential dipole transitions is governed by the electric dipole selection rules. This problem explores the specific pathways and their probabilities.\n\nThe decay process can be broken down into two steps:\n\n**Step 1: Transition from |3,0,0> to an intermediate state**\n\n*   **Initial State:** |n=3, l=0, m=0>, which is the 3s state.\n*   **Selection Rules:** For an electric dipole transition, the orbital angular momentum quantum number *l* must change by ±1 (Δl = ±1), and the magnetic quantum number *m* must change by 0 or ±1 (Δm = 0, ±1).\n*   Since the initial state has l=0, the intermediate state must have l=1 (a 'p' orbital) to satisfy Δl = +1. The principal quantum number *n* must decrease. The most probable transition is to n=2.\n*   Thus, the intermediate states must be of the form |2,1,m'>.\n*   The possible values for m' are determined by Δm = m' - m = m' - 0 = m'. Since Δm can be 0, +1, or -1, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>.\n\n**Step 2: Transition from the intermediate state to |1,0,0>**\n\n*   **Intermediate State:** |2,1,m'>\n*   **Final State:** |1,0,0> (the 1s state)\n*   This transition must also obey the selection rules. The change in *l* is Δl = 0 - 1 = -1, which is allowed. The change in *m* will be Δm = 0 - m', which is also allowed for m' = -1, 0, or 1.\n*   The |2,1,m'> states (the 2p sublevels) can only decay to the |1,0,0> state, as it is the only available lower energy state that satisfies the selection rules. Therefore, the probability of this second step is 100% for any of the allowed intermediate states.\n\n**Calculating the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific decay route. This refers to the branching ratio for that path.\n\n1.  The initial state |3,0,0> is spherically symmetric. In the absence of an external field, there is no preferred direction in space.\n2.  Consequently, the probability of transitioning from the spherically symmetric |3,0,0> state to any of the three degenerate |2,1,m'> sublevels is equal.\n3.  There are three possible decay routes to the n=2 level: via |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, or |2,1,1>.\n4.  Since the probabilities are equal, the total probability is divided equally among them. Each path, therefore, has a probability of 1/3.\n5.  The total probability for a specific route is the product of the probabilities of each step. For the route |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>, the calculation is:\n    *   Probability (Step 1: |3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) = 1/3\n    *   Probability (Step 2: |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>) = 1\n    *   Total Probability = (1/3) * 1 = 1/3\n\nComparing this result with the given options, the correct choice is the one that identifies the transition route through |2,1,0> with a probability of 1/3.\n\nThe correct statement is:\n$$ |3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{1}{3} $$\n\n<<<C>>>"
