    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum\n\n*   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration found in a carboxylic acid. The significant broadness is due to hydrogen bonding, which is particularly strong in the dimeric form of carboxylic acids. This absorption often overlaps the C-H stretching region.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. Specifically, carboxylic acid carbonyls absorb strongly in the 1690-1760 cm⁻¹ range.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The data strongly suggest the compound is a carboxylic acid that also contains an alkene (a carbon-carbon double bond). A carboxylic acid contains two oxygen atoms.\n\n### 2. Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbon atoms of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the NMR spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene group, supporting the FTIR data. Vinyl protons typically resonate in the 4.5-6.5 ppm region of the spectrum.\n\n**Conclusion from 1H NMR:** The compound contains a C=C double bond.\n\n### 3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids, corresponding to the mass of the [COOH]⁺ fragment (mass of C=12, O=16, H=1; 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45). While other fragments can have this mass, its presence in combination with the strong FTIR evidence for a carboxylic acid is conclusive.\n\n**Conclusion from Mass Spec:** The compound is a carboxylic acid.\n\n### 4. Determination of the Chemical Formula\n\nTo tie all the evidence together, let's determine the degree of unsaturation (DoU) for the proposed structure. The DoU represents the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule.\n\n*   The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) accounts for **one degree of unsaturation**.\n*   The presence of an alkene (C=C) accounts for **one degree of unsaturation**.\n*   Therefore, the unknown compound must have a total of **two degrees of unsaturation**.\n\nNow, let's calculate the DoU for each of the possible chemical formulas:\nThe formula for the Degree of Unsaturation is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n\n*   **A) C6H10O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This formula has the correct DoU but only one oxygen atom, which contradicts the evidence for a carboxylic acid.\n*   **B) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This formula has two degrees of unsaturation and contains two oxygen atoms. This is perfectly consistent with a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid group and an alkene group.\n*   **C) C6H12O:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This formula has an incorrect DoU.\n*   **D) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This could represent a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), but it lacks the second degree of unsaturation required for the alkene group confirmed by FTIR and NMR.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe combined spectroscopic evidence points unambiguously to a molecule that is an unsaturated carboxylic acid with the chemical formula C6H10O2. This is the only option that accounts for the very broad O-H stretch, the two distinct C=O and C=C stretches in the FTIR, the presence of vinyl hydrogens in the 1H NMR, the [COOH]⁺ fragment in the mass spectrum, and the required two degrees of unsaturation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
