    "The energy eigenvalues of a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by the formula:\nE_n = (n + 3/2)ħω.\n\nHere, n is the principal quantum number, which can be expressed as the sum of the quantum numbers for each of the three dimensions (n = n_x + n_y + n_z), where n_x, n_y, and n_z are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...).\n\nThe different energy states are determined as follows:\n*   **Ground state:** n = 0. The energy is E_0 = (0 + 3/2)ħω = (3/2)ħω.\n*   **First excited state:** n = 1. The energy is E_1 = (1 + 3/2)ħω = (5/2)ħω.\n*   **Second excited state:** n = 2. The energy is E_2 = (2 + 3/2)ħω = (7/2)ħω.\n*   **Third excited state:** n = 3. The energy is E_3 = (3 + 3/2)ħω = (9/2)ħω.\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level is the number of distinct quantum states (i.e., different combinations of n_x, n_y, and n_z) that correspond to the same energy eigenvalue. For a given principal quantum number n, the degeneracy g_n is given by the formula:\ng_n = (n + 1)(n + 2) / 2.\n\nFor the third excited state, we have n = 3. Plugging this into the degeneracy formula:\ng_3 = (3 + 1)(3 + 2) / 2\ng_3 = (4)(5) / 2\ng_3 = 20 / 2\ng_3 = 10.\n\nThus, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for the energy E = (9/2)ħω.\n\nThe possible combinations of (n_x, n_y, n_z) that sum to n=3 are:\n*   One number is 3, and the others are 0: (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) - 3 states.\n*   One number is 2, one is 1, and one is 0: (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) - 6 states.\n*   All numbers are 1: (1,1,1) - 1 state.\n\nThe total number of combinations is 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the third excited state is (9/2)ħω, and its degeneracy is 10.\n\n<<<C>>>"
