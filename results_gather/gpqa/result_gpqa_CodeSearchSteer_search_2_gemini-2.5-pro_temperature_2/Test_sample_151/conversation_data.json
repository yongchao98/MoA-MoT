    "When yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* is treated with a mating pheromone, or a peptide that mimics it, the cells arrest their cell cycle in the G1 phase and form a mating projection called a shmoo. Your experiment is designed to identify the proteins present in *active chromatin* during this specific cellular state. Active chromatin, or euchromatin, is structurally open and associated with active gene transcription.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the protein complexes in question and their expected presence in the active chromatin of a shmoo:\n*   **A) Nucleosome histone complex:** Nucleosomes are the fundamental repeating units of all eukaryotic chromatin, consisting of DNA wrapped around histone proteins. Active chromatin is characterized by specific post-translational modifications on these histones (like acetylation), but the histone complexes themselves are ubiquitously present. Therefore, you would certainly expect to recover this complex.\n*   **C) Enhancer protein complex:** Enhancers are DNA regions that bind transcription factor proteins to significantly increase the transcription of specific genes. These complexes are hallmarks of active chromatin and are crucial for the high level of gene expression required for processes like shmoo formation. They would be abundant in your assay.\n*   **D) Pre-initiation complex (PIC):** The PIC is a large assembly of proteins, including RNA polymerase II and general transcription factors, that forms at the promoter of a gene to initiate transcription. Its presence is the very definition of a gene that is being actively transcribed, so it would be a key component recovered from active chromatin.\n*   **B) Pre-replication complex (PRC):** The PRC assembles on DNA at origins of replication during the late M and G1 phases of the cell cycle. Its purpose is to \"license\" the DNA for replication, which occurs in the subsequent S phase. Since the shmoo is arrested in G1, the PRC will be assembled and present on the chromatin. However, its function is for DNA replication, not transcription. While it is on the chromatin, it is functionally dormant because the cell is arrested and will not enter S phase to begin replication. Your assay targets the proteome of *active chromatin*, which is defined by transcriptional activity. Since the PRC is involved in a process (replication) that is licensed but not occurring, it is the least associated with the *functional* aspect of active chromatin compared to the other complexes, which are all directly involved in active transcription.\n\nTherefore, you would expect to observe the least amount of proteins from the pre-replication complex in your assay.\n\n<<<B>>>"
