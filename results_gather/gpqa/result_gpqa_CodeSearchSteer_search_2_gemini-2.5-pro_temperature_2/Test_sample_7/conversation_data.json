    "To determine the relationship between the genes G1, G2, and G3 based on the experimental data, we need to analyze the phenotypes of the single and double mutants.\n\n### Data Analysis:\n\n*   **Wild-Type (Control):** 100% resistance.\n*   **Single mutant g1:** 75% resistance. This shows G1 contributes to resistance, and its loss reduces resistance by 25%.\n*   **Single mutant g2:** 0% resistance. This shows G2 is absolutely essential for resistance. Its loss completely eliminates resistance.\n*   **Single mutant g3:** 50% resistance. This shows G3 also contributes to resistance, and its loss reduces resistance by 50%.\n\n### Analyzing Gene Interactions (Epistasis):\n\nEpistasis is a phenomenon where the effect of one gene is masked by the effect of another gene. We look at the phenotype of the double mutant and compare it to the phenotypes of the single mutants.\n\n1.  **g1 and g2 interaction:**\n    *   `g1` resistance = 75%\n    *   `g2` resistance = 0%\n    *   `g1g2` double mutant resistance = 0%\n    Since the `g1g2` double mutant has the same phenotype (0% resistance) as the `g2` single mutant, the `g2` mutation is **epistatic** to the `g1` mutation. This means G2's function is required for G1 to have any effect on resistance, suggesting G2 acts downstream of G1 or is a critical component of the main resistance pathway.\n\n2.  **g2 and g3 interaction:**\n    *   `g2` resistance = 0%\n    *   `g3` resistance = 50%\n    *   `g2g3` double mutant resistance = 0%\n    Similarly, the `g2g3` double mutant's phenotype (0% resistance) is identical to the `g2` single mutant's phenotype. Therefore, `g2` is also **epistatic** to `g3`.\n\n3.  **g1 and g3 interaction:**\n    *   `g1` resistance = 75%\n    *   `g3` resistance = 50%\n    *   `g1g3` double mutant resistance = 10%\n    The phenotype of the `g1g3` double mutant (10% resistance) is different from both the `g1` (75%) and `g3` (50%) single mutants. It shows a more severe loss of resistance than a simple additive effect of the individual mutations (expected additive resistance would be 100% - 25% - 50% = 25%). This is known as a **synergistic interaction**, where the combined effect of the two mutations is greater than the sum of their individual effects. It suggests that G1 and G3 likely function in parallel pathways that both contribute to overall resistance. There is no simple epistasis between G1 and G3.\n\n### Identifying the Transcription Factor:\n\nThe problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of other genes.\n*   G2 is essential for any resistance. Its knockout phenotype (0% resistance) masks the phenotypes of both `g1` and `g3`. This makes G2 a master regulator in the pathway. It is, therefore, the most likely candidate for the transcription factor that activates the entire resistance response.\n\n### Evaluating the Options:\n\n*   **A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1:**\n    *   \"G2 is epistatic towards G1\" is **correct**.\n    *   \"G1 is a transcription factor\" is unlikely, as G2 is the far better candidate.\n    *   \"G2 and G3 show pleiotropy\" (a single gene affecting multiple traits) is not supported by the experimental data, which only measures resistance.\n\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:**\n    *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\" is the **strongest conclusion** from our analysis.\n    *   \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\" is a plausible, albeit imprecise, way to describe their synergistic interaction in parallel pathways. They both contribute to the same function, so in a broad sense, they have redundant roles.\n    *   \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" is **incorrect**. The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g1` phenotype (75%).\n\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:**\n    *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\" is **correct**.\n    *   \"G1 and G3 has the same promoter\" cannot be determined from this experiment.\n    *   \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\" is **incorrect**. The `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g3` phenotype (50%).\n\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:**\n    *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\" is **correct**.\n    *   \"G1 and G3 show pleiotropy\" is unsupported by the data.\n    *   \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" is **incorrect**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nAll the provided options contain at least one incorrect or unsupported statement. However, option A is the only one that contains a statement about epistasis that is verifiably correct based on the data (\"G2 is epistatic towards G1\"). Despite its other two statements being weak, the claim of epistasis is factually accurate. The other options (B, C, and D) make definitive claims about epistasis between G1 and G3 that are demonstrably false based on the provided numbers. Therefore, A is the most accurate choice among the flawed options.\n\n<<<A>>>"
