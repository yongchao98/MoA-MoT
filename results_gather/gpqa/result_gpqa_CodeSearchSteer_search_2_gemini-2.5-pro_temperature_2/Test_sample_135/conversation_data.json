    "To solve this problem, we need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the vector field **f**(r), where the magnitude of the field is given by f(r) = 1/r² and it points radially outward. The integral is taken over the volume of a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.\n\nThe vector field can be written as **f**(r) = (1/r²) **r̂**, where **r̂** is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\nThere are two primary methods to approach this integral: direct calculation of the divergence followed by volume integration, and using the Divergence Theorem.\n\n### Direct Calculation\nThe formula for the divergence of a vector field in spherical coordinates is:\n∇ ⋅ **f** = (1/r²) ∂(r² * fᵣ)/∂r\nGiven that the radial component fᵣ is 1/r², the divergence is:\n∇ ⋅ **f** = (1/r²) ∂(r² * (1/r²))/∂r = (1/r²) ∂(1)/∂r = 0.\n\nThis calculation suggests the divergence is zero. If this were true everywhere within the sphere, the volume integral would also be zero. However, this calculation is not valid at the origin (r = 0), where the field is singular (undefined). This singularity at the origin is crucial and means we cannot simply conclude the integral is zero. The divergence is zero everywhere *except* at the origin.\n\n### Divergence Theorem\nA more appropriate method for handling fields with singularities at the origin is the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem). This theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume V to the net flux of the field through the closed surface S that encloses V:\n\n∫[V] (∇ ⋅ **f**) dV = ∮[S] (**f** ⋅ d**S**)\n\nHere, S is the surface of the sphere of radius R.\n\n1.  **The vector field on the surface:** On the surface of the sphere, the radius r is constant and equal to R. So, the field is **f**(R) = (1/R²) **r̂**.\n2.  **The surface element vector:** The differential surface element d**S** on a sphere points in the radial direction, **r̂**, and has a magnitude of R² sin(θ) dθ dφ. So, d**S** = **r̂** R² sin(θ) dθ dφ.\n3.  **The dot product:** We calculate the dot product of the field and the surface element:\n    **f** ⋅ d**S** = [(1/R²) **r̂**] ⋅ [**r̂** R² sin(θ) dθ dφ]\n    Since **r̂** ⋅ **r̂** = 1, the dot product simplifies to:\n    **f** ⋅ d**S** = (1/R²) * (R²) sin(θ) dθ dφ = sin(θ) dθ dφ.\n4.  **The surface integral:** Now we integrate this result over the entire surface of the sphere. The angle θ ranges from 0 to π, and the angle φ ranges from 0 to 2π.\n    ∮[S] sin(θ) dθ dφ = ∫[from 0 to 2π] dφ * ∫[from 0 to π] sin(θ) dθ\n    The first integral is ∫[from 0 to 2π] dφ = [φ] from 0 to 2π = 2π.\n    The second integral is ∫[from 0 to π] sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)] from 0 to π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 2.\n    Multiplying the results gives:\n    2π * 2 = 4π.\n\nThe Divergence Theorem allows us to find the value of the volume integral by evaluating the flux through the surface, thereby correctly accounting for the \"source\" or singularity at the origin. The calculation shows that the integral is equal to 4π. This result is independent of the sphere's radius R, as long as the sphere encloses the origin.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 4π\nC) 1\nD) 4/3 π R\n\nThe correct answer is 4π.\n\n<<<B>>>"
