    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the relationship between the number of stars and distance:\n\n1.  **Relationship between Distance and Parallax**: Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (r).\n    *   `plx = 1/r`\n\n2.  **Relationship between Differentials**: We need to find how the interval of parallax, `d(plx)`, relates to the interval of distance, `dr`. We can find this by taking the derivative of the parallax with respect to distance.\n    *   `d(plx)/dr = -1/r²`\n    *   When considering the number of stars, we are interested in the magnitude of this change, so we take the absolute value: `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`, which gives `d(plx) = dr/r²`.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Stars**: The number of stars, dN, in a given small range of parallax must be the same as the number of stars in the corresponding range of distance.\n    *   `dN = N(plx) d(plx) = N(r) dr`\n    *   Here, `N(plx)` is the number density of stars per unit parallax, and `N(r)` is the number density per unit distance.\n\n4.  **Substitution**: We are given that the number of stars varies with parallax as `N(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵`. We can substitute the relationships from steps 1 and 2 into this equation.\n    *   `N(r) dr ∝ (1/plx⁵) d(plx)`\n    *   Substitute `plx = 1/r` and `d(plx) = dr/r²`:\n    *   `N(r) dr ∝ (1 / (1/r)⁵) * (dr/r²)`\n    *   `N(r) dr ∝ (r⁵) * (dr/r²)`\n    *   `N(r) dr ∝ r³ dr`\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: By simplifying the expression, we find that the number of stars per unit range of distance, `N(r)`, changes in proportion to the cube of the distance.\n    *   `N(r) ∝ r³`\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
