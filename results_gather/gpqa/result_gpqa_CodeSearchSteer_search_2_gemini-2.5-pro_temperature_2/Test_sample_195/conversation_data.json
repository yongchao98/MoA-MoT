    "Answering this question involves applying the principles of relativistic energy conservation.\n\n1.  **Define the System and States:**\n    We consider a 1-dimensional harmonic oscillator. The potential energy of the spring system is given by $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, where $k$ is the spring constant and $x$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position. The system's total energy includes its rest energy ($mc^2$), kinetic energy ($K$), and potential energy ($U$).\n\n2.  **Total Relativistic Energy:**\n    The total relativistic energy ($E_{total}$) of a particle is given by the sum of its kinetic energy and potential energy, plus its rest energy:\n    $E_{total} = K + U(x) + mc^2$\n    The relativistic kinetic energy is $K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    Therefore, the total energy is:\n    $E_{total} = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 + mc^2 = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Energy:**\n    The total energy of the isolated system must be conserved. We can evaluate the total energy at two specific points in the oscillator's motion:\n    *   **At maximum displacement (amplitude A):** The mass is momentarily at rest. So, its velocity $v = 0$, which means its Lorentz factor $\\gamma = 1$. The displacement is $x = A$.\n        $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    *   **At the equilibrium position (x = 0):** The mass has its maximum speed, $v = v_{max}$, and its Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$. The displacement is $x = 0$, so the potential energy is zero.\n        $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$.\n\n4.  **Solve for Maximum Speed ($v_{max}$):**\n    By the principle of conservation of energy, the total energy at both points must be equal:\n    $\\gamma_{max}mc^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n    Now, we solve this equation for $v_{max}$. First, solve for $\\gamma_{max}$ by dividing both sides by $mc^2$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    To isolate $v_{max}$, we first take the reciprocal of both sides:\n    $\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\n    Square both sides:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    Rearrange the equation to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\nThis expression matches option A. As a check, in the non-relativistic limit where $\\frac{kA^2}{mc^2}$ is very small, this formula correctly reduces to the classical result $v_{max} = \\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$.\n\n<<<A>>>"
