    "To estimate the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds so they can be detected by ground-based optical telescopes, we need to consider the wavelength range observable from the ground.\n\nThe light from background quasars is absorbed by neutral hydrogen at the Lyman-alpha wavelength, which is approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å). This wavelength is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. The Earth's atmosphere blocks most ultraviolet radiation. The \"optical window\" that allows light to reach ground-based telescopes starts at around 300 to 400 nanometers (nm). More specifically, the useful range for ground-based optical sensors starts around 300 nm (or 3000 Å).\n\nFor the absorbed Lyman-alpha line to be detectable, it must be redshifted from its original wavelength of 1216 Å to at least 3000 Å to pass through the atmosphere. The redshift (z) is calculated using the formula:\n\nz = (λ_observed / λ_emitted) - 1\n\nWhere:\n*   λ_observed is the wavelength measured by the telescope.\n*   λ_emitted is the wavelength at which the light was originally absorbed (1216 Å).\n\nTo find the lower limit for the redshift, we use the minimum observable wavelength:\n\nz_lower_limit = (3000 Å / 1216 Å) - 1\nz_lower_limit ≈ 2.467 - 1\nz_lower_limit ≈ 1.467\n\nRounding to the nearest of the given options, the value is approximately 1.5, however, if we consider a more conservative atmospheric cutoff, such as ~3650 Å (the approximate atmospheric cutoff due to ozone), the calculation would be:\n\nz = (3650 Å / 1216 Å) - 1\nz ≈ 3.0 - 1\nz ≈ 2.0\n\nLet's use a standard atmospheric cutoff for ground-based astronomy which is generally taken as ~3500 Angstroms.\n\n*   **Emitted Wavelength (λ_emitted):** 1216 Å\n*   **Minimum Observed Wavelength (λ_observed_min):** ~3500 Å (Atmospheric UV cutoff)\n\nNow, we calculate the redshift `z`:\n`z = (λ_observed_min / λ_emitted) - 1`\n`z = (3500 / 1216) - 1`\n`z ≈ 2.878 - 1`\n`z ≈ 1.878`\n\nThis value is very close to 1.9.\n\n<<<B>>>"
