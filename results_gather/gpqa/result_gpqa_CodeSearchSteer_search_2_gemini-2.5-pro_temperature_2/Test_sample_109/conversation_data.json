    "To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, we must consider two main factors: the star's position in the sky (declination) and its brightness (apparent magnitude).\n\n**1. Sky Visibility (Declination)**\n\n*   **Paranal Observatory (ESPRESSO):** Located in the Southern Hemisphere in Chile (Latitude ~-24°), it can observe the southern celestial pole and up to northern declinations of about +66°.\n*   **W. M. Keck Observatory (HIRES):** Located in the Northern Hemisphere in Hawaii (Latitude ~+20° N), it can observe the northern celestial pole and down to southern declinations of about -70°.\n*   **Conclusion:** For a star to be visible by both observatories, its declination must lie roughly between -70° and +66°.\n\n**2. Brightness (Apparent Magnitude)**\n\n*   **ESPRESSO Limit:** Can observe stars brighter than an apparent V magnitude of 17 (m_V < 17).\n*   **HIRES Limit:** Can observe stars brighter than an apparent V magnitude of 16 (m_V < 16). The exact limit depends on conditions, but 16 is a representative value for this problem.\n*   **Conclusion:** To be detected by both, a star must be brighter than the stricter limit, meaning its apparent magnitude must be less than 16.\n\n**Analysis of Each Star**\n\nThe apparent magnitude (m_V) is calculated from the absolute magnitude (M_V) and distance (d, in parsecs) using the formula:  \n*m_V = M_V + 5*log₁₀(d) - 5 + A_V*  \nwhere A_V is the interstellar absorption, calculated as 3.1 * E(B-V).\n\n*   **Star 1:**\n    *   **Declination:** -75°. This is too far south to be observed from Keck Observatory.\n    *   *Result: Not detectable by both.*\n\n*   **Star 2:**\n    *   **Declination:** +55°. Visible from both observatories.\n    *   **Apparent Magnitude:** Given as m_V = 16.5. This is fainter than the HIRES limit of 16.\n    *   *Result: Not detectable by both.*\n\n*   **Star 3:**\n    *   **Declination:** +48°. Visible from both observatories.\n    *   **Apparent Magnitude:** Given as m_V = 15.5. This value is brighter than the limit for both HIRES (15.5 < 16) and ESPRESSO (15.5 < 17). The other provided information (distance and E(B-V)) is considered extraneous.\n    *   *Result: Detectable by both.*\n\n*   **Star 4:**\n    *   **Declination:** -48°. Visible from both observatories.\n    *   **Apparent Magnitude Calculation:**\n        *   A_V = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag.\n        *   m_V = 15.5 + 5*log₁₀(10) - 5 + 1.24 = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = 16.74.\n        *   This is fainter than the HIRES limit of 16.\n    *   *Result: Not detectable by both.*\n\n*   **Star 5:**\n    *   **Declination:** +60°. Visible from both observatories.\n    *   **Apparent Magnitude Calculation:**\n        *   A_V = 0 (not specified).\n        *   m_V = 16.5 + 5*log₁₀(5) - 5 = 16.5 + 3.495 - 5 = 14.995.\n        *   This value is brighter than the limit for both HIRES (14.995 < 16) and ESPRESSO (14.995 < 17).\n    *   *Result: Detectable by both.*\n\nBased on the analysis, only Star 3 and Star 5 meet both the visibility and brightness criteria for both observatories.\n\n<<<C>>>"
