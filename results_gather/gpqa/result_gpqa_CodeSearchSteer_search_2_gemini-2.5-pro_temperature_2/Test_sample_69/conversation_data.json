    "This is a multi-step chemistry puzzle that can be solved by systematically identifying each substance.\n\n1.  **Identify gases B, D, and solvent H:**\n    *   The reaction `D(g) + B(g) -> H` in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent is a strong clue. A common reaction that fits this is the formation of 1,2-dichloroethane (`C₂H₄Cl₂`), a solvent, from ethene (`C₂H₄`) and chlorine (`Cl₂`).\n    *   Let's assume: `D = C₂H₄` (ethene) and `B = Cl₂` (chlorine). This means `H = C₂H₄Cl₂`.\n\n2.  **Identify substances A, C, F, and G:**\n    *   **Reaction with water**: The reaction `C + H₂O -> A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)` is key. Since `B` is `Cl₂`, product `C` must be a chloride of some substance `A`. The hydrolysis producing `HCl` (a strong acid) is expected. So, `F = HCl`.\n    *   The reaction must also reform the solid `A` and produce a weak acid `G`.\n    *   **Candidate C**: Let's test if `C` is sulfur dichloride (`SCl₂`), which is a cherry-red liquid. Its hydrolysis is known to produce hydrochloric acid, solid sulfur, and sulfur dioxide. The `SO₂` then dissolves in water to form sulfurous acid (`H₂SO₃`), a weak acid.\n    *   Hydrolysis Reaction: `2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → S(s) + SO₂ + 4HCl`.\n    *   This perfectly matches the description: `A = S` (sulfur, a solid), `F = HCl` (strong acid), and `G = H₂SO₃` (weak acid).\n\n3.  **Confirm the initial reaction (`A + 8B -> C`):**\n    *   With our assignments, this reaction is `S(s) + 8Cl₂(g) -> SCl₂(l)`.\n    *   Sulfur exists as `S₈` crowns. The chlorination of sulfur to sulfur dichloride can be represented as `S₈ + 8Cl₂ → 8SCl₂` (in a two-step process). If \"product C\" refers to the substance `SCl₂`, then the 1:8 molar ratio between the reactant `S₈` (A) and `Cl₂` (B) is correct.\n\n4.  **Identify the extremely hazardous product E:**\n    *   `E` is formed from `C + 2D -> E`.\n    *   Substituting our identified substances: `SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ -> E`.\n    *   This is the Levinstein process for producing bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide, commonly known as mustard gas (`S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`). Mustard gas is a notorious chemical warfare agent and is extremely hazardous due to its ability to form blisters and cause cancer.\n\n5.  **Determine the molecular symmetry group of E:**\n    *   `E` is mustard gas, `S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`.\n    *   The molecule consists of a central sulfur atom bonded to two chloroethyl groups. Due to the lone pairs on the sulfur atom, the molecule has a bent shape.\n    *   The overall molecule is not planar, nor is it linear. Because of the rotational freedom around the single bonds, it exists in several conformations. For a fixed, stable conformation, the molecule lacks planes of symmetry but possesses a twofold rotational axis (`C₂`) that passes through the sulfur atom. This makes the molecule chiral.\n    *   Therefore, the molecular symmetry point group for mustard gas is `C₂`.\n\nThe deductions are consistent across all the described reactions.\n\n*   **A**: Sulfur (`S₈`)\n*   **B**: Chlorine (`Cl₂`)\n*   **C**: Sulfur dichloride (`SCl₂`)\n*   **D**: Ethene (`C₂H₄`)\n*   **E**: Mustard gas (`S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂`)\n*   **F**: Hydrochloric acid (`HCl`)\n*   **G**: Sulfurous acid (`H₂SO₃`)\n*   **H**: 1,2-dichloroethane (`C₂H₄Cl₂`)\n\nThe molecular symmetry group of E (mustard gas) is `C₂`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
