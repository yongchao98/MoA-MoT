    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Equilibrium Temperature\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is the theoretical temperature it would have if it were a black body heated only by its parent star. It is determined by the star's properties and the planet's distance from the star. For a planet in a circular orbit, its equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance (a).\n\n***T_eq ∝ (1/a)¹ᐟ²***\n\nSince all the planets in this system orbit the same star, other factors like the star's temperature and radius are constant for all planets. The problem also specifies that the planets have the same albedo (the fraction of light they reflect).\n\n### 2. Kepler's Third Law\nKepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion states that the square of the orbital period (P) of a planet is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a).\n\n***P² ∝ a³***\n\nThis can be rearranged to express the semi-major axis in terms of the orbital period:\n\n***a ∝ P²ᐟ³***\n\n### 3. Combining the Formulas\nBy substituting the expression for the semi-major axis (a) from Kepler's Third Law into the equilibrium temperature relationship, we can find the relationship between equilibrium temperature and the orbital period:\n\n***T_eq ∝ (1 / P²ᐟ³)¹ᐟ²***\n***T_eq ∝ 1 / P¹ᐟ³*** or ***T_eq ∝ P⁻¹ᐟ³***\n\nThis shows that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is inversely proportional to the cube root of its orbital period.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Temperature Ratio\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 to Planet_2 (T_eq4 / T_eq2). Using the relationship derived above:\n\n***T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P₄)⁻¹ᐟ³ / (P₂)⁻¹ᐟ³ = (P₂ / P₄)¹ᐟ³***\n\nThe problem provides the ratio of the orbital periods for Planet_1 through Planet_5 as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n*   The period of Planet_2 (P₂) corresponds to the value 2 in the ratio.\n*   The period of Planet_4 (P₄) corresponds to the value 3.5 in the ratio.\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into our equation:\n\n***T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)¹ᐟ³***\n\n### 5. Final Calculation\nTo solve this, we can first simplify the fraction:\n\n***2 / 3.5 = 20 / 35 = 4 / 7***\n\nSo the ratio is:\n\n***(4 / 7)¹ᐟ³ ≈ (0.5714)¹ᐟ³ ≈ 0.8298***\n\nRounding this to two decimal places gives approximately 0.83. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
