    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the options to determine which exoplanet has the highest density:\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This describes Earth. The average density of Earth is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly given as about 5.5 g/cm³.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** For a planet with the same basic composition, a higher mass leads to greater gravitational compression of its materials. This self-compression results in a higher average density. Therefore, a rocky planet with 5 times the mass of Earth would be significantly denser than Earth. Its density would be substantially greater than 5.5 g/cm³.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** Conversely, a planet with a smaller mass than Earth would experience less gravitational compression. With the same composition, its materials would be less compacted, resulting in a lower average density than Earth's. Its density would be less than 5.5 g/cm³.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Density (a) is ~5.51 g/cm³.\n*   Density (b) is ~5.5 g/cm³.\n*   Density (c) is greater than 5.51 g/cm³.\n*   Density (d) is less than 5.51 g/cm³.\n\nBy comparing the four options, the planet that is 5 times more massive than Earth (c) will be the most compressed by its own gravity and will, therefore, have the highest density.\n\n<<<B>>>"
