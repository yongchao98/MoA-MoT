    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O) with heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents is used for the alpha-bromination of a carboxylic acid, a reaction similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The reaction replaces one of the alpha-hydrogens (hydrogens on the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group) with a bromine atom. In acetic acid, the alpha-carbon is the methyl group (CH3).\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material (Product 1):** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification, where a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester. The -OH of the carboxylic acid is replaced by the -OCH2CH3 group from ethanol.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3**\n\n*   **Starting Material (Product 2):** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-) is an excellent nucleophile and attacks the carbon atom bonded to the bromine, displacing the bromide ion (Br-), which is a good leaving group.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of the final Product 4**\n\n*   **Starting Material (Product 3):** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (BrCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a two-part process involving a double alkylation followed by cyclization.\n    1.  **First Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base. It removes one of the acidic protons from the CH2 group located between the electron-withdrawing cyano (-CN) and ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH2CH3) groups.\n        `NCCH2COOEt + NaH -> Na+[NCCH(-)COOEt] + H2`\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion (enolate) is a strong nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        `Na+[NCCH(-)COOEt] + Br(CH2)5Br -> NCCH(COOEt)-(CH2)5Br + NaBr`\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** The problem states that **excess** NaH is used. This implies a second deprotonation occurs at the remaining acidic alpha-hydrogen.\n        `NCCH(COOEt)-(CH2)5Br + NaH -> Na+[NCC(-)(COOEt)-(CH2)5Br] + H2`\n    4.  **Intramolecular Cyclization:** The molecule now contains both a nucleophilic carbanion and an electrophilic carbon (part of the C-Br bond) at the end of the pentyl chain. The carbanion attacks this carbon in an intramolecular SN2 reaction. This is a ring-closing reaction. The ring formed will contain the alpha-carbon plus the five carbons of the pentane chain, resulting in a 6-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane. This requires analyzing the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure of Product 4:** A cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry:** The C1 atom is attached to four groups: -CN, -COOEt, -CH2- (ring C2), and -CH2- (ring C6). Since the path from C1 through C2 around the ring is identical to the path from C1 through C6, C1 is not a chiral center. The molecule is achiral and possesses a plane of symmetry (Cs) that passes through C1, C4 (the opposite carbon in the ring), the cyano group, and the ester group.\n*   **Consequences of Symmetry:** This plane of symmetry makes pairs of carbons and their attached protons chemically equivalent:\n    *   The protons on C2 are equivalent to the protons on C6.\n    *   The protons on C3 are equivalent to the protons on C5.\n\n*   **Counting the Signals:**\n    1.  **H on C2 and C6:** The two protons on C2 (one axial, one equatorial in a chair conformation) are not equivalent to each other. They are diastereotopic because of their fixed, different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1. The same is true for C6. Since C2 and C6 are equivalent by symmetry, the two non-equivalent protons on C2 correspond to the two non-equivalent protons on C6. This results in **2 distinct signals**.\n    2.  **H on C3 and C5:** Similarly, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. The protons on the equivalent C5 carbon will give the same two signals. This gives another **2 distinct signals**.\n    3.  **H on C4:** C4 lies on the plane of symmetry. However, its two protons (axial and equatorial) are in different chemical environments relative to the rest of the molecule. They are diastereotopic and thus give **2 distinct signals**.\n    4.  **Ethyl group (-O-CH2-CH3):**\n        *   **-O-CH2- protons:** This methylene group is part of an achiral molecule and is not adjacent to a stereocenter. Therefore, its two protons are enantiotopic. In a standard achiral NMR solvent, enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent (isochronous) and give **1 signal** (which would be a quartet).\n        *   **-CH3 protons:** The three protons of the terminal methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. They give **1 signal** (which would be a triplet).\n\n*   **Total Signal Count:** Summing up all the distinct signals:\n    2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) + 2 (from C4) + 1 (from -OCH2-) + 1 (from -CH3) = **8 signals**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
