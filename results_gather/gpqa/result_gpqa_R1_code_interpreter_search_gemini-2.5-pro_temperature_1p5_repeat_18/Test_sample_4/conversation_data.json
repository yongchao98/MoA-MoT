    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Identify the Operators\n\nThe problem provides the components of the quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$:\n*   $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThese are the spin operators for a spin-1/2 particle, where $\\vec{P}$ is the spin angular momentum operator $\\vec{S}$. The matrices are the Pauli matrices, denoted as $\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$. So, $\\vec{P} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\vec{\\sigma}$.\n\n### 2. Define the Direction Vector\n\nThe problem states that the direction vector $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane. A general unit vector in 3D can be written in spherical coordinates as $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$.\nFor a vector to be in the x-z plane, its y-component must be zero. This means $\\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi = 0$, which implies $\\phi = 0$ or $\\phi = \\pi$.\nLet's choose $\\phi=0$. The unit vector $\\vec{n}$ is then:\n$\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$\nwhere $\\theta$ is the angle the vector $\\vec{n}$ makes with the positive z-axis.\n\n### 3. Construct the Operator Along Direction $\\vec{n}$\n\nThe operator representing the spin component along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n$P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\nSubstitute the components of $\\vec{P}$ and $\\vec{n}$:\n$P_n = \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x\\right) \\sin\\theta + \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y\\right) (0) + \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z\\right) \\cos\\theta$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (\\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta)$\nNow, substitute the matrix representations:\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right)$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n### 4. Solve the Eigenvalue Equation\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. Let the eigenvector be $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe eigenvalue equation is $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$:\n$\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nWe can cancel the factor $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ from both sides:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis matrix equation gives us a system of two linear equations:\n1.  $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n2.  $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\nFrom the first equation, we solve for the ratio $b/a$:\n$b \\sin\\theta = a - a \\cos\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\nNow, we use the trigonometric half-angle identities:\n*   $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n*   $\\sin\\theta = 2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $b/a$:\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\nSo, $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$. The eigenvector has the form:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} = a \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nTo simplify, we can multiply by a constant (since the overall scaling does not change the eigenvector's direction). Multiplying by $\\cos(\\theta/2)$ gives a more convenient unnormalized form:\n$|\\psi\\rangle_{unnormalized} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n### 5. Normalize the Eigenvector\n\nTo find the normalized eigenvector, we require its norm to be 1. The norm squared is $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$. For our unnormalized vector, the norm squared is:\n$(\\cos(\\theta/2))^2 + (\\sin(\\theta/2))^2 = \\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$\nThe vector is already normalized.\n\nThus, the normalized eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$ is:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe elements of this eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n### 6. Compare with Options\n\nLet's check the given options:\nA) (\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2)) - Incorrect. Eigenvectors (state vectors) are dimensionless and should not contain $\\hbar$.\nB) (\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar) - Incorrect for the same reason as A, and it also lacks the angular dependence.\nC) (\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta)) - Incorrect. The dependence is on $\\theta$, not $\\theta/2$.\nD) (\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2)) - This matches our calculated result.\n\nTherefore, the correct elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))$.\n\n<<<D>>>"
