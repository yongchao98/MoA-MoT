    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to get an initial idea of the structure.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    *   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond (likely a C=O group, accounting for the 5th degree).\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic signature for the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for an ester group (R-COO-R') that is conjugated with an aromatic ring. The conjugation lowers the frequency from the usual ~1735-1750 cm⁻¹ for a saturated ester.\n\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal corresponds to 3 protons (likely a -CH₃ group). The triplet multiplicity (t) indicates it is adjacent to a -CH₂ group (according to the n+1 rule, 2+1=3 peaks).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal corresponds to 2 protons (likely a -CH₂ group). The quartet multiplicity (q) indicates it is adjacent to a -CH₃ group (3+1=4 peaks). The high chemical shift (4.5 ppm) suggests the -CH₂ group is attached to a very electronegative atom, like the oxygen in an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n    *   Combining the signals at 1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm, we can identify an ethyl ester fragment: **-COO-CH₂CH₃**.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) for 2 protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). The protons can exchange with each other and the solvent, leading to a broadening of the signal and loss of observable coupling. This confirms the finding from the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets (d), each integrating to 2 protons, is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons at 8.0 ppm are significantly downfield, indicating they are adjacent to a strong electron-withdrawing group (the ester, -COOEt). The protons at 7.0 ppm are upfield relative to the other aromatic protons, indicating they are adjacent to an electron-donating group (the amine, -NH₂).\n\n*   **Putting it all together**\n    1.  We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  The two substituents are an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) and a primary amine group (-NH₂).\n    3.  This leads to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Checking the Alternatives**\n    *   A) **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches all data perfectly.\n    *   B) **3-ethoxybenzamide:** Is a primary amide (-CONH₂), not an ester. The C=O stretch would be at a lower frequency (~1680 cm⁻¹). The aromatic NMR pattern would be more complex than two doublets.\n    *   C) **N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Is a secondary amide (-NH-), which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR. The NMR would have a signal for a single NH proton and a very downfield formyl proton (-CHO) signal (~8.2 ppm).\n    *   D) **4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an ester of the type Ph-O-CO-R. The alkyl part is a propionyl group (-CO-CH₂CH₃). The NMR would show a quartet for the -CH₂- group around 2.2-2.6 ppm (next to a C=O), not 4.5 ppm (next to an oxygen). The data clearly shows an ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃), not a propionyl group.\n\nTherefore, the only structure that fits all the provided spectral data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
