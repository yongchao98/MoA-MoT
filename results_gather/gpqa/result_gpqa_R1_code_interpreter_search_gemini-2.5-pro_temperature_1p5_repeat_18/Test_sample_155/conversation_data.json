    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene, which is symmetrical and achiral. The structure is CH₃CH₂CH₂-CH=CH-CH₂CH₂CH₃.\n*   **Reagent 1: mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid).** This reagent performs epoxidation on the alkene. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to the same face of the double bond.\n    *   Since the starting alkene is *trans*, the resulting epoxide will also be *trans*. Specifically, the two propyl groups will be on opposite sides of the epoxide ring.\n    *   The starting alkene is achiral, and the epoxidation can occur from either the top face or the bottom face with equal probability. This process leads to the formation of a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n*   **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This reagent causes the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide to form a diol. The mechanism involves the nucleophile (water) attacking one of the epoxide carbons from the side opposite to the C-O bond. This is an *anti*-addition.\n    *   Let's consider the ring-opening of the (4R,5R)-epoxide. Attack at C4 inverts its configuration to S, leaving C5 as R. The product is (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. Attack at C5 inverts its configuration to S, leaving C4 as R. The product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The compounds (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol are actually the same molecule, which is a *meso* compound (it has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to internal symmetry).\n    *   If we start with the other enantiomer, (4S,5S)-epoxide, the same *meso*-diol is formed.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** The sole product is meso-octane-4,5-diol, an achiral molecule.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene, which is symmetrical and achiral.\n*   **Reagent 1: mCPBA.** The *syn*-addition of the oxygen atom to the *cis*-alkene results in a *cis*-epoxide.\n    *   This *cis*-epoxide (cis-4,5-epoxyoctane) has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a *meso* compound: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n*   **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** The acid-catalyzed *anti*-opening of the meso-epoxide ring occurs.\n    *   Attack at the C4 (R-center) by water leads to inversion of configuration, resulting in (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the C5 (S-center) by water leads to inversion of configuration, resulting in (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Since the starting epoxide is meso (achiral), attack at either carbon is equally probable.\n*   **Product of Reaction 2:** The products are (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol and (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. These two molecules are enantiomers. Since they are formed in equal amounts, the product is a racemic mixture.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  meso-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 1)\n2.  (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n3.  (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is as follows:\n*   (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol are a pair of **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity, size, etc.) which arise from their different structures.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated. They will elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   In our mixture, the meso-diol (diastereomer) will be separated from the enantiomeric pair. The two enantiomers ((4R,5R) and (4S,5S)) will co-elute.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **2 peaks**: one for the meso-diol and one for the racemic mixture.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase, creating a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   The interactions between the individual enantiomers and the chiral stationary phase are diastereomeric in nature, leading to different strengths of interaction and thus different retention times.\n    *   The chiral column will separate the meso-diol from the other two compounds (as they are diastereomers).\n    *   It will also separate the two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, from each other.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **3 peaks**: one for the meso-diol, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 2 peaks in the standard (achiral) HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<A>>>"
