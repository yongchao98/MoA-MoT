    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Model:** The problem describes a diatomic molecule (X-Y) using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The energy levels in this model are a combination of vibrational and rotational energy.\n\n2.  **Energy Level Formula:** The energy of a state defined by the vibrational quantum number `v` and the rotational quantum number `J` is given by:\n    `E(v, J) = E_vibrational + E_rotational = ħω(v + 1/2) + B*J(J+1)`\n\n    *   `v` = 0, 1, 2, ... (vibrational quantum number)\n    *   `J` = 0, 1, 2, ... (rotational quantum number)\n    *   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (`h / 2π ≈ 1.05457 * 10⁻³⁴ J·s`)\n    *   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration (given as `4 * 10¹⁴ rad/s`).\n    *   `B` is the rotational constant.\n\n3.  **Identify the Initial State:** The molecule is initially in its \"fundamental state,\" which means its ground state. The ground state corresponds to the lowest possible values for both quantum numbers, so `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\n    *   Initial Energy: `E_initial = E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + B*0(0+1) = (1/2)ħω`\n\n4.  **Identify the Final State:** The question asks for a transition to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" This requires considering the selection rules for photon absorption.\n    *   **Selection Rules:** For an electric dipole transition (the most common type) in a heteronuclear diatomic molecule, the selection rules are `Δv = ±1` and `ΔJ = ±1`.\n    *   Since the molecule starts in the ground state (`v=0, J=0`) and absorbs a photon (gains energy), the quantum numbers must increase. So, `Δv = +1` and `ΔJ = +1`.\n    *   Applying these rules to the initial state (`v=0, J=0`):\n        *   `v_final = v_initial + Δv = 0 + 1 = 1`\n        *   `J_final = J_initial + ΔJ = 0 + 1 = 1`\n    *   Therefore, the final state is `(v=1, J=1)`.\n    *   Final Energy: `E_final = E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + B*1(1+1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Photon's Energy:** The energy of the absorbed photon (`E_photon`) must be equal to the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n    *   `E_photon = ΔE = E_final - E_initial`\n    *   `ΔE = [(3/2)ħω + 2B] - [(1/2)ħω]`\n    *   `ΔE = ħω + 2B`\n\n6.  **Calculate Necessary Physical Quantities:** To find `ΔE`, we need to calculate the rotational constant `B`.\n    *   The rotational constant is `B = ħ² / (2I)`, where `I` is the moment of inertia.\n    *   The moment of inertia is `I = μR²`, where `μ` is the reduced mass and `R` is the bond length.\n    *   The reduced mass is `μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)`.\n\n7.  **Perform the Calculations (Step-by-Step):** I will now use a Python script to perform the numerical calculations accurately.\n\n    *   **Constants and Given Values:**\n        *   `Mx` = 20 amu\n        *   `My` = 2 amu\n        *   `R` = 2 angstroms = `2 * 10⁻¹⁰ m`\n        *   `ω` = `4 * 10¹⁴ rad/s`\n        *   `amu_to_kg` = `1.66054 * 10⁻²⁷ kg`\n        *   `ħ` = `1.05457 * 10⁻³⁴ J·s`\n        *   `c` (speed of light) = `2.99792 * 10⁸ m/s`\n\n    *   **Code Implementation:**\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nh_bar = 1.05457e-34  # Reduced Planck constant in J*s\nc = 2.99792e8        # Speed of light in m/s\namu_to_kg = 1.66054e-27 # AMU to kg conversion\n\n# Given molecular properties\nMx_amu = 20.0  # Mass of atom X in amu\nMy_amu = 2.0   # Mass of atom Y in amu\nR_angstrom = 2.0 # Bond length in angstroms\nomega = 4.0e14     # Angular frequency in rad/s\n\n# Convert units to SI\nMx_kg = Mx_amu * amu_to_kg\nMy_kg = My_amu * amu_to_kg\nR_m = R_angstrom * 1e-10\n\n# 1.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Model and Energy Levels**\n\nThe problem uses the quantum rotation-vibration model (or non-rigid rotor model). The energy `E` of a state is determined by two quantum numbers: the vibrational quantum number `v` (v = 0, 1, 2, ...) and the rotational quantum number `J` (J = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n\nThe total energy of a state (v, J) is the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\nE(v, J) = E_vibrational + E_rotational\nE(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + B*J(J + 1)\n\nwhere:\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (≈ 1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration.\n*   `B` is the rotational constant, which depends on the molecule's moment of inertia.\n\n**2.
