    "The problem asks for the geometrical position in the qubit space of the density matrix $\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$.\n\n**1. Understanding the Qubit Space and the Bloch Sphere**\n\nA single qubit state can be represented as a point in a 3D space, called the Bloch sphere. The position of this point is given by a vector $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$, known as the Bloch vector. The relationship between the density matrix $\\rho$ and the Bloch vector $\\vec{r}$ is given by the formula:\n\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$\n\nwhere $I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix and $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrices:\n\n$I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, $\\sigma_x = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $\\sigma_y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $\\sigma_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nPure states are represented by points on the surface of the sphere ($|\\vec{r}|^2 = r_x^2 + r_y^2 + r_z^2 = 1$), while mixed states are represented by points inside the sphere ($|\\vec{r}|^2 < 1$).\n\n**2. Expressing the given Density Matrix in Matrix Form**\n\nFirst, let's write the given density matrix $\\rho$ in its matrix form. The computational basis states are:\n$|0\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $|1\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe outer products are:\n$|0\\rangle\\langle 0| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$|1\\rangle\\langle 1| = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\rho$:\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2}I$\n\nThis is the density matrix of a maximally mixed state. This state has an equal probability of being in state $|0\\rangle$ or state $|1\\rangle$ upon measurement in the computational basis.\n\n**3. Calculating the Bloch Vector**\n\nTo find the components of the Bloch vector $\\vec{r}=(r_x, r_y, r_z)$, we can use the formula:\n$r_k = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_k)$ for $k \\in \\{x, y, z\\}$.\n\nLet's calculate each component:\n*   $r_x = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_x) = \\text{Tr}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_x\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{Tr}(\\sigma_x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{Tr}\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2}(0+0) = 0$\n*   $r_y = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_y) = \\text{Tr}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_y\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{Tr}(\\sigma_y) = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{Tr}\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2}(0+0) = 0$\n*   $r_z = \\text{Tr}(\\rho \\sigma_z) = \\text{Tr}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}I \\sigma_z\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{Tr}(\\sigma_z) = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{Tr}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2}(1-1) = 0$\n\nThus, the Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe geometrical position of the density matrix $\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}I$ in the qubit space is the origin of the Bloch sphere, represented by the vector $\\vec{r}=(0,0,0)$. This corresponds to option C.\n\nTo confirm this, we can plug $\\vec{r}=(0,0,0)$ back into the general formula for $\\rho$:\n$\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + (0,0,0) \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}) = \\frac{1}{2}(I + 0) = \\frac{1}{2}I$, which matches our density matrix.\n\nFinal check of options:\nA) r=(1,1,1) is not a valid physical state as its length squared is $1^2+1^2+1^2=3 > 1$.\nB) r=(0,0,1) represents the pure state $|0\\rangle\\langle 0|$.\nC) r=(0,0,0) represents the maximally mixed state $\\frac{1}{2}I$.\nD) r=(1,1,0) is not a valid physical state as its length squared is $1^2+1^2+0^2=2 > 1$.\n\nThe correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
