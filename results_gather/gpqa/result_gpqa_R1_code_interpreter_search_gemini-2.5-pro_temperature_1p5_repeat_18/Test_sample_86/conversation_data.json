    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the given information:**\n\n*   **Molecular Structure:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means it is a benzene ring with two groups attached, having the general formula C6H4(Substituent 1)(Substituent 2).\n*   **Total Carbon Atoms:** The compound has a total of 8 carbon atoms. Since the benzene ring itself contains 6 carbons, the two substituents must collectively contain 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   **Carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents contains a carbonyl group.\n    *   **Aromatic-halogen bond:** One substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) bonded directly to the aromatic ring.\n\n**2. Deduce the Structure of the Compound:**\n\n*   Let's identify the two substituents.\n    *   Substituent 1 is a Halogen (let's call it -X). It contains 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   Substituent 2 must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. The most common and stable arrangement for a C2 unit with a carbonyl is an **acetyl group (-COCH3)**.\n\n*   Combining these pieces, the compound is a **haloacetophenone**. The structure consists of a benzene ring substituted with a halogen atom (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n\n*   The molecular formula would be C8H7XO (where X is a halogen). Let's count the protons: The benzene ring starts with 6 protons. Replacing two with substituents leaves 4 aromatic protons. The acetyl group's methyl (-CH3) has 3 protons. So, the total number of protons is 4 + 3 = 7.\n\n**3. Analyze the Substitution Pattern and Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n\nThe two substituents can be arranged in three possible ways on the benzene ring: ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4).\n\n*   **Ortho- and Meta-substitution:** These patterns would result in four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons, leading to a complex multiplet in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum (typically between δ 6.5-8.5 ppm).\n*   **Para-substitution (1,4):** This pattern creates a plane of symmetry in the molecule. The two protons ortho to the acetyl group are chemically equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the halogen are also chemically equivalent. This simplification results in a characteristic pattern in the aromatic region: two signals, each integrating to 2 protons. Due to coupling with their neighbors, these signals typically appear as two distinct **doublets**.\n\nThe acetyl group's methyl protons (-CH3) are attached to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, these 3 protons will appear as a **singlet**.\n\n**Predicted Spectrum for a 4-haloacetophenone:**\n*   Aromatic region: Two doublets, each for 2H.\n*   Aliphatic region: One singlet, for 3H.\n*   Total Protons: 2 + 2 + 3 = 7.\n\n**4. Compare the Prediction with the Given Options:**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   **Pattern:** This spectrum shows two doublets in the aromatic region (7.8 and 7.6 ppm) and a singlet in the aliphatic region (2.3 ppm). This perfectly matches the pattern predicted for a para-substituted haloacetophenone.\n    *   **Integration:** 2H + 2H + 3H = 7 protons. This matches our calculated proton count.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The signals at δ 7.8 and δ 7.6 are in the expected region for an aromatic ring with electron-withdrawing groups. The signal at δ 2.3 is a reasonable chemical shift for a methyl group next to a carbonyl (a methyl ketone). This option is a strong candidate.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: δ 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The signal at δ 9.9 is characteristic of an **aldehyde** (-CHO). An aldehyde group contains only one carbon. If the substituents were an aldehyde and a halogen, the total carbon count would be 6 (ring) + 1 (aldehyde) = 7, which contradicts the given total of 8 carbons. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: δ 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring must have 4 aromatic protons. This spectrum only shows one proton at δ 6.9, and it's a singlet. This is inconsistent with the required structure. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: δ 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum has **no signals in the aromatic region** (δ 6.5-8.5 ppm). Therefore, it cannot represent an aromatic compound. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOnly Option A provides a 1H NMR spectrum that is fully consistent with the structural features deduced from the problem statement: an 8-carbon, di-substituted aromatic compound containing a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond (specifically, a para-haloacetophenone).\n\n<<<A>>>"
