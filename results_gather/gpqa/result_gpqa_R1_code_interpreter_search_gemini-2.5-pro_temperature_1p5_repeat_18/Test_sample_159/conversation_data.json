    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Aperture for an Infinitely Large N:**\n    The problem describes an N-sided regular polygon aperture where all apothems have the same length 'a'. The apothem is the distance from the center of the polygon to the midpoint of a side.\n\n    As the number of sides, N, approaches infinity (`N -> ∞`), a regular polygon with a constant apothem approaches a circle. The apothem 'a' of the polygon becomes the radius of the limiting circle. Therefore, the problem simplifies to finding the diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n2.  **Recall the Diffraction Theory for a Circular Aperture:**\n    When monochromatic light passes through a circular aperture, it produces a diffraction pattern in the far-field (Fraunhofer diffraction). This pattern is known as the Airy pattern, which consists of a central bright disk (the Airy disk) surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings.\n\n    The intensity `I` of the diffraction pattern at an angle `θ` from the central axis is given by the formula:\n    `I(θ) = I₀ * [2 * J₁(ka * sinθ) / (ka * sinθ)]²`\n    where:\n    *   `I₀` is the intensity at the center (`θ = 0`).\n    *   `k = 2π / λ` is the wave number, with `λ` being the wavelength of the light.\n    *   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n    *   `J₁(x)` is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n\n3.  **Determine the Positions of the Minima:**\n    The intensity minima (dark rings) occur when the numerator of the intensity formula is zero, which means `J₁(ka * sinθ) = 0`. We need to find the values (zeros) of the argument `x = ka * sinθ` for which `J₁(x) = 0`.\n\n    The Bessel function `J₁(x)` is zero at several points. The first few non-zero positive roots are:\n    *   `x₁ ≈ 3.8317` (This corresponds to the first minimum)\n    *   `x₂ ≈ 7.0156` (This corresponds to the second minimum)\n    *   `x₃ ≈ 10.1735` (This corresponds to the third minimum)\n    *   and so on.\n    (Note: `x = 0` gives the central maximum, not a minimum).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Angular Positions of the First Two Minima:**\n    Let `θₘ` be the angular position of the m-th minimum. The condition for the m-th minimum is:\n    `ka * sin(θₘ) = xₘ`\n    Substituting `k = 2π / λ`:\n    `(2π / λ) * a * sin(θₘ) = xₘ`\n\n    The problem states we can use the small-angle approximation, `sin(θ) ≈ tan(θ) ≈ θ`. So, we have:\n    `(2π / λ) * a * θₘ = xₘ`\n    Solving for `θₘ`:\n    `θₘ = (xₘ * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\n    Now, we can find the angular positions for the first two minima:\n    *   **First minimum (m=1):** `θ₁ = (x₁ * λ) / (2π * a) = (3.8317 * λ) / (2π * a)`\n    *   **Second minimum (m=2):** `θ₂ = (x₂ * λ) / (2π * a) = (7.0156 * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Angular Distance Between the First Two Minima:**\n    The question asks for the angular distance between the first and second minima, which is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n\n    `Δθ = [(x₂ * λ) / (2π * a)] - [(x₁ * λ) / (2π * a)]`\n    `Δθ = [(x₂ - x₁) / (2π)] * (λ / a)`\n\n    Now, we plug in the values for the zeros of the Bessel function:\n    `Δθ = [(7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π)] * (λ / a)`\n    `Δθ = [3.1839 / (2π)] * (λ / a)`\n\n    To get the numerical coefficient, we calculate `3.1839 / (2 * 3.14159...)`:\n    `Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    The calculated value is `0.5067 λ / a`. Let's compare this with the provided options:\n    A) 0.610 λ / a  (This is the approximate position of the first minimum, `θ₁ ≈ (3.8317/2π)λ/a`)\n    B) 0.500 λ / a\n    C) 0.506 λ / a  (This matches our calculation)\n    D) 1.220 λ /a  (This is `2θ₁`, the angular diameter of the central Airy disk)\n\nThe calculation clearly points to option C.\n\nTo confirm with higher precision, we can use a python script.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.special import jn_zeros\n\n# Get the first two non-zero roots of the Bessel function J1(x)\nzeros = jn_zeros(1, 2)\nx1 = zeros[0]\nx2 = zeros[1]\n\n# The angular distance between the first two minima is delta_theta = theta_2 - theta_1\n# delta_theta = [(x2 - x1) / (2*pi)] * (lambda / a)\n# We compute the coefficient (x2 - x1) / (2*pi)\ncoefficient = (x2 - x1) / (2 * np.pi)\n\nprint(f\"{coefficient:.3f}\")\n```\n<execute_output>\n0.507\n</execute_output>\nThe python code calculates the coefficient to be 0.507 when rounded to three decimal places, which corresponds to 0.506... before rounding. This confirms our result.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "An N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem `a` will approach a circle of radius `a` as the number of sides `N` approaches infinity. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius `a`.\n\nThe diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture in the far-field (Fraunhofer diffraction) is known as the Airy pattern. The intensity `I` at an angle `θ` relative to the central axis is given by:\n\n`I(θ) = I₀ * [2 * J₁(ka * sinθ) / (ka * sinθ)]²`\n\nWhere:\n*   `I₀` is the intensity at the center.\n*   `k = 2π / λ` is the wave number.\n*   `λ` is the wavelength of the light.\n*   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   `J₁(x)` is the Bessel function of the first kind, order one.\n\nThe intensity minima (dark rings) occur when the numerator `J₁(ka * sinθ)` is equal to zero. The first two non-zero roots (zeros) of the Bessel function `J₁(x)` are:\n*   `x₁ ≈ 3.8317` (This corresponds to the first minimum).\n*   `x₂ ≈ 7.0156` (This corresponds to the second minimum).\n\nThe condition for the m-th minimum at an angle `θₘ` is:\n`ka * sin(θₘ) = xₘ`\n\nUsing the small-angle approximation (`sinθ ≈ θ`), the equation becomes:\n`ka * θₘ = xₘ`\n\nSubstituting `k = 2π / λ`:\n`(2π / λ) * a * θₘ = xₘ`\n\nSolving for the angular position `θₘ`:\n`θₘ = (xₘ * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\nNow we can find the angular positions of the first two minima:\n*   Angular position of the first minimum (`θ₁`):\n    `θ₁ = (x₁ * λ) / (2π * a) = (3.8317 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 0.610 * λ / a`\n*   Angular position of the second minimum (`θ₂`):\n    `θ₂ = (x₂ * λ) / (2π * a) = (7.0156 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 1.116 * λ / a`\n\nThe question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = [(x₂ * λ) / (2π * a)] - [(x₁ * λ) / (2π * a)]`\n`Δθ = [(x₂ - x₁) / (2π)] * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ = [(7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π)] * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ = [3.1839 / (2 * 3.14159...)] * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`\n\nThis value is closest to option C. The python code also confirmed this calculation, yielding a result of 0.507 (rounded).\n\n<<<C>>>"
