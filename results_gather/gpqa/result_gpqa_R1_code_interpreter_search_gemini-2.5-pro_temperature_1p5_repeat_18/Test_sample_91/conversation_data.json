    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the structure of the given molecule to count the number of atoms and the types of bonds.\nThe molecule is: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\n\nLet's break it down and count the atoms:\n*   **Carbon (C) atoms:**\n    *   (CH3)2C: 1 C and 2 from the methyl groups = 3\n    *   =CH-: 1\n    *   -CH2-: 1\n    *   -CH(CH3)-: 1 C on the main chain and 1 from the methyl group = 2\n    *   -CH2-: 1\n    *   -CH=: 1\n    *   =C(CH3)2: 1 C and 2 from the methyl groups = 3\n    *   Total Carbon atoms = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = **12 C atoms**.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H) atoms:**\n    *   (CH3)2: 2 * 3 = 6\n    *   =CH-: 1\n    *   -CH2-: 2\n    *   -CH(CH3)-: 1 H on the main chain and 3 from the methyl group = 4\n    *   -CH2-: 2\n    *   -CH=: 1\n    *   =C(CH3)2: 2 * 3 = 6\n    *   Total Hydrogen atoms = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = **22 H atoms**.\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n### **2. Count the Bonds**\n\nNext, we count each type of covalent bond in one molecule.\n*   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n*   **C=C double bonds:** We can see two double bonds in the structure: (CH3)2**C=C**H- and -C**H=C**(CH3)2. So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C single bonds:** In an acyclic (non-ring) hydrocarbon, the total number of bonds between carbon atoms is (Total C atoms - 1). Here, it is 12 - 1 = 11 bonds. Since we already have 2 double bonds, the number of single bonds is 11 - 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\nLet's summarize the bond counts:\n*   C-C bonds: 9\n*   C=C bonds: 2\n*   C-H bonds: 22\n\n### **3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound (ΔH_atomization)**\n\nThis is the total energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound. We sum the bond energies of all the bonds.\n\nGiven bond energies:\n*   BE(C-C) = 200 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C=C) = 300 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C-H) = 400 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_atomization = (No. of C-C × BE(C-C)) + (No. of C=C × BE(C=C)) + (No. of C-H × BE(C-H))\nΔH_atomization = (9 × 200) + (2 × 300) + (22 × 400)\nΔH_atomization = 1800 + 600 + 8800\nΔH_atomization = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n### **4. Calculate the Enthalpy Required to Form Gaseous Atoms from Standard States**\n\nThis is the energy needed to turn the elements in their standard states (C as solid graphite, H as H2 gas) into individual gaseous atoms.\nThis corresponds to the reaction: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → 12 C(g) + 22 H(g)\n\nGiven data:\n*   Enthalpy of atomization of carbon (ΔH_atom(C)): C(s) → C(g) is **1000 kJ/mol**.\n*   Bond energy of H-H: H2(g) → 2H(g) is **100 kJ/mol**. The enthalpy of atomization for one mole of H atoms (1/2 H2(g) → H(g)) is half of this value, so ΔH_atom(H) = 100 / 2 = **50 kJ/mol**.\n\nTotal enthalpy for atom formation = (No. of C atoms × ΔH_atom(C)) + (No. of H atoms × ΔH_atom(H))\nTotal enthalpy for atom formation = (12 × 1000) + (22 × 50)\nTotal enthalpy for atom formation = 12000 + 1100\nTotal enthalpy for atom formation = **13100 kJ/mol**\n\n### **5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation of the Compound (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) is calculated using Hess's Law. The formation of the compound from its constituent gaseous atoms is the reverse of atomization.\nΔH_f(compound) = (Total enthalpy for atom formation) - (ΔH_atomization of compound)\nΔH_f(compound) = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol\nΔH_f(compound) = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n### **6. Convert to kJ/g and Compare with Options**\n\nThe options are given in kJ/mol and kJ/g. We have calculated the value in kJ/mol as 1900. Let's convert this to kJ/g to check against the other options.\n\n*   **Calculate the molar mass of C12H22:**\n    *   Molar Mass = (12 × Atomic Mass of C) + (22 × Atomic Mass of H)\n    *   Molar Mass ≈ (12 × 12.0) + (22 × 1.0) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n\n*   **Convert kJ/mol to kJ/g:**\n    *   Enthalpy (kJ/g) = Enthalpy (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\n    *   Enthalpy (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166 ≈ **11.446 kJ/g**.\n\nLet's review the options:\nA) 11200 kJ/mol (This is the ΔH_atomization, not ΔH_f)\nB) 67.4 kJ/mol\nC) 1900 kJ/g (The value is correct for kJ/mol, but the unit is wrong)\nD) 11.44 kJ/g (This matches our calculation)\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 11.44 kJ/g.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, we can use a Python script for the calculations.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nBE_CC = 200  # Bond energy C-C in kJ/mol\nBE_CC_double = 300  # Bond energy C=C in kJ/mol\nBE_CH = 400  # Bond energy C-H in kJ/mol\nBE_HH = 100  # Bond energy H-H in kJ/mol\nAH_C = 1000  # Enthalpy of atomization of Carbon in kJ/mol\n\n# Step 1: Count atoms and bonds for C12H22\nn_C = 12  # Number of Carbon atoms\nn_H = 22  # Number of Hydrogen atoms\nn_CC = 9   # Number of C-C single bonds\nn_CC_double = 2  # Number of C=C double bonds\nn_CH = 22  # Number of C-H bonds\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the enthalpy of atomization of the compound\nAH_atom_compound = (n_CC * BE_CC) + (n_CC_double * BE_CC_double) + (n_CH * BE_CH)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the enthalpy required to form gaseous atoms from standard states\n# Enthalpy of atomization of H is 1/2 of H-H bond energy\nAH_H = 0.5 * BE_HH\nAH_f_atoms = (n_C * AH_C) + (n_H * AH_H)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the enthalpy of formation of the compound in kJ/mol\nAH_f_compound_mol = AH_f_atoms - AH_atom_compound\n\n# Step 5: Convert to kJ/g\n# Molar mass of C12H22\nMolar_Mass = (n_C * 12.0) + (n_H * 1.0)\nAH_f_compound_gram = AH_f_compound_mol / Molar_Mass\n\n# Print the results to check against options\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of atomization of compound: {AH_atom_compound} kJ/mol\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol: {AH_f_compound_mol} kJ/mol\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation in kJ/g: {AH_f_compound_gram:.2f} kJ/g\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
