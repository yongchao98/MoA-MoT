    "*   **Analysis of the Reaction and Product**\n\n1.  **Reactant and Conditions:** The starting material is Compound X with a molecular formula of C11H12O. It is treated with DABCO (1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane), a non-nucleophilic base, at a high temperature (403 K or 130 °C). These conditions are characteristic of a base-catalyzed or thermal isomerization/rearrangement reaction, meaning the product will have the same molecular formula as the starting material: C11H12O.\n\n2.  **Product Structure Elucidation from NMR Data:**\n    *   **¹³C NMR:** The signal at δ 197.7 ppm is highly deshielded and is definitive for a carbonyl carbon (C=O). The absence of a proton signal around 9-10 ppm in the ¹H NMR indicates this is a ketone, not an aldehyde.\n    *   **¹H NMR:**\n        *   The spectrum shows two singlets, each integrating to 3H (δ 2.28 and 2.31 ppm). These correspond to two methyl (CH₃) groups that are not adjacent to any protons. One is likely an acetyl methyl group (-C(=O)-CH₃), and the other is an aryl methyl group (Ar-CH₃).\n        *   The signals in the aromatic region (δ 7.0-8.0 ppm) consist of two doublets at δ 7.08 (2H) and δ 7.71 (2H). This AA'BB' splitting pattern is classic for a para-substituted benzene ring.\n        *   The remaining two signals are doublets at δ 6.75 (1H) and δ 7.68 (1H). These are characteristic of two protons on a carbon-carbon double bond (-CH=CH-) that are coupled to each other.\n    *   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n        *   We have a ketone group (-C(=O)-).\n        *   We have a para-substituted benzene ring.\n        *   One substituent on the ring is a methyl group (from one of the 3H singlets, let's say δ 2.28 ppm). This gives a para-tolyl group (p-Tol).\n        *   We have an acetyl group (-C(=O)CH₃) (from the other 3H singlet, δ 2.31 ppm).\n        *   We have a trans -CH=CH- group connecting the p-tolyl ring and the acetyl group.\n        *   Connecting these fragments gives the structure: 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one (also named 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one).\n        *   Let's verify the formula: C₁₁H₁₂O. (p-tolyl = C₇H₇, -CH=CH- = C₂H₂, -C(=O)CH₃ = C₂H₃O). Total = C(7+2+2)H(7+2+3)O = C₁₁H₁₂O. The formula matches.\n        *   This structure, an α,β-unsaturated ketone, is fully consistent with all the provided NMR data.\n\n*   **Identification of Compound X**\n\n1.  **Finding the Isomer:** Now we must identify which of the given options for Compound X (all of which are epoxides) is an isomer of C11H12O and could plausibly rearrange to form 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n2.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A) 2-styrylepoxide (2-styryloxirane):** The styryl group is C₆H₅-CH=CH-. The structure is C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂. Its formula is C₁₀H₁₀O, which does not match C₁₁H₁₂O.\n    *   **B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** The structure is C₆H₅-CH=C(CH₃)-CH(O)CH₂. Its formula is C₁₁H₁₂O, which matches. However, the starting material has a phenyl group (C₆H₅), while the product has a p-tolyl group (p-CH₃C₆H₄). A reaction that moves a methyl group from a side chain onto the para-position of a benzene ring is chemically highly improbable under these conditions.\n    *   **C) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** The 4-methylstyryl group is p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-. The structure is p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂.\n        *   Let's check the formula: p-tolyl (C₇H₇) + -CH=CH- (C₂H₂) + oxirane fragment (-CH(O)CH₂ = C₂H₃O). Total is C(7+2+2)H(7+2+3)O = C₁₁H₁₂O. The formula is correct.\n        *   This starting material already contains the p-tolyl group found in the product.\n        *   The rearrangement of a vinyl epoxide (where the double bond is conjugated with the epoxide ring) to an α,β-unsaturated ketone is a known and chemically plausible reaction, often occurring under thermal or catalytic conditions.\n            `p-Tol-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂` (X) → `p-Tol-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃` (Product)\n        This transformation accounts for all atoms and is a viable chemical pathway.\n    *   **D) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** The structure is C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(O)CH-CH₃. The formula is C₁₁H₁₂O. Similar to option B, this starts with a phenyl group, but the product contains a p-tolyl group. This makes it an unlikely candidate for the same reason as B.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n\nThe product of the reaction is unambiguously identified as 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one from the NMR spectra. Of the choices provided, only 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane (C) has the correct molecular formula and the necessary p-tolyl backbone to rearrange into the observed product under the given conditions.\n\n<<<C>>>"
