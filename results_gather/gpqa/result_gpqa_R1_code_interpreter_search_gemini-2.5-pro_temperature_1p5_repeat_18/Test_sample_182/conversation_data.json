    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactant and its Structure**\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: This is a six-membered carbon ring with one double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n*   **carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group is attached to the ring. By IUPAC convention for carboxylic acids, this carbon is C1.\n*   **2-formyl**: A formyl group (-CHO, an aldehyde) is attached to C2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is attached to C5.\n\nLet's determine the molecular formula of this reactant:\n*   **Carbon (C)**:\n    *   6 carbons in the ring.\n    *   1 carbon in the -COOH group.\n    *   1 carbon in the -CHO group.\n    *   2 carbons in the -CH=CH2 group.\n    *   Total Carbon atoms = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10.\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**:\n    *   Let's count the hydrogens on each carbon of the ring:\n        *   C1 (bonded to COOH, C2, C6): 1H\n        *   C2 (bonded to CHO, C1, C3): 1H\n        *   C3 (double bond to C4, single bond to C2): 1H\n        *   C4 (double bond to C3, single bond to C5): 1H\n        *   C5 (bonded to vinyl, C4, C6): 1H\n        *   C6 (bonded to C1, C5): 2H\n    *   Hydrogens on the substituent groups:\n        *   -COOH: 1H\n        *   -CHO: 1H\n        *   -CH=CH2: 3H\n    *   Total Hydrogen atoms = (1+1+1+1+1+2) + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12.\n*   **Oxygen (O)**:\n    *   2 oxygens in the -COOH group.\n    *   1 oxygen in the -CHO group.\n    *   Total Oxygen atoms = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nSo, the molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus (Red P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This combination of reagents is a very powerful reducing agent. Its key functions are:\n*   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to the corresponding alkane groups (-CH3).\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   It removes all oxygen atoms from the molecule.\n\n**3. Predict the Product**\n\nThe reaction will proceed as follows:\n*   The C10 carbon skeleton will remain intact.\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at C1 will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The formyl group (-CHO) at C2 will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The double bond in the cyclohexene ring (at C3-C4) will be reduced to a single bond, making the ring a cyclohexane.\n*   The double bond in the vinyl group (-CH=CH2) at C5 will be reduced, converting the vinyl group to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n\nThe final product will be a saturated substituted cycloalkane. Since the starting material has 10 carbon atoms, the product will also have 10 carbon atoms. It will be a derivative of cyclohexane, meaning it is a monocyclic alkane (a single ring, no double or triple bonds).\n\n**4. Determine the Molecular Formula of the Product**\n\nThe general molecular formula for a monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane) is **CnH2n**.\nSince our product has 10 carbon atoms (n=10), its molecular formula will be **C10H(2*10) = C10H20**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, represents the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. It can be calculated from the molecular formula.\n\nThe formula for IHD is:\nIHD = C - (H/2) + (N/2) - (X/2) + 1\nwhere C = number of carbons, H = number of hydrogens, N = number of nitrogens, X = number of halogens.\n\nFor our product, C10H20:\n*   C = 10\n*   H = 20\n*   N = 0\n*   X = 0\n\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 0 - 0 + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\nAlternatively, we can reason from the structure. The product is a saturated cycloalkane.\n*   Number of double bonds = 0 (IHD contribution = 0)\n*   Number of triple bonds = 0 (IHD contribution = 0)\n*   Number of rings = 1 (the cyclohexane ring) (IHD contribution = 1)\nTotal IHD = 1.\n\nThe IHD of the product is 1.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nComparing the calculated IHD with the given options:\nA) 1\nB) 0\nC) 5 (This is the IHD of the reactant)\nD) 3\n\nThe correct answer is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>"
