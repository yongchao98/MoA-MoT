    "Rationale Breakdown:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Concept:** The question is about comparing the density of four different exoplanets. Density is defined as mass divided by volume (ρ = M/V). The key physical principle at play here is gravitational compression. For planets of the same composition, a more massive planet will have stronger gravity, which compresses its material more tightly, leading to a higher overall density.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Option:**\n    *   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is our baseline reference. The average density of Earth is approximately 5.51 g/cm³. Let's call this density ρ_E.\n    *   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density given is ~5.5 g/cm³, which is almost identical to Earth's density. So, ρ_b ≈ ρ_E.\n    *   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** This planet has the same building materials as Earth but is much more massive (M_c = 5 M_E). Due to its significantly stronger gravity, the material (iron core, silicate mantle, etc.) will be squeezed much more tightly than in Earth. This gravitational self-compression means that its volume will not increase as fast as its mass. Therefore, its overall density will be significantly higher than Earth's density. So, ρ_c > ρ_E.\n    *   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** This planet has the same composition but is less massive (M_d = 0.5 M_E). Its internal gravity is weaker than Earth's. As a result, the material is less compressed. Therefore, its overall density will be lower than Earth's density. So, ρ_d < ρ_E.\n\n3.  **Compare the Densities:**\n    *   Density of (a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Density of (b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n    *   Density of (c) > 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Density of (d) < 5.51 g/cm³\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** By comparing the four options, the planet described in option (c) is the only one that must have a density greater than Earth's. The increased mass leads to greater gravitational compression, resulting in the highest density among the choices.\n\nTo illustrate this with a calculation, we can use the approximate mass-radius relationship for rocky planets: R ∝ M^~0.3.\n\n*   For planet (c), M_c = 5 M_E. So R_c ≈ (5^0.3) R_E ≈ 1.6 R_E.\n*   Density ρ = M/V ∝ M/R³.\n*   ρ_c / ρ_E = (M_c / M_E) / (R_c / R_E)³ = 5 / (1.6)³ ≈ 5 / 4.1 ≈ 1.22.\n*   This shows the density of planet (c) is roughly 22% higher than Earth's.\n\nTherefore, planet (c) has the highest density.\n\n<<<A>>>"
