    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the relationship between parallax and distance.**\n    Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) of a star.\n    `plx ∝ 1/d`\n    This can be written as `d = k/plx`, where `k` is a constant of proportionality. For simplicity, we can set `k=1`, so `d = 1/plx`.\n\n2.  **Understand the assumption of uniform distribution.**\n    The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ`, is constant everywhere. The number of stars in any given volume `V` is `N = ρ * V`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of stars in a thin shell of space.**\n    We want to find the number of stars *per unit range of parallax*. This means we need to find how many stars have a parallax in a specific small range, say between `plx` and `plx + d(plx)`. This parallax range corresponds to a distance range between `d` and `d + dd`.\n\n    Let's consider a thin spherical shell of radius `d` and thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this shell (`dV`) is its surface area multiplied by its thickness: `dV = 4πd² * dd`.\n    *   The number of stars (`dN`) in this shell is the volume of the shell multiplied by the constant star density `ρ`:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² * dd`.\n\n4.  **Express the number of stars in terms of parallax.**\n    Our goal is to find the relationship for `dN/d(plx)`. We have an expression for `dN` in terms of `d` and `dd`. We need to convert `d` and `dd` to `plx` and `d(plx)`.\n    *   From step 1, we have `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   Now, we need to find the relationship between the thickness `dd` and the parallax interval `d(plx)`. We can do this by differentiating `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) * (1/plx) = -1/plx²`\n        Therefore, `dd = -d(plx)/plx²`.\n        We are interested in the number of stars in a range, so we can ignore the negative sign which just indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases. So we use `dd = d(plx)/plx²`.\n\n5.  **Substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` back into the equation for `dN`.**\n    `dN = 4πρ * d² * dd`\n    Substitute `d = 1/plx` and `dd = d(plx)/plx²`:\n    `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx)² * (d(plx)/plx²) `\n    `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx²) * (d(plx)/plx²) `\n    `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Find the number of stars per unit range of parallax.**\n    We are looking for `dN/d(plx)`. From the equation above, we can rearrange it to find this value:\n    `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n7.  **Interpret the final result.**\n    The equation shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`) is proportional to `1/plx⁴`, since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants.\n\n    Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes as `~ 1/plx⁴`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
