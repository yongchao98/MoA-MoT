    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using the mass percentage of Fluorine in A2.**\n    Let the formula of compound A2 be YF_n.\n    The molar mass of Y is M(Y) and the molar mass of Fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n    The mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) is given as 31.96%.\n    The formula for mass percentage is:\n    ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n    0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\n    Rearranging the formula to solve for M(Y):\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * 19.00 * n = 19.00 * n\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 19.00 * n - 6.0724 * n\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276 * n\n    M(Y) = (12.9276 / 0.3196) * n ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n    Now, we test integer values for 'n' to find a plausible element Y.\n    *   n = 1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (Closest is Calcium, Ca=40.08)\n    *   n = 2: M(Y) ≈ 80.90 g/mol (Closest are Bromine, Br=79.90, and Krypton, Kr=83.80)\n    *   n = 3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (Closest is Antimony, Sb=121.76)\n    *   n = 4: M(Y) ≈ 161.80 g/mol (Closest is Dysprosium, Dy=162.50)\n    *   n = 5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (Closest are Mercury, Hg=200.6, and Thallium, Tl=204.4)\n    *   n = 6: M(Y) ≈ 242.70 g/mol (Closest are Plutonium, Pu=244, and Americium, Am=243)\n\n2.  **Evaluate the candidates for Y based on other clues.**\n    *   **Antimony (Sb)**: If n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol, which is very close to Sb (121.76 g/mol). Let's check if A2=SbF3 has ɷF ≈ 31.96%.\n        ɷF(SbF3) = (3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 * 19.00) = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 31.88%. This is a very close match.\n    *   **Krypton (Kr)**: If n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.90 g/mol, which is reasonably close to Kr (83.80 g/mol). Let's check if A2=KrF2.\n        ɷF(KrF2) = (2 * 19.00) / (83.80 + 2 * 19.00) = 38 / 121.80 ≈ 31.20%. This match is not as good as Antimony's.\n    *   **Plutonium (Pu)**: If n=6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol, very close to Pu (244 g/mol). Let's check A2=PuF6.\n        ɷF(PuF6) = (6 * 19.00) / (244 + 6 * 19.00) = 114 / 358 ≈ 31.84%. This is also a very close match.\n\n3.  **Analyze the chemical reactions to decide between the best candidates (Sb, Kr, Pu).**\n\n    *   **Clue: A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 and fluorine (F2).**\n        This means A1 is a higher fluoride than A2 (A1 = YF_{n+2}).\n        *   If Y=Sb, A2=SbF3. Then A1 would be SbF5. (Reaction: SbF5 → SbF3 + F2). This is chemically a reduction, so it's plausible.\n        *   If Y=Pu, A2=PuF6. Then A1 would be PuF8, which is not a known compound. Alternatively, if A1=PuF6, it decomposes to PuF4 + F2. Then A2=PuF4. But ɷF(PuF4) is 23.75%, which contradicts the given value. So Pu is unlikely.\n        *   If Y=Kr, A2=KrF2. Then A1 would be KrF4. (Reaction: KrF4 → KrF2 + F2). This is chemically sound.\n\n    *   **Clue: A5 is obtained by adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4.**\n        Reaction: Y + A4 → A5 (with a 1:1 molar ratio of Y to A4).\n        *   If Y=Sb: The reaction is a comproportionation. To form a stable product, A4 must be the higher oxidation state fluoride (SbF5) and A5 must be the lower one (SbF3).\n            Reaction: Sb + A4(SbF5) → A5(SbF3).\n            The balanced equation is 2Sb + 3SbF5 → 5SbF3. The stoichiometric ratio is 2:3, not 1:1. This contradicts the clue if \"1:1 molar ratio\" refers to stoichiometry.\n        *   If Y=Kr: The comproportionation reaction is Kr + KrF4 → 2KrF2.\n            The stoichiometric ratio of reactants Kr to KrF4 is exactly 1:1. This is a perfect match for the clue. This suggests A4=KrF4 and A5=KrF2.\n\n    *   **Clue: In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.**\n        *   If Y=Sb, A5=SbF3. Hydrolysis of SbF3: SbF3 + H2O → SbOF(s) + 2HF(aq). This produces two substances, antimony oxyfluoride and hydrofluoric acid. This is a perfect match.\n        *   If Y=Kr, A5=KrF2. Hydrolysis of KrF2: 2KrF2 + 2H2O → 2Kr(g) + O2(g) + 4HF(aq). This produces three substances (Kr, O2, HF). This contradicts the clue.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the findings and resolve contradictions.**\n    We have a conflict:\n    *   The **Antimony (Sb)** hypothesis fits the mass percentage and the hydrolysis clue perfectly, but contradicts the 1:1 stoichiometry clue.\n    *   The **Krypton (Kr)** hypothesis fits the 1:1 stoichiometry clue perfectly, but contradicts the hydrolysis clue and has a less accurate fit for the mass percentage.\n\n    Let's check the final piece of the puzzle: the molecular weight of A4. The question asks to find the range for MW(A4).\n\n    *   If Y=Sb, then A4=SbF5. MW(SbF5) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = 216.76 g/mol. This value does not fall into any of the given ranges (A: 110-130, B: 220-240, C: 140-160, D: 160-180).\n    *   If Y=Kr, then A4=KrF4. MW(KrF4) = 83.80 + 4 * 19.00 = 83.80 + 76 = 159.80 g/mol. This value falls perfectly into range **C) 140-160**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion.**\n    The fact that the Krypton hypothesis leads to a molecular weight for A4 that fits perfectly within one of the options is a very strong indicator that this is the intended answer, despite the other chemical inaccuracies in the problem description (color of A1, number of hydrolysis products, and the less-precise mass percentage fit). In complex chemistry puzzles, it's possible for some details to be simplified or erroneous, while a numerical match provides the key to the solution. The Krypton model provides a direct path to one of the answers.\n\n    *   Element Y: Krypton (Kr)\n    *   A4: KrF4\n    *   Molecular Weight of A4 (KrF4): 159.8 g/mol.\n    *   This falls in the range 140-160.\n\n<<<C>>>"
