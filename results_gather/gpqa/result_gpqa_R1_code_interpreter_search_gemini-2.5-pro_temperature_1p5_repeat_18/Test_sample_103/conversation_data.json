    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Radial Velocity (RV) Method**\n    The problem uses the Radial Velocity (RV) method. This method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. The star \"wobbles\" as it orbits the common center of mass with the planet. This wobble causes its light to be blueshifted when it moves towards us and redshifted when it moves away.\n\n2.  **Relating Wavelength Shift to Stellar Velocity**\n    The observed wavelength shift, $\\Delta\\lambda$, is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity, $v_{r*}$, along our line of sight. The maximum observed shift, given in the problem, corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity curve, denoted as $K$.\n    The relationship is given by the Doppler formula: $\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{v_{r*}}{c}$. Since we are interested in the maximum shift, we have:\n    $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$.\n\n    For the two systems, we can write the ratio of their RV semi-amplitudes:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7 \\text{ miliangstrom}}{5 \\text{ miliangstrom}} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$.\n\n3.  **Relating Stellar Velocity to Orbital Parameters**\n    The RV semi-amplitude ($K$) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by the formula:\n    $K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{(M_* + m_p)^{2/3}}$\n    where:\n    *   $P$ is the orbital period.\n    *   $m_p$ is the planet's mass.\n    *   $M_*$ is the star's mass.\n    *   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit to our line of sight ($i=90^\\circ$ for an edge-on orbit).\n    *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\n4.  **Applying the Problem's Conditions**\n    The problem states that:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: $M_{*1} = M_{*2}$.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: $m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$.\n    *   Since no information on orbital inclination is given, we assume it's the same for both systems ($i_1 = i_2$).\n\n    Given these conditions, most terms in the formula for $K$ are constant for both systems. Let's see how $K$ depends on $P$:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad K \\propto P^{-1/3}$.\n    This means that a larger RV semi-amplitude implies a shorter orbital period.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Ratio of Orbital Periods**\n    We can set up a ratio for the two systems:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{(P_2)^{-1/3}}{(P_1)^{-1/3}} = \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\right)^{-1/3} = \\left( \\frac{P_1}{P_2} \\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    We want to find the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$. Let's rearrange the equation to solve for it:\n    First, cube both sides:\n    $\\left( \\frac{K_2}{K_1} \\right)^3 = \\frac{P_1}{P_2}$\n\n    Then, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\right)^3$\n\n6.  **Substituting the Values and Computing the Result**\n    We know that $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$.\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^3$\n\n    Now, let's calculate the numerical value.\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods\nperiod_ratio = (5/7)**3\nprint(period_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.3644324960753532\n</execute_result>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 0.364.

    "The user wants to find the ratio of the orbital periods of two exoplanets. Let's break down the problem using the principles of the Radial Velocity (RV) method.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method and Doppler Shift:**\n    The RV method detects exoplanets by measuring the tiny, periodic shift in the wavelength of light from a star. This shift is caused by the Doppler effect as the star \"wobbles\" due to the gravitational pull of its orbiting planet. The magnitude of the observed wavelength shift, $\\Delta\\lambda$, is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity ($v_*$) along our line of sight. The maximum observed shift corresponds to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted by $K$.\n    So, $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$.\n\n2.  **Establish the Ratio of RV Semi-Amplitudes:**\n    We are given the periodic wavelength shifts for the two systems:\n    *   Planet #1: $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstrom\n    *   Planet #2: $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstrom\n    The ratio of their RV semi-amplitudes ($K_1$ and $K_2$) is:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$\n    And conversely:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n3.  **Relate RV Semi-Amplitude to Orbital Parameters:**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's RV semi-amplitude ($K$) is given by the formula:\n    $K = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{m_p \\sin i}{M_*^{2/3}}$\n    Where:\n    *   $P$ is the orbital period.\n    *   $m_p$ is the mass of the planet.\n    *   $M_*$ is the mass of the star.\n    *   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit (angle between the orbital plane and the plane of the sky).\n    *   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n    *(Note: The full denominator is $(M_* + m_p)^{2/3}$, but since the star is much more massive than the planet ($M_* \\gg m_p$), it can be approximated to $M_*^{2/3}$. This simplification doesn't affect the final proportionality.)*\n\n4.  **Simplify the Relationship Based on the Problem's Information:**\n    The problem states:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: $M_{*1} = M_{*2}$.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: $m_{p1} \\approx m_{p2}$.\n    *   Since no other information is given, we assume the orbital inclinations are similar ($i_1 \\approx i_2$), which is a standard assumption in such comparison problems.\n\n    With $m_p$, $M_*$, and $\\sin i$ being effectively constant for both systems, the formula simplifies to show the relationship between $K$ and $P$:\n    $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$ or $K \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods:**\n    We can write the ratio of the semi-amplitudes in terms of the periods:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{P_2^{-1/3}}{P_1^{-1/3}} = \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\right)^{-1/3} = \\left( \\frac{P_1}{P_2} \\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    We need to find the ratio $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$. Let's rearrange the equation:\n    First, cube both sides:\n    $\\left( \\frac{K_2}{K_1} \\right)^3 = \\frac{P_1}{P_2}$\n\n    Now, take the reciprocal to get the desired ratio:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\right)^3$\n\n6.  **Substitute the Values and Compute the Final Answer:**\n    We know that $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$.\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^3$\n\n    Let's compute this value using Python.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1.\n# This is (K1/K2)^3, where K1/K2 = 5/7.\nperiod_ratio = (5/7)**3\nprint(period_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.3644324960753532\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.364. This means the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. This value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "My reasoning remains the same, and the calculation is correct. The slight variation in the decimal places of the code output does not alter the conclusion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation Recap\n\n1.  **Doppler Shift and Radial Velocity:** The radial velocity semi-amplitude of the star, $K$, is directly proportional to the measured wavelength shift, $\\Delta\\lambda$.\n    *   $K \\propto \\Delta\\lambda$\n\n2.  **Ratio of Velocities:** From the given data, we can find the ratio of the stars' velocities.\n    *   $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n3.  **Velocity and Orbital Period:** The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K$) shows its relationship with the orbital period ($P$). Given that the star masses ($M_*$) and planet masses ($m_p$) are the same for both systems, the formula simplifies.\n    *   $K \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}}$\n\n4.  **Ratio of Periods:** We can set up a ratio to find how the periods relate.\n    *   $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{P_1^{-1/3}}{P_2^{-1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\n5.  **Solving for the Period Ratio:** We want to find $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$. We can rearrange the equation and substitute the known velocity ratio.\n    *   $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^3 = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3$\n\n### Calculation\n\nAs calculated before:\n$\\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{125}{343} \\approx 0.3644$\n\nThis result is approximately 0.36.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times the orbital period of planet #1. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
