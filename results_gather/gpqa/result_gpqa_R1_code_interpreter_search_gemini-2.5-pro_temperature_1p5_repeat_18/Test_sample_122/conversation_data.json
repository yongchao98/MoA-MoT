    "This is a problem of special relativity. We need to calculate the distance traveled by the supernova ejecta in the reference frame of the Galaxy.\n\n### 1. Identify the given information and the goal\n*   **Frame S:** The reference frame of the Galaxy (considered stationary).\n*   **Frame S':** The reference frame of the ejecta (considered moving).\n*   **Relative velocity (v):** The speed of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is v = 60,000 km/s.\n*   **Proper time (Δt₀):** The time elapsed in the ejecta's frame is Δt₀ = 50 s. This is the \"proper time\" because it's measured by a clock in the moving frame.\n*   **Speed of light (c):** We will use the standard value c = 300,000 km/s.\n*   **Goal:** Find the distance (d) the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (S).\n\n### 2. Formulate the physics\n1.  In the Galaxy's reference frame (S), the distance traveled by the ejecta is given by its velocity (v) multiplied by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt).\n    `d = v * Δt`\n\n2.  According to the theory of special relativity, time runs at different rates in different inertial frames. This phenomenon is called time dilation. The time elapsed in the stationary frame (Δt) is related to the proper time in the moving frame (Δt₀) by the following formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    where γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  The Lorentz factor is defined as:\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n### 3. Step-by-step calculation\nFirst, we calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).\n\n1.  **Calculate the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light (β):**\n    `β = v / c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n2.  **Calculate β²:**\n    `β² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n\n3.  **Calculate γ:**\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\nNow, we can find the time (Δt) that has passed in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n4.  **Calculate Δt:**\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\nFinally, we calculate the distance (d) traveled in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n5.  **Calculate d:**\n    `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * ( (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s )`\n    `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\nTo get the numerical value, we can use a calculator.\n```python\nimport math\n\nv = 60000  # km/s\ndt0 = 50   # s\nc = 300000 # km/s\n\n# Calculate gamma\nbeta_sq = (v/c)**2\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta_sq)\n\n# Calculate dilated time in Galaxy frame\ndt = gamma * dt0\n\n# Calculate distance in Galaxy frame\ndistance = v * dt\nprint(distance)\n```\n\nThe output of the code is:\n```\n3061862.178478728\n```\nThe calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km.\n\n### 4. Compare with the options\n*   A) 2,880,000 km\n*   B) 3,060,000 km\n*   C) 3,000,000 km (This would be the answer if relativistic effects were ignored, i.e., `d = v * Δt₀`)\n*   D) 2,940,000 km (This would be the answer if one incorrectly used `d = v * Δt₀ * sqrt(1-v²/c²)`)\n\nOur calculated value of 3,061,862 km is very close to option B, 3,060,000 km. The small discrepancy (about 0.06%) is likely due to rounding in the problem's design. For instance, if the Lorentz factor `γ = 1/sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.0206` was rounded to `1.02`, the time dilation would be `Δt = 1.02 * 50s = 51s`, and the distance would be `d = 60,000 km/s * 51s = 3,060,000 km`.\n\nBased on the correct physical principles, option B is the intended answer.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This is a classic problem involving special relativity, specifically time dilation. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n**1. Identify the Frames of Reference**\n\n*   **Galaxy's Frame (S):** This is the \"stationary\" frame of reference from which we want to measure the distance traveled by the ejecta.\n*   **Ejecta's Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame of reference. The time of 50 seconds is measured in this frame.\n\n**2. Identify the Given Quantities**\n\n*   Relative velocity of the ejecta (S') with respect to the Galaxy (S), `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   Time elapsed in the ejecta's frame, `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is the \"proper time\" because it is measured by a clock that is moving with the ejecta.\n*   The speed of light, `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n**3. Determine the Goal**\n\nWe need to find the distance `d` that the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (S).\n\n**4. Apply the Principles of Special Relativity**\n\n*   **Distance in the Galaxy's Frame:** The distance `d` is the velocity of the ejecta `v` multiplied by the time `Δt` that has passed in the Galaxy's frame.\n    `d = v * Δt`\n\n*   **Time Dilation:** An observer in the Galaxy's frame (S) will measure time passing more slowly for the moving ejecta (S'). This means the time `Δt` measured in the Galaxy's frame will be longer than the proper time `Δt₀` measured in the ejecta's frame. The relationship is given by the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n*   **Lorentz Factor (γ):** The Lorentz factor depends on the relative velocity `v` and is calculated as:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n**5. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`.\n\n1.  **Calculate the ratio `v/c`:**\n    `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n2.  **Calculate `(v/c)²`:**\n    `(0.2)² = 0.04`\n\n3.  **Calculate `γ`:**\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96`\n    `γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.02062`\n\nNow, let's calculate the dilated time `Δt` in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n4.  **Calculate `Δt`:**\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀ ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s ≈ 51.031 s`\n\nFinally, we can calculate the distance `d` traveled in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n5.  **Calculate `d`:**\n    `d = v * Δt ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s ≈ 3,061,860 km`\n\nAlternatively, we can combine the formulas first:\n`d = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt₀) = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n`d = (60,000 km/s * 50 s) / √0.96`\n`d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96 ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\nThe code execution confirmed this calculation.\n\n**6. Compare with the Options**\n\n*   A) 2,880,000 km\n*   B) 3,060,000 km\n*   C) 3,000,000 km\n*   D) 2,940,000 km\n\nOur calculated value of approximately 3,061,862 km is extremely close to option B, 3,060,000 km. The small difference is likely due to the options being created using a rounded value for the Lorentz factor (e.g., rounding `γ ≈ 1.0206` to `1.02`, which gives `d = 60,000 * (1.02 * 50) = 3,060,000`).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer based on the physics is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
