    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct product:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Starting Material\n\nThe starting material is **(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane**.\n\n*   **Structure:** The name describes an epoxide fused to a substituted cyclohexane ring.\n    *   `bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`: This is a cyclohexane ring fused with a cyclopropane ring.\n    *   `7-oxa`: The atom at position 7 (the one-atom bridge of the cyclopropane) is an oxygen. This is the structure of a cyclohexene epoxide. The epoxide is formed between carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   `1,3,4-trimethyl`: Methyl groups are located at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The configuration is given as (1R,3R,4R,6S). We can determine the spatial arrangement (up/down or wedge/dash) of the substituents from these descriptors. Through careful application of the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules:\n    *   The epoxide oxygen is on the **alpha** face (pointing down, dashed bond). This is determined by solving the R/S assignments for C1 and C6 simultaneously.\n    *   The methyl group at **C1** is on the **beta** face (pointing up, wedge bond) to satisfy the **(1R)** configuration.\n    *   The hydrogen at **C6** is on the **beta** face (pointing up, wedge bond) to satisfy the **(6S)** configuration.\n    *   The methyl group at **C3** is on the **alpha** face (pointing down, dash bond) to satisfy the **(3R)** configuration.\n    *   The methyl group at **C4** is on the **beta** face (pointing up, wedge bond) to satisfy the **(4R)** configuration.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Reaction\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Nucleophilic opening of an epoxide. The nucleophile is a methyl group (Me⁻).\n*   **Rules Provided:**\n    1.  The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks the **less hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n    2.  The attack proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked (an Sₙ2 mechanism).\n\n### 3. Apply the Reaction Rules\n\n*   **Regioselectivity (Site of Attack):** The epoxide involves carbons C1 and C6. We must determine which is less hindered for the incoming nucleophile.\n    *   The nucleophile (Me⁻) must attack from the side opposite to the C-O bond. Since the epoxide is alpha (down), the attack must occur from the **beta** (up) face.\n    *   At C1, the beta face is occupied by a bulky methyl group.\n    *   At C6, the beta face is occupied by a small hydrogen atom.\n    *   Therefore, **C6 is the less hindered carbon**, and the nucleophilic attack will occur at C6.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Attack:**\n    *   The Me⁻ nucleophile attacks C6 from the beta face.\n    *   The C6-O bond (which is alpha) breaks, and the electrons move to the oxygen atom. After an acidic workup (implicit in this type of reaction), the oxygen at C1 becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The OH group will be on the **alpha** face (down/dash) at C1.\n    *   The attack at C6 causes inversion of configuration. The initial configuration of C6 was **(S)**. Therefore, the configuration of this carbon in the product will be **(R)**.\n\n### 4. Determine the Product Structure and Name\n\n*   **Structure:** The reaction opens the epoxide ring, resulting in a substituted cyclohexanol.\n    *   An -OH group is at C1 (alpha).\n    *   A new methyl group from the cuprate is at C6 (beta).\n    *   The original methyl groups at C1 (beta), C3 (alpha), and C4 (beta) are unchanged.\n*   **IUPAC Naming:**\n    1.  The parent name is **cyclohexanol**. The carbon with the -OH group is designated as **C1**. This corresponds to the original C1 of the starting material.\n    2.  We number the ring to give the substituent methyl groups the lowest possible locants.\n        *   The methyl groups are at original C1, C6, C3, and C4.\n        *   Let's try numbering counter-clockwise from the new C1 (old C1). The path is C1 → C6 → C5 → C4 → C3 → C2.\n        *   The substituents are at:\n            *   New C1 (Old C1)\n            *   New C2 (Old C6)\n            *   New C4 (Old C4)\n            *   New C5 (Old C3)\n        *   This gives the locant set {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n        *   Numbering clockwise would give {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n        *   According to IUPAC rules, {1, 2, 4, 5} is the correct set as it has a lower number at the first point of difference.\n    3.  The product name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options A and D.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    1.  **New C2 (from Old C6):** The configuration inverts from (S) to **(R)**. So, we are looking for a product with a (2R) configuration. This eliminates option C, which has (2S).\n    2.  This leaves **Option B** as the only possibility.\n\n### 5. Final Check\n\nLet's verify the stereochemistry of Option B: **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   **C2 is (R):** This matches our deduction from the inversion at C6.\n*   **Other centers (C1, C4, C5):** Determining the final R/S labels for the other centers from first principles is complex because the CIP priorities of the neighboring groups change. However, based on the clear chemical principle of inversion at the reaction center, B is the only chemically consistent option among the choices with the correct substituent numbering. The most straightforward logical path leads to the conclusion that the configurations are (1R, 2R, 4R, 5R), likely assuming the R/S descriptors for the non-reacting centers are intended to be preserved in the context of the problem.\n\nBased on the regioselectivity (attack at C6) and the stereochemistry (inversion at C6 from S to R), the resulting product at C2 must have an R configuration. Only option B satisfies this requirement.\n\n<<<B>>>"
