    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown organic compound:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Number of Protons and Structure Size**\n\nFirst, let's sum the integrations of all the signals in the 1H NMR spectrum to determine the total number of protons in the molecule.\n- Integration: 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8H.\nThe unknown compound has a total of 8 protons.\n\nNow, let's determine the number of protons for the possible options:\n- **Propenyl acetate:** The molecular formula is C5H8O2. The structure is CH3-CH=CH-O-CO-CH3. The total number of protons is 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 8H. This matches the NMR data.\n- **Butenyl acetate:** The molecular formula is C6H10O2. For example, 1-butenyl acetate (CH3CH2CH=CH-O-CO-CH3) has 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 10H. This does not match the NMR data.\n\n**Conclusion:** The compound must be a propenyl acetate. This eliminates options A (Cis-butenyl acetate) and C (Trans-butenyl acetate). We are left with Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Signals and Assign them to the Propenyl Acetate Structure**\n\nThe structure is `CH3(c)-CH(b)=CH(a)-O-CO-CH3(d)`. Let's analyze each signal:\n\n- **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** A singlet in the region of ~2.0-2.2 ppm integrating to 3 protons is characteristic of an acetyl methyl group (-O-CO-C**H**3). This proton group (d) has no adjacent protons, so it appears as a singlet. This is consistent with an acetate structure.\n\n- **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This is a methyl group attached to the double bond (`C**H**3(c)-CH=`). It integrates to 3 protons and is a doublet because it is coupled to the single adjacent vinylic proton, H(b).\n\n- **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This signal is for a single proton, H(b). It is split into a doublet by the adjacent vinylic proton H(a), and into a quartet by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (c). This results in a doublet of quartets (dq). Its chemical shift is in the vinylic region.\n\n- **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This signal is for the other single vinylic proton, H(a). It is attached to the carbon bearing the electronegative oxygen atom, which deshields it significantly, shifting it far downfield. It is split into a doublet by the single adjacent vinylic proton, H(b).\n\n### **3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans)**\n\nThe key to distinguishing between the cis and trans isomers is the coupling constant (J) between the two vinylic protons, H(a) and H(b).\n\n- The signal at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a reported coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n- For vinylic protons:\n    - A **trans** configuration typically shows a large coupling constant, usually in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    - A **cis** configuration typically shows a smaller coupling constant, usually in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nSince the observed coupling constant is 16.0 Hz, which falls squarely in the range for a trans coupling, the two vinylic protons are in a **trans** orientation relative to each other.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the total number of protons (8H) and the large vinylic coupling constant (16.0 Hz), the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\nThe structure is:\n      H\n     /\nCH3-C=C-O-CO-CH3\n   /\n  H\n\n<<<D>>>"
