    "This problem requires a step-by-step calculation of ion concentrations in a buffer solution.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species and their initial amounts.**\n    The solution contains potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH₂PO₄) and disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O) dissolved in water.\n    *   KH₂PO₄ dissociates completely into K⁺ and H₂PO₄⁻ (dihydrogen phosphate ion).\n    *   Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O dissociates completely into 2 Na⁺, HPO₄²⁻ (hydrogen phosphate ion), and 2 H₂O.\n    *   The key species for the acid-base equilibria are H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, which form a buffer system.\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial molar concentrations of the buffer components.**\n    *   Volume of the solution (V) = 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L.\n    *   **For KH₂PO₄:**\n        *   Mass = 1.00 g\n        *   Molar Mass (Mw) = 136.09 g/mol\n        *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = Mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 mol.\n        *   Since KH₂PO₄ provides one H₂PO₄⁻ ion, the moles of H₂PO₄⁻ are also 0.007348 mol.\n        *   Initial concentration [H₂PO₄⁻] = Moles / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.03674 M.\n    *   **For Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O:**\n        *   Mass = 1.00 g\n        *   Molar Mass (Mw) = 177.99 g/mol\n        *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = Mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 mol.\n        *   Since Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O provides one HPO₄²⁻ ion, the moles of HPO₄²⁻ are also 0.005618 mol.\n        *   Initial concentration [HPO₄²⁻] = Moles / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.02809 M.\n\n3.  **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] in the buffer solution.**\n    The solution is a buffer composed of the conjugate acid-base pair H₂PO₄⁻ / HPO₄²⁻. The relevant equilibrium is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄):\n    H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka₂ = 6.2 x 10⁻⁸.\n\n    The Ka₂ expression is:\n    Ka₂ = ([H⁺][HPO₄²⁻]) / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for [H⁺]:\n    [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n\n    Since H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ are a buffer pair and their concentrations are relatively high, we can use their initial concentrations as a very good approximation of their equilibrium concentrations.\n    [H⁺] ≈ (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n    [H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M.\n\n4.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion [PO₄³⁻] concentration.**\n    The orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed from the third dissociation of phosphoric acid, which involves the deprotonation of the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻):\n    HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka₃ = 1.8 x 10⁻¹².\n\n    The Ka₃ expression is:\n    Ka₃ = ([H⁺][PO₄³⁻]) / [HPO₄²⁻]\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n    [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n\n    We use the equilibrium concentrations of [H⁺] and [HPO₄²⁻] determined from the buffer system. Because Ka₃ is extremely small, the amount of HPO₄²⁻ that dissociates into PO₄³⁻ is negligible, so we can use the initial concentration of [HPO₄²⁻] (0.02809 M). The [H⁺] concentration is controlled by the main buffer equilibrium and is the value we calculated in the previous step (8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M).\n\n    [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n    [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\n5.  **Final check with a Python script.**\n    To ensure precision, we can perform the calculation using a script.\n\n```python\n# Constants\nmass_KH2PO4 = 1.00  # g\nmw_KH2PO4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmass_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 1.00  # g\nmw_Na2HPO4_2H2O = 177.99 # g/mol\nvolume = 0.200  # L\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Calculate initial concentrations\nconc_H2PO4 = (mass_KH2PO4 / mw_KH2PO4) / volume\nconc_HPO4 = (mass_Na2HPO4_2H2O / mw_Na2HPO4_2H2O) / volume\n\n# Calculate [H+] from the Ka2 equilibrium\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4-] --> [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-]/[HPO4^2-]\nH_plus_conc = Ka2 * (conc_H2PO4 / conc_HPO4)\n\n# Calculate [PO4^3-] from the Ka3 equilibrium\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] --> [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]/[H+]\nPO4_conc = Ka3 * (conc_HPO4 / H_plus_conc)\n\nprint(f\"{PO4_conc:.3e}\")\n```\n\n> 6.236e-07\n\nThe calculation yields a result of 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M, which rounds to 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
