    "This problem requires us to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing yield of the para-isomer upon electrophilic bromination. The yield of the para-isomer is determined by the directing effect of the substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents**\n\nSubstituents on a benzene ring direct incoming electrophiles to specific positions. We can classify them as either *ortho, para*-directors or *meta*-directors.\n*   **Activating groups** are *ortho, para*-directors. They increase the rate of reaction compared to benzene.\n*   **Deactivating groups** are generally *meta*-directors. They decrease the rate of reaction.\n*   **Halogens** are an exception: they are deactivating but are *ortho, para*-directors.\n\nLet's classify the substituent for each substance:\n\n1.  **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene)**: -CH3 (methyl) is an alkyl group. It is an **activating group** and an **ortho, para-director**.\n2.  **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)**: -COOC2H5 (ester) is an electron-withdrawing group. It is a **deactivating group** and a **meta-director**.\n3.  **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene)**: -Cl (chloro) is a halogen. It is a **deactivating group** but an **ortho, para-director**.\n4.  **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene)**: -NO2 (nitro) is a very strong electron-withdrawing group. It is a **deactivating group** and a **meta-director**.\n5.  **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)**: -C2H5 (ethyl) is an alkyl group. It is an **activating group** and an **ortho, para-director**.\n6.  **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid)**: -COOH (carboxyl) is an electron-withdrawing group. It is a **deactivating group** and a **meta-director**.\n\n**Step 2: Separate the compounds into two main groups**\n\n*   **Low para yield group (meta-directors)**: These substances will produce very little para-isomer, as the substituent directs the incoming bromine to the meta position. This group includes:\n    *   4) Nitrobenzene (-NO2)\n    *   6) Benzoic acid (-COOH)\n    *   2) Ethyl benzoate (-COOC2H5)\n\n*   **High para yield group (ortho, para-directors)**: These substances will produce significant amounts of the para-isomer. This group includes:\n    *   1) Toluene (-CH3)\n    *   5) Ethylbenzene (-C2H5)\n    *   3) Chlorobenzene (-Cl)\n\nThe final correct sequence must list all the meta-directors before the ortho, para-directors.\n\n**Step 3: Order the compounds within the low para yield group (meta-directors)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the para position is electronically disfavored. The stronger the deactivating effect of the group, the more strongly it directs to the meta position, and the lower the yield of the ortho and para isomers. We need to compare the deactivating strength of -NO2, -COOH, and -COOC2H5.\n\nThe established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5**\n\nTherefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be the lowest for the strongest deactivating group and highest for the weakest one in this set.\nOrder of increasing para-yield: **-NO2 < -COOH < -COOC2H5**\nThis corresponds to the substance order: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n*   Typical para yield: Nitrobenzene (~0.1%), Benzoic acid (~0.2%), Ethyl benzoate (~3.5%).\n\n**Step 4: Order the compounds within the high para yield group (ortho, para-directors)**\n\nFor ortho, para-directors, the ratio of para to ortho product depends on both electronic and steric effects.\n\n*   **-CH3 (Toluene) vs. -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)**: Both are activating alkyl groups. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased bulk hinders the attack at the adjacent ortho positions, thus favoring substitution at the less hindered para position. Therefore, ethylbenzene will produce a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   % para (Ethylbenzene) > % para (Toluene)\n    *   Order: **1 < 5**\n    *   Typical para yield: Toluene (~66%), Ethylbenzene (~71%).\n\n*   **-Cl (Chlorobenzene) vs. alkyl groups**: Chlorine is a halogen. It is deactivating due to its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I), but it directs ortho/para due to its electron-donating resonance effect (+R). The inductive effect is strongest at the ortho positions, making them more deactivated than the para position. This strong electronic preference leads to a very high yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   % para (Chlorobenzene) is significantly higher than for toluene and ethylbenzene.\n    *   Typical para yield: Chlorobenzene (~87%).\n\nCombining these findings, the order of increasing para yield for the ortho, para-directors is:\n**Toluene < Ethylbenzene < Chlorobenzene**\nThis corresponds to the substance order: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the two groups to get the final order**\n\nWe place the ordered group of meta-directors before the ordered group of ortho, para-directors:\n(4 < 6 < 2) followed by (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe complete order of increasing para-isomer yield is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
