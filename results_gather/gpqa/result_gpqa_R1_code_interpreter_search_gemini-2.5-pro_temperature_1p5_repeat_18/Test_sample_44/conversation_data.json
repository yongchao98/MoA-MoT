    "*   **1. System Identification and Fundamental Principles:**\n    *   The problem involves four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin are fermions.\n    *   Identical fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n    *   The particles are confined to a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n\n*   **2. Single-Particle Energy Levels:**\n    *   The energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well are given by:\n        `E_n = n^2 * (h^2 / 8mL^2)`, where `n = 1, 2, 3, ...` is the principal quantum number.\n    *   The problem defines a base energy unit `E = (π^2 * ħ^2) / (2mL^2)`.\n    *   We need to express `E_n` in terms of `E`. Recalling that `ħ = h / (2π)`, we have `h = 2πħ`.\n        `E_n = n^2 * ((2πħ)^2 / 8mL^2) = n^2 * (4π^2ħ^2 / 8mL^2) = n^2 * (π^2ħ^2 / 2mL^2)`\n    *   Therefore, the single-particle energy levels are simply `E_n = n^2 * E`.\n\n*   **3. State Occupancy due to Pauli Exclusion Principle:**\n    *   For this system, a complete quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum number `n` and the spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (which can be +1/2 for spin up or -1/2 for spin down).\n    *   According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, each unique combination of `(n, m_s)` can be occupied by at most one particle.\n    *   This means for each energy level `n`, there are two possible spin states. Thus, each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of two fermions (one spin up, one spin down).\n\n*   **4. Calculation of State Energies:**\n    *   The total energy of the four-particle system is the sum of the energies of the individual particles.\n\n    *   **Ground State Energy (E_g):**\n        To find the ground state, we fill the energy levels from the lowest energy (`n=1`) upwards, respecting the two-particle limit per level.\n        *   Place 2 particles in the `n=1` level. Their combined energy is `2 * E_1 = 2 * (1^2 * E) = 2E`.\n        *   Place the remaining 2 particles in the `n=2` level. Their combined energy is `2 * E_2 = 2 * (2^2 * E) = 8E`.\n        *   The total ground state energy is the sum:\n            `E_g = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n\n    *   **First Excited State Energy (E_1st):**\n        To get the first excited state, we must promote one particle from the ground state configuration to the next available higher energy level. The lowest energy excitation involves moving a particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).\n        *   The configuration becomes: 2 particles in `n=1`, 1 particle in `n=2`, and 1 particle in `n=3`.\n        *   The total energy is:\n            `E_1st = (2 * E_1) + (1 * E_2) + (1 * E_3)`\n            `E_1st = (2 * 1^2 * E) + (1 * 2^2 * E) + (1 * 3^2 * E)`\n            `E_1st = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n    *   **Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd):**\n        We need to find the configuration with the next-lowest energy above the first excited state. Let's examine the possible excitations from the ground state:\n        *   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`. Configuration: {2 at `n=1`, 1 at `n=2`, 1 at `n=4`}.\n            Energy = `(2*1^2 + 1*2^2 + 1*4^2)E = (2 + 4 + 16)E = 22E`.\n        *   **Possibility B:** Promote one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`. Configuration: {1 at `n=1`, 2 at `n=2`, 1 at `n=3`}.\n            Energy = `(1*1^2 + 2*2^2 + 1*3^2)E = (1 + 8 + 9)E = 18E`.\n        *   **Possibility C:** Promote both particles from `n=2` to `n=3`. Configuration: {2 at `n=1`, 2 at `n=3`}.\n            Energy = `(2*1^2 + 2*3^2)E = (2 + 18)E = 20E`.\n        *   Comparing the energies (15E < 18E < 20E < 22E), the second excited state corresponds to Possibility B.\n        *   The total energy is:\n            `E_2nd = 18E`.\n\n*   **5. Conclusion:**\n    The energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
