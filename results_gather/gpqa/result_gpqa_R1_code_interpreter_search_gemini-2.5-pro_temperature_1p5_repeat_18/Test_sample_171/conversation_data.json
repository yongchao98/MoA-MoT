    "*   **Analyze the physical principle:** The problem describes the population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of stars. The assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) tells us that the distribution of atoms across these energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann distribution.\n\n*   **Formulate the Boltzmann Equation:** The ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (`N_j`) to the number of atoms in a ground state (`N_i`) is given by the Boltzmann equation:\n    N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T)]\n    where:\n    *   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights of the states (which are properties of the atom, not the star).\n    *   `E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the states, which we'll call `ΔE`.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the temperature of the gas.\n\n*   **Define \"Excitation\":** The term \"excitation\" in this context refers to the ratio of atoms in the excited state to those in the ground state (or a lower state). Let's call this excitation ratio `X`.\n    `X = N_j / N_i`\n\n*   **Apply to the two stars:** We can write the excitation equation for each star.\n    *   For star_1 (temperature T_1): `X_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]`\n    *   For star_2 (temperature T_2): `X_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]`\n\n*   **Use the given relationship:** The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice the excitation in star_2.\n    `X_1 = 2 * X_2`\n\n*   **Substitute and solve:**\n    `(g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]`\n\n    The term for the statistical weights, `(g_j / g_i)`, is the same on both sides since it concerns the same energy levels of the same atom (iron), so it cancels out.\n    `exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]`\n\n    Now, we solve for the relationship between the temperatures by taking the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    `ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])`\n\n    Using the logarithm properties `ln(exp(a)) = a` and `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`:\n    `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])`\n    `-ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)`\n\n    Rearrange the equation to isolate `ln(2)`:\n    `ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)`\n\n    Factor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n    `(ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)`\n\n    Combine the terms in the parenthesis by finding a common denominator:\n    `(ΔE / k) * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)] = ln(2)`\n\n*   **Incorporate the given numerical values:** The problem provides:\n    *   Energy difference `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`\n    *   The Boltzmann constant `k` is a fundamental constant with the value `k ≈ 1.380649 x 10^(-23) J/K`\n\n    The ratio `ΔE / k` is therefore:\n    `(1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.380649 x 10^(-23) J/K) ≈ 1 K`\n    The problem is set up so that this pre-factor is essentially equal to 1.\n\n*   **Final Equation:** Substituting `ΔE / k = 1` into our derived equation:\n    `1 * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)] = ln(2)`\n    `ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]`\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
