    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Principle:** The problem connects the lifetime of a quantum state to the uncertainty (or spread) in its energy. This relationship is described by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n2.  **State the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The principle states:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n    where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy.\n    *   Δt is the uncertainty in time.\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h/2π).\n\n3.  **Relate Lifetime to Time Uncertainty:** The lifetime (τ) of an excited state is the characteristic time for which the state exists. We can take this lifetime as the uncertainty in time, Δt. Therefore, Δt ≈ τ. The uncertainty in the energy of a state, often called the natural linewidth, is given by:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy Uncertainty for Each State:** We need to find the energy spread (ΔE) for each of the two states. It is convenient to use the value of ħ in electron-volt-seconds (eV·s):\n    ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s\n\n    *   **For State 1:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\n        *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   **For State 2:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂\n        *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) = 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n5.  **Determine the Condition for \"Clearly Resolving\" the Levels:** To clearly distinguish or resolve two energy levels, their energy separation must be significantly larger than their energy uncertainties (linewidths). A common criterion is that the energy difference between the two levels must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties.\n    *   Required energy difference > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n    *   Required energy difference > (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\n    *   Required energy difference > (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n    *   Required energy difference > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options:** We are looking for an energy difference from the options that satisfies the condition `> 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV`.\n\n    *   A) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is much greater than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV. (10⁻⁴ = 1000 x 10⁻⁷)\n    *   B) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is much smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   C) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV. (10⁻⁸ = 0.1 x 10⁻⁷)\n    *   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is much smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** Only the energy difference in option A (10⁻⁴ eV) is large enough to ensure that the two energy levels can be clearly resolved. The other options represent energy differences that are smaller than the combined spectral width of the two states, meaning their energy distributions would significantly overlap and be indistinguishable.\n\nTo confirm the calculation:\n```python\n# Constants\nhbar_eVs = 6.582e-16  # Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\n\n# Given lifetimes\ntau1 = 1e-9  # seconds\ntau2 = 1e-8  # seconds\n\n# Calculate energy uncertainty (linewidth) for each state using Delta_E ~ hbar / tau\ndelta_E1 = hbar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = hbar_eVs / tau2\n\n# To clearly resolve the two levels, the energy difference should be greater than the sum of their linewidths\nrequired_energy_difference = delta_E1 + delta_E2\n\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty for state 1 (ΔE1): {delta_E1:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy uncertainty for state 2 (ΔE2): {delta_E2:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Required energy difference to resolve (ΔE1 + ΔE2): {required_energy_difference:.3e} eV\")\n\n# Compare with the options\noptions = {'A': 1e-4, 'B': 1e-9, 'C': 1e-8, 'D': 1e-11}\nprint(\"\\nComparing with options:\")\nfor option, value in options.items():\n    if value > required_energy_difference:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is large enough to be resolved.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {option} ({value:.1e} eV) is NOT large enough to be resolved.\")\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The reasoning is based on the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time, which states:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy.\n*   Δt is the uncertainty in time.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\nThe lifetime of a quantum state (τ) can be considered the uncertainty in time (Δt). Therefore, the inherent uncertainty in the energy of a state, also known as its natural linewidth, is given by:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\nTo clearly distinguish or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their energies (E₁ - E₂) must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties (linewidths).\n\nLet's calculate the energy uncertainty for each state:\n\n1.  **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n2.  **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nNow, let's find the minimum energy difference required to resolve them:\n\n*   Required Difference > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n*   Required Difference > (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV)\n*   Required Difference > (6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV) + (0.6582 x 10⁻⁷ eV)\n*   Required Difference > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nWe need to choose an option that is greater than approximately 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nLet's examine the options:\nA) 10⁻⁴ eV = 1000 x 10⁻⁷ eV. This is much greater than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\nB) 10⁻⁹ eV. This is much smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\nC) 10⁻⁸ eV = 0.1 x 10⁻⁷ eV. This is smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\nD) 10⁻¹¹ eV. This is much smaller than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly option A provides an energy difference large enough to clearly resolve the two states, as their energy distributions would not significantly overlap.
