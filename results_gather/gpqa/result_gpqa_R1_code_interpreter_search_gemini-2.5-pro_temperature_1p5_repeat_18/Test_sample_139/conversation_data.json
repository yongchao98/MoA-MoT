    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **Substance X** contains a heavier isotope of one of its elements. It's used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its close analog. Its reaction with a keto acid produces a compound with 2 oxygen atoms. This strongly suggests X is a deuterated reducing agent, like Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄) or Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄). The corresponding common analogs are LiAlH₄ and NaBH₄. The reduction of a keto acid (R-CO-COOH, 3 oxygens) by these agents typically yields a diol (R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH, 2 oxygens) or a hydroxy acid (R-CH(OH)-COOH, 3 oxygens for NaBH4 and 2 for LiAlH4 after acidic workup). The product containing 2 oxygens fits well with a powerful reducing agent like LiAlH₄ or its deuterated version.\n\n    *   **Liquid Y:** Reacts violently with X.\n    *   **Gas W:** Released during the reaction. A key property is that its molecule contains an equal number of neutrons and protons (N=P).\n    *   **Precipitate G:** Forms during the reaction.\n    *   **Substance B:** Released when G is heated. The melting point of B is ~277 K (which is 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C). This melting point is famously that of heavy water (D₂O), which melts at 3.82 °C (276.97 K). Therefore, B is D₂O.\n\n2.  **Synthesize the Clues:**\n    *   Since B is D₂O, the heavier isotope in Substance X must be Deuterium (D, or ²H). This confirms X is a deuterated compound.\n    *   G releases D₂O upon heating. This means G is likely a deuterated hydroxide, as metal hydroxides decompose upon heating to form a metal oxide and water. For example, `2 Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O`. So, G is probably a deuterated metal hydroxide precipitate.\n    *   The reaction `X + Y -> W + G` must form this deuterated hydroxide. This means the metal must come from X and the oxygen must come from Y.\n    *   Let's test the potential candidates for X.\n        *   If X = NaBD₄, the metal is Boron. Boron hydroxides or borates formed (like Na[B(OD)₄]) are generally soluble, which contradicts the formation of a precipitate G.\n        *   If X = LiAlD₄, the metals are Lithium and Aluminum. Aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is a well-known gelatinous precipitate. Therefore, its deuterated analog, Al(OD)₃, would also be a precipitate. This makes LiAlD₄ a very strong candidate for X.\n\n3.  **Identify the Full Reaction:**\n    *   Let's assume **X = LiAlD₄**.\n    *   To form G = Al(OD)₃, X must react with a source of \"OD\" groups. The simplest and most direct way to do this is to react it with **Y = D₂O** (heavy water).\n    *   Let's write the reaction: `LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O -> LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂`\n    *   Now, let's check if this reaction satisfies all the clues:\n        *   **X = LiAlD₄**: A deuterated analog of LiAlH₄, a common organic reagent. (Check)\n        *   **Y = D₂O**: A liquid. (Check)\n        *   **Violent reaction?**: LiAlH₄ reacts violently with water. LiAlD₄'s reaction with D₂O is analogous and also violent. (Check)\n        *   **Precipitate G = Al(OD)₃**: Al(OD)₃ is a solid precipitate. (Check)\n        *   **G --(heat)--> B = D₂O**: `2 Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O`. This releases D₂O. (Check)\n        *   **Gas W = D₂**: Let's check the proton/neutron count for a deuterium molecule (D₂). Each deuterium atom (²H) has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has **2 protons** and **2 neutrons**. The number of protons equals the number of neutrons. (Check)\n\n    *   The proposed reaction system (X=LiAlD₄, Y=D₂O) perfectly matches all the details given in the problem.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen (atomic number 1).\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum (atomic number 13).\n    *   The question states that \"if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed\". We will use the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes.\n        *   **For the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are four atoms of hydrogen in the molecule, all of which are the heavy isotope Deuterium (D or ²H). The mass number of Deuterium is 2. So, the total mass contribution from the lightest element is `4 atoms * 2 = 8`.\n        *   **For the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is one atom of aluminum in the molecule. The only stable isotope of aluminum is ²⁷Al, so its mass number is 27. The total mass contribution from the heaviest element is `1 atom * 27 = 27`.\n    *   The **cumulative atomic mass** is the sum of these two values: `8 + 27 = 35`.\n\n5.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n    *   The calculated value is 35.\n    *   This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
