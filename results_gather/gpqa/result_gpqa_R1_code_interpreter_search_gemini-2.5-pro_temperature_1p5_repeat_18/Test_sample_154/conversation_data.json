    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the uncertainty in the operator $P_z$, denoted as $\\Delta P_z$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Uncertainty Formula:** The uncertainty of an operator $A$ in a given quantum state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is defined by the formula:\n    $\\Delta A = \\sqrt{\\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2}$\n    In our case, we need to find:\n    $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n\n3.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The state of the system is given by the column vector (ket):\n        $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   The matrix representation of the operator $P_z$ is:\n        $P_z = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$:**\n    The expectation value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$ is calculated as $\\langle \\psi | P_z | \\psi \\rangle$.\n    *   First, we need the bra vector $\\langle\\psi|$, which is the conjugate transpose of $|\\psi\\rangle$. Since all elements are real, it's just the transpose:\n        $\\langle\\psi| = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   Next, we calculate the action of the operator $P_z$ on the state $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n        $P_z |\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} (1)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (0)(-1/2) \\\\ (0)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (0)(-1/2) \\\\ (0)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (-1)(-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   Now, we compute the inner product of $\\langle\\psi|$ with $P_z |\\psi\\rangle$:\n        $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | (P_z |\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n        $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left( (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(1/2) \\right)$\n        $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left( \\frac{1}{4} + 0 - \\frac{1}{4} \\right) = 0$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$:**\n    The expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$ is calculated as $\\langle \\psi | P_z^2 | \\psi \\rangle$.\n    *   First, we need to find the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$ by squaring the $P_z$ matrix:\n        $P_z^2 = \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n        $P_z^2 = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   Next, we calculate the action of $P_z^2$ on $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n        $P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   Now, we compute the inner product of $\\langle\\psi|$ with $P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle$:\n        $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | (P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n        $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left( (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-1/2) \\right)$\n        $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{4} + 0 + \\frac{1}{4} \\right) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$:**\n    Now substitute the calculated expectation values into the uncertainty formula:\n    $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n    $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}}$\n    $\\Delta P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated uncertainty is $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$, which corresponds to option B.\n\n*(Self-Correction/Alternative Method): The problem states that the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. The operator $P_z$ is diagonal in this basis, with eigenvalues $\\hbar, 0, -\\hbar$. The given state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is a superposition of these eigenvectors, with coefficients $c_1 = -1/2$, $c_2 = 1/\\sqrt{2}$, and $c_3 = -1/2$. The probability of measuring each eigenvalue is $|c_i|^2$.\n$P(\\hbar) = |-1/2|^2 = 1/4$\n$P(0) = |1/\\sqrt{2}|^2 = 1/2$\n$P(-\\hbar) = |-1/2|^2 = 1/4$\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = (\\hbar)P(\\hbar) + (0)P(0) + (-\\hbar)P(-\\hbar) = \\hbar(1/4) - \\hbar(1/4) = 0$.\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = (\\hbar^2)P(\\hbar) + (0^2)P(0) + (-\\hbar)^2 P(-\\hbar) = \\hbar^2(1/4) + \\hbar^2(1/4) = \\hbar^2/2$.\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2} = \\sqrt{\\hbar^2/2 - 0} = \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$. This confirms the result.*\n\n<<<B>>>"
