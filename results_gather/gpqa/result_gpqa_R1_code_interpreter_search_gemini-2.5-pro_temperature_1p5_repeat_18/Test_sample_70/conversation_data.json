    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 (T_eq4 / T_eq2).\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by:\n    T_eq = T_star * ( (1 - A) * R_star^2 / (4 * a^2) )^(1/4)\n    Where:\n    *   T_star is the star's temperature.\n    *   R_star is the star's radius.\n    *   'A' is the planet's albedo.\n    *   'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n    For a circular orbit, the semi-major axis 'a' is the same as the orbital radius 'r'. The formula can be simplified for proportionality:\n    T_eq ∝ (1 - A)^(1/4) / sqrt(r)\n\n3.  **Set up the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio T_eq4 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = [ (1 - A4)^(1/4) / sqrt(r4) ] / [ (1 - A2)^(1/4) / sqrt(r2) ]\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:**\n    *   The problem states that the planets have the same albedo (A), so A4 = A2. This means the (1 - A) terms cancel out.\n    *   The expression simplifies to:\n        T_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt(r2) / sqrt(r4) = sqrt(r2 / r4)\n\n5.  **Relate Orbital Radius to Orbital Period using Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law for planets orbiting the same star states that the square of the orbital period (T) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a), or orbital radius (r) for circular orbits.\n    T² ∝ r³\n    This means T² / r³ = constant for all planets in the system.\n\n6.  **Apply Kepler's Law to the two planets:**\n    T2² / r2³ = T4² / r4³\n\n7.  **Solve for the Radius Ratio (r2 / r4):**\n    Rearrange the equation:\n    r2³ / r4³ = T2² / T4²\n    (r2 / r4)³ = (T2 / T4)²\n    r2 / r4 = (T2 / T4)^(2/3)\n\n8.  **Substitute the Radius Ratio into the Temperature Ratio Equation:**\n    From step 4, we have T_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt(r2 / r4).\n    Substitute the expression for r2 / r4 from step 7:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (T2 / T4)^(2/3) )\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (T2 / T4)^((2/3) * (1/2))\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (T2 / T4)^(1/3)\n\n9.  **Use the Given Period Ratios:** The problem gives the ratio of orbital periods as T1:T2:T3:T4:T5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n    *   The ratio value for T2 is 2.\n    *   The ratio value for T4 is 3.5.\n    *   So, T2 / T4 = 2 / 3.5.\n\n10. **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (4 / 7)^(1/3)\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3)\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.8298\n\n11. **Compare with Options:** The calculated value ~0.83 matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
