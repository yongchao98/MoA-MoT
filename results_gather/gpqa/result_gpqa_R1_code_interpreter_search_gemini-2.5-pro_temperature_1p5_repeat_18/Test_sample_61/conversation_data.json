    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning to find the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Name:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde\n*   **Parent Structure:** \"cyclohexanecarbaldehyde\" refers to a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (-CHO) attached. The carbon atom of the ring to which the -CHO group is attached is designated as C1.\n*   **Substituent:** The substituent is \"cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl\", which means a methyl group (-CH₂-) that is itself substituted with a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxy (-OH) group. This forms the group -CH(OH)(C₆H₁₁).\n*   **Position:** The \"1-\" indicates this substituent is attached to the same carbon (C1) of the cyclohexane ring as the carbaldehyde group.\n*   **Overall Structure:** The target molecule is the product of a self-aldol addition reaction of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (C₆H₁₁-CHO). One molecule acts as the nucleophile (after deprotonation at C1 to form an enolate) and the other acts as the electrophile.\n\n    ```\n      O                OH O\n     //               |  //\n    2 C₆H₁₁-C-H  --[Base]-->  C₆H₁₀(-C-H)-CH-C₆H₁₁\n    ```\n    The structure has a C14 skeleton (6+1+1+6=14 carbons if you count the skeleton, or two C7 units combining), containing two cyclohexyl rings.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Material**\n\n*   **Name:** Ethynylcyclohexane\n*   **Structure:** C₆H₁₁-C≡CH\n*   This molecule has one cyclohexyl group and a total of 8 carbon atoms.\n\n**3. Devise a General Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe synthesis requires two key transformations:\n1.  Convert the starting material, ethynylcyclohexane (a C8 compound with one cyclohexyl group), into the key intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (a C7 compound).\n2.  Induce the self-aldol addition of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde to form the final C14 product, which has two cyclohexyl groups. This implies that the overall reaction consumes two equivalents of the starting material, which are converted to two equivalents of the intermediate aldehyde before the final step.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences**\n\nLet's examine each option to see if it accomplishes our required synthesis. The goal is to generate cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (C₆H₁₁-CHO) and then treat it with a base.\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH₂, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   Step 1: NaNH₂ is a strong base that deprotonates the terminal alkyne. Methanol would react with NaNH₂ or protonate the resulting acetylide, making this step unclear or unproductive.\n    *   Even if we assume steps 1 & 2 somehow convert the alkyne to an alkene (C₆H₁₁-CH=CH₂), the ozonolysis in step 3 would yield cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (C₆H₁₁-CHO) and formaldehyde (HCHO).\n    *   Step 4 would then promote an aldol reaction between C₆H₁₁-CHO and HCHO. The product would be 1-(hydroxymethyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, not the target molecule which contains a second cyclohexyl group. So, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)₂; 3. H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**\n    *   Step 1: NaNH₂ deprotonates the alkyne, and the resulting acetylide reacts with methyl chloride to give 1-cyclohexyl-1-propyne (C₆H₁₁-C≡C-CH₃). This correctly adds a methyl group.\n    *   Step 2: H₂/Pd is a strong hydrogenation catalyst that reduces the alkyne all the way to an alkane: propylcyclohexane (C₆H₁₁-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃). It is impossible to form an aldehyde from this saturated alkane with the subsequent reagents. So, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. Ba(OH)₂**\n    *   Step 1: As in B, this step produces 1-cyclohexyl-1-propyne (C₆H₁₁-C≡C-CH₃).\n    *   Step 2: H₂/Pd-CaCO₃ is Lindlar's catalyst, which reduces an alkyne to a *cis*-alkene. The product is (Z)-1-cyclohexylprop-1-ene (C₆H₁₁-CH=CH-CH₃).\n    *   Step 3: Ozonolysis of this alkene with a reductive workup ((CH₃)₂S) cleaves the double bond to yield two aldehydes: cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (C₆H₁₁-CHO) and acetaldehyde (CH₃CHO).\n    *   Step 4: Ba(OH)₂ is a base that will catalyze an aldol reaction. In the mixture of aldehydes, four different aldol products are possible. One of these is the self-condensation product of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is the desired target molecule, 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Although other products are formed, this sequence does produce the target compound.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ H₂O; 4. NH₄OH**\n    *   Step 1: Alkylation with ethyl chloride gives 1-cyclohexyl-1-butyne (C₆H₁₁-C≡C-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   Step 2: Li/liq. NH₃ reduces the internal alkyne to a *trans*-alkene.\n    *   Step 3: Ozonolysis with an *oxidative* workup (H₂O instead of (CH₃)₂S) oxidizes the resulting aldehyde fragments to carboxylic acids. The products would be cyclohexanecarboxylic acid (C₆H₁₁-COOH) and propanoic acid (CH₃CH₂COOH), not the required aldehyde. So, this option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly option C provides a chemically sound pathway that generates the necessary intermediate (cyclohexanecarbaldehyde) and then uses a standard reaction (aldol addition) to form the final target molecule.\n\n<<<C>>>"
