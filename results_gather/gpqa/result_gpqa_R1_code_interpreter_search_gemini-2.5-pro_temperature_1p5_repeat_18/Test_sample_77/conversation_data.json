    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning process to arrive at the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem Setup\n\nWe are asked for the scalar potential `V` and vector potential `A` generated by a moving point charge `q`. The key challenge in this problem, as opposed to a static charge (electrostatics) or a charge moving at constant velocity (magnetostatics), is that the electromagnetic \"news\" (the field) travels at a finite speed, `c`.\n\nThis means that the field we observe at a point `r` at time `t` was not generated by the charge at its current position `s(t)`, but by the charge at some earlier position `s(tr)` at an earlier time `tr`, called the **retarded time**.\n\n### 2. Key Quantities and Definitions\n\n*   **q**: The charge of the point particle.\n*   **`s(t)`**: The position vector of the charge as a function of time. This is the trajectory.\n*   **`r`**: The position vector of the point where we are observing the field (the field point).\n*   **t**: The time at which we are observing the field.\n*   **`tr`**: The retarded time, i.e., the time when the field was generated by the charge.\n*   **`s(tr)`**: The position of the charge at the retarded time `tr`.\n*   **`v = ds(t)/dt` evaluated at `t = tr`**: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n*   **`d = r - s(tr)`**: The vector pointing from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n*   **`d = |d|`**: The distance from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n\n### 3. The Concept of Retarded Time\n\nThe signal (the electromagnetic field) travels the distance `d` from `s(tr)` to `r` at the speed of light `c`. The time taken for this journey is `d/c`. Therefore, the time of observation `t` is related to the time of emission `tr` by:\n`t = tr + d/c`\nor, solving for `tr`:\n`tr = t - d/c = t - |r - s(tr)|/c`\n\nThis is an implicit equation for `tr`, as `tr` appears on both sides. However, for a given trajectory `s(t)`, it has a unique solution.\n\n### 4. The Retarded Potentials (General Form)\n\nFor any arbitrary charge distribution `ρ` and current distribution `J`, the potentials are given by the retarded potential formulas:\n\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', tr')] / |r - r'| d³r'`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', tr')] / |r - r'| d³r'`\n\nwhere `tr' = t - |r - r'| / c` is the retarded time for each source point `r'`.\n\n### 5. Applying to a Point Charge\n\nFor a point charge `q` at position `s(t)`, the charge and current densities are represented by Dirac delta functions:\n*   `ρ(r', t') = q * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n*   `J(r', t') = q * v(t') * δ³(r' - s(t'))`\n\nSubstituting these into the general formulas and performing the integration is a standard but somewhat complex derivation found in advanced electromagnetism textbooks (like Griffiths or Jackson). The crucial part of the derivation involves handling the delta function whose argument depends on the integration variable through the retarded time, which requires a Jacobian correction factor.\n\nThe result of this integration is the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**.\n\n### 6. The Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\n\nThe standard result from this derivation is:\n\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * q / (d - (d · v)/c)`\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * (q * v) / (d - (d · v)/c)`\n\nwhere all quantities on the right-hand side (`d`, `d`, and `v`) must be evaluated at the **retarded time `tr`**.\n\n### 7. Matching with the Options\n\nLet's re-write the derived formulas to match the format of the options provided. We can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n\n*   **Scalar Potential V:**\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * q / (d - (d · v)/c)`\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * qc / (dc - d · v)`\n    In the problem's notation, this is `V(r,t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`.\n\n*   **Vector Potential A:**\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * (q * v) / (d - (d · v)/c)`\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * (qc * v) / (dc - d · v)`\n    In the problem's notation, this is `\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}`.\n\nNow, we compare these results with the given options:\n\n*   **A)** `V(...) = ... / (dc + d·v)`, `A(...) = ... / (dc + d·v)` -> Incorrect sign in the denominator.\n*   **B)** `V(...) = ... / (dc - d·v)`, `A(...) = ... / (dc - d·v)` -> **This matches our derived potentials perfectly.**\n*   **C)** `V = q/(4πε₀r)` -> This is the static potential, ignoring retardation and the motion correction factor. Incorrect.\n*   **D)** `V = q/(4πε₀r)` -> Same as C. Incorrect. Although the relation `A = (v/c²)V` holds for the correct Liénard-Wiechert potentials (since `μ₀ε₀ = 1/c²`), the expression for `V` itself is the static one, making the option incorrect as a general solution.\n\nTherefore, option B provides the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<B>>>"
