    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the maximum speed $v_{max}$ of the relativistic harmonic oscillator.\n\n**1. Principle of Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe problem involves a conservative force (the spring force), so the total energy of the system is conserved. The system consists of the mass and the potential energy stored in the spring.\n\nThe total energy of the system, $E_{sys}$, is the sum of the relativistic energy of the mass and the potential energy of the spring:\n$E_{sys} = E_{mass} + U(x)$\n\nThe relativistic energy of the mass is given by $E_{mass} = \\gamma mc^2$, where $m$ is the rest mass, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\nThe potential energy stored in the spring is given by Hooke's Law: $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, where $k$ is the spring constant and $x$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position.\n\n**2. Energy at Maximum Amplitude (x = A)**\n\nAt the maximum amplitude, $x = A$, the mass is momentarily at rest.\n*   The velocity of the mass is $v = 0$.\n*   This means the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n*   The energy of the mass is its rest energy: $E_{mass, A} = 1 \\cdot mc^2 = mc^2$.\n*   The potential energy stored in the spring is at its maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\nSo, the total energy of the system at this point is:\n$E_{sys} = E_{mass, A} + U(A) = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n**3. Energy at Equilibrium Position (x = 0)**\n\nThe mass reaches its maximum speed, $v_{max}$, when it passes through the equilibrium position, $x = 0$.\n*   The displacement is $x = 0$.\n*   The potential energy stored in the spring is zero: $U(0) = 0$.\n*   The velocity of the mass is $v = v_{max}$.\n*   The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n*   The energy of the mass is at its maximum: $E_{mass, 0} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$.\n\nSo, the total energy of the system at this point is:\n$E_{sys} = E_{mass, 0} + U(0) = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n**4. Equating the Energies and Solving for v_max**\n\nBy the principle of conservation of energy, the total energy at the maximum amplitude must equal the total energy at the equilibrium position:\n$mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\nNow, we solve this equation for $v_{max}$.\nFirst, solve for $\\gamma_{max}$ by dividing the entire equation by $mc^2$:\n$\\frac{mc^2}{mc^2} + \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2} = \\frac{\\gamma_{max}mc^2}{mc^2}$\n$1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\gamma_{max}$\n\nNow, substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n$1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\nTo isolate $v_{max}$, we square both sides of the equation:\n$(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}$\n\nNext, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n$\\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2} = 1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for the term with $v_{max}$:\n$\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\nFinally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n$v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n**Non-relativistic Check:**\nIn the classical limit where the speed is much less than $c$, the term $\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$ is very small. Let $\\epsilon = \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \\ll 1$.\n$v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - (1+\\epsilon)^{-2}}$\nUsing the binomial approximation $(1+\\epsilon)^n \\approx 1+n\\epsilon$:\n$(1+\\epsilon)^{-2} \\approx 1 - 2\\epsilon = 1 - 2(\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}) = 1 - \\frac{kA^2}{mc^2}$\n$v_{max} \\approx c \\sqrt{1 - (1 - \\frac{kA^2}{mc^2})} = c \\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{mc^2}} = c \\frac{\\sqrt{kA^2}}{c\\sqrt{m}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$\nThis is the correct non-relativistic formula for the maximum speed, which confirms our relativistic derivation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
