    "To determine if a compound is optically active, we need to assess its chirality. A compound is optically active if it is chiral and is not present as a racemic mixture (a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers). The compounds listed are given as specific stereoisomers (or without any stereochemical designation, implying a racemic mixture or an achiral compound). We will analyze each one for chirality. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common structural feature leading to chirality is the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups), but the ultimate test is the absence of any plane of symmetry or center of inversion in the molecule.\n\nLet's examine each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`\n    *   **Analysis:** This is an alkene. The atoms involved in the double bond (C1 and C2) and the atoms directly attached to them lie in a single plane. This plane of the molecule itself serves as a plane of symmetry. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Analysis:** The name explicitly includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. This notation is used to specify the absolute configuration of specific chiral centers in the molecule, meaning a single enantiomer is being described. While the parent structure (without the `8-(chloromethylene)` group) is a meso compound and thus achiral, the addition of a substituent breaks the internal symmetry. A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is, by definition, optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule possesses two chiral centers (C2 and C3). The substituents on C2 are identical to those on C3. The configurations are given as opposite `(R,S)`. This is the definition of a meso compound. A meso compound has a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry and is achiral despite having chiral centers.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. It has two chiral centers with the same configuration `(R,R)`. The molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is chiral. Its non-superimposable mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` stereoisomer. The name specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Analysis:** The carbon atom with the `-OH` group (C1) is bonded to four different groups: (1) `-H`, (2) `-OH`, (3) `-CH2-CH=CH-` (pathway around the ring in one direction), and (4) `-CH2-CH2-CH=` (pathway around the ring in the other direction). The two pathways around the ring are different due to the location of the double bond. Therefore, C1 is a chiral center. The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Analysis:** This name, with identical stereodescriptors, most likely refers to the highly symmetric all-cis isomer. In this molecule, the three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring. Let's check the potential chiral centers C1, C3, and C5. From C1, the path to C2 and then to C3(OH) is identical to the path to C6 and then to C5(OH). Thus, the carbons bearing the OH groups are not chiral centers. The molecule has several planes of symmetry (e.g., a plane passing through one C-OH bond and the opposite CH2 group). It is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** `(cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's look for any chiral centers. The carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized. The carbon `CH(CH3)2` is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not chiral. In the cyclopentyl ring, the carbon attached to the carbonyl is bonded to two identical `-CH2-` groups within the ring. The molecule has no chiral centers. It also has a plane of symmetry in achievable conformations. Thus, it is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Optically **inactive**.\n\nCounting the number of optically active compounds from the list:\n- (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n- (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n- (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>"
