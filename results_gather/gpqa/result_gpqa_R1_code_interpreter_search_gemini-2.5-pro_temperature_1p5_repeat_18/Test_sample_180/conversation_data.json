    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Event:** The pp-III branch of the proton-proton chain in the Sun's core stops. The effect is just reaching Earth (travel time ~8.5 mins).\n    *   **Condition:** All other solar nuclear reactions (pp-I, pp-II, CNO cycle) continue normally.\n    *   **Goal:** Calculate the ratio of neutrino flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV) to the flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV).\n    *   **Ratio = Flux(Band 1) / Flux(Band 2)**\n\n2.  **Identify Solar Neutrino Sources and Their Energies:**\n    We need to know which reactions produce neutrinos in or near our energy bands of interest. Let's list the main sources and their characteristics:\n    *   **pp-I Chain:**\n        *   `p + p → ²H + e⁺ + νₑ` (pp neutrinos): Continuous spectrum with a maximum energy of 420 keV.\n    *   **pp-II Chain:**\n        *   `⁷Be + e⁻ → ⁷Li + νₑ` (⁷Be neutrinos): Produces a sharp, monochromatic line of neutrinos. The vast majority (~90%) are at **861 keV**, with a smaller line at 384 keV. This reaction is part of the pp-II branch, which the problem states is *unaffected*.\n    *   **pp-III Chain:**\n        *   `⁸B → ⁸Be* + e⁺ + νₑ` (⁸B neutrinos): Continuous spectrum with a high maximum energy (~15 MeV). **This is the reaction that has stopped.**\n    *   **CNO Cycle:**\n        *   `¹³N → ¹³C + e⁺ + νₑ`: Continuous spectrum, max energy 1200 keV (1.20 MeV).\n        *   `¹⁵O → ¹⁵N + e⁺ + νₑ`: Continuous spectrum, max energy 1730 keV (1.73 MeV).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Neutrino Flux in Each Energy Band *After* the Change:**\n\n    *   **Band 1 (700 keV - 800 keV):**\n        *   **pp neutrinos?** No, their maximum energy is 420 keV.\n        *   **⁷Be neutrinos?** No, the strong line is at 861 keV, which is outside this band.\n        *   **⁸B neutrinos?** No, this source has been turned off.\n        *   **CNO neutrinos?** Yes. Both the ¹³N and ¹⁵O neutrinos have continuous spectra that extend through this energy range.\n        *   **Conclusion for Band 1:** The only source of neutrinos is the continuous spectrum from the CNO cycle.\n\n    *   **Band 2 (800 keV - 900 keV):**\n        *   **pp neutrinos?** No.\n        *   **⁷Be neutrinos?** **Yes.** The extremely intense, monochromatic line at **861 keV** falls squarely in the middle of this band.\n        *   **⁸B neutrinos?** No, source is off.\n        *   **CNO neutrinos?** Yes, their continuous spectra also pass through this band.\n        *   **Conclusion for Band 2:** The flux is composed of two parts: the CNO continuous spectrum and the very strong ⁷Be line.\n\n4.  **Compare the Magnitudes of the Fluxes:**\n    To find the ratio, we need to compare the size of the contributions. We can use typical flux values from the Standard Solar Model.\n    *   **⁷Be Line Flux:** The total flux from the 861 keV line is enormous, approximately **5 x 10⁹ neutrinos per cm² per second**. Since the entire line is within Band 2, this entire flux contributes to Band 2.\n    *   **CNO Continuous Flux:** The total flux from ¹³N and ¹⁵O neutrinos combined is much smaller, roughly 5 x 10⁸ per cm² per second. Critically, this flux is spread out over an energy range of >1 MeV. To find the flux within a small 100 keV (0.1 MeV) band, we need to consider the differential flux (flux per unit energy).\n        *   A good estimate for the combined CNO differential flux in the 700-900 keV region is about 5 x 10⁸ neutrinos / (cm² s MeV).\n    *   **Calculating the flux in each band:**\n        *   **Flux (Band 1):** This is just the CNO contribution over a 100 keV range.\n            *   Flux(Band 1) ≈ (5 x 10⁸ / (cm² s MeV)) * (0.1 MeV) = **5 x 10⁷ / (cm² s)**\n        *   **Flux (Band 2):** This is the sum of the massive ⁷Be line and the CNO contribution.\n            *   Flux(Band 2) = Flux(⁷Be line) + Flux(CNO in band 2)\n            *   Flux(Band 2) ≈ (5 x 10⁹) + (5 x 10⁸ * 0.1) = 5 x 10⁹ + 5 x 10⁷\n            *   Flux(Band 2) ≈ 5.05 x 10⁹ / (cm² s)\n\n    Notice that the CNO contribution in Band 2 (5 x 10⁷) is only about 1% of the ⁷Be contribution (5 x 10⁹). Therefore, the flux in Band 2 is completely dominated by the ⁷Be line.\n    *   Flux (Band 1) ≈ 5 x 10⁷\n    *   Flux (Band 2) ≈ 5 x 10⁹\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:**\n    *   Ratio = Flux (Band 1) / Flux (Band 2)\n    *   Ratio ≈ (5 x 10⁷) / (5 x 10⁹)\n    *   Ratio ≈ 1 / 100\n    *   Ratio ≈ **0.01**\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
