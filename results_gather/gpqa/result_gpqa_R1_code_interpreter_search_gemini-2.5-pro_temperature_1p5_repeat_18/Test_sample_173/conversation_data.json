    "Here's a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n### **1. Define variables and extract given information**\n\n*   Initial nucleus rest mass: `M`\n*   Initial nucleus rest-mass energy: `Mc² = 300 GeV`\n*   The nucleus is initially at rest, so its initial momentum is zero.\n*   Fragment 1 (more massive) rest mass: `m₁`\n*   Fragment 2 (less massive) rest mass: `m₂`\n*   Kinetic energy of the more massive fragment: `T₁`\n*   Kinetic energy of the less massive fragment: `T₂`\n\nWe are given the following relationships:\n1.  `m₁ = 2 * m₂`\n2.  `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M`\n\n### **2. Calculate the rest masses of the fragments**\n\nFrom the given information, we can calculate the rest-mass energies (`mc²`) of the fragments.\n\n*   `Mc² = 300 GeV`\n*   The sum of the fragments' rest-mass energies is:\n    `m₁c² + m₂c² = (m₁ + m₂)c² = 0.99 * Mc² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`\n*   We also know `m₁c² = 2 * m₂c²`. Substituting this into the sum:\n    `2 * m₂c² + m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    `3 * m₂c² = 297 GeV`\n    `m₂c² = 99 GeV`\n*   Now, we can find the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment:\n    `m₁c² = 2 * m₂c² = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`\n\n### **3. Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value)**\n\nThe fission process converts some of the initial rest mass into the kinetic energy of the fragments. This released energy, known as the Q-value, is the total kinetic energy `T₁ + T₂`.\n\n*   `Q = Initial Rest-Mass Energy - Final Rest-Mass Energy`\n*   `Q = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n*   Therefore, `T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV`.\n\n### **4. Classical (Non-Relativistic) Calculation of T₁**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is `T = p² / (2m)`, where `p` is momentum.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total final momentum must be zero. The two fragments fly apart with equal and opposite momenta. Let `p` be the magnitude of the momentum of each fragment.\n    `|p₁| = |p₂| = p`\n*   **Kinetic Energies:**\n    `T₁_classical = p² / (2m₁)`\n    `T₂_classical = p² / (2m₂)`\n*   **Ratio of Kinetic Energies:** We can find the ratio `T₁/T₂`:\n    `(T₁_classical) / (T₂_classical) = (p² / (2m₁)) / (p² / (2m₂)) = m₂ / m₁`\n*   Since `m₁ = 2m₂`, the ratio is `m₂ / (2m₂) = 1/2`.\n    `T₁_classical / T₂_classical = 1/2  =>  T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`\n*   **Solving for T₁_classical:** We use the total kinetic energy `Q`:\n    `T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁_classical + 2 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n    `T₁_classical = 1 GeV = 1000 MeV`\n\n### **5. Relativistic Calculation of T₁ (Correct Value)**\n\nIn special relativity, the relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is `E² = (pc)² + (m_0c²)²`. The kinetic energy is `T = E - m_0c²`.\n\n*   From the energy-momentum relation, we can write `(pc)² = E² - (m_0c²)²`.\n*   Substituting `E = T + m_0c²`, we get:\n    `(pc)² = (T + m_0c²)² - (m_0c²)² = T² + 2T(m_0c²) + (m_0c²)² - (m_0c²)² = T(T + 2m_0c²)`\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** As before, `|p₁| = |p₂|`, which means `p₁² = p₂²`.\n    `T₁(T₁ + 2m₁c²) = T₂(T₂ + 2m₂c²)`\n*   **Solving for T₁ (Relativistic):** We substitute `T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁` and the rest-mass energy values we found:\n    `m₁c² = 198 GeV`\n    `m₂c² = 99 GeV`\n    `T₁(T₁ + 2 * 198) = (3 - T₁)((3 - T₁) + 2 * 99)`\n    `T₁(T₁ + 396) = (3 - T₁)(3 - T₁ + 198)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = (3 - T₁)(201 - T₁)`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = 603 - 3T₁ - 201T₁ + T₁²`\n    `T₁² + 396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁ + T₁²`\n    `396T₁ = 603 - 204T₁`\n    `396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603`\n    `600T₁ = 603`\n    `T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV = 1005 MeV`\n\n### **6. Find the Difference**\n\nThe final step is to find the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation.\n\n*   `Difference = T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical`\n*   `Difference = 1005 MeV - 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThe difference between the two values is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<D>>>"
