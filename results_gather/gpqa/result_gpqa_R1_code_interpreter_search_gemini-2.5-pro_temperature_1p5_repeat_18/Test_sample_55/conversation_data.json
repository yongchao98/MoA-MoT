    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Process:** The problem describes a two-step radiative decay from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state of a hydrogen atom to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. This is a cascade decay, proceeding through an intermediate state. The transitions are specified as electric dipole transitions.\n\n2.  **Recall Dipole Transition Selection Rules:** Electric dipole transitions are governed by a set of selection rules for the quantum numbers $(n, l, m)$:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer, but for decay (spontaneous emission), energy must decrease, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State:**\n    The decay proceeds in two steps: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **First Transition:** From $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n        *   Initial quantum numbers: $n_i=3, l_i=0, m_i=0$.\n        *   Applying selection rules for $l$: $\\Delta l = l' - l_i = \\pm 1 \\Rightarrow l' - 0 = \\pm 1 \\Rightarrow l' = 1$.\n        *   Applying selection rules for $m$: $\\Delta m = m' - m_i = 0, \\pm 1 \\Rightarrow m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1 \\Rightarrow m' = 0, 1, -1$.\n        *   For the principal quantum number $n'$, it must be less than 3. The problem options consistently point to an intermediate state with $n'=2$. This is physically the most likely transition ($3s \\to 2p$).\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second Transition:** From the intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   Initial quantum numbers for this step: $n'=2, l'=1, m'$.\n        *   Final quantum numbers: $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n        *   Checking selection rules:\n            *   $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n            *   $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m'$. This is allowed if $m' \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$.\n        *   So, all three possible intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Identify the Possible Decay Routes:** Based on the above analysis, there are three possible routes for the cascade decay:\n    *   Route 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Route 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Route 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    All routes listed in the options are valid.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route:**\n    The \"probability\" of a specific decay route refers to its branching ratio: the fraction of atoms in the initial state that will follow this particular path to the final state.\n    The probability for a route $|i\\rangle \\to |k\\rangle \\to |f\\rangle$ is given by the product of the branching ratios of each step:\n    $P(\\text{route via } |k\\rangle) = Br(i \\to k) \\times Br(k \\to f)$\n\n    *   **Branching Ratio for the second step, $Br(k \\to f)$:**\n        The intermediate state is $|k\\rangle = |2,1,m'\\rangle$. The only state with lower energy it can decay to via a dipole transition is the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (since for n=1, l must be 0). Therefore, this is the only possible decay channel for the state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$. This means its branching ratio is 1.\n        $Br(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\n    *   **Branching Ratio for the first step, $Br(i \\to k)$:**\n        The initial state is $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$. The possible decay channels are to the three intermediate states $|k\\rangle = |2,1,m'\\rangle$ where $m' \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$. The branching ratio for the transition to a specific state, say $|2,1,0\\rangle$, is:\n        $Br(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle)}{\\Gamma_{total}(|3,0,0\\rangle)}$\n        where $\\Gamma$ is the transition rate.\n        $\\Gamma_{total}(|3,0,0\\rangle) = \\sum_{m'=-1,0,1} \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle)$\n\n    *   **Relative Transition Rates for the first step:**\n        The transition rate for spontaneous emission is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element: $\\Gamma(i \\to k) \\propto |\\langle k | -e\\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2$.\n        The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, which means it is spherically symmetric. Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the decay probability is isotropic. This means the transition rates to the different magnetic sublevels of the final state must be equal.\n        $\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle)$.\n        Let's call this rate $\\Gamma_A$.\n\n    *   **Calculating the Branching Ratio:**\n        $\\Gamma_{total}(|3,0,0\\rangle) = \\Gamma_A + \\Gamma_A + \\Gamma_A = 3\\Gamma_A$.\n        The branching ratio for the transition to any specific intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is:\n        $Br(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle) = \\frac{\\Gamma_A}{3\\Gamma_A} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n6.  **Final Probability Calculation:**\n    The probability for any of the three routes is:\n    $P(\\text{route via } |2,1,m'\\rangle) = Br(|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle) \\times Br(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The probability for the specific route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches option C.\n\nThe problem asks for the transition route and the corresponding probability.\nOption C provides the route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and the probability $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches our derivation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
