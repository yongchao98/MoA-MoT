    "This problem requires calculating the distribution of cobalt species in a solution. Specifically, we need to find the fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, relative to the total cobalt concentration. This fraction is known as the alpha fraction, denoted as α₂.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species:** In a solution containing Co²⁺ and SCN⁻, several complex species will form in equilibrium. The species are Co²⁺, [Co(SCN)]⁺, [Co(SCN)₂], [Co(SCN)₃]⁻, and [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻.\n\n2.  **Define the equilibria:** The formation of these complexes is described by overall stability constants (β):\n    *   Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺ ; β₁ = 9\n    *   Co²⁺ + 2 SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂] ; β₂ = 40\n    *   Co²⁺ + 3 SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ ; β₃ = 63\n    *   Co²⁺ + 4 SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ ; β₄ = 16\n\n3.  **Define the total concentration:** The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n4.  **Express concentrations in terms of [Co²⁺]:** Using the stability constants, we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]` and the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`:\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n5.  **Derive the formula for the alpha fraction (α₂):** The alpha fraction for the `[Co(SCN)₂]` species (α₂) is the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration:\n    `α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n\n    By substituting the expressions from steps 3 and 4, we get:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n    We can cancel `[Co²⁺]` from the numerator and the denominator:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n6.  **Use the given concentrations:** The problem states that the total cobalt concentration `c(Co) = 10⁻² M` and the thiocyanate concentration `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`. Since the thiocyanate concentration is ten times larger than the total cobalt concentration, we can assume that the concentration of free thiocyanate ligand `[SCN⁻]` is approximately equal to its initial concentration, `0.1 M`.\n\n7.  **Calculate α₂:** Now we can plug the values into the derived formula. Let `L = [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`.\n    *   Numerator = `β₂ * L² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n    *   Denominator = `1 + (β₁ * L) + (β₂ * L²) + (β₃ * L³) + (β₄ * L⁴)`\n        *   `1`\n        *   `β₁ * L = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n        *   `β₂ * L² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n        *   `β₃ * L³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n        *   `β₄ * L⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n    *   Denominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n    `α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646`\n\n8.  **Final Computation:** To get a precise result, we can use a simple python script.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nL = 0.1  # [SCN-] concentration\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n\n# Calculate the numerator for the alpha fraction of the [Co(SCN)2] complex\nnumerator_alpha2 = beta2 * (L**2)\n\n# Calculate the denominator, which is the sum of terms for all species\ndenominator = 1 + beta1 * L + beta2 * (L**2) + beta3 * (L**3) + beta4 * (L**4)\n\n# Calculate the alpha fraction\nalpha2 = numerator_alpha2 / denominator\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage_alpha2 = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(percentage_alpha2)\n```\n\nThe result of this calculation is approximately 16.916%. Comparing this with the given options:\nA) 38.1%\nB) 25.6%\nC) 42.3%\nD) 16.9%\n\nThe calculated percentage (16.916%) matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, in a solution containing Co(II) and SCN⁻ ions.\n\n**1. Understand the System:**\nIn the solution, cobalt(II) ions react with thiocyanate ions (SCN⁻) to form a series of complexes in equilibrium. The species present are the free cobalt ion (Co²⁺) and the complexes [Co(SCN)]⁺, [Co(SCN)₂], [Co(SCN)₃]⁻, and [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻.\n\n**2. Define the Equilibria and Stability Constants:**\nThe formation of these complexes is described by overall stability constants (β):\n*   Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺ ; `β₁ = [[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) = 9`\n*   Co²⁺ + 2 SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂] ; `β₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) = 40`\n*   Co²⁺ + 3 SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ ; `β₃ = [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) = 63`\n*   Co²⁺ + 4 SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ ; `β₄ = [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) = 16`\n\n**3. Define the Total Cobalt Concentration:**\nThe total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n**4. Express Concentrations in terms of [Co²⁺]:**\nUsing the stability constants, we can write the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration `[Co²⁺]` and the free ligand concentration `[SCN⁻]`:\n*   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³`\n*   `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n\nSubstituting these into the total concentration equation:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**5. Define the Alpha Fraction (α₂):**\nThe percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, `[Co(SCN)₂]`, is its fraction of the total cobalt concentration, known as α₂.\n`α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n\nSubstituting the expressions from above:\n`α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\nBy canceling `[Co²⁺]`, the formula simplifies to:\n`α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n**6. Perform the Calculation:**\nThe problem gives `c(Co) = 10⁻² M` and `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`. Since the concentration of the ligand (`[SCN⁻]`) is 10 times larger than the total metal concentration, we can assume that the free ligand concentration is approximately equal to the initial concentration, i.e., `[SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M`.\n\nLet's plug the values into the α₂ formula:\n*   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1\n*   `β₁` = 9\n*   `β₂` = 40\n*   `β₃` = 63\n*   `β₄` = 16\n\nNumerator = `β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\nDenominator = `1 + (β₁ * [SCN⁻]) + (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) + (β₃ * [SCN⁻]³) + (β₄ * [SCN⁻]⁴)`\nDenominator = `1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴)`\nDenominator = `1 + 0.9 + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001)`\nDenominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016`\nDenominator = `2.3646`\n\n`α₂ = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo get the percentage, multiply by 100:\nPercentage = `0.16916 * 100 = 16.916%`\n\nThis value is approximately 16.9%.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nComparing the result with the given options:\nA) 38.1%\nB) 25.6%\nC) 42.3%\nD) 16.9%\n\nThe calculated percentage matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
