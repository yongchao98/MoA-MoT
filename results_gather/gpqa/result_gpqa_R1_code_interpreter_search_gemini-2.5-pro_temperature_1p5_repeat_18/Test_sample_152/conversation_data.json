    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), abstracts one of the highly acidic α-protons located between the two carbonyl groups, forming a resonance-stabilized enolate, `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, an α,β-unsaturated ester. The structure is `p-CH₃C₆H₄-CH=CH-COOCH₃`. The β-carbon (the carbon attached to the tolyl group) is the electrophilic site.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   **Step 1 (Enolate formation):** `CH₂(COOCH₃)₂ + NaOEt → Na⁺⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂ + EtOH`\n    *   **Step 2 (Nucleophilic attack):** The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate. The π-electrons of the C=C bond shift to the α-carbon, and the C=O π-electrons shift to the oxygen, forming another enolate intermediate.\n    *   **Step 3 (Protonation):** The resulting enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent (EtOH) to give the final neutral product.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product (A):**\n    *   The new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of dimethyl malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   Initial reactants: `(CH₃OOC)₂CH₂` and `p-Tolyl-CH=CH-COOCH₃`\n    *   Product structure: `(CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-Tolyl)-CH₂-COOCH₃`\n    *   **Naming the product:** This compound is a substituted propane with three methyl ester groups (tricarboxylate). The main propane chain can be identified as C1-C2-C3 where C1 is the malonate carbon, C2 is the β-carbon of the acrylate, and C3 is the α-carbon of the acrylate.\n        *   C1 has two `-COOCH₃` groups.\n        *   C2 has the `p-tolyl` group.\n        *   C3 is attached to the third `-COOCH₃` group (as `-CH₂COOCH₃`).\n    *   The IUPAC name is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**. This matches option A.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O+) --> (B)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor (Stork Enamine Reaction):**\n    *   **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, which serves as a neutral enolate equivalent. The nucleophilic carbon is the C2 of the cyclohexene ring (the β-carbon relative to the nitrogen atom).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`. This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon (`-CH(CH₃)-`) is the electrophilic site.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1 (Michael Addition):** The nucleophilic enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. This forms a new C-C bond and results in an intermediate iminium ion and a nitrile-stabilized carbanion.\n    *   **Step 2 (Protonation):** The carbanion is protonated by the solvent (MeOH).\n    *   **Step 3 (Hydrolysis):** The addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back to a carbonyl group (ketone), regenerating the catalyst (piperidine, as piperidinium salt) and yielding the final product.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product (B):**\n    *   The reaction starts with an equivalent of cyclohexanone (as its enamine).\n    *   The substituent from but-2-enenitrile is added to the α-carbon of the cyclohexanone.\n    *   The new C-C bond is between the α-carbon of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile.\n    *   The added fragment is `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the 2-position with a `3-nitrilobutyl` group.\n    *   Structure: 2-substituted cyclohexanone, with the substituent being `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n    *   **Naming the product:** Treating butanenitrile as the parent chain, the substituent at C3 is a `(2-oxocyclohexyl)` group. The name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. This corresponds to the keto form, which is the major, stable product after acidic workup.\n\n### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n1.  **Identify Reactant C by Retrosynthesis:**\n    *   This is a Michael addition reaction where we are given the product and need to find one of the reactants (the Michael donor C).\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`.\n    *   **Michael Donor:** C. The base is KOH.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Product Structure:**\n    *   The product consists of two parts joined by a new C-C bond:\n        1.  A `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` moiety.\n        2.  A `3-oxobutyl` group (`-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`) attached to position 2 of the dione ring.\n    *   In a Michael reaction, the nucleophile (donor) attacks the β-carbon of the acceptor. The α-carbon of a 1,3-dicarbonyl compound is highly acidic and readily forms an enolate. Therefore, C2 of the `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring is the nucleophilic center.\n    *   The `3-oxobutyl` side chain must have come from the Michael acceptor, `but-3-en-2-one` (`CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`). The C2 of the dione ring attacks the β-carbon (`CH₂=`) of MVK.\n    *   After the attack, the intermediate enolate is protonated to give the side chain `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`.\n\n3.  **Determine Reactant C:**\n    *   By breaking the bond between the ring's C2 and the side chain, we can identify the original reactants.\n    *   The fragment that provides the nucleophilic enolate is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n*   **Product A:** trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **Product B:** 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **Reactant C:** cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   **A)** A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n*   **B)** A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate (Incorrect A), B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile (Incorrect B), C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n*   **C)** A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate (Incorrect A), B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile (Incorrect B), C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione (Incorrect C)\n*   **D)** A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione (Incorrect C)\n\nThe correct choice is A, as it correctly identifies all reactants and major products.\n\n<<<A>>>"
