    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (`L1`) to the luminosity of Star_2 (`L2`), which is `L1 / L2`.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics Principles:**\n    *   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** This law relates a star's luminosity (`L`) to its radius (`R`) and its surface temperature (`T`). Assuming the star is a perfect black body radiator, the formula is:\n        `L = 4 * π * R^2 * σ * T^4`\n        where `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law relates the peak emission wavelength (`λ_max`) of a black body to its surface temperature (`T`):\n        `λ_max = b / T`\n        where `b` is Wien's constant. This means the temperature is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength (`T ∝ 1/λ_max`).\n    *   **Doppler Effect for Light:** This effect describes how the observed wavelength of light changes due to the relative motion between the source and the observer. The radial velocity (`v`) causes a shift. For a velocity `v` much smaller than the speed of light `c`, the formula can be approximated, but the full relativistic formula is:\n        `λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt((1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c))`\n        Here, `v` is positive for a source moving away (redshift) and negative for a source moving towards (blueshift). Radial velocity is conventionally positive for receding objects.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Given Information:**\n    *   Radius relationship: `R1 = 1.5 * R2`\n    *   Mass relationship: `M1 = 1.5 * M2`. This is extra information not needed for the calculation based on luminosity and temperature laws. It might be a distractor.\n    *   Peak Wavelength: \"the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest... are the same\". This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength. So, `λ_obs1 = λ_obs2`.\n    *   Radial Velocities: `v1 = 0 km/s`, `v2 = 700 km/s`.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:**\n    Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of luminosities is:\n    `L1 / L2 = (4 * π * R1^2 * σ * T1^4) / (4 * π * R2^2 * σ * T2^4)`\n    The constants (`4`, `π`, `σ`) cancel out, leaving:\n    `L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Components of the Ratio:**\n    *   **Radius Component:** We are given `R1 = 1.5 * R2`, so `(R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25`.\n    *   **Temperature Component:** This is the most critical part. The temperature (`T`) is related to the *emitted* peak wavelength (`λ_emitted`), not the observed one. We need to use the Doppler effect to relate the observed wavelengths back to the emitted ones.\n        *   For Star_1: `v1 = 0`, so there is no Doppler shift. `λ_emitted1 = λ_obs1`.\n        *   For Star_2: `v2 = 700 km/s`. Its light is Doppler shifted. `λ_obs2 = λ_emitted2 * sqrt((1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c))`.\n        *   Since we know `λ_obs1 = λ_obs2`, we can state:\n            `λ_emitted1 = λ_emitted2 * sqrt((1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c))`\n        *   Now, relate this to the temperature ratio. From Wien's Law, `T ∝ 1/λ_emitted`. Therefore:\n            `T1 / T2 = λ_emitted2 / λ_emitted1`\n        *   Substituting the expression for `λ_emitted1`:\n            `T1 / T2 = λ_emitted2 / (λ_emitted2 * sqrt((1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c)))`\n            `T1 / T2 = 1 / sqrt((1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c)) = sqrt((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))`\n        *   We need `(T1/T2)^4` for our luminosity ratio:\n            `(T1/T2)^4 = [sqrt((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))]^4 = ((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))^2`\n\n6.  **Combine the Components and Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    Now substitute the radius and temperature components back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n    `L1 / L2 = 2.25 * ((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))^2`\n\n    To get the numerical value, we can use a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the constants and given values\n# The ratio of the radii of Star_1 to Star_2\nR1_over_R2 = 1.5\n# The radial velocity of Star_2 in km/s\nv2 = 700.0\n# The speed of light in km/s\nc = 299792.458\n\n# Calculate beta, which is the ratio of the star's velocity to the speed of light\nbeta = v2 / c\n\n# The luminosity ratio is L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\n# The temperature ratio is derived from the Doppler shift: (T1/T2)^4 = ((1 - beta) / (1 + beta))^2\n# So, the final luminosity ratio is:\nluminosity_ratio = (R1_over_R2**2) * ((1 - beta) / (1 + beta))**2\n\nprint(luminosity_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n2.229048325988081\n</execute_result>\nThe result of the calculation is approximately 2.229. This value is closest to option A.\n\nThe fact that option B is exactly `1.5^2 = 2.25` confirms that the question is designed to test whether you correctly account for the Doppler effect on the temperature measurement. The provided radial velocities are essential information, not distractors.\n\nFinal check: `2.229048...` is closest to `~2.23`.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The user has confirmed the execution of a Python script.\nThe script calculated the luminosity ratio based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law and accounted for the relativistic Doppler effect on the temperature measurement.\n\n**Summary of Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Luminosity Ratio Formula**: According to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the luminosity (L) of a star is proportional to its radius squared and its surface temperature to the fourth power (`L ∝ R^2 * T^4`). The ratio of luminosities is therefore:\n    `L1 / L2 = (R1 / R2)^2 * (T1 / T2)^4`\n\n2.  **Radius Component**: The problem states `R1 = 1.5 * R2`, so `(R1 / R2)^2 = 1.5^2 = 2.25`.\n\n3.  **Temperature Component**: The temperatures must be derived from the peak emission wavelengths using Wien's Displacement Law (`T ∝ 1/λ_emitted`). The crucial information is that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same (`λ_obs1 = λ_obs2`).\n    *   For Star_1, with a radial velocity of 0, the observed wavelength is the same as the emitted wavelength (`λ_obs1 = λ_emitted1`).\n    *   For Star_2, with a radial velocity `v2 = 700 km/s`, its light is redshifted due to the Doppler effect. The relationship between observed and emitted wavelength is given by the relativistic Doppler formula: `λ_obs2 = λ_emitted2 * sqrt((1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c))`.\n    *   Since `λ_obs1 = λ_obs2`, we have `λ_emitted1 = λ_emitted2 * sqrt((1 + v2/c) / (1 - v2/c))`.\n    *   The temperature ratio is the inverse of the emitted wavelength ratio: `T1 / T2 = λ_emitted2 / λ_emitted1`.\n    *   Substituting the wavelength relation, we find `T1 / T2 = sqrt((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))`.\n    *   Therefore, the temperature factor in the luminosity equation is `(T1 / T2)^4 = ((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))^2`.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation**: Combining the parts:\n    `L1 / L2 = 2.25 * ((1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c))^2`\n    Using `v2 = 700 km/s` and the speed of light `c ≈ 299792.458 km/s`, the calculation yields:\n    `L1 / L2 ≈ 2.25 * ((1 - 700/299792.458) / (1 + 700/299792.458))^2 ≈ 2.229`\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 2.229 is closest to 2.23.\n\n<<<A>>>"
