    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Products**\n\n*   Both reactions produce a substituted version of tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This is a six-membered cyclic ester, also known as a delta-lactone.\n*   The lactone has an ethyl group at position 4. This C4 atom is a chiral center.\n*   Reaction A produces the (R)-enantiomer: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n*   Reaction B produces the (S)-enantiomer: (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\n*   The options provided are all derivatives of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid).\n*   The specific name is `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. Let's break this down:\n    *   \"pentanoic acid\": A 5-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at C1.\n    *   \"3-ethyl\": An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) on C3. C3 is the chiral center.\n    *   \"5-isobutoxy-5-oxo\": This describes an isobutyl ester group [-C(=O)O-isobutyl] at the C5 position.\n*   The structure is: `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CO-O-isobutyl`. This molecule contains two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid and an ester.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reagents and Reactions**\n\nThis problem hinges on the selective reactivity of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃, towards carboxylic acids and esters.\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This is a moderately strong reducing agent. It readily reduces aldehydes, ketones, and **esters** to alcohols. However, it does *not* typically reduce carboxylic acids under standard conditions.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent is particularly effective at reducing **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols. It reduces esters as well, but much more slowly than carboxylic acids. Therefore, in a molecule with both functional groups, BH₃ will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid.\n\nLet's apply this knowledge to the two reactions:\n\n**Reaction 1: Starting Material A + LiBH₄**\n\n1.  **Reduction:** LiBH₄ will selectively reduce the **ester** group to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group remains unchanged.\n    *   A (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-isobutyl) + LiBH₄ → HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n2.  **Lactonization:** The product of the reduction is a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid. The H⁺ workup step catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization), where the hydroxyl group (-OH) attacks the carboxylic acid carbonyl (-COOH) to form the six-membered ring (the delta-lactone).\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and cyclization steps do not involve the chiral center at C3 (which becomes C4 in the lactone). Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product.\n4.  **Conclusion:** To get the **(R)-lactone** product, the starting material **A** must have the **(R)** configuration.\n    *   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n**Reaction 2: Starting Material B + BH₃**\n\n1.  **Reduction:** BH₃ will selectively reduce the **carboxylic acid** group to a primary alcohol. The ester group remains unchanged.\n    *   B (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-isobutyl) + BH₃ → HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-isobutyl\n2.  **Lactonization:** The product of this reduction is a 5-hydroxy ester. The H⁺ workup step catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification, where the newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl. This forms the six-membered lactone and releases isobutanol.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the reaction mechanism does not affect the chiral center. The stereochemistry is retained.\n4.  **Conclusion:** To get the **(S)-lactone** product, the starting material **B** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   Starting Material A must be: **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   Starting Material B must be: **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
