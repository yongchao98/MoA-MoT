    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical equilibrium:** The problem involves a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex (represented as CaY²⁻, where Y⁴⁻ is the fully deprotonated EDTA ligand). This complex is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium (Ca²⁺) and EDTA (Y⁴⁻).\n\n2.  **Write the equilibrium reaction:** The dissociation of the complex can be written as:\n    CaY²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n3.  **Define the formation constant (K_f):** The problem gives the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA or K_f. The equilibrium expression for the *formation* of the complex is:\n    K_f = [CaY²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻])\n    We are given K_f = 5 x 10¹⁰.\n\n4.  **Set up an ICE table:** We can track the initial, change, and equilibrium concentrations of the species involved in the dissociation reaction. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ that dissociates from the complex at equilibrium.\n\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| CaY²⁻ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| Ca²⁺ | 0 | +x | x |\n| Y⁴⁻ | 0 | +x | x |\n\n5.  **Substitute equilibrium concentrations into the K_f expression:**\n    5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n    5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / x²\n\n6.  **Apply a simplifying assumption:** The formation constant K_f is very large (5 x 10¹⁰), which means the equilibrium lies far to the left (favoring the complex). Therefore, the amount of dissociation 'x' will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can assume that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\n7.  **Solve for x:**\n    5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n    Rearrange the equation to solve for x²:\n    x² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\n    x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻²) / (5 x 10¹⁰)\n    x² ≈ 0.4 x 10⁻¹²\n    x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n\n    Now, take the square root to find x:\n    x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n    x = √(40 x 10⁻¹⁴)\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n8.  **Final Answer:** The concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is equal to 'x'.\n    [Ca²⁺] = 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nThis value corresponds to option D. The phrase \"we assume that the pH is ideal\" confirms that we should use the given formation constant without adjusting for pH effects on the EDTA ligand.\n\nTo confirm the calculation precisely:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nK_f = 5e10  # Formation constant for Ca-EDTA\ninitial_conc_CaY = 0.02  # Initial stoichiometric concentration of Ca-EDTA\n\n# The equilibrium is CaY(2-) <=> Ca(2+) + Y(4-)\n# K_f = [CaY(2-)] / ([Ca(2+)] * [Y(4-)])\n# At equilibrium, let [Ca(2+)] = x and [Y(4-)] = x\n# Then [CaY(2-)] = 0.02 - x\n# So, K_f = (0.02 - x) / x^2\n# Since K_f is very large, x is very small, so we approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n# K_f ≈ 0.02 / x^2\n# x = sqrt(0.02 / K_f)\n\nx = math.sqrt(initial_conc_CaY / K_f)\nprint(f\"The concentration of Ca2+ ions is approximately {x:.2e} M\")\n```\n> EXECUTING CODE...\n>\n> \n> The concentration of Ca2+ ions is approximately 6.32e-07 M\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the concentration of calcium ions.\n\n1.  **Chemical Equilibrium:** The problem involves the dissociation of the calcium-EDTA complex (CaY²⁻) into its constituent ions, calcium (Ca²⁺) and the EDTA ligand (Y⁴⁻).\n\n2.  **Dissociation Reaction:** The equilibrium reaction for the dissociation of the complex is the reverse of its formation:\n    CaY²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n3.  **Formation Constant (Kf):** We are given the formation constant (also known as the stability constant), K_f, for the complex:\n    K_f = [CaY²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n4.  **ICE Table Setup:** We can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ formed at equilibrium.\n    *   **Reaction:**         CaY²⁻      ⇌      Ca²⁺      +      Y⁴⁻\n    *   **Initial (M):**      0.02                0              0\n    *   **Change (M):**        -x                 +x             +x\n    *   **Equilibrium (M):**  0.02 - x              x              x\n\n5.  **Applying the Equilibrium Expression:** Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\n    K_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n    5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / x²\n\n6.  **Simplifying Assumption:** The formation constant K_f is very large (5 x 10¹⁰), which means the equilibrium lies heavily to the left, favoring the intact complex. Therefore, the amount that dissociates, 'x', will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex. We can assume that (0.02 - x) is approximately equal to 0.02.\n    5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\n7.  **Solving for x:** Rearrange the simplified equation to solve for x, which represents the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺.\n    x² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\n    x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n    x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], at equilibrium is approximately 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M. This value matches option D. The Python code execution confirms this calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
