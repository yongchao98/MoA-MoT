    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of Sequential Measurements**\n\nThe problem asks for the probability of a sequence of two measurements. In quantum mechanics, the probability of obtaining a result `p_i` for an observable P, followed by a result `q_j` for an observable Q, is calculated as follows:\n*   First, calculate the probability of measuring `p_i`.\n*   After this measurement, the state of the system \"collapses\" into the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue `p_i`.\n*   Then, using this new collapsed state, calculate the probability of measuring `q_j`.\n*   The total probability is the product of these two probabilities.\n\n`P(p_i and then q_j) = P(p_i) * P(q_j | state collapsed to p_i)`\n\n**2. Define the Initial State and Operators**\n\n*   **Initial State (unnormalized):** `ψ_un = [-1, 2, 1]`\n*   **Operator P:**\n    ```\n    P = [[0, 1/√2, 0],\n         [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],\n         [0, 1/√2, 0]]\n    ```\n*   **Operator Q:**\n    ```\n    Q = [[1, 0, 0],\n         [0, 0, 0],\n         [0, 0, -1]]\n    ```\n\n**3. Normalize the Initial State**\n\nA state vector in quantum mechanics must be normalized (have a length of 1).\n*   The squared norm of `ψ_un` is `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`.\n*   The normalization factor is `1/√6`.\n*   The normalized initial state `|ψ⟩` is: `|ψ⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]`.\n\n**4. First Measurement: Probability of getting P = 0**\n\nTo find the probability of measuring the value 0 for P, we need the eigenvector of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0.\n*   **Find the eigenvector `|p_0⟩` for eigenvalue `p=0`:**\n    We need to solve the equation `P|v⟩ = 0|v⟩`.\n    ```\n    [[0, 1/√2, 0],   [x]   [0]\n     [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [y] = [0]\n     [0, 1/√2, 0]]   [z]   [0]\n    ```\n    This gives the system of equations:\n    1.  `(1/√2)y = 0  => y = 0`\n    2.  `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0  => x + z = 0 => x = -z`\n    The eigenvector is of the form `[x, 0, -x]`. We choose `x=1/√2` to make the vector normalized (`(1/√2)² + 0² + (-1/√2)² = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1`).\n    So, the normalized eigenvector for `p=0` is `|p_0⟩ = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]`.\n\n*   **Calculate the probability `P(p=0)`:**\n    The probability is the squared magnitude of the inner product of the state `|ψ⟩` and the eigenvector `|p_0⟩`.\n    `P(p=0) = |⟨p_0|ψ⟩|²`\n    `⟨p_0|ψ⟩ = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2] · ( (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1] )`\n    `⟨p_0|ψ⟩ = (1/√6) * [ (1/√2)*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/√2)*1 ]`\n    `⟨p_0|ψ⟩ = (1/√6) * [ -1/√2 - 1/√2 ] = (1/√6) * (-2/√2) = (1/√6) * (-√2) = -√(2/6) = -√(1/3)`\n    `P(p=0) = |-√(1/3)|² = 1/3`\n\n**5. State Collapse**\n\nAfter measuring `P=0`, the system's state collapses to the corresponding normalized eigenvector `|p_0⟩`.\n*   **New state `|ψ'⟩`:** `|ψ'⟩ = |p_0⟩ = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]`\n\n**6. Second Measurement: Probability of getting Q = -1**\n\nNow, we calculate the probability of measuring the value -1 for Q from the new state `|ψ'⟩`.\n*   **Find the eigenvector `|q_{-1}⟩` for eigenvalue `q=-1`:**\n    The operator Q is a diagonal matrix. Its eigenvalues are its diagonal elements (1, 0, -1), and its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.\n    The normalized eigenvector for the eigenvalue `q=-1` is `|q_{-1}⟩ = [0, 0, 1]`.\n\n*   **Calculate the probability `P(q=-1 | p=0)`:**\n    This is the squared magnitude of the inner product of the new state `|ψ'⟩` and the eigenvector `|q_{-1}⟩`.\n    `P(q=-1 | p=0) = |⟨q_{-1}|ψ'⟩|²`\n    `⟨q_{-1}|ψ'⟩ = [0, 0, 1] · [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]`\n    `⟨q_{-1}|ψ'⟩ = 0*(1/√2) + 0*0 + 1*(-1/√2) = -1/√2`\n    `P(q=-1 | p=0) = |-1/√2|² = 1/2`\n\n**7. Calculate the Total Probability**\n\nFinally, multiply the probabilities of the two steps.\n*   `P(total) = P(p=0) * P(q=-1 | p=0)`\n*   `P(total) = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`\n\nThus, the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements is 1/6.\n\n<<<A>>>"
