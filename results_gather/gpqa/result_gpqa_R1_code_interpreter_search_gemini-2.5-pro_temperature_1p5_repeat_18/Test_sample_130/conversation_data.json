    "*   **Step 1: Identify the reactants.**\n    *   The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene, which upon dehydration forms an anhydride. The spectral data for this anhydride are a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.\n    *   Let's analyze maleic anhydride, which is formed from *cis*-butenedioic acid (maleic acid).\n        *   **Structure:** Maleic anhydride is a planar, five-membered ring with a C=C double bond and C₂ᵥ symmetry.\n        *   **¹H NMR:** Due to symmetry, the two protons on the double bond are chemically equivalent. They are vinyl protons adjacent to carbonyl groups, so their chemical shift is expected to be significantly downfield. A single peak at ~7 ppm is a perfect match.\n        *   **¹³C NMR:** There are two sets of equivalent carbons: the two vinyl carbons (C=C) and the two carbonyl carbons (C=O). This would give two signals. Carbonyl carbons typically resonate at 160-180 ppm (matching 165 ppm), and alkene carbons at 100-150 ppm (matching 137 ppm).\n    *   Conclusion: The anhydride is **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   The other reactant is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the reaction and products.**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**.\n    *   This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. The specific skeleton formed from a cyclopentadiene derivative is a **bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene** system.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is given as C₁₃H₁₆O₃. Let's verify this.\n        *   Maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) + 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (C₉H₁₄) → C₁₃H₁₆O₃. The formula is correct.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two main stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products. According to the \"endo rule,\" the *endo* product is typically the major, kinetically favored product, while the *exo* product is the minor, thermodynamically favored product.\n    *   **Major product = Endo adduct.**\n    *   **Minor product = Exo adduct.**\n    *   Let's visualize the structures. The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene skeleton.\n        *   The anhydride ring is fused at positions C2 and C3.\n        *   Methyl groups are at the bridgehead positions (C1, C4) and on the double bond (C5, C6).\n        *   A CH₂ group forms the C7 bridge.\n    *   In the **endo adduct (major)**, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side as) the C7 bridge. The two protons on the anhydride part (at C2 and C3) are therefore on the *exo* face.\n    *   In the **exo adduct (minor)**, the anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side of) the C7 bridge. The two protons at C2 and C3 are on the *endo* face.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the NOESY spectrum.**\n    *   NOESY spectroscopy detects protons that are close in space (< 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of two spatially proximate protons.\n    *   We are looking for a cross-peak present in the major product (endo) but absent in the minor product (exo). This requires finding a pair of protons that are close in the endo isomer but far apart in the exo isomer.\n    *   Let's consider the key protons:\n        *   **H(anhydride):** The two equivalent protons at C2 and C3.\n        *   **H(bridge):** The two diastereotopic protons on the C7 bridge, H-syn (pointing towards the C5=C6 double bond) and H-anti (pointing away from it).\n    *   **Spatial Relationships:**\n        *   **In the endo (major) product:** The H(anhydride) protons are on the *exo* face. They are spatially close to the **H-syn** proton on the C7 bridge. They are far from the H-anti proton.\n        *   **In the exo (minor) product:** The H(anhydride) protons are on the *endo* face. They are spatially close to the **H-anti** proton on the C7 bridge. They are far from the H-syn proton.\n    *   Therefore, the NOESY cross-peak between **H(anhydride) and H-syn** will be present (strong) in the major product and absent (or very weak) in the minor product. This is the distinguishing feature.\n\n*   **Step 4: Assign the NMR signals from the options.**\n    *   The options provide the following signals:\n        *   A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm\n        *   A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n        *   A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n        *   A 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n    *   Let's assign these based on typical chemical shifts and the molecular structure:\n        *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** These are protons on sp³ carbons (C2, C3) adjacent to two carbonyl groups in a strained ring system. This chemical shift is highly characteristic of the **H(anhydride)** protons.\n        *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** Methyl groups on a double bond (vinylic methyls) typically resonate around 1.6-2.0 ppm. This is likely the two equivalent methyl groups on C5 and C6.\n        *   **6H singlet at ~1 ppm:** Methyl groups on a saturated, sp³ bridgehead carbon typically resonate further upfield. This is likely the two equivalent methyl groups on C1 and C4.\n        *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This must correspond to one of the C7 bridge protons (**H-syn** or H-anti). Given that we are looking for its interaction with H(anhydride) in the major product, this signal must be for **H-syn**.\n\n*   **Step 5: Identify the correct option.**\n    *   We have established that the unique cross-peak in the major product is between H(anhydride) and H-syn.\n    *   Based on our signal assignment, this corresponds to a cross-peak between:\n        *   The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (H(anhydride))\n        *   The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** (H-syn)\n    *   This matches option B.\n\n    Let's re-check the other options:\n    *   A) 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead Me) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (H-syn): An NOE might exist with H-anti, not H-syn. Not the distinguishing feature.\n    *   C) 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinyl Me) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H(anhydride)): These protons are far apart in both isomers.\n    *   D) 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (bridgehead Me) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinyl Me): These are on adjacent carbons, so an NOE is expected in both isomers. Not a distinguishing feature.\n\nThe only option describing an interaction unique to the major (endo) product is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
