    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone was treated with bromine, forming product 1.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine (Br₂) typically in the presence of an acid catalyst (like acetic acid) to undergo bromination at the α-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n*   **Mechanism:** The ketone first tautomerizes to its enol form. The electron-rich double bond of the enol then attacks a bromine molecule to form a brominated intermediate, which loses a proton to yield the final product.\n*   **Product 1:** Due to the symmetry of cyclohexanone, both α-positions are equivalent. The product is **2-bromocyclohexanone**.\n     \n\n**Step 2: Product 1 was heated with sodium hydroxide, forming product 2.**\n\n*   **Reactant:** 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a strong base, and heat.\n*   **Reaction:** For an α-halo ketone with an acidic proton on the other α-carbon (the α' position), two major pathways are possible with a strong base:\n    1.  **Elimination:** The base removes a proton from the α' position (C6), and the resulting enolate eliminates the bromide ion to form an α,β-unsaturated ketone (cyclohex-2-en-1-one).\n    2.  **Favorskii Rearrangement:** The base removes a proton from the α' position (C6), and the enolate performs an intramolecular nucleophilic attack on the carbon bearing the bromine, forming a strained bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate. This intermediate is then attacked by the hydroxide nucleophile, leading to ring-opening and rearrangement. For 2-bromocyclohexanone, this results in a ring contraction.\n*   **Which path is correct?** Let's consider the final options. If the product was derived from elimination, the final product would be cyclohexa-1,3-diene, which has 4 distinct types of hydrogens. Since 4 is not an option, the elimination pathway is likely incorrect. The Favorskii rearrangement is the intended reaction.\n*   **Mechanism (Favorskii):**\n    1.  OH⁻ abstracts the acidic proton at C6.\n    2.  The resulting enolate attacks C2, displacing Br⁻ to form a bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one intermediate.\n    3.  OH⁻ attacks the carbonyl carbon.\n    4.  The tetrahedral intermediate collapses, and the C1-C6 bond breaks, forming a carbanion on a five-membered ring.\n    5.  Protonation upon workup gives the carboxylic acid.\n*   **Product 2:** The product of the Favorskii rearrangement is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n     \n\n**Step 3: Product 2 was treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine, forming 3.**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagent:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.\n*   **Reaction:** This is the standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride (or acid chloride). Pyridine acts as a base to neutralize the HCl gas produced during the reaction.\n*   **Product 3:** The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl). The product is **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n     \n\n**Step 4: Product 3 was treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, forming product 4.**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O*t*-Bu)₃).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a selective reduction. Unlike the powerful reducing agent LiAlH₄ (which would reduce an acyl chloride to a primary alcohol), LiAlH(O*t*-Bu)₃ is a much milder, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acyl chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reduction at that stage.\n*   **Product 4:** The product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n     \n\n**Final Analysis: Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogens in Product 4**\n\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry that includes the aldehyde group (CHO) and the ring carbon it's attached to (C1). This plane makes the left and right sides of the cyclopentane ring mirror images of each other.\n*   Let's count the unique hydrogen environments (which would correspond to distinct signals in an ¹H NMR spectrum):\n    1.  **Aldehyde H (-CHO):** This hydrogen is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n    2.  **C1-H:** The hydrogen on the carbon atom of the ring attached to the aldehyde group. This hydrogen is also unique. (1 type)\n    3.  **C2-H₂ and C5-H₂:** These two CH₂ groups are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, within one of these groups (e.g., C2), the two hydrogen atoms are diastereotopic because they are adjacent to a stereocenter (C1). This means they are chemically non-equivalent and will have different chemical shifts. So, these four protons give rise to two distinct signals. (2 types)\n    4.  **C3-H₂ and C4-H₂:** These two CH₂ groups are also equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. Like the C2/C5 protons, the two hydrogens on C3 are diastereotopic because of the chirality at C1. They are chemically non-equivalent. These four protons give rise to another two distinct signals. (2 types)\n\n*   **Total Count:**\n    *   1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5 protons) + 2 (from C3/C4 protons) = **6**\n\nThere are **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on the final product, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n<<<C>>>"
