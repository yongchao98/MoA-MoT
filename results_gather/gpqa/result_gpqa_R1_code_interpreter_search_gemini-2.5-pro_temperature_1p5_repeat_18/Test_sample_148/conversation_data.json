    "*   **Analyze the Observations:**\n    1.  **Â¹H NMR:** The presence of two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton indicates that this proton exists in two different chemical environments. The fact that they have similar chemical shifts suggests the environments are structurally similar but non-identical. The slow interconversion between these two environments (on the NMR timescale) results in separate signals instead of a single averaged signal. The equal integrals (summing to 1H) mean the two species are present in a roughly 1:1 ratio. Spin-spin coupling is ruled out.\n    2.  **LC-MS:** The presence of two separable peaks in the liquid chromatography (LC) trace confirms the existence of two distinct chemical compounds. The fact that they have the same mass spectrum (MS) confirms they are isomers (molecules with the same chemical formula but different arrangements of atoms). The separation on LC indicates they have different physical properties (e.g., polarity), which allows them to interact differently with the stationary phase of the LC column. The fact that the peaks are still resolved at elevated temperatures indicates that the two isomers do not interconvert rapidly on the chromatography time scale under these conditions, or that the barrier to interconversion is high enough to be maintained during elution.\n\n*   **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent and on a standard (achiral) LC column, enantiomers are indistinguishable. They would produce a single set of peaks in the NMR spectrum and a single peak in the LC trace. This option is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC-MS data.\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties. Consequently, they give different NMR spectra (though corresponding protons might have similar shifts) and are separable by standard chromatography (like LC). Since they are isomers, they have the identical mass. This explanation fits all the observations perfectly. Common sources of diastereomers in peptide synthesis include:\n        1.  **Cis/trans isomerism (atropisomerism):** The amide bond in a peptide has partial double-bond character, restricting rotation. This can lead to stable *cis* and *trans* isomers. This is particularly common for amide bonds involving a proline residue. These *cis/trans* isomers are diastereomers of each other (assuming the peptide has other chiral centers), are often present in significant quantities at equilibrium (sometimes close to 1:1), and interconvert slowly on the NMR timescale, leading to peak doubling.\n        2.  **Epimerization:** During synthesis, the chiral center of an amino acid can partially or fully racemize (a process called epimerization in the context of a molecule with other chiral centers). This would create a diastereomer of the intended peptide. A 1:1 ratio would suggest nearly complete racemization at one center.\n    Both of these common scenarios result in a mixture of diastereomers. Therefore, this option is the most chemically sound and encompassing explanation.\n    *   **C) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor from the synthesis would almost certainly have a different molecular formula and therefore a different mass. This is contradicted by the MS data, which shows both peaks have the same mass as the expected product.\n    *   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This implies an extra amino acid was added, creating a new, larger peptide. This molecule would have a significantly different mass, which is contradicted by the MS data.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of two species that are isomers, but have different properties leading to distinct NMR signals and LC peaks, is the definition of a mixture of diastereomers. This is the most likely explanation for the given set of analytical data.\n\n<<<B>>>"
