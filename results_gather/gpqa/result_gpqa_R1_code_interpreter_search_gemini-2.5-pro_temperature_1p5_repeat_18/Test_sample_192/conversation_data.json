    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   We are given a relationship between the number of stars and their parallax (`plx`). Let's denote the number of stars as `N`. The relationship is given as varying like `1/plx^5`.\n    *   We are asked to find how the number of stars changes with distance (`r`). Specifically, it asks for the number of stars \"per unit range of distance,\" which means we need to find the functional form of the density `dN/dr`.\n    *   We need the fundamental relationship between distance (`r`) and parallax (`plx`).\n\n2.  **Relate Parallax and Distance:**\n    Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. The standard formula is:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n    where `r` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds. For our purposes, the proportionality `plx ∝ 1/r` is what matters.\n\n3.  **Interpret the Given Variation:**\n    The phrase \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\" can be interpreted in two main ways:\n    a) As a *density function*: The number of stars in a small parallax interval `d(plx)` is proportional to `plx⁻⁵ d(plx)`. In calculus terms, this means `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`.\n    b) As a *cumulative function*: The total number of stars with parallax *greater than* `plx` is proportional to `plx⁻⁵`.\n\n    In physics and mathematics, when a quantity \"varies with\" a variable, it usually refers to the function or density itself, not its integral (cumulative value). For example, \"velocity varies with time as `t²`\" means `v(t) ∝ t²`, not `∫v(t)dt ∝ t²`. Therefore, interpretation (a) is the more standard and direct reading of the statement. We will proceed with this interpretation.\n\n4.  **Set up the Mathematical Transformation:**\n    Our goal is to find the relationship for `dN/dr` starting from the relationship for `dN/d(plx)`. We can do this using the chain rule for derivatives, which is essentially a change of variables for the density function.\n\n    `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   From the problem statement (as interpreted above), we have:\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n\n    *   We need to find the derivative of `plx` with respect to `r`:\n        `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`\n        `d(plx)/dr = d(r⁻¹)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n\n    *   Now, substitute these into the chain rule equation. We are interested in proportionality, so we can ignore the negative sign (which just signifies that as one variable increases, the other decreases).\n        `dN/dr ∝ (plx⁻⁵) * (1/r²) `\n\n    *   The expression for `dN/dr` should only depend on `r`. So, we substitute `plx = 1/r` into the expression:\n        `plx⁻⁵ = (1/r)⁻⁵ = r⁵`\n\n    *   Putting it all together:\n        `dN/dr ∝ (r⁵) * (1/r²) `\n        `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n        `dN/dr ∝ r³`\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The number of stars per unit range of distance (`dN/dr`) varies as the cube of the distance (`r³`). This corresponds to option B.\n\n*(Self-Correction/Verification): If we had used the cumulative interpretation, we would get `N(<r) ∝ r⁵`, and then `dN/dr ∝ d(r⁵)/dr ∝ r⁴`, which is option C. However, the interpretation of \"varies with\" as a density is more direct. Furthermore, assuming the given relation `dN/d(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵` is a density, we can integrate it to find the cumulative count: `N(>plx) = ∫(k/p⁵)dp = -k/(4p⁴)`. This means the cumulative count varies as `plx⁻⁴`. This leads to a cumulative count versus distance `N(<r) ∝ r⁴`, and differentiating this with respect to `r` gives the density `dN/dr ∝ r³`. This cross-check confirms the consistency of the density interpretation and the final result.*\n\n<<<B>>>"
