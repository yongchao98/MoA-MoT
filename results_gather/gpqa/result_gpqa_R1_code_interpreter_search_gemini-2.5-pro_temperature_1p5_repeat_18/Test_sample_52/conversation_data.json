    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information from the problem statement:**\n    *   **Structure:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This implies a benzene ring with two substituents, which has a core formula of C6H4 and 4 aromatic protons. The aromatic ring itself accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation.\n    *   **FTIR Spectroscopy:** An ester group (-COO-) is present. An ester contains a carbonyl group (C=O), which accounts for 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **1H NMR Spectroscopy:** This gives us the most detailed information about the proton environment.\n        *   **Six total signals:** This indicates six different types of protons in the molecule.\n        *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** This is consistent with the 4 protons on a di-substituted benzene ring (e.g., ortho or meta substitution where protons are not all equivalent). Let's assume a total of 4 aromatic hydrogens.\n        *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** Vinyl protons are attached to a C=C double bond. This splitting pattern is a classic signature for a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) attached to another group.\n            *   Let's denote the group as R-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3.\n            *   H(a) is split by H(b), resulting in a **doublet**.\n            *   H(b) is split by H(a) (a doublet) and the three protons of the -CH3 group (a quartet), resulting in a **doublet of quartets**.\n            *   This confirms the presence of a C=C bond (1 degree of unsaturation) and a propenyl fragment. This fragment has 2 vinyl protons and a methyl group.\n        *   **Two signals for -CH3 groups:**\n            *   One -CH3 group is the one from the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). It would be a doublet due to coupling with the adjacent vinyl proton H(b).\n            *   The second -CH3 group must be from another part of the molecule. Given the presence of an ester, and the constraint of no -CH2 groups, this must be a methyl ester (-COOCH3) or an acetate group (-OOCCH3). This methyl group would be a singlet.\n        *   **No signals for -CH2 groups:** This is a crucial piece of data that eliminates possibilities like ethyl, propyl, or other alkyl chains containing a methylene (-CH2-) unit.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Molecular Fragments:**\n    *   Aromatic ring: C6H4 (4 Hydrogens)\n    *   Propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH3 (Fragment formula: C3H5; 5 Hydrogens)\n    *   Ester group and the second methyl group. This can be either a methyl carboxylate group (-COOCH3) or an acetoxy group (-OOCCH3).\n        *   In both cases, the fragment that needs to be added is composed of C, O, O, CH3. (Fragment formula: COOCH3; 3 Hydrogens).\n\n3.  **Calculate the Total Molecular Formula:**\n    Let's sum up the atoms from the assembled fragments:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 1 (from C=O) + 1 (from O-CH3) = **11 carbons**.\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from -COOCH3) = **12 hydrogens**.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from the ester group -COO-) = **2 oxygens**.\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n4.  **Verify the Degrees of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    *   DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DBE for C11H12O2 = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**.\n    *   Let's check this against our structure: Benzene ring (4 DBE) + C=C bond in the propenyl group (1 DBE) + C=O bond in the ester (1 DBE) = 6 DBE. The calculated DBE matches the deduced structure.\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) C11H14O2: Incorrect. This would have a DBE of 5. It implies saturation of one double bond, which would introduce -CH2- groups, contradicting the NMR data.\n    *   B) C12H12O2: Incorrect. This would have a DBE of 7. It would require an additional double bond or ring, which is not supported by the spectral data.\n    *   C) C11H12O2: **Correct.** This formula perfectly matches our analysis of the spectral data.\n    *   D) C12H14O2: Incorrect. This has a DBE of 6, but it contains an extra CH2 group compared to C11H12O2, which is explicitly ruled out.\n\nThe spectroscopic evidence strongly and unambiguously points to the molecular formula C11H12O2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
