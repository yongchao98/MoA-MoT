    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is undergoing hydrogen bonding. The broadness is a key characteristic.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This frequency is typical for the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) contain a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), so this information is consistent with all candidates but doesn't differentiate between them.\n\n### **2. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe most crucial information comes from the splitting patterns (multiplicity) of the signals in the 1H NMR spectrum. The splitting of a proton's signal is determined by its non-equivalent neighboring protons (the n+1 rule). When a proton is coupled to multiple, different groups of protons, its signal becomes a multiplet of multiplets.\n\nWe are given two specific, complex signals:\n1.  **A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n2.  **A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n\nLet's break down what these patterns mean in terms of neighboring protons:\n*   **dtq (doublet of triplets of quartets):** The proton giving this signal must be adjacent to three different groups of protons:\n    *   A group with **1** proton (n=1, gives a doublet).\n    *   A group with **2** equivalent protons (n=2, gives a triplet).\n    *   A group with **3** equivalent protons (n=3, gives a quartet).\n    *   **Total neighbors:** 1H, 2H, and 3H.\n*   **dtt (doublet of triplets of triplets):** The proton giving this signal must be adjacent to three different groups of protons:\n    *   A group with **1** proton (n=1, gives a doublet).\n    *   A group with **2** equivalent protons (n=2, gives a triplet).\n    *   Another, different group with **2** equivalent protons (n=2, gives a triplet).\n    *   **Total neighbors:** 1H, 2H, and 2H.\n\nThe correct compound must have protons in environments that match **both** of these descriptions.\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Candidate Structure**\n\nFirst, let's clarify the structures from the condensed formulas, assuming they represent valid chain structures.\n\n*   **A) CH3CH2CH(C2H5)CH(C2H5)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   **B) CH3CH(C2H5)CH(C2H5)CH2COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   **C) CH3CH2CH(CH3)CH(CH3)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   **D) CH3CH(CH3)CH(CH3)CH2COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n\nNow, let's analyze the methine (CH) protons in each structure, as they are most likely to show such complex splitting.\n*(Note: For this analysis, we will make a common simplification that the two protons of a CH₂ group in an ethyl or propyl chain are equivalent, even if they are technically diastereotopic due to nearby chiral centers. The observation of clean multiplets suggests this is a valid approximation here.)*\n\n---\n#### **Analysis of C: 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH3-CH2-CH(c)-CH(b)-COOH`\n         `|      |`\n         `CH3    CH3`\n*   **Proton H(b):** Is next to H(c) (1H) and a CH₃ group (3H). Its neighbors are (1H, 3H), so its signal would be a **doublet of quartets (dq)**. This doesn't match.\n*   **Proton H(c):** Is next to H(b) (1H), a CH₂ group (2H), and a CH₃ group (3H). Its neighbors are (1H, 2H, 3H), so its signal would be a **dtq**. This matches one of the required signals.\n*   **Conclusion for C:** This molecule can produce a `dtq`, but it has no proton with neighbors (1H, 2H, 2H) to produce a `dtt`. So, it is incorrect.\n\n---\n#### **Analysis of D: 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH3-CH(e)-CH(d)-CH2-COOH`\n     `|      |`\n     `CH3    CH3`\n*   **Proton H(d):** Is next to H(e) (1H), a CH₂ group (2H), and a CH₃ group (3H). Its neighbors are (1H, 2H, 3H), so its signal would be a **dtq**. This matches one of the required signals.\n*   **Proton H(e):** Is next to H(d) (1H) and two different CH₃ groups (3H + 3H = 6H). Its neighbors are (1H, 6H), so its signal would be a **doublet of septets (d-septet)**. This does not match.\n*   **Conclusion for D:** This molecule can produce a `dtq`, but it cannot produce a `dtt`. So, it is incorrect.\n\n---\n#### **Analysis of A: 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH3-CH2-CH(c)-CH(b)-COOH`\n         `|      |`\n         `C2H5   C2H5`\nThe methine protons H(b) and H(c) are surrounded by other protons on chiral carbons and diastereotopic CH₂ groups. This leads to very complex splitting (e.g., doublet of doublets of doublets), not the clean `dtq` or `dtt` patterns described. So, it is incorrect.\n\n---\n#### **Analysis of B: 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH3-CH(b)(C2H5)-CH(e)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH`\nThe key protons are the two methines, H(b) on C4 and H(e) on C3.\n*   **Proton H(b) (on C4):** Let's count its neighbors.\n    *   The methine proton H(e) on C3 (1H).\n    *   The protons on the terminal CH₃ group (3H).\n    *   The protons on the CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent on C4 (2H).\n    *   The neighbors are **(1H, 2H, 3H)**. This proton's signal will be a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This is a perfect match for the first signal.\n\n*   **Proton H(e) (on C3):** Let's count its neighbors.\n    *   The methine proton H(b) on C4 (1H).\n    *   The protons on the main chain's CH₂ group at C2 (2H).\n    *   The protons on the CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent on C3 (2H).\n    *   The neighbors are **(1H, 2H, 2H)**. This proton's signal will be a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This is a perfect match for the second signal.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nStructure B, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, is the only candidate that has protons matching both of the specific splitting patterns (`dtq` and `dtt`) described in the 1H NMR data.\n\n<<<B>>>"
