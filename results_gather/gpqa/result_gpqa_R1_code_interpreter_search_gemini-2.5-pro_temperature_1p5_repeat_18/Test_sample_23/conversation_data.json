    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Substance Z**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let's determine the empirical formula. The mass fraction of carbon is 100% - 14.28% = 85.72%.\n    *   Ratio of moles C : H = (85.72 / 12.01) : (14.28 / 1.008) ≈ 7.14 : 14.17\n    *   Divide by the smallest number (7.14): C : H ≈ 1 : 1.98 ≈ 1 : 2.\n    *   So, the empirical formula of Z is CH2.\n    *   Z is also described as not reacting further with hydrogen, which means it is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n    *   A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula (CH2)n must be a cycloalkane, with the general formula CnH2n. An acyclic alkane has the formula CnH(2n+2).\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in any cycloalkane CnH2n is (2n * 1) / (n * 12 + 2n * 1) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857, which matches the given 14.28%.\n    *   So, Z is a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n\n2.  **Analyze Mixture Y and the Hydrogenation Reactions**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One of them is Z. Let's call the other one D. So, Y = {Z, D}.\n    *   Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated (like cycloalkanes) or aromatic (like benzene and its derivatives), as these do not react with bromine water under normal conditions.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives *only* substance Z.\n        *   Hydrogenation of Z (a saturated cycloalkane) gives Z.\n        *   Therefore, hydrogenation of D must also give Z.\n    *   If D were a saturated isomer of Z (e.g., if Z is cyclohexane, D could be methylcyclopentane), it would not be described as a product of disproportionation involving hydrogen transfer, and its hydrogenation to Z would require isomerization, not just simple H2 addition.\n    *   A more plausible candidate for D is an aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton as Z. Aromatic compounds do not decolorize bromine water and can be hydrogenated to the corresponding cycloalkane.\n    *   So, if Z = CnH2n, then D must be the corresponding aromatic compound, which would have the formula CnH(2n-6) (e.g., if Z is cyclohexane C6H12, D is benzene C6H6).\n    *   This fits all the criteria for Y: an equimolar mixture {CnH2n, CnH(2n-6)} would not decolorize bromine water, and its complete hydrogenation would yield only one product, CnH2n (Z).\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B. X = {A, B}.\n    *   X decolorizes bromine water, meaning A and B are unsaturated (contain C=C or C≡C bonds).\n    *   The reaction is: X → Y. Given the equimolar nature of both mixtures, the reaction is most likely A + B → Z + D.\n    *   This is a \"disproportionation\" reaction, which in this context means a hydrogen transfer reaction. One molecule gets reduced (gains H), and one gets oxidized (loses H).\n        *   A → Z (CnH2n)  OR  B → Z (CnH2n)\n        *   B → D (CnH(2n-6)) OR  A → D (CnH(2n-6))\n    *   Let's assume A is reduced and B is oxidized.\n        *   Oxidation: B → D + hydrogen. Specifically, B → CnH(2n-6).\n        *   Reduction: A + hydrogen → Z. Specifically, A → CnH2n.\n    *   The overall reaction is a hydrogen transfer: A + B → Z + D.\n    *   The problem states that hydrogenation of mixture X also gives only Z. This means both A and B, upon hydrogenation, yield Z. This confirms they both have the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n    *   A and B are therefore unsaturated cycloalkenes or cyclodienes. The problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Let's identify the most likely structures for A and B.\n        *   The substance that gets hydrogenated to a cycloalkane (Z, CnH2n) is most likely a cycloalkene with the formula CnH(2n-2). It gains 2H.\n        *   The substance that gets dehydrogenated to an aromatic compound (D, CnH(2n-6)) is most likely a non-conjugated cyclodiene with the formula CnH(2n-4). It loses 2H.\n    *   So, our reaction is: CnH(2n-2) + CnH(2n-4) → CnH2n + CnH(2n-6).\n    *   Let's check the hydrogen balance: (2n-2) + (2n-4) = 4n-6. And for the products: (2n) + (2n-6) = 4n-6. The reaction is perfectly balanced.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B.\n    *   Total H = (H in A) + (H in B) = (2n-2) + (2n-4) = 4n - 6.\n    *   Now we must find the value of 'n'. We can test the answer choices.\n        *   A) Total H = 12 → 4n - 6 = 12 → 4n = 18 → n = 4.5 (not an integer, so not possible).\n        *   B) Total H = 22 → 4n - 6 = 22 → 4n = 28 → n = 7. This is a possible solution.\n        *   C) Total H = 18 → 4n - 6 = 18 → 4n = 24 → n = 6. This is a possible solution.\n        *   D) Total H = 16 → 4n - 6 = 16 → 4n = 22 → n = 5.5 (not an integer, so not possible).\n\n5.  **Distinguish Between n=6 and n=7**\n    *   We have two plausible scenarios:\n        *   **n=6**: Z is cyclohexane (C6H12). X is a mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). The total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n        *   **n=7**: Z is methylcyclohexane (C7H14). X is a mixture of a methylcyclohexene (C7H12) and a non-conjugated methylcyclohexadiene (C7H10). The total H atoms = 12 + 10 = 22.\n    *   Both scenarios are chemically sound and fit all the conditions. However, in the absence of any information suggesting a substituted ring (like a methyl group), the most fundamental and common example should be chosen. The reaction described is a classic catalytic hydrogen transfer, and its archetypal example involves the unsubstituted C6 ring system (cyclohexane/benzene/cyclohexene/cyclohexadiene). Therefore, the most reasonable choice is n=6.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation**\n    *   For n=6, the two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   Total number of hydrogen atoms = 10 (from C6H10) + 8 (from C6H8) = 18.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
