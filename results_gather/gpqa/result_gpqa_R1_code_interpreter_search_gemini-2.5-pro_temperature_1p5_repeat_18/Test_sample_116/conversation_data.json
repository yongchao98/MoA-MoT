    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which of the given organic moieties show optical isomerism.\n\n**1. Understanding Optical Isomerism**\nOptical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. For a compound to exhibit optical isomerism, its molecule must be **chiral**. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are:\n*   **A chiral center:** An atom (usually carbon) bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Axial chirality (Atropisomerism):** Arises from restricted rotation around a single bond, creating a chiral axis. This is common in substituted biphenyls, allenes, and spiranes.\n\nA molecule is **achiral** (and thus does not show optical isomerism) if it possesses an element of symmetry such as:\n*   **A plane of symmetry (σ):** A plane that divides the molecule into two identical halves which are mirror images of each other.\n*   **A center of inversion (i):** A point within the molecule such that if any atom is connected to it and the line is extended an equal distance on the other side, it encounters an identical atom.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n**2. Analysis of Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl compound (two phenyl rings joined by a single bond). The key feature is the substituents at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6' relative to the bond connecting the rings).\n*   The ortho positions are occupied by bulky groups: two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH₃) and two nitro groups (-NO₂).\n*   **Chirality Check:** The presence of these four large groups at the ortho positions causes significant steric hindrance. This hindrance prevents the two phenyl rings from rotating freely around the central C-C single bond. Because the rotation is locked, the rings are held in a twisted, non-planar conformation.\n*   The resulting molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Its mirror image is non-superimposable.\n*   This phenomenon is called **atropisomerism**, a type of axial chirality.\n*   **Conclusion:** This compound is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**3. Analysis of Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is an ester also known as methyl lactate. Let's identify the groups on the carbon atoms. The formula is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n*   **Chirality Check:** Let's focus on the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the hydroxyl group). This carbon is bonded to four different groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   Since the carbon at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a **chiral center** (or asymmetric carbon).\n*   **Conclusion:** A molecule containing a single chiral center is always chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**4. Analysis of Compound 3: benzophenone**\n\n*   **Structure:** The chemical formula is (C₆H₅)₂CO. It consists of a central carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two phenyl rings.\n*   **Chirality Check:**\n    *   There are no chiral centers in the molecule. The central carbon is sp² hybridized (only bonded to three atoms).\n    *   The molecule possesses elements of symmetry. For instance, a plane of symmetry can pass through the C=O bond, bisecting the angle between the two phenyl rings. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   **Conclusion:** Benzophenone is an achiral molecule and does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**5. Analysis of Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two -COOCH₃ groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Chirality Check:**\n    *   There are no chiral centers. All carbons are sp² hybridized or part of methyl groups.\n    *   The molecule is planar and possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself).\n    *   It also has a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Conclusion:** Due to the presence of a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism. (Note: It does exhibit *cis-trans* or geometric isomerism with its isomer, dimethyl maleate, but that is different from optical isomerism).\n\n**Final Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
