    "Here is a breakdown of the reasoning and calculations to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Objective:** The goal is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, Planet1 and Planet2, which can be expressed as $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet in a circular orbit is given by the formula:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A)^{1/4}$\n    where:\n    *   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\n3.  **Forming the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$. Let's set up the ratio using the formula above:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} (R_{star}/(2a_1))^{1/2} (1-A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} (R_{star}/(2a_2))^{1/2} (1-A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\n    The problem states that both planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$), and they orbit the same star (so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both). Therefore, these terms cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^{1/2}$\n\n    This means we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes of the two planets' orbits.\n\n4.  **Relating Semi-Major Axis to Observations:** The problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method, specifically the maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) caused by each planet. The maximum Doppler shift is related to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity ($K$) by:\n    $K = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0} c$\n    where $c$ is the speed of light and $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's RV semi-amplitude ($K$) is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$), the star's mass ($M_{star}$), and the orbital semi-major axis ($a$) by the following equation (assuming the orbit is viewed edge-on, i.e., inclination $i=90^\\circ$, which is a good assumption for planets detected by both transit and RV methods):\n    $K = \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{M_{star} \\cdot a}} \\sqrt{G}$\n\n5.  **Solving for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** We can rearrange the above formula to solve for $a$:\n    $K^2 = \\frac{M_p^2 G}{M_{star} \\cdot a}$\n    $a = \\frac{G \\cdot M_p^2}{M_{star} \\cdot K^2}$\n\n6.  **Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes ($a_2/a_1$):** Now we can form the ratio for the semi-major axes:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G \\cdot M_{p2}^2 / (M_{star} \\cdot K_2^2)}{G \\cdot M_{p1}^2 / (M_{star} \\cdot K_1^2)}$\n\n    The gravitational constant ($G$) and the star's mass ($M_{star}$) cancel out, leaving:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n7.  **Calculating Component Ratios:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio:**\n        $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\ M_{Earth}}{7 \\ M_{Earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   **RV Semi-Amplitude Ratio (K):** This ratio is directly proportional to the ratio of the Doppler shifts.\n        $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{(\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\lambda_0)c}{(\\Delta\\lambda_2 / \\lambda_0)c} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\ \\text{Å}}{0.04 \\ \\text{Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n8.  **Substituting and Solving:** Substitute these ratios back into the equation for $a_2/a_1$:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\cdot \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\n9.  **Final Calculation for Temperature Ratio:** Finally, we calculate the temperature ratio using the relationship derived in step 3:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n    Now, we compute the numerical value.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes\n# a2/a1 = (Mp2/Mp1)^2 * (K1/K2)^2\n# Mp2/Mp1 = 5/7\n# K1/K2 = delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4\nratio_a2_a1 = (5/7)**2 * (3/4)**2\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures\n# Teq1/Teq2 = sqrt(a2/a1)\nratio_Teq = math.sqrt(ratio_a2_a1)\n\nprint(ratio_Teq)\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The primary objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2 ($T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$).\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates. For a planet in a circular orbit, this is given by:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where:\n    *   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   $A$ is the planet's bond albedo.\n\n3.  **Form the Ratio:** We need to compute the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$.\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** The problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both. It is also given that both planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). Therefore, these terms cancel out in the ratio.\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}$\n    To find the temperature ratio, we first need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits.\n\n5.  **Relate Observational Data to Physical Properties:** The problem provides data from the radial velocity (RV) method, specifically the maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) induced by each planet on a spectral line of the star.\n    The semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, $K$, is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift:\n    $K = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0} c$\n    where $c$ is the speed of light and $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength. Since $c$ and $\\lambda_0$ are constants, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\ \\text{Å}}{0.04 \\ \\text{Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n6.  **Connect RV Semi-Amplitude to Orbital Parameters:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's RV semi-amplitude ($K$) is related to the planet's mass ($M_p$), the star's mass ($M_{star}$), the orbital semi-major axis ($a$), and the orbital inclination ($i$) by:\n    $K = \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{\\sqrt{M_{star}+M_p}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}}$\n    Since the planets were detected by both transit and RV methods, we can assume the orbits are viewed nearly edge-on, so $\\sin i \\approx 1$. Also, the planet masses ($5-7 \\ M_{Earth}$) are much smaller than the star's mass ($1.5 \\ M_{Sun}$), so $M_{star}+M_p \\approx M_{star}$. The formula simplifies to:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{M_{star}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}}$\n\n7.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** We can rearrange this formula to solve for $a$:\n    $K^2 = \\frac{M_p^2 G}{M_{star} \\cdot a} \\implies a = \\frac{G \\cdot M_p^2}{M_{star} \\cdot K^2}$\n\n8.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** Now we can find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{\\frac{G \\cdot M_{p2}^2}{M_{star} \\cdot K_2^2}}{\\frac{G \\cdot M_{p1}^2}{M_{star} \\cdot K_1^2}}$\n    The gravitational constant $G$ and the star's mass $M_{star}$ cancel out:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n9.  **Substitute Known Values:** We have the ratios for mass and RV semi-amplitude:\n    *   $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\ M_{Earth}}{7 \\ M_{Earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n    Substitute these into the equation for the semi-major axis ratio:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\cdot \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\n10. **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:** Now substitute the value of $a_2/a_1$ back into the simplified temperature ratio equation from step 4:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n11. **Compute the Numerical Value:** To compare with the given options, we'll calculate the numerical value of the fraction 15/28.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# M_p1 = 7, M_p2 = 5\n# delta_lambda1 = 0.03, delta_lambda2 = 0.04\n# The ratio of planet masses squared is (M_p2/M_p1)^2\nmass_ratio_sq = (5 / 7)**2\n\n# The ratio of RV semi-amplitudes is K1/K2 = delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2\nK_ratio = 0.03 / 0.04\n\n# The ratio of semi-major axes a2/a1 = (M_p2/M_p1)^2 * (K1/K2)^2\na_ratio_2_over_1 = mass_ratio_sq * (K_ratio)**2\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures Teq1/Teq2 = sqrt(a2/a1)\ntemp_ratio = math.sqrt(a_ratio_2_over_1)\n\nprint(temp_ratio)\n```\nThe output `0.5357142857142857` is approximately 0.53.\n\nComparing this result to the options:\nA) ~ 0.53\nB) ~ 1.05\nC) ~ 1.30\nD) ~ 0.98\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Goal:** The objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 to Planet2, which is $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A)^{1/4}$\n    where $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature, $R_{star}$ is the star's radius, $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, and $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\n3.  **Form the Ratio:** We create the ratio for the two planets' equilibrium temperatures:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} (R_{star}/(2a_1))^{1/2} (1-A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} (R_{star}/(2a_2))^{1/2} (1-A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** The problem states that both planets orbit the same star (so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same) and they have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). These terms cancel out, simplifying the equation significantly:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{(1/a_1)^{1/2}}{(1/a_2)^{1/2}} = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^{1/2}$\n    This shows the temperature ratio depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes. Our next step is to find the ratio $a_2/a_1$.\n\n5.  **Use Radial Velocity (RV) Data:** The problem provides Doppler shift data, which relates to the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude, $K$. For a planet in a circular orbit (and assuming the planetary mass $M_p$ is much smaller than the star's mass $M_{star}$, and the orbit is edge-on with inclination $i=90^\\circ$), the formula for $K$ is:\n    $K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{M_{star}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}}$\n    where G is the gravitational constant.\n\n6.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis ($a$):** We can rearrange the formula to express $a$ in terms of the other variables:\n    $K^2 = \\frac{M_p^2 G}{M_{star} \\cdot a} \\implies a = \\frac{G \\cdot M_p^2}{M_{star} \\cdot K^2}$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes ($a_2/a_1$):** Now we form the ratio for the semi-major axes of the two planets:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G \\cdot M_{p2}^2 / (M_{star} \\cdot K_2^2)}{G \\cdot M_{p1}^2 / (M_{star} \\cdot K_1^2)}$\n    The constants $G$ and $M_{star}$ cancel out, leaving:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n8.  **Determine Component Ratios from Given Data:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio:** The problem gives $M_{p1} = 7 \\ M_{Earth}$ and $M_{p2} = 5 \\ M_{Earth}$.\n        $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   **RV Semi-Amplitude Ratio:** The RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$.\n        $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\ \\text{Å}}{0.04 \\ \\text{Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n9.  **Substitute and Calculate $a_2/a_1$:**\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\cdot \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\n10. **Final Calculation for the Temperature Ratio:** Substitute the result for $a_2/a_1$ back into the simplified temperature ratio equation from step 4.\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n11. **Numerical Value:** To match the options, we compute the decimal value.\n    $\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n12. **Conclusion:** The calculated ratio is approximately 0.536, which corresponds to option A.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Ratio of planet masses: Mp2 / Mp1\nmass_ratio = 5 / 7\n\n# Ratio of RV semi-amplitudes: K1 / K2\n# This is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts: Δλ1 / Δλ2\nK_ratio = 0.03 / 0.04\n\n# The ratio of semi-major axes a2/a1 = (Mp2/Mp1)^2 * (K1/K2)^2\na_ratio_2_over_1 = (mass_ratio**2) * (K_ratio**2)\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures Teq1/Teq2 = sqrt(a2/a1)\n# This can also be calculated directly as (Mp2/Mp1) * (K1/K2)\ntemp_ratio = math.sqrt(a_ratio_2_over_1)\n\nprint(temp_ratio)\n```\n<<<A>>>",
