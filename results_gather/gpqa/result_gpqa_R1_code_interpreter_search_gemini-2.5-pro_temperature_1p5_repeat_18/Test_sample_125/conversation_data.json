    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **Reaction I Analysis**\n\n1.  **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is `CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3`.\n    *   It has one chiral center at carbon C5, and its configuration is specified as (S). Since it's a single stereoisomer, the starting material is enantiomerically pure.\n\n2.  **Reagent:** LAH (Lithium aluminum hydride) followed by an acidic workup (H3O+).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. The carbonyl group at C3 will be reduced to a hydroxyl group (`-OH`).\n\n3.  **Product Formation and Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The reduction of the ketone `C=O` at C3 creates a new chiral center at C3. The carbon becomes `CH(OH)`.\n    *   The hydride ion (`H-`) can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces (the top face or the bottom face).\n    *   The original chiral center at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n    *   Since the starting molecule is chiral, the two faces of the carbonyl are diastereotopic. The attack of the hydride is not equally likely from both sides, leading to the formation of two different products in unequal amounts.\n    *   The products are (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    *   These two products have the same molecular formula and connectivity but differ in the configuration at one of their chiral centers (C3). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction I:** It produces a mixture of **two diastereomeric** compounds.\n\n### **Reaction II Analysis**\n\n1.  **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`.\n    *   This molecule is achiral; it has a plane of symmetry passing through the central `CH2` group.\n\n2.  **Reagent:** Excess NaBH4 (Sodium borohydride) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH4 is a reducing agent that also reduces ketones to alcohols. The \"excess\" indicates that both ketone groups will be reduced.\n\n3.  **Product Formation and Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: `CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3`.\n    *   This molecule has two new chiral centers, at C2 and C4.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   Let's examine these stereoisomers:\n        *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the starting material is achiral, they will be formed in a 1:1 ratio, creating a racemic mixture.\n        *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has a plane of symmetry (passing through C3) and is therefore an achiral **meso compound**. The (2S, 4R) configuration is identical to the (2R, 4S) one (just flipping the molecule).\n        *   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Reaction II:** It produces **three stereoisomers**: a racemic pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and one meso compound.\n\n### **Combined Product Mixture Analysis by HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains five distinct chemical compounds:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol  (from Rxn I)\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol  (from Rxn I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol      (from Rxn II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol      (from Rxn II)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol          (from Rxn II)\n\n#### **1. Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties (except for optical activity) and therefore **cannot be separated** on an achiral column. They will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** and **constitutional isomers** have different physical properties and **can be separated**.\n\nLet's analyze the mixture:\n*   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. They will separate into **2 peaks**.\n*   The three products from Reaction II consist of a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound.\n    *   The enantiomers, (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will co-elute as **1 peak**.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have a different retention time, giving a separate **1 peak**.\n    *   So, the products from Reaction II will show **2 peaks**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C7H16O2, an alcohol and an ether) are constitutional isomers of the products from Reaction II (C5H12O2, a diol). They are structurally very different and will have different retention times.\n*   Therefore, the total number of peaks on a normal-phase HPLC is the sum of the peaks from both sets of products: 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **2. Chiral HPLC (Chiral Stationary Phase)**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers.\n*   This type of column can separate **all stereoisomers**, including both enantiomers and diastereomers.\n\nLet's analyze the mixture:\n*   The mixture contains five unique stereoisomers.\n*   Assuming an ideal chiral column capable of resolving them all, each compound will have a unique retention time.\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> Peak 1\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol -> Peak 2\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 3\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 4\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol -> Peak 5\n*   Therefore, the total number of peaks observed on a chiral HPLC is **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to the option: 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<B>>>"
