    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Physical System\n\nWe have a point charge `q` and a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which is a key piece of information. A grounded conductor is connected to the Earth, which acts as a vast reservoir of charge. This means the conductor is an equipotential surface with a potential `V = 0`.\n\nThe presence of the point charge `q` will induce a redistribution of charges on the surface of the conducting sphere. The net force on the charge `q` will be the vector sum of the forces from all these induced charges. Calculating this force directly by integrating over the induced charge distribution is very difficult because the distribution itself is complex.\n\n### 2. The Method of Images\n\nA powerful technique for solving this kind of problem is the \"method of images.\" We replace the complicated system of the charge `q` and the grounded sphere with a simpler, equivalent system. This equivalent system consists of the original charge `q` and one or more \"image charges.\" The image charges are chosen such that they, along with the original charge `q`, correctly reproduce the boundary conditions of the original problem.\n\nFor this problem, the boundary condition is that the potential `V` on the surface of the sphere (at a distance `R` from the center) is zero.\n\n### 3. Finding the Image Charge and its Position\n\nLet's set up a coordinate system:\n*   The center of the sphere is at the origin (0, 0, 0).\n*   The charge `q` is placed on the z-axis at `z = d`.\n*   We hypothesize that a single image charge `q'` placed on the z-axis at `z = b` (where `b < R`) can satisfy the `V=0` condition on the sphere's surface.\n\nThe potential `V(P)` at any point `P` outside the sphere is the sum of the potentials from `q` and `q'`.\nThe condition is `V(r=R) = 0` for any angle. It can be shown through algebraic manipulation that this condition is met if:\n\n*   **Position of the image charge:** `b = R^2 / d`\n*   **Magnitude of the image charge:** `q' = -q * (R / d)`\n\nSo, the complex physical system of charge `q` and the grounded sphere is equivalent (for all points outside the sphere) to a simpler system of two point charges: `q` at `z=d` and `q'` at `z = R^2/d`.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position `d` in the presence of the grounded sphere. As we bring `q` closer, it exerts a force on the induced charges, and they exert a force back on `q`.\n\nThis work can be calculated as the interaction energy of the charge `q` with the potential created by the induced charges on the sphere. A crucial point in electrostatic energy calculations is that the energy of a charge `q` in the potential `V` created by other charges is `U = (1/2)qV`. The factor of `1/2` arises because the source of the potential (the induced charges) is itself created by `q`, so we avoid double-counting the energy.\n\n1.  **Potential at `q` due to the sphere:** The potential at the location of `q` (at `z=d`) due to the induced charges on the sphere is, by the method of images, the same as the potential created by the image charge `q'`.\n\n2.  **Calculate this potential (let's call it `V_image`):**\n    *   The image charge `q'` is at `b = R^2/d`.\n    *   The original charge `q` is at `d`.\n    *   The distance between them is `Δz = d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n    *   The potential at `d` due to `q'` is:\n        `V_image = k * q' / Δz`\n        `V_image = k * (-q * R/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n        `V_image = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n3.  **Calculate the total potential energy `U` of the system:**\n    The potential energy of the system is the work done to assemble it. This is equal to half the charge `q` multiplied by the potential it experiences from the other charges (the induced charges on the sphere).\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`. This matches option A. The energy is negative because the force between the charge `q` and the grounded sphere is attractive (since `q'` has the opposite sign to `q`), meaning the system does work as the charge is brought in from infinity.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\nB) `U = - k * q^2 * d / (d^2 - R^2)`\nC) `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * d / (d^2 + R^2)`\nD) `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R^2 / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nOur derived expression matches option A perfectly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
