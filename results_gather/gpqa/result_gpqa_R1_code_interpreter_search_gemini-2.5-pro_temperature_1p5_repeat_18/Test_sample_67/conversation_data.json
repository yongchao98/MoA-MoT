    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Define the Initial State\n\n*   The particle is a spin-1/2 particle. Its spin state can be described by a two-component vector (a spinor).\n*   The magnetic moment is given by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `S` is the spin operator.\n*   Initially, the particle is in a magnetic field `B_vec = B k̂` (pointing in the +Z direction). The problem states the particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with this field. This means the system is in its lowest energy state.\n*   The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is `H = -μ ⋅ B_vec`.\n*   The initial Hamiltonian is `H₀ = -γS ⋅ (B k̂) = -γB S_z`.\n*   The eigenstates of `S_z` are spin-up `|+z⟩` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z⟩` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n*   The corresponding energies are `E₊ = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E₋ = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n*   The lowest energy state (most stable alignment) is the spin-up state, `|+z⟩`.\n*   So, the initial state of the system at time `t=0` is `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩`. In the standard z-basis, this is represented by the vector `[[1], [0]]`.\n\n### 2. Define the New Hamiltonian and Time Evolution\n\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is suddenly changed to `B_vec = B ĵ` (pointing in the +Y direction).\n*   The new Hamiltonian for `t > 0` is `H = -μ ⋅ B_vec = -γS ⋅ (B ĵ) = -γB S_y`.\n*   The state of the system evolves according to the Schrödinger equation, `|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t)|ψ(0)⟩`, where `U(t) = exp(-iHt/ħ)` is the time evolution operator.\n*   Substituting the new `H`, we get `U(t) = exp(-i(-γB S_y)t/ħ) = exp(iγBt S_y / ħ)`.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Time-Evolved State `|ψ(t)⟩`\n\nWe can calculate the exponential of the `S_y` matrix. Let `ω = γB`. This `ω` is the Larmor frequency.\nThe evolution operator is `U(t) = exp(iωt S_y / ħ)`.\n\nThe matrix for `S_y` in the z-basis is `S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\nThe evolution operator can be calculated using the identity `exp(iθ n ⋅ σ) = I cos(θ) + i (n ⋅ σ) sin(θ)`, where `σ` are the Pauli matrices. Here, the operator is `exp(i(ωt/2) σ_y)`.\n`U(t) = cos(ωt/2) * I + i * sin(ωt/2) * σ_y`\n`U(t) = cos(ωt/2) * [[1, 0], [0, 1]] + i * sin(ωt/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n`U(t) = [[cos(ωt/2), 0], [0, cos(ωt/2)]] + [[0, sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), 0]]`\n`U(t) = [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]]`\n\nNow, we apply this operator to the initial state `|ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩ = [[1], [0]]`:\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = U(t) |ψ(0)⟩ = [[cos(ωt/2), sin(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2), cos(ωt/2)]] * [[1], [0]]`\n`|ψ(t)⟩ = [[cos(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2)]]`\nIn Dirac notation, this is `|ψ(t)⟩ = cos(ωt/2)|+z⟩ - sin(ωt/2)|-z⟩`.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Expectation Value of `μ_z`\n\nWe need to find the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z>(t)`.\n`<μ_z>(t) = ⟨ψ(t)| μ_z |ψ(t)⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| γS_z |ψ(t)⟩ = γ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩`.\n\nLet's calculate `⟨S_z⟩(t) = ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩`.\n*   `⟨ψ(t)|` is the conjugate transpose of `|ψ(t)⟩`, which is `[cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)]`.\n*   The operator `S_z` in the z-basis is `S_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`.\n\nSo, the calculation is:\n`⟨S_z⟩(t) = [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)] * (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [[cos(ωt/2)], [-sin(ωt/2)]]`\n`⟨S_z⟩(t) = [cos(ωt/2), -sin(ωt/2)] * (ħ/2) * [[cos(ωt/2)], [sin(ωt/2)]]`\n`⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) * (cos²(ωt/2) - sin²(ωt/2))`\n\nUsing the trigonometric identity `cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ)`, we get:\n`⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`\n\nFinally, the expectation value of the magnetic moment's z-component is:\n`<μ_z>(t) = γ * ⟨S_z⟩(t) = γ * (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`\n\n### 5. Identify the Oscillation Frequency\n\nThe expression for `<μ_z>(t)` is `(γħ/2) * cos(ωt)`.\nThe time-dependent part is `cos(ωt)`. This describes a simple harmonic oscillation.\nThe general form is `A * cos(ω_osc * t + φ)`.\nBy comparing the terms, we see that the angular frequency of oscillation is `ω_osc = ω`.\nWe previously defined `ω = γB`.\n\nSo, the oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\n### Alternative Method: Larmor Precession\n\nThis problem is a classic example of Larmor precession. The torque `τ` on a magnetic moment `μ` in a magnetic field `B` is `τ = μ × B`. This torque causes a change in the angular momentum `S`, according to `dS/dt = τ`.\n*   `dS/dt = μ × B`\n*   Since `μ = γS`, we have `dS/dt = γ(S × B)`.\nThis equation describes the precession of the spin vector `S` around the magnetic field vector `B` with an angular frequency `ω_L = γB`. This frequency is called the Larmor frequency.\nIn our case, the spin is initially along the Z-axis, and the magnetic field is along the Y-axis. The spin vector will precess around the Y-axis in the X-Z plane. Its projection onto the Z-axis will oscillate between `+S_z` and `-S_z` with the Larmor frequency. Therefore, the oscillation frequency is `ω = γB`.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. Comparing this with the given options:\n\nA) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nB) gamma*B/2\nC) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nD) gamma*B\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
