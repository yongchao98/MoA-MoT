    "This problem requires the application of the relativistic velocity addition formula. Let's define the reference frames and velocities involved.\n\n1.  **Reference Frames:**\n    *   Let S be the stationary laboratory frame, where the observer is located.\n    *   Let S' be the moving reference frame, which is the rest frame of the glass.\n\n2.  **Velocities:**\n    *   The velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the laboratory (frame S) is *v*. The problem states the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam. Let's assume this is the positive direction, so the velocity is +*v*.\n    *   The speed of light in the glass, as measured in the glass's own rest frame (S'), is *u'*. The index of refraction *n* is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (*c*) to the speed of light in the medium (*u'*).\n        *   *n* = *c* / *u'*\n    *   The problem specifies that the speed of light in a vacuum is *c* = 1. Therefore:\n        *   *n* = 1 / *u'*\n        *   This gives us the speed of light in the glass frame: *u'* = 1/*n*. Since the beam propagates in the same direction as the glass, its velocity is +*u'*.\n\n3.  **Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the speed of the light beam in the laboratory frame (S). Let's call this speed *u*.\n\n4.  **Relativistic Velocity Addition:**\n    *   The formula for adding velocities that are in the same direction in special relativity is:\n        *u* = (*u'* + *v*) / (1 + (*u'* * v*) / *c*Â²)\n    *   Substituting *c* = 1, the formula simplifies to:\n        *u* = (*u'* + *v*) / (1 + *u'* *v*)\n\n5.  **Calculation:**\n    *   Now, we substitute the value of *u'* = 1/*n* into the velocity addition formula:\n        *u* = ( (1/*n*) + *v* ) / ( 1 + (1/*n*) * v )\n    *   To simplify this complex fraction, let's combine the terms in the numerator and the denominator:\n        *   Numerator: (1/*n*) + *v* = (1 + *n*v) / *n*\n        *   Denominator: 1 + (v/*n*) = (*n* + *v*) / *n*\n    *   Now, substitute these back into the expression for *u*:\n        *u* = [ (1 + *n*v) / *n* ] / [ (*n* + *v*) / *n* ]\n    *   We can cancel the *n* term from the numerator and the denominator:\n        *u* = (1 + *n*v) / (*n* + *v*)\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is (*1 + n*v) / (*n + v*).\n    *   Comparing this result with the given options:\n        A) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n        B) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n        C) 1\n        D) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n    *   Our derived result matches option B.\n\nThis effect is known as the Fresnel drag effect, which was experimentally observed by Fizeau and later explained perfectly by Einstein's theory of special relativity.\n\n<<<B>>>"
