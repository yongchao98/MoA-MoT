    "Here is a step-by-step process to determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n### 1. Identify the Parent Compound and Principal Functional Group\n\n*   The molecule is based on a benzene ring.\n*   It contains several functional groups: carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2), and methoxy (-OCH3).\n*   According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority.\n*   Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is designated as position **C1**.\n\n### 2. Place the Substituents on the Benzene Ring based on the Description\n\n*   **C1**: -COOH (by definition)\n*   **Para to carboxylic acid (C1) is a methoxy group**: The para position is C4. So, **C4** has a **-OCH3** (methoxy) group.\n*   **Ortho to the carboxylic acid (C1) are a hydroxyl and a dimethylamino group**: The ortho positions are C2 and C6. So, **C2** and **C6** have **-OH** (hydroxyl) and **-N(CH3)2** (dimethylamino) groups, one at each position.\n*   **Meta to the carboxylic acid (C1) are a carbaldehyde and a cyano group**: The meta positions are C3 and C5. So, **C3** and **C5** have **-CHO** (formyl) and **-CN** (cyano) groups, one at each position.\n\nAt this point, the ring looks like this:\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C2/C6: -OH and -N(CH3)2\n*   C3/C5: -CN and -CHO\n*   C4: -OCH3\n\n### 3. Use the Final Constraint to Determine the Exact Positions\n\n*   The final piece of information is: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   The methoxy group is fixed at **C4**.\n    *   The nitrile (cyano group) must be at C3 or C5.\n    *   The alcohol (hydroxyl group) must be at C2 or C6.\n\n*   Let's test the two possibilities for the cyano group's position:\n    *   **Case 1: Cyano group is at C3.** The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4. For the methoxy (at C4) and hydroxyl to be ortho to it, the hydroxyl group must be at **C2**. This configuration works.\n    *   **Case 2: Cyano group is at C5.** The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6. For the methoxy (at C4) and hydroxyl to be ortho to it, the hydroxyl group must be at **C6**. This configuration also works.\n\n*   This gives us two possible structures, which are mirror images of each other depending on the numbering direction (clockwise vs. counter-clockwise).\n\n    *   **Structure from Case 1 (Clockwise numbering):**\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -OH (hydroxyl)\n        *   C3: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CHO (formyl)\n        *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n\n    *   **Structure from Case 2 (Counter-clockwise numbering):**\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n        *   C3: -CHO (formyl)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C6: -OH (hydroxyl)\n\n### 4. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules to Choose the Correct Structure/Numbering\n\n*   IUPAC rules state that we must number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants (numbers). In this case, both numbering directions (clockwise and counter-clockwise) result in the same set of locants: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n*   **Tie-breaker rule:** When the locant sets are identical, we assign the lowest numbers to the substituents that appear first alphabetically.\n*   Let's list the substituents alphabetically (prefixes like 'di-' are ignored for alphabetization):\n    1.  **c**yano\n    2.  **d**imethylamino\n    3.  **f**ormyl\n    4.  **h**ydroxy\n    5.  **m**ethoxy\n\n*   Now, compare the locants for the first substituent in the alphabetical list ('cyano') in both structures:\n    *   In the first structure (clockwise numbering), **cyano** is at position **3**.\n    *   In the second structure (counter-clockwise numbering), **cyano** is at position **5**.\n*   Since 3 is lower than 5, the first structure (clockwise numbering) is the correct one according to IUPAC rules.\n\n### 5. Construct the Final IUPAC Name\n\n*   Using the correct structure (Case 1), we list the substituents alphabetically, followed by the parent name.\n    *   **3-cyano**\n    *   **6-(dimethylamino)** (parentheses are used for complex substituents)\n    *   **5-formyl**\n    *   **2-hydroxy**\n    *   **4-methoxy**\n*   Combining these gives the full name: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n### 6. Compare with the Given Options\n\n*   A) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - Incorrect alphabetization.\n*   B) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - **This matches our derived name exactly.**\n*   C) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - This is the name for the incorrectly numbered structure.\n*   D) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - Describes the incorrect structure and is not alphabetized.\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
