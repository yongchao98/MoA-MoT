    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial problem**: We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH). This solution is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. The resulting solution is then titrated with 0.1 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH). We need to find the pH at two specific points: 25% titration and the equivalence point. We are given the acid dissociation constant (Ka) for acetic acid as 1.85 x 10⁻⁵.\n\n2.  **Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution**:\n    *   Initial volume of acetic acid (V₁) = 20.00 cm³ = 20.00 mL\n    *   Initial concentration of acetic acid (M₁) = 0.05 M\n    *   Volume of water added = 20.00 cm³ = 20.00 mL\n    *   Final volume after dilution (V₂) = 20.00 mL + 20.00 mL = 40.00 mL\n    *   We use the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂ to find the new concentration (M₂).\n    *   (0.05 M) × (20.00 mL) = M₂ × (40.00 mL)\n    *   M₂ = (0.05 × 20.00) / 40.00 = 1.00 / 40.00 = 0.025 M\n    *   So, we are titrating 40.00 mL of 0.025 M CH₃COOH.\n\n3.  **Determine the reaction**: The titration involves a weak acid (CH₃COOH) and a strong base (NaOH).\n    *   The balanced chemical equation is: CH₃COOH(aq) + NaOH(aq) → CH₃COONa(aq) + H₂O(l)\n\n4.  **Calculate the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point**:\n    *   First, calculate the initial moles of acetic acid.\n    *   Moles CH₃COOH = Molarity × Volume (in L) = 0.025 mol/L × 0.040 L = 0.001 moles.\n    *   At the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added will be equal to the initial moles of CH₃COOH.\n    *   Moles NaOH = 0.001 moles.\n    *   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 mL.\n\n5.  **Calculate the pH at 25% titration**:\n    *   25% titration means that 25% of the equivalence volume of NaOH has been added.\n    *   Volume of NaOH added = 25% of 10.00 mL = 0.25 × 10.00 mL = 2.50 mL.\n    *   At this stage, the solution contains a mixture of unreacted acetic acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), formed from the reaction. This is a buffer solution.\n    *   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]), where HA is the acid and A⁻ is the conjugate base.\n    *   First, calculate pKa: pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733.\n    *   At 25% titration, 25% of the acid has been converted to its conjugate base, and 75% remains as the acid.\n    *   The ratio [A⁻]/[HA] is therefore 25/75 = 1/3.\n    *   Now, calculate the pH:\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - log(3) = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256.\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH at 25% titration is **4.26**.\n\n6.  **Calculate the pH at the equivalence point**:\n    *   At the equivalence point, all the CH₃COOH has been neutralized by the NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution contains only the conjugate base, CH₃COO⁻.\n    *   The total volume of the solution is the initial volume of the acid plus the volume of NaOH added: 40.00 mL + 10.00 mL = 50.00 mL = 0.050 L.\n    *   The moles of acetate formed are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid: 0.001 moles.\n    *   The concentration of acetate [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n    *   The acetate ion will react with water (hydrolysis), acting as a weak base:\n        CH₃COO⁻(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ CH₃COOH(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate. We can find it using the relationship Kw = Ka × Kb, where Kw = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰.\n    *   We set up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis: Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻].\n    *   Let 'x' be the concentration of OH⁻ produced at equilibrium. Then [OH⁻] = x and [CH₃COOH] = x, and [CH₃COO⁻] = 0.02 - x.\n    *   5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x).\n    *   Since Kb is very small, we can assume that x is much smaller than 0.02, so (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    *   x² ≈ (5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 = 1.081 × 10⁻¹¹.\n    *   x = √ (1.081 × 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 × 10⁻⁶ M.\n    *   So, [OH⁻] = 3.288 × 10⁻⁶ M.\n    *   Now, calculate the pOH: pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483.\n    *   Finally, calculate the pH: pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 = 8.517.\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\n7.  **Compare with the options**:\n    *   Calculated pH at 25% titration ≈ 4.26\n    *   Calculated pH at equivalence point ≈ 8.52\n    *   These values match option C.\n\nFinal Answer Check: The initial solution is a weak acid, so the pH starts low. As a strong base is added, the pH rises. At 25% titration, we are in the buffer region, and pH < pKa (since [A-]/[HA] < 1), which is consistent (4.26 < 4.73). At the equivalence point, the solution contains a weak base (acetate), so the pH should be above 7, which is also consistent (8.52 > 7). The calculations and logic are sound.\n\n<<<C>>>"
