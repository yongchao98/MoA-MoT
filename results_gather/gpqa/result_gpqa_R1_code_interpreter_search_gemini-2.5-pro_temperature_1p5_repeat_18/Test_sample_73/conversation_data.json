    "This is a classic problem involving the memoryless property of exponential decay. Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Physics:** Radioactive decay is a random process. For a single unstable nucleus, the probability of it decaying in any given time interval is constant, regardless of how long it has already existed. This is known as the \"memoryless\" property of exponential decay.\n\n2.  **Define the Mathematical Model:** The probability of a nucleus *surviving* (not decaying) for a time `t` is given by the exponential decay formula:\n    P(survival, t) = e^(-λt)\n    where λ is the decay constant.\n\n    The probability of the nucleus *decaying* within a time `t` is:\n    P(decay, t) = 1 - P(survival, t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\n3.  **Calculate the Decay Constant (λ):**\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    P(decay, 100) = 0.32\n    1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32\n    e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32\n    e^(-100λ) = 0.68\n\n    To solve for λ, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    -100λ = ln(0.68)\n    λ = -ln(0.68) / 100\n\n    We can calculate this value.\n\n    ```python\n    import math\n\n    # Calculate the decay constant lambda\n    lambda_val = -math.log(0.68) / 100\n    print(f\"The decay constant lambda is: {lambda_val} per minute\")\n    ```\n\n4.  **Apply the Memoryless Property:**\n    The problem states that 50 minutes have already passed without decay. Because radioactive decay is memoryless, this information is irrelevant for calculating *future* probabilities. The clock essentially \"resets\". We are interested in the probability of decay in the *next* 150 minutes, starting from now (t=50).\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Probability:**\n    We need to find the probability that the atom, which exists now, will decay within the next 150 minutes. We use the same decay formula with `t = 150`.\n\n    P(decay in next 150 min) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\n    We substitute the expression for λ we found in step 3:\n    P = 1 - e^((-ln(0.68) / 100) * 150)\n    P = 1 - e^(ln(0.68) * (-150 / 100))\n    P = 1 - e^(ln(0.68) * -1.5)\n\n    Using the logarithm property that `e^(ln(x)*y) = (e^ln(x))^y = x^y`:\n    P = 1 - (0.68)^1.5\n\n    Now, we compute the final value.\n\n    ```python\n    import math\n\n    # Calculate the final probability\n    # P = 1 - (0.68)^1.5\n    probability = 1 - math.pow(0.68, 1.5)\n    \n    # Convert to percentage and round\n    percentage_probability = round(probability * 100)\n    \n    print(f\"The probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately {percentage_probability}%.\")\n    ```\n\nThe calculation shows the probability is approximately 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>"
