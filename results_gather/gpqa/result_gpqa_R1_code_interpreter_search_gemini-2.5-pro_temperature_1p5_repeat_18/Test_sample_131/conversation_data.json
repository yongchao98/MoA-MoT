    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the two compounds in the mixture.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula and Initial Information**\n\n*   All candidate compounds (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene) have the same molecular formula: C10H14.\n*   The spectrum is of a 1:1 molar mixture of two of these compounds.\n*   The total number of protons per molecule is 14.\n\n**2. Analyze the 1H NMR Spectral Data**\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   Since it is a 1:1 mixture, the fact that the signals have a 1:1 intensity ratio means that each signal arises from the same number of protons.\n    *   This strongly suggests that we are mixing two compounds, each of which produces a single, distinct singlet in the aromatic region, and the number of protons responsible for each singlet is identical.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n    *   These signals must be the sum of all the alkyl proton signals from the two compounds in the mixture.\n    *   Let's determine the total number of protons represented by this alkyl region. All C10H14 isomers with a benzene ring and only methyl/ethyl substituents are either tetramethylbenzenes or diethylbenzenes.\n        *   Tetramethylbenzenes: 4 aromatic C-H bonds are replaced by C-CH3. This leaves 6 - 4 = 2 aromatic protons. The number of alkyl protons is 4 * 3 = 12. Total = 2 + 12 = 14.\n        *   Diethylbenzenes: 2 aromatic C-H bonds are replaced by C-CH2CH3. This leaves 6 - 2 = 4 aromatic protons. The number of alkyl protons is 2 * (2+3) = 10. Total = 4 + 10 = 14.\n    *   The problem states all alkyl signals are singlets. This immediately rules out **1,4-diethylbenzene**, which would show a quartet (for the -CH2- groups) and a triplet (for the -CH3 groups) due to spin-spin coupling. This eliminates option C.\n    *   So, both compounds must be tetramethylbenzene isomers. Each molecule has 2 aromatic protons and 12 alkyl (methyl) protons.\n    *   In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of alkyl protons is 12 (from compound A) + 12 (from compound B) = 24 protons.\n    *   The ratio of the three singlets is 2:1:1. Let the integration of the smallest peak be 'x'. Then the integrations are 2x, x, and x.\n    *   The total integration is 2x + x + x = 4x.\n    *   So, 4x = 24 protons, which means x = 6 protons.\n    *   Therefore, the three singlets in the alkyl region must integrate to **12H**, **6H**, and **6H**.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Remaining Candidate**\n\nLet's predict the spectrum for each tetramethylbenzene isomer, focusing on the number and integration of signals.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet** for **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl protons:** The four methyl groups are all equivalent. They produce **one singlet** for **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet** for **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl protons:** The methyl groups at 1 and 4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at 2 and 3 are equivalent. They produce **two singlets**, each for **6H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has no symmetry (or, under some conditions, a plane of symmetry leading to a different prediction, but we will see this compound is ruled out by the aromatic signal count). The most rigorous analysis shows different environments for the protons and methyl groups.\n    *   **Aromatic protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They would produce **two separate singlets**, each for **1H**. This contradicts the requirement for a compound that gives a *single* aromatic signal. Therefore, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene cannot be one of the compounds in the mixture, as its presence would lead to at least three signals in the aromatic region. This eliminates options A and D.\n\n**4. Identify the Correct Mixture**\n\nThe only remaining possibility is option B. Let's verify that a 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** matches all the data.\n\n*   **Mixture:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (1:1)\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-isomer gives one 2H singlet.\n    *   1,2,3,4-isomer gives one 2H singlet.\n    *   Assuming their chemical shifts are different, the mixture will show **two singlets**, each corresponding to 2H. The intensity ratio will be 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-isomer gives one singlet corresponding to **12H**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-isomer gives two singlets, each corresponding to **6H**.\n    *   The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is also a perfect match.\n\nBoth the aromatic and alkyl regions of the described spectrum are perfectly explained by a 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
