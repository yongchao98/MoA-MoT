    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the thermodynamic part of the question.**\n    *   The question asks about the strength of oxygen as an oxidant in basic solutions. The strength of an oxidant is determined by its standard reduction potential (E°). A higher (more positive) E° indicates a stronger oxidant.\n    *   We need to compare the reduction potential of oxygen in acidic solution versus basic solution.\n    *   The half-reaction for the reduction of oxygen in **acidic solution** is:\n        O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l)\n        The standard reduction potential for this reaction is E° = +1.23 V.\n    *   The half-reaction for the reduction of oxygen in **basic solution** is:\n        O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq)\n        The standard reduction potential for this reaction is E° = +0.40 V.\n    *   Since +1.23 V (acidic) > +0.40 V (basic), oxygen is thermodynamically a stronger oxidant in acidic solution and a **weaker** oxidant in basic solution.\n    *   Therefore, the first blank should be \"weaker\".\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the kinetic part of the question.**\n    *   The question asks about the reaction rate (kinetics) of oxygen in acidic solutions.\n    *   The reduction of oxygen involves the transfer of four electrons and the breaking of a strong O=O double bond.\n    *   Processes that involve multi-electron transfers and the breaking of strong covalent bonds typically have a high activation energy.\n    *   A high activation energy means that the reaction rate is slow, even if the reaction is thermodynamically favorable (as indicated by the high positive E° in acid).\n    *   This kinetic sluggishness of oxygen reduction is well-known and is the reason why many spontaneous oxidation reactions (like the corrosion of many metals) are slow in practice.\n    *   Therefore, kinetically, oxygen reacts **slower** in acidic solutions (and in general, at room temperature without a catalyst).\n    *   The second blank should be \"slower\".\n\n*   **Step 3: Combine the findings.**\n    *   The first word is \"weaker\".\n    *   The second word is \"slower\".\n    *   This corresponds to the combination \"weaker – slower\".\n\n*   **Step 4: Match with the given options.**\n    *   A) stronger – slower\n    *   B) weaker – faster\n    *   C) weaker - slower\n    *   D) stronger – faster\n\n    The correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
