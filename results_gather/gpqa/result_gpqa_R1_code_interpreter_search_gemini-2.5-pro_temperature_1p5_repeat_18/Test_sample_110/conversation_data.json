    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for completing the two reactions and identifying the major products.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reagents:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This is a ketone with two alpha-carbons (α-carbons), C2 and C6.\n    *   **Reagent:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CHCOOEt). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester, which acts as a Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong and sterically bulky base.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Type:**\n    The reaction between a ketone enolate and an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound is a **Michael Addition**. The base is used to form the nucleophilic enolate from the ketone.\n\n3.  **Formation of the Enolate (Nucleophile):**\n    *   The base (t-BuOK) will remove an acidic proton from one of the α-carbons of the ketone to form an enolate.\n    *   Let's examine the α-carbons of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one:\n        *   **C2:** This carbon is quaternary, bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group. It has **no α-protons**.\n        *   **C6:** This carbon is tertiary, bonded to a methyl group and one hydrogen. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Since C2 has no protons, the base can only deprotonate C6. The bulky t-BuOK abstracts the proton from C6 to form the corresponding enolate. The double bond of the enolate will be between C1 and C6.\n\n4.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The enolate is the nucleophile. The C6 of the enolate attacks the electron-deficient β-carbon of the Michael acceptor, ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate moiety.\n    *   The reaction is completed by a protonation step (e.g., during aqueous workup) to neutralize the intermediate enolate formed from the acrylate.\n\n5.  **Structure of Product A:**\n    *   The original cyclohexanone ring remains, but now has a new substituent at the C6 position.\n    *   The new substituent is derived from ethyl acrylate: -CH₂-CH₂-COOEt.\n    *   The final structure has the original ethyl and methyl groups at C2, the original methyl group at C6, and the new `-(CH₂)₂COOEt` group also at C6.\n    *   To name this product systematically, we can treat the ester as the principal functional group. The parent chain is ethyl propanoate. The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on this chain.\n    *   Numbering for the name: The propanoate chain is `(cyclohexyl)-CH₂(β)-CH₂(α)-COOEt`. The cyclohexyl group is at position 3. We now need to name the cyclohexyl substituent. The attachment point on the ring is designated as C1 of the substituent.\n        *   Original C6 (reaction site) -> New C1 (attachment site, also has a methyl group).\n        *   Original C1 (ketone) -> New C2 (has the oxo group).\n        *   Original C2 (ethyl and methyl) -> New C3 (has an ethyl and a methyl group).\n    *   So, the substituent name is **(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)**.\n    *   The full name of Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reagents:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The protons on the carbon adjacent to the nitro group (α-carbon) are acidic.\n    *   **Reagent:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃CH=CHCN). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, a Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH). A strong base.\n    *   **Solvent:** Water (H₂O), which also acts as a proton source for the final step.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Type:**\n    This is also a **Michael Addition**. The α-carbon of the nitroalkane is deprotonated to form a nucleophilic carbanion (a nitronate ion).\n\n3.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:**\n    *   KOH removes a proton from the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane.\n    *   CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂ + OH⁻ ⇌ [CH₃CH₂CHNO₂]⁻ (a resonance-stabilized nitronate anion) + H₂O.\n\n4.  **The Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   The β-carbon in CH₃(γ)-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN is the carbon bearing the methyl group.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n\n5.  **Structure of Product B:**\n    *   Let's connect the fragments:\n        *   From 1-nitropropane: `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)-`\n        *   From but-2-enenitrile: `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` (after attack and protonation by H₂O)\n    *   Combining them gives the structure: `CH₃CH₂CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN`.\n    *   To name this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The IUPAC name will be based on alkanenitrile.\n    *   Find the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon (C1).\n    *   `C(6)H₃-C(5)H₂-C(4)H(NO₂)-C(3)H(CH₃)-C(2)H₂-C(1)N`\n    *   The chain has 6 carbons, so it is a hexanenitrile.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The name of Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   A) A is correct, B is incorrect.\n*   B) A is incorrect, B is correct.\n*   **C) A is correct, B is correct.**\n*   D) A is incorrect, B is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
