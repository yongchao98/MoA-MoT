    "Here is a detailed step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\nLet's draw the structure and analyze the positions of the substituents:\n- On a benzene ring, we have:\n    - An **ethoxy group (-OEt)** at position C1.\n    - A **tert-butyl group (-tBu)** at position C2.\n    - A **nitro group (-NO2)** at position C3.\n\nThe relative positions of the groups are:\n- The -tBu group is **ortho** to the -OEt group.\n- The -tBu group is **ortho** to the -NO2 group.\n- The -OEt group is **meta** to the -NO2 group.\n\nThis 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern is key. Achieving this specific substitution pattern requires careful consideration of the directing effects of the substituents at each step.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents\n\n-   **tert-Butyl (-tBu):** An alkyl group. It's an **ortho, para-director** and an activating group. It is very bulky, which can sterically hinder substitution at the ortho positions.\n-   **Ethoxy (-OEt):** An alkoxy group. It's a strongly activating **ortho, para-director**.\n-   **Nitro (-NO2):** A strongly deactivating **meta-director**.\n-   **Amino (-NH2):** A strongly activating **ortho, para-director**. It is formed by the reduction of a nitro group (e.g., using Fe/HCl). In strongly acidic solutions, it's protonated to the **anilinium ion (-NH3+)**, which becomes a deactivating **meta-director**.\n-   **Sulfonic Acid (-SO3H):** A strongly deactivating **meta-director**. It can be used as a \"blocking group\" to protect a position (usually the para position) and can be removed later (desulfonation) by heating with dilute acid.\n-   **Hydroxyl (-OH):** A strongly activating **ortho, para-director**. It can be formed from an amino group via diazotization followed by hydrolysis. It can be converted to an ethoxy group via Williamson ether synthesis (e.g., NaOH/EtBr).\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences\n\nLet's evaluate each option to see if it leads to the correct isomer in a chemically logical way.\n\n**Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n1.  Benzene -> Nitrobenzene\n2.  Nitrobenzene -> Aniline\n3.  Aniline + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts alkylation): This reaction fails. The amino group of aniline is a Lewis base that reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3). This forms a complex (-NH2-AlCl3+) that strongly deactivates the ring, preventing the Friedel-Crafts reaction. Thus, Option A is incorrect.\n\n**Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n1.  Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene\n2.  tert-Butylbenzene -> Nitration gives a mixture of ortho- and para-nitro-tert-butylbenzene.\n3.  Let's assume we proceed with either isomer. The next step is sulfonation.\n4.  Step (iv) is NaNO2/HCl. This reagent is used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). At this stage in the synthesis, there is no amino group present on the ring; there is a nitro group. Therefore, this step is impossible. Thus, Option B is incorrect.\n\n**Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\nThis path uses a sulfonic acid blocking group.\n1.  Benzene -> tert-Butylbenzene\n2.  tert-Butylbenzene -> Sulfonation. The bulky tBu group directs para. Product: **p-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This blocks the para position.\n3.  Nitration: Both the -tBu (o,p-director) and -SO3H (m-director) groups direct the incoming nitro group to the position ortho to the -tBu group. Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\nIn this molecule, the tBu group and the NO2 group are **meta** to each other. However, in the final target molecule, the tBu group and the NO2 group must be **ortho** to each other. Since this key relative positioning is incorrect, this pathway cannot lead to the desired product. Thus, Option C is incorrect.\n\n**Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ...`\nLet's analyze this sequence step-by-step.\n1.  **Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl3 -> tert-Butylbenzene.** (Correct)\n2.  **Nitration of tert-Butylbenzene:** This gives a mixture of o- and p-isomers. The para isomer is major due to sterics, but the **ortho-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** is also formed and can be separated. Let's proceed with the ortho isomer. (Plausible)\n3.  **Fe/HCl reduction:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group. Product: **2-tert-butylaniline**. (Correct)\n4.  **Nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline:** This is a key step. In the strong acid medium (H2SO4), the -NH2 group is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. The -tBu group at C2 is an o,p-director.\n    -   The -NH3+ at C1 directs to C3 and C5.\n    -   The -tBu at C2 directs to C4, C5, and C6.\n    While the major product would be 2-tert-butyl-5-nitroaniline (directed by both groups to C5), substitution at C3 is also possible (directed meta by -NH3+ and ortho by -tBu). This would form **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. Although this might be a minor product, this pathway is the only one that establishes the correct 1,2,3-substitution pattern.\n5.  **Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl):** The amino group of 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline is converted to a diazonium salt (-N2+). Product: **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzenediazonium salt**. (Correct)\n6.  **Hydrolysis (H3O+, H2O/Heat):** The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH). Product: **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**. (Correct)\n7.  **Williamson Ether Synthesis (NaOH/EtBr):** The phenol is deprotonated by NaOH to form a phenoxide, which then reacts with ethyl bromide (EtBr) to form an ether. Product: **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. (Correct)\n\nThis sequence successfully produces the target molecule with the correct isomeric structure. The additional steps (viii and ix) listed in the option are extraneous and likely typos, as they would occur after the final product is already formed. Among the given choices, this is the only chemically viable pathway to the specified product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
