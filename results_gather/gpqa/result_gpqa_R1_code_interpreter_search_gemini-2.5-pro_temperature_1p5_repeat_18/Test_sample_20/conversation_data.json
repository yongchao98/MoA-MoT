    "*   **Analysis of Part A: Tautomerism**\n\n    *   **Tautomerism** is a form of isomerism where a molecule can exist in two or more interconvertible structures that differ in the position of a proton and the location of a double bond. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   For **keto-enol tautomerism** to occur, a molecule must have an alpha-hydrogen atom, which is a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O). Crucially, this alpha-carbon must be sp3-hybridized.\n\n    1.  **Benzoquinone (1,4-Benzoquinone):**\n        *   Structure: It's a six-membered ring containing two carbonyl groups opposite each other (at positions 1 and 4) and two carbon-carbon double bonds.\n        *   The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (alpha-carbons) are all part of the carbon-carbon double bonds. This means they are sp2-hybridized.\n        *   Since there are no alpha-hydrogens on an sp3-hybridized carbon atom, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n    2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n        *   Structure: It's a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are CH2 groups.\n        *   These carbons (C2, C4, C6) are sp3-hybridized and are alpha to the carbonyl groups. Each of these carbons has two alpha-hydrogens.\n        *   Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can readily undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In fact, it exists in equilibrium with its highly stable enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is aromatic.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The compound that does *not* show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\n    *   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n    1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n        *   Structure: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n        *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one with the -OH group). It is bonded to four different groups:\n            1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n            2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n            3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n            4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n        *   Since the carbon at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and therefore exhibits optical isomerism (it has two enantiomers).\n\n    2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n        *   Structure: This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the ester groups in a *trans* configuration across the double bond.\n        *   The molecule has a C=C double bond, but it does not have any carbon atom bonded to four different groups. There are no chiral centers.\n        *   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry and is achiral. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Final Answer Formulation**\n\n    *   Compound A (no tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
