    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core of the Question:** The question asks which of the listed physical theories \"never requires regularization at high energies.\" This requires understanding what \"regularization at high energies\" means and how it applies to each theory.\n\n2.  **Define Regularization:** In physics, particularly in quantum field theory, many calculations that attempt to determine physical quantities (like the mass or charge of a particle) result in infinite values. These infinities typically arise from integrals that cover all possible energy and momentum values, and the problematic part comes from very high energies (or, equivalently, very short distances). This is known as an \"ultraviolet (UV) divergence.\"\n    **Regularization** is a mathematical technique used to handle these infinities. It involves temporarily modifying the theory, for example by introducing a \"cutoff\" so that the integrals don't go to infinite energy. This makes the result finite but dependent on the cutoff. The subsequent process of renormalization then shows how to obtain physically meaningful, finite results that are independent of this artificial cutoff.\n    Essentially, a theory that \"requires regularization\" is one that produces these high-energy infinities in its raw calculations.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Option:**\n\n    *   **B) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** This is the quantum theory of electrons and photons. When calculating corrections to processes using Feynman diagrams (specifically, diagrams with \"loops\"), QED produces UV divergences. The entire framework of **renormalization**, which is central to QED's success, relies on first regularizing these divergences. Therefore, QED absolutely *requires* regularization.\n\n    *   **D) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** This is the quantum theory of quarks and gluons (the strong nuclear force). Similar to QED, it is a quantum field theory. Calculations involving loop diagrams in QCD also lead to UV divergences that must be handled by regularization and renormalization. Therefore, QCD also *requires* regularization.\n\n    *   **C) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory is governed by Maxwell's equations and describes electric and magnetic fields generated by charges and currents. While it is a *classical* theory, it is not free from high-energy problems. The most famous example is the **self-energy of a point charge**. If you calculate the energy contained in the electric field of an electron assuming it is a perfect point, the result is infinite. This divergence occurs as you integrate the energy density down to a radius of zero (a short-distance/high-energy problem). To get a finite answer, one must \"regularize\" the theory, for example, by assuming the electron is not a point but a small sphere of a certain radius. Thus, Classical Electrodynamics *does* require a form of regularization to resolve this fundamental inconsistency.\n\n    *   **A) Superstring Theory:** This theory is a departure from the \"point particle\" concept of QED, QCD, and Classical Electrodynamics. In string theory, the fundamental objects are one-dimensional vibrating \"strings.\" Interactions between strings are not point-like but are \"smeared out\" over a small region. A primary motivation and celebrated feature of superstring theory is that this smearing-out effect naturally tames the high-energy behavior of interactions. The scattering amplitudes calculated in superstring theory are believed to be free of the UV divergences that plague quantum field theories. In essence, the theory has a built-in physical cutoff (related to the length of the string) and does not require the artificial mathematical procedure of regularization. It is considered a UV-complete theory.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** QED, QCD, and Classical Electrodynamics all encounter infinities associated with high energies/short distances and therefore require some form of regularization to yield finite, physical answers. Superstring Theory is specifically constructed to be free of these ultraviolet divergences, thus it does not require this procedure.\n\n<<<A>>>"
