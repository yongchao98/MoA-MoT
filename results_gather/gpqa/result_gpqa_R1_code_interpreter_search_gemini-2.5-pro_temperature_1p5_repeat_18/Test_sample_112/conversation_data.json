    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic signal for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, C=O stretches in carboxylic acids appear around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The data strongly suggests the compound is a carboxylic acid that also contains an alkene group. A carboxylic acid functional group is -COOH, which contains two oxygen atoms.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons attached directly to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of an alkene group, which supports the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a classic and diagnostic fragmentation pattern for carboxylic acids. The fragment corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺. (Mass = 12 for C + 2*16 for O + 1 for H = 45). This provides very strong evidence for the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information:**\n    *   The combined evidence from all three techniques points to a molecule that is a **carboxylic acid** and also an **alkene**.\n    *   Since the compound is a carboxylic acid, its molecular formula must contain **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A (C6H12O) and B (C6H10O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with two possibilities: C) C6H12O2 and D) C6H10O2.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The Degree of Unsaturation (also known as the index of hydrogen deficiency) tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is:\n    DoU = C - (H/2) + 1  (for molecules containing only C, H, and O)\n\n    *   We know from the spectroscopic data that the molecule must contain at least two features that contribute to the DoU: one C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene).\n    *   Therefore, the correct formula must have a DoU of at least 2.\n\n    Let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n    *   **For C) C6H12O2:**\n        DoU = 6 - (12 / 2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = 1.\n        A DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O in the carboxylic acid. It does not account for the C=C alkene group. A molecule with this formula would be a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which contradicts the FTIR and NMR data.\n    *   **For D) C6H10O2:**\n        DoU = 6 - (10 / 2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = 2.\n        A DoU of 2 perfectly matches our findings: one degree of unsaturation for the C=O bond and a second degree for the C=C bond. A molecule with this formula would be an unsaturated carboxylic acid (e.g., a hexenoic acid).\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nBased on the combined evidence from FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry, the unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The only formula that fits this description by having two oxygen atoms and a degree of unsaturation of 2 is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
