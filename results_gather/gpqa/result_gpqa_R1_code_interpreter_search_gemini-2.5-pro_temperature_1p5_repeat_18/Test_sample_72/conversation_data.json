    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n### Part 1: Calculate the Relative Speed (v_rel)\n\nThe two astronauts are moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds. To find their relative speed, we use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula.\n\nLet the velocities of the two astronauts be `v1` and `v2`.\n*   `v1 = 0.6c`\n*   `v2 = 0.5c`\n\nThe formula for relative velocity in special relativity is:\n`v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into the formula:\n1.  **Calculate the numerator (v1 - v2):**\n    `0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c`\n\n2.  **Calculate the denominator (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2):**\n    `(v1 * v2) / c^2 = (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2 = 0.3c^2 / c^2 = 0.3`\n    `1 - 0.3 = 0.7`\n\n3.  **Calculate the relative speed (v_rel):**\n    `v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7`\n    `v_rel ≈ 0.142857c`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **`0.14c`**.\n\n### Part 2: Calculate the Total Energy of the System (E)\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total energies of the two astronauts. The total energy (E) of a particle with rest mass `m0` moving at speed `v` is given by the formula:\n\n`E = γ * m0 * c^2`\n\nwhere `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is defined as:\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2 / c^2)`\n\nLet's calculate the energy for each astronaut separately.\n\n**Astronaut 1:**\n*   Rest mass `m1 = 2m`\n*   Velocity `v1 = 0.6c`\n\n1.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ1):**\n    `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2)`\n    `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36)`\n    `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(0.64)`\n    `γ1 = 1 / 0.8`\n    `γ1 = 1.25`\n\n2.  **Calculate the energy (E1):**\n    `E1 = γ1 * m1 * c^2`\n    `E1 = 1.25 * (2m) * c^2`\n    `E1 = 2.5 mc^2`\n\n**Astronaut 2:**\n*   Rest mass `m2 = 3m`\n*   Velocity `v2 = 0.5c`\n\n1.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ2):**\n    `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2 / c^2)`\n    `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25)`\n    `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(0.75)`\n    `γ2 ≈ 1 / 0.866`\n    `γ2 ≈ 1.1547`\n\n2.  **Calculate the energy (E2):**\n    `E2 = γ2 * m2 * c^2`\n    `E2 ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c^2`\n    `E2 ≈ 3.4641 mc^2`\n\n**Total Energy (E_total):**\nNow, we add the energies of the two astronauts to find the total energy of the system.\n`E_total = E1 + E2`\n`E_total = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2`\n`E_total = (2.5 + 3.4641) mc^2`\n`E_total = 5.9641 mc^2`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **`5.96 mc^2`**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   **Relative speed:** `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`\n*   **Total energy:** `E ≈ 5.96 mc^2`\n\nComparing these results with the given options, we find that they match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
