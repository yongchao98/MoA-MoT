    "Here's a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 represents the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 has an intensity of 32% relative to the M+ peak (100%). This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 (100:32) is a definitive indicator of the presence of **one chlorine atom** in the molecule. The M+ peak corresponds to the molecule containing the ³⁵Cl isotope, and the M+2 peak corresponds to the molecule containing the ³⁷Cl isotope.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This extremely broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, when paired with the broad O-H stretch, it confirms the presence of a **carboxylic acid** group.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The molecule is a carboxylic acid.\n\n### 3. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is characteristic of the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid (-COO**H**)**. The 's' means it's a singlet (it doesn't couple to other protons), and '1H' integration confirms it's a single proton.\n*   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):** These signals are in the region for aromatic protons.\n    *   There are a total of 4 aromatic protons (2H + 2H).\n    *   The splitting pattern consists of two doublets. This simple pattern (two signals, each a doublet, each integrating to 2H) is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two protons on one side of the ring's axis of symmetry are chemically equivalent to each other, as are the two protons on the other side. They split each other, resulting in two doublets.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid group and a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\n### 4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating Options\nBased on the analysis, the unknown compound is a **chlorinated benzoic acid with a para substitution pattern**.\n\nLet's check the proposed options:\n\n*   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   **Structure:** Has a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom in the para (1,4) positions on a benzene ring.\n    *   **MW:** C₇H₅ClO₂ has a MW of 156.5 g/mol, which matches the MS data (156 for ³⁵Cl).\n    *   **IR:** Contains a carboxylic acid, matching the IR spectrum.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** Contains a carboxylic acid proton and a para-disubstituted ring, which would produce two doublets for 4H. **This is a perfect match for all data.**\n\n*   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is ortho-substituted. The ¹H NMR spectrum would be much more complex than two simple doublets. This does not match.\n\n*   **C) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an acid chloride, not a carboxylic acid. It lacks the O-H group (no broad IR peak) and the acidic proton (no signal at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR). This does not match.\n\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is a trisubstituted ring, so it would only have 3 aromatic protons, and their splitting pattern would be complex. It also lacks a carboxylic acid group. This does not match.\n\nThe only structure that is fully consistent with all the provided spectral data is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>"
