    "An elegant way to solve this is to rewrite the Hamiltonian.\nNotice that (S1+S2+S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3).\nSince S_i can only be +1 or -1, S_i^2 = 1 for all i.\nSo, S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.\nTherefore, (S1+S2+S3)^2 = 3 + 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3).\nThis means (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3) = 1/2 * [(S1+S2+S3)^2 - 3].\n\nThe Hamiltonian is E = -J [ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ].\nSubstituting the expression above:\nE = -J/2 * [ (S1+S2+S3)^2 - 3 ]\nE = (3J/2) - (J/2) * (S1+S2+S3)^2\n\nThe value of the energy E depends only on the sum of the spins, S_total = S1+S2+S3.\nLet's enumerate the possible values of S_total and their degeneracies.\nThe spins (S1, S2, S3) can be:\n1.  All spins up: (+1, +1, +1)\n    S_total = 1+1+1 = 3.\n    There is only 1 such state. Degeneracy g = 1.\n    Energy E = (3J/2) - (J/2)*(3)^2 = (3J/2) - (9J/2) = -6J/2 = -3J.\n    By symmetry, for all spins down (-1, -1, -1):\n    S_total = -1-1-1 = -3.\n    There is only 1 such state. Degeneracy g = 1.\n    Energy E = (3J/2) - (J/2)*(-3)^2 = (3J/2) - (9J/2) = -3J.\n    So, there are 2 states with energy E1 = -3J. The degeneracy g1 = 2.\n\n2.  Two spins up, one spin down: (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, +1)\n    S_total = 1+1-1 = 1.\n    There are 3 such states. Degeneracy g = 3.\n    Energy E = (3J/2) - (J/2)*(1)^2 = (3J/2) - (J/2) = 2J/2 = J.\n    By symmetry, for one spin up, two spins down: (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, -1), (-1, -1, +1)\n    S_total = 1-1-1 = -1.\n    There are 3 such states. Degeneracy g = 3.\n    Energy E = (3J/2) - (J/2)*(-1)^2 = (3J/2) - (J/2) = 2J/2 = J.\n    So, there are 3+3=6 states with energy E2 = J. The degeneracy g2 = 6.\n\nWe have accounted for all 2+6=8 possible states. The system has two energy levels:\n-   E1 = -3J, with degeneracy g1 = 2\n-   E2 = J, with degeneracy g2 = 6\n\nThe partition function Z is given by the sum over all states of the Boltzmann factor, which can be grouped by energy levels:\nZ = Σ_i g_i * exp(-βE_i)\nwhere β = 1/(kT).\n\nSubstituting the values we found:\nZ = g1 * exp(-βE1) + g2 * exp(-βE2)\nZ = 2 * exp(-β(-3J)) + 6 * exp(-β(J))\nZ = 2 * exp(3Jβ) + 6 * exp(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z= 2 e^(-3Jβ)+6e^(Jβ)\nB) Z= 6e^(2Jβ)+2e^(-2Jβ)\nC) Z= 2e^(2Jβ)+6e^(-2Jβ)\nD) Z= 2 e^(3Jβ)+6e^(-Jβ)\n\nOur calculated partition function matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
