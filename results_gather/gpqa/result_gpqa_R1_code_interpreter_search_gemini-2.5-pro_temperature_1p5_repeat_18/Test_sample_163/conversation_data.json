    "An analysis of the spectroscopic binary star systems allows us to determine the ratio of their total masses. The relationship between the total mass of an eclipsing binary system (M), its orbital period (P), and the amplitudes of the radial velocities of its component stars (K_a and K_b) is given by Kepler's Third Law adapted for spectroscopic binaries.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the total mass of `system_1` to the total mass of `system_2`, which can be expressed as M1 / M2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics:** For a double-lined spectroscopic binary, we can relate the masses of the stars to their orbital properties. The key formula for the total mass (M = m1 + m2) of a binary system is derived from Kepler's Third Law. For a spectroscopic binary, this is expressed in terms of the orbital period (P) and the radial velocity amplitudes (K1 and K2). The formula is:\n    M = (P * (K_a + K_b)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))\n    where:\n    *   M is the total mass of the system (M = m_a + m_b).\n    *   P is the orbital period.\n    *   K_a and K_b are the amplitudes of the radial velocity curves for the two stars.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n    *   'i' is the inclination of the orbital plane to the line of sight.\n\n3.  **Apply Simplifications:** The problem states that both systems are \"eclipsing.\" For an eclipse to occur, our line of sight must be very close to the orbital plane of the binary system. This implies that the inclination angle `i` is close to 90°. For an inclination of i = 90°, sin(i) = 1, and sin³(i) = 1. This assumption simplifies the mass formula significantly. Even if the inclination is not exactly 90°, it would be nearly the same for both eclipsing systems, and the sin³(i) term would cancel out when taking the ratio of the masses.\n\n4.  **Set up the Ratio:** We want to calculate the ratio M1 / M2.\n    *   M1 = (P1 * (K1a + K1b)³) / (2 * π * G)\n    *   M2 = (P2 * (K2a + K2b)³) / (2 * π * G)\n\n    Taking the ratio M1 / M2, the constant term (2 * π * G) cancels out:\n    M1 / M2 = [P1 * (K1a + K1b)³] / [P2 * (K2a + K2b)³]\n    M1 / M2 = (P1 / P2) * [(K1a + K1b) / (K2a + K2b)]³\n\n5.  **List the Given Values:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   Velocity Amplitudes (K1a, K1b) = 10 km/s, 5 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   Velocity Amplitudes (K2a, K2b) = 15 km/s, 10 km/s\n\n6.  **Calculate Intermediate Values:**\n    *   Ratio of periods (P1 / P2) = 2 years / 1 year = 2.\n    *   Sum of velocities for system 1 (K1_total) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s.\n    *   Sum of velocities for system 2 (K2_total) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s.\n    *   Ratio of total velocities (K1_total / K2_total) = 15 km/s / 25 km/s = 3/5.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:** Substitute the intermediate values back into the ratio formula:\n    M1 / M2 = 2 * (3/5)³\n    M1 / M2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\n    M1 / M2 = 54 / 125\n    M1 / M2 = 0.432\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated ratio is 0.432, which is closest to the value in option C. To confirm, we can execute a simple calculation script.\n\n```python\n# System 1 parameters\nP1 = 2.0  # years\nK1a = 10.0 # km/s\nK1b = 5.0  # km/s\n\n# System 2 parameters\nP2 = 1.0  # years\nK2a = 15.0 # km/s\nK2b = 10.0 # km/s\n\n# Calculate the sum of velocity amplitudes for each system\nK1_total = K1a + K1b\nK2_total = K2a + K2b\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the total masses (M1 / M2)\n# M_ratio = (P1/P2) * (K1_total / K2_total)^3\nmass_ratio = (P1 / P2) * (K1_total / K2_total)**3\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.432\n</execute_result>\nThe code confirms the result of the manual calculation. The factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is 0.432, which is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The mass of an eclipsing binary system `M` is proportional to its period `P` and the cube of the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes of its stars `(Ka + Kb)`. The relationship can be expressed as:\n\nM ∝ P * (K_a + K_b)³\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the mass of system 1 (`M1`) to the mass of system 2 (`M2`). We can set up the ratio as follows:\n\nM1 / M2 = [P1 * (K1a + K1b)³] / [P2 * (K2a + K2b)³]\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n*   **For system_1:**\n    *   Period (P1) = 2 years\n    *   Radial velocity amplitudes (K1a, K1b) = 10 km/s and 5 km/s.\n    *   Sum of velocities (K1a + K1b) = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s.\n\n*   **For system_2:**\n    *   Period (P2) = 1 year\n    *   Radial velocity amplitudes (K2a, K2b) = 15 km/s and 10 km/s.\n    *   Sum of velocities (K2a + K2b) = 15 + 10 = 25 km/s.\n\nSubstitute these values into the ratio equation:\n\nM1 / M2 = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (15/25)³\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (3/5)³\nM1 / M2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\nM1 / M2 = 54 / 125\nM1 / M2 = 0.432\n\nThe calculated value of 0.432 is closest to the option ~0.4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
