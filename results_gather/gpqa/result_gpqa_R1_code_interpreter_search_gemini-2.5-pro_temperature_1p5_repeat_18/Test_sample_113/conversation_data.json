    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning for selecting the correct reagents:\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction transforms a ketone (butan-2-one) into a cyanohydrin (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile). This is a classic example of nucleophilic addition to a carbonyl group, specifically, cyanohydrin formation.\n\n2.  **Analyze the mechanism:**\n    *   The cyanide ion (CN⁻), from the dissociation of NaCN, acts as a nucleophile. It attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n    *   This attack breaks the C=O pi bond, and the electrons move to the oxygen atom, forming a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate: `CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃`.\n    *   This alkoxide intermediate is a strong base and needs to be protonated to form the final stable cyanohydrin product, which has a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   Reagent 'A' must therefore be a proton source.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the options for A:**\n    *   `NaHSO₃` (Sodium bisulfite): This reagent is used for forming bisulfite addition products with aldehydes and some unhindered ketones. It is not the correct reagent to provide a proton in this context. Thus, options A and B are incorrect.\n    *   `H₃O⁺` (Hydronium ion): This represents a strong acid in an aqueous solution (e.g., HCl(aq) or H₂SO₄(aq)). It is an excellent proton source to protonate the alkoxide intermediate.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for A:** Reagent A must be H₃O⁺. This narrows the choices down to C and D.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction converts a nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is a hydrolysis reaction of a nitrile. Note that the rest of the molecule, including the hydroxyl group, remains unchanged.\n\n2.  **Analyze the mechanism/conditions:**\n    *   The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid is a common transformation but requires forcing conditions. It can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base, typically with heating. The presence of `H₂O` in the reactants indicates hydrolysis. Reagent 'B' is the catalyst.\n    *   The reaction proceeds via an amide intermediate (R-CONH₂), which is then further hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid (R-COOH).\n\n3.  **Evaluate the options for B (from the remaining choices C and D):**\n    *   `CH₃COOH` (Acetic acid): This is a weak acid. While it can protonate the nitrile nitrogen to some extent, it is generally not strong enough to catalyze the complete hydrolysis of a stable nitrile to a carboxylic acid in an efficient manner.\n    *   `HCl` (Hydrochloric acid): This is a strong acid. Strong acids like HCl or H₂SO₄ are the standard reagents used for acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles. They effectively protonate the nitrile, making it susceptible to nucleophilic attack by water and driving the reaction to completion.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for B:** Reagent B must be a strong acid catalyst, making HCl the correct choice.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\n*   For the first reaction, `A = H₃O⁺`.\n*   For the second reaction, `B = HCl`.\n\nCombining these two conclusions, the correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
