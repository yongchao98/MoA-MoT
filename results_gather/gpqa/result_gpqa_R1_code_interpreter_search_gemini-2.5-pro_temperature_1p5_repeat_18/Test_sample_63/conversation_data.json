    "Here's my thinking process to solve this chemistry problem.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Experimental Data:**\n    *   **Initial state:** An equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. Total mass = 7.20 g.\n    *   **Process:** The mixture is heated to 200°C, decomposing completely into a mixture of gases.\n    *   **Gas treatment step 1:** Passed through anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂, a drying agent. The mass increased by 3.60 g. This means 3.60 g of water (H₂O) was absorbed.\n    *   **Gas treatment step 2:** Passed through Ca(OH)₂ solution (limewater). The mass did not change. This indicates the absence of acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂.\n    *   **Gas treatment step 3:** Passed through red-hot copper (Cu). The mass of the tube increased by 0.80 g, and CuO was formed. This implies a reaction with an oxidizing gas. The gas gives its oxygen to the copper.\n    *   **Final state:** 2.24 L of a remaining gas C, measured at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP). This gas is inert to all the previous reagents.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Moles of Each Component:**\n    *   **Water (H₂O):**\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   **Oxidizing Gas (reacting with Cu):** The mass increase of the copper tube (0.80 g) is the mass of the oxygen that bound to the copper.\n        *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   What is the oxidizing gas? Common decomposition products of nitrogen-based salts include N₂O and O₂.\n            *   If it were O₂, the reaction would be 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. We would need to calculate moles of O₂.\n            *   If it were N₂O, the reaction is Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂. Here, one mole of N₂O provides one mole of O atoms to the copper.\n        *   Let's assume it's N₂O for now, as it's a very common product of ammonium salt decomposition. This assumption means we had **0.05 mol of N₂O** entering the tube.\n    *   **Remaining Gas (C):**\n        *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n        *   Gas C is the gas that is left after all reactions. Since it's inert, it's very likely N₂.\n\n3.  **Reconstruct the Original Gas Mixture:**\n    *   Let's trace the gases backwards. Gas C is the final N₂. Where did it come from?\n    *   The reaction in tube №3 (Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂) produces N₂. The amount produced is equal to the moles of N₂O that reacted, which is 0.05 mol.\n    *   The total final N₂ is 0.10 mol. So, 0.05 mol came from the N₂O reaction, which means the other **0.05 mol of N₂ must have been present in the gas mixture *before* it entered the copper tube**.\n    *   Therefore, the mixture of gases formed by heating the salts was:\n        *   0.20 mol H₂O\n        *   0.05 mol N₂\n        *   0.05 mol N₂O\n\n4.  **Identify the Salts A and B:**\n    *   We need to find two salts (A and B) that decompose to give these specific products in these amounts. The salts only contain atoms that appear in the products (N, H, O). This points towards ammonium salts of oxygenated nitrogen acids.\n    *   Let's look at the decomposition reactions of likely candidates:\n        *   Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂): NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n        *   Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃): NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O (This reaction occurs at ~200-250°C, which matches the problem description).\n    *   Let's see if these two salts fit our product mole counts.\n        *   To produce 0.05 mol of N₂, we would need **0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂**. This would also produce 0.05 * 2 = 0.10 mol of H₂O.\n        *   To produce 0.05 mol of N₂O, we would need **0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃**. This would also produce 0.05 * 2 = 0.10 mol of H₂O.\n    *   This combination perfectly accounts for all the products:\n        *   Total N₂ = 0.05 mol (matches).\n        *   Total N₂O = 0.05 mol (matches).\n        *   Total H₂O = 0.10 mol + 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol (matches).\n\n5.  **Verify with Initial Conditions:**\n    *   Our hypothesis is that the mixture contained 0.05 mol of salt A (NH₄NO₂) and 0.05 mol of salt B (NH₄NO₃).\n    *   **Is it equimolar?** Yes, the moles are equal (0.05 mol of each).\n    *   **Does the mass match?** Let's calculate the total mass.\n        *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ = (14.0*2) + (1.0*4) + (16.0*2) = 28 + 4 + 32 = 64 g/mol.\n        *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ = (14.0*2) + (1.0*4) + (16.0*3) = 28 + 4 + 48 = 80 g/mol.\n        *   Total Mass = (0.05 mol * 64 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80 g/mol) = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\n    *   The calculated mass matches the given mass of 7.20 g. The hypothesis is correct.\n\n6.  **Answer the Question:**\n    *   The question asks for the **total number of all atoms in salts A and B**. This means the sum of atoms in the formula of one unit of each salt.\n    *   Salt A: NH₄NO₂. It has 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen atoms = 8 atoms.\n    *   Salt B: NH₄NO₃. It has 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen atoms = 9 atoms.\n    *   Total number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n```python\n# A simple calculation to confirm the final answer based on the identified salts.\n\n# Salt A is Ammonium Nitrite (NH4NO2)\natoms_in_A = 2  # Nitrogen\natoms_in_A += 4 # Hydrogen\natoms_in_A += 2 # Oxygen\n\n# Salt B is Ammonium Nitrate (NH4NO3)\natoms_in_B = 2  # Nitrogen\natoms_in_B += 4 # Hydrogen\natoms_in_B += 3 # Oxygen\n\n# Total atoms is the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt\ntotal_atoms = atoms_in_A + atoms_in_B\n\nprint(f\"Atoms in Salt A (NH4NO2): {atoms_in_A}\")\nprint(f\"Atoms in Salt B (NH4NO3): {atoms_in_B}\")\nprint(f\"Total number of atoms in salts A and B: {total_atoms}\")\n```\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks for the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of two salts, A and B. To find this, we first need to identify the chemical composition of salts A and B based on the provided experimental data.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Gas Absorption Data:**\n    *   The gas mixture produced by heating the salts is passed through a series of tubes.\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent. The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water (H₂O) absorbed.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol H₂O**.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂. Since the mass did not change, no such gases were present in the mixture. This tells us the salts A and B do not contain carbon or sulfur.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper(II) oxide (CuO). This means an oxidizing gas in the mixture transferred its oxygen atoms to the copper.\n        *   Mass of oxygen atoms = 0.80 g.\n        *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol O atoms**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Gaseous Products:**\n    *   The elements present must come from the original salts. Since H₂O is produced, the salts contain Hydrogen and Oxygen. The lack of CO₂ and SO₂ rules out C and S. The remaining likely element is Nitrogen, as many nitrogen-containing salts decompose upon heating.\n    *   The gas that reacted with copper was an oxidizing gas. A common product from the decomposition of nitrogen salts is nitrous oxide (N₂O). The reaction is: N₂O + Cu → CuO + N₂. In this reaction, one mole of N₂O provides one mole of oxygen atoms to the copper.\n    *   Therefore, the 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms came from **0.05 mol of N₂O**. This reaction also produced 0.05 mol of N₂.\n    *   **Final Gas (C):** At the end, 2.24 L of an inert gas C remained at STP.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n        *   This inert gas is most likely Nitrogen (N₂).\n    *   The total N₂ at the end (0.10 mol) is the sum of the N₂ produced in Tube №3 (0.05 mol) and any N₂ that was part of the original gas mixture.\n    *   Original N₂ = Total N₂ - N₂ from N₂O reaction = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = **0.05 mol N₂**.\n    *   So, the initial mixture of gases formed from heating the salts was:\n        *   0.20 mol H₂O\n        *   0.05 mol N₂O\n        *   0.05 mol N₂\n\n3.  **Identify Salts A and B:**\n    *   We need to find two salts that decompose to yield these products. We are told the initial mixture of salts A and B was equimolar. Let's assume there were `n` moles of salt A and `n` moles of salt B.\n    *   Consider the thermal decomposition of common ammonium salts:\n        *   **NH₄NO₂ (Ammonium nitrite) → N₂ + 2H₂O**\n        *   **NH₄NO₃ (Ammonium nitrate) → N₂O + 2H₂O**\n    *   This pair of reactions perfectly matches our identified products. Let's check the stoichiometry.\n    *   Let Salt A be NH₄NO₂ and Salt B be NH₄NO₃. If the mixture is equimolar, `n` = 0.05 mol.\n        *   Decomposition of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₂ yields: 0.05 mol N₂ and 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol H₂O.\n        *   Decomposition of 0.05 mol NH₄NO₃ yields: 0.05 mol N₂O and 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol H₂O.\n    *   The total products are: 0.05 mol N₂, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.10 + 0.10 = 0.20 mol H₂O. This perfectly matches our findings from step 2.\n\n4.  **Verify the Initial Mass:**\n    *   Let's check if 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ have a total mass of 7.20 g.\n        *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 2(16) = 64 g/mol.\n        *   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14 + 4(1) + 14 + 3(16) = 80 g/mol.\n        *   Total Mass = (0.05 mol * 64 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80 g/mol) = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\n    *   This confirms that salts A and B are Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two salts.\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 2 = **8 atoms**.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 3 Oxygen atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 3 = **9 atoms**.\n    *   Total number of atoms in salts A and B = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
