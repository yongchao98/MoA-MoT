Identify the Parent Compound**\nThe molecule is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group, which has the highest priority among the given functional groups. Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the ring attached to the -COOH group is designated as **C1**.\n\n**2. Place the Substituents Based on Relative Positions**\n*   **Carboxylic acid (-COOH):** At C1.\n*   **Methoxy group (-OCH₃):** It is *para* to the carboxylic acid, so it is at **C4**.\n*   **Hydroxyl (-OH) and Dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂) groups:** They are *ortho* to the carboxylic acid, so they occupy positions **C2** and **C6**.\n*   **Carbaldehyde (-CHO) and Cyano (-CN) groups:** They are *meta* to the carboxylic acid and also *meta* to each other. This places them at positions **C3** and **C5**.\n\n**3. Use the Final Constraint to Determine the Exact Arrangement**\nThe crucial piece of information is: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n*   \"Nitrile\" refers to the cyano group (-CN).\n*   \"Alcohol\" refers to the hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   The methoxy group is fixed at C4.\n*   The cyano group must be ortho to the methoxy group, so it must be at C3 or C5.\n*   The hydroxyl group must also be ortho to the cyano group.\n\nLet's test the two possibilities for the cyano group's position:\n*   **Case A: If the cyano group is at C3.** The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4. The methoxy group is at C4 (which fits). Therefore, the hydroxyl group must be at **C2**. This forces the dimethylamino group to be at C6 and the formyl group (carbaldehyde) to be at C5.\n*   **Case B: If the cyano group is at C5.** The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6. The methoxy group is at C4 (which fits). Therefore, the hydroxyl group must be at **C6**. This forces the dimethylamino group to be at C2 and the formyl group to be at C3.\n\n**4. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules (Tie-Breaker)**\nWe have two possible structures (from Case A and Case B) that fit the description. They represent the same molecule, just numbered in opposite directions.\n*   The set of locants (positions) for the substituents is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} in both cases.\n*   When the locant set is identical, IUPAC rules state that we must choose the numbering direction that gives the **lowest possible number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order**.\n\n**5. Alphabetize the Substituents and Choose the Correct Numbering**\nThe substituent prefixes are:\n1.  **c**yano\n2.  **d**imethylamino\n3.  **f**ormyl\n4.  **h**ydroxy\n5.  **m**ethoxy\n\nThe first substituent alphabetically is \"cyano\". We must choose the numbering scheme that gives the cyano group the lower number.\n*   In Case A, the cyano group is at position **3**.\n*   In Case B, the cyano group is at position **5**.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, the numbering from **Case A is correct**.\n\n**6. Assemble the Final Name**\nUsing the correct structure and numbering (from Case A), we list the substituents in alphabetical order, followed by the parent name.\n*   The positions are: 2-hydroxy, 3-cyano, 4-methoxy, 5-formyl, 6-dimethylamino.\n*   Alphabetical assembly:\n    *   3-**c**yano-\n    *   6-(**d**imethylamino)-\n    *   5-**f**ormyl-\n    *   2-**h**ydroxy-\n    *   4-**m**ethoxy-\n*   Parent name: **benzoic acid**\n\nThe final, correct IUPAC name is: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\nThis name matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the correct IUPAC name, a systematic approach is required, following the official nomenclature rules.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Principal Functional Group and Parent Compound:**\n    The molecule contains several functional groups, including a carboxylic acid (-COOH), a carbaldehyde (-CHO), and a cyano (-CN) group. According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**, and the carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the -COOH group is designated as position **C1**.\n\n2.  **Map the Substituents Based on Positional Information:**\n    *   The carboxylic acid is at **C1**.\n    *   A methoxy group (-OCH₃) is *para* to the carboxylic acid, placing it at **C4**.\n    *   A hydroxyl (-OH) group and a dimethylamino [-N(CH₃)₂] group are *ortho* to the carboxylic acid, placing them at positions **C2** and **C6**.\n    *   A carbaldehyde (-CHO, named as a \"formyl\" substituent) and a cyano (-CN) group are *meta* to the carboxylic acid, placing them at positions **C3** and **C5**.\n\n3.  **Use the Final Constraint to Determine the Exact Arrangement:**\n    The description provides a crucial piece of information: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   The methoxy group is fixed at C4.\n    *   The nitrile (cyano group, -CN) must be ortho to the methoxy group, so it can be at C3 or C5. This is consistent with our previous deduction.\n    *   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) must also be ortho to the nitrile group.\n\n    Let's test the two possible positions for the nitrile group:\n    *   **Case 1: The nitrile (-CN) is at C3.** The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4. Since the methoxy group is at C4, the hydroxyl group must be at C2. This arrangement is consistent with all conditions. This forces the dimethylamino group to be at C6 and the formyl group at C5.\n    *   **Case 2: The nitrile (-CN) is at C5.** The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6. Since the methoxy group is at C4, the hydroxyl group must be at C6. This arrangement is also consistent with all conditions. This forces the dimethylamino group to be at C2 and the formyl group at C3.\n\n4.  **Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules (Tie-Breaker):**\n    We have two possible structures that fit the description, which are essentially mirror images in terms of numbering direction. Both arrangements result in the same set of locants (positions) for the substituents: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. When there is a tie in the locant set, IUPAC rules state that we must choose the numbering direction that gives the lowest number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\n5.  **Alphabetize the Substituents and Choose the Correct Numbering:**\n    The substituent prefixes are listed alphabetically as:\n    *   **c**yano\n    *   **d**imethylamino\n    *   **f**ormyl\n    *   **h**ydroxy\n    *   **m**ethoxy\n\n    The first substituent alphabetically is **cyano**. We must choose the numbering scheme that gives the cyano group the lower number.\n    *   In Case 1, the cyano group is at position **3**.\n    *   In Case 2, the cyano group is at position **5**.\n\n    Since 3 is lower than 5, the numbering scheme from **Case 1 is correct**.\n\n6.  **Assemble the Final Name:**\n    Using the correct structure and numbering (from Case 1), we list the substituents in alphabetical order, followed by the parent name:\n    *   The positions are: 2-hydroxy, 3-cyano, 4-methoxy, 5-formyl, 6-dimethylamino.\n    *   Arranging alphabetically: 3-cyano-, 6-(dimethylamino)-, 5-formyl-, 2-hydroxy-, 4-methoxy-\n    *   Combining these with the parent name \"benzoic acid\" gives the final name: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\nThis name matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct IUPAC name.\n\n**1. Identify the Parent Compound and Principal Functional Group**\nThe molecule is a benzene ring with several functional groups. According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid (-COOH) group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**, and the carbon atom of the ring attached to the -COOH group is designated as position **C1**.\n\n**2. Place Substituents Based on Relative Positions**\n*   **C1**: -COOH (part of the parent name).\n*   **Para to C1**: A methoxy group (-OCH3) is at the para position, which is **C4**.\n*   **Ortho to C1**: A hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group are at the ortho positions, which are **C2** and **C6**.\n*   **Meta to C1**: A carbaldehyde (-CHO, named as a \"formyl\" substituent) and a cyano (-CN) group are at the meta positions, which are **C3** and **C5**.\n\n**3. Use the Final Constraint to Determine the Exact Structure**\nThe key piece of information is: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n*   The methoxy group is at C4.\n*   The alcohol is the hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The nitrile is the cyano (-CN) group.\n*   For the methoxy group at C4 to be ortho to the nitrile, the nitrile must be at C3 or C5. This is consistent.\n*   The hydroxyl group must also be ortho to the nitrile. Let's test the two possibilities for the nitrile's position:\n    *   **Case A: Nitrile (-CN) is at C5.** The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6. The methoxy group is at C4 (this fits). The hydroxyl group must be at the other ortho position, C6. This arrangement is consistent with all conditions.\n    *   **Case B: Nitrile (-CN) is at C3.** The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4. The methoxy group is at C4 (this fits). The hydroxyl group must be at the other ortho position, C2. This arrangement is also consistent with all conditions.\n\n**4. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules (Tie-Breaker)**\nWe have two possible structures that fit the description. They represent the same molecule, just numbered in opposite directions from C1.\n*   **Structure from Case A**: C2-dimethylamino, C3-formyl, C4-methoxy, C5-cyano, C6-hydroxy.\n*   **Structure from Case B**: C2-hydroxy, C3-cyano, C4-methoxy, C5-formyl, C6-dimethylamino.\n\nIn both cases, the set of locants (positions) for the substituents is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. When the locant set is identical, IUPAC rules state that we must choose the numbering direction that gives the lowest number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\n**5. Alphabetize Substituents and Choose the Correct Numbering**\n*   The substituent prefixes are: **c**yano, **d**imethylamino, **f**ormyl, **h**ydroxy, **m**ethoxy.\n*   The first substituent alphabetically is **cyano**. We must choose the numbering scheme that gives the cyano group the lower number.\n*   In the structure from Case A, the cyano group is at position **5**.\n*   In the structure from Case B, the cyano group is at position **3**.\n*   Since 3 is lower than 5, the numbering from **Case B is correct**.\n\n**6. Assemble the Final Name**\nUsing the correct structure and numbering (from Case B), we list the substituents in alphabetical order, followed by the parent name:\n*   3-cyano-\n*   6-(dimethylamino)-\n*   5-formyl-\n*   2-hydroxy-\n*   4-methoxy-\n*   benzoic acid\n\nThe final name is: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n**7. Match with Options**\nThis name matches option B. A review of the candidate answers shows that while many agents correctly deduced this name, several made errors when matching it to the provided options. The chemical reasoning, however, strongly supports this result.\n\n```python\n# The problem asks for the correct IUPAC name of a substituted benzoic acid.\n\n# Step 1: Identify the parent compound.\n# The highest priority functional group is carboxylic acid, so the parent is benzoic acid.

Identify the Parent Compound and Principal Functional Group**\n*   The molecule is a substituted benzene ring.\n*   It contains several functional groups: carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2), and methoxy (-OCH3).\n*   According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority.\n*   Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is assigned position **C1**.\n\n**2. Map the Substituents Based on the Description**\n*   **C1:** -COOH (part of the parent name).\n*   **Para to C1:** A methoxy group (-OCH3) is para to the carboxylic acid. The para position is C4. So, the **methoxy group is at C4**.\n*   **Ortho to C1:** A hydroxyl group (-OH) and a dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2) are ortho to the carboxylic acid. The ortho positions are C2 and C6. So, **-OH and -N(CH3)2 are at C2 and C6**.\n*   **Meta to C1:** A carbaldehyde (-CHO, named as a \"formyl\" substituent) and a cyano group (-CN) are meta to the carboxylic acid. The meta positions are C3 and C5. So, **-CHO and -CN are at C3 and C5**.\n\n**3. Use the Final Constraint to Determine the Exact Arrangement**\nThe crucial piece of information is: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n*   We know the methoxy group is at C4.\n*   The nitrile (cyano group, -CN) must be ortho to the methoxy group. The positions ortho to C4 are C3 and C5. This is consistent with our earlier deduction.\n*   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) must also be ortho to the nitrile group.\n\nLet's test the two possible positions for the nitrile group:\n\n*   **Case A: The nitrile (-CN) is at C3.**\n    *   The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4.\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4 (this fits).\n    *   The hydroxyl group must be at the other ortho position, which is **C2**.\n    *   This forces the dimethylamino group to be at C6 and the formyl group to be at C5.\n    *   This arrangement is: C1(-COOH), C2(-OH), C3(-CN), C4(-OCH3), C5(-CHO), C6(-N(CH3)2).\n\n*   **Case B: The nitrile (-CN) is at C5.**\n    *   The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6.\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4 (this fits).\n    *   The hydroxyl group must be at the other ortho position, which is **C6**.\n    *   This forces the dimethylamino group to be at C2 and the formyl group to be at C3.\n    *   This arrangement is: C1(-COOH), C2(-N(CH3)2), C3(-CHO), C4(-OCH3), C5(-CN), C6(-OH).\n\n**4. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules (Tie-Breaker)**\nBoth Case A and Case B describe the same molecule, just numbered in opposite directions (clockwise vs. counter-clockwise). Both numbering schemes result in the same set of locants (positions): {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. When there is a tie in the locant set, IUPAC rules state that we must choose the numbering direction that gives the **lowest number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order**.\n\n*   **Alphabetical order of substituents:**\n    1.  **c**yano\n    2.  **d**imethylamino\n    3.  **f**ormyl\n    4.  **h**ydroxy\n    5.  **m**ethoxy\n\n*   **Apply the rule:** The first substituent alphabetically is \"cyano\". We must choose the numbering scheme that gives the cyano group the lower number.\n    *   In Case A, the cyano group is at position **3**.\n    *   In Case B, the cyano group is at position **5**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Since 3 is lower than 5, **Case A provides the correct IUPAC numbering.**\n\n**5. Assemble the Final Name**\nUsing the correct numbering from Case A, we list the substituents in alphabetical order, followed by the parent name:\n*   **3-cyano-**\n*   **6-(dimethylamino)-**\n*   **5-formyl-**\n*   **2-hydroxy-**\n*   **4-methoxy**\n*   **benzoic acid**\n\nCombining these parts gives the final name: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n**6. Match with the Options**\n*   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n*   B) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n*   C) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid\n*   D) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid\n\nThe derived name exactly matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct IUPAC name.\n\n**1. Identify the Parent Compound**\nThe molecule is a benzene ring with multiple functional groups. According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid (-COOH) group has the highest priority among those listed. Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid is assigned position **C1**.\n\n**2. Place the Substituents on the Ring**\nWe use the positional information given in the question to place the other groups relative to C1:\n*   **Methoxy group (-OCH₃):** It is *para* to the carboxylic acid, so it is at position **C4**.\n*   **Hydroxyl (-OH) and Dimethylamino [-N(CH₃)₂] groups:** They are *ortho* to the carboxylic acid, so they occupy positions **C2** and **C6**.\n*   **Carbaldehyde (-CHO) and Cyano (-CN) groups:** They are *meta* to the carboxylic acid, so they occupy positions **C3** and **C5**.\n\n**3. Use the Final Constraint to Determine the Exact Arrangement**\nThe crucial piece of information is: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n*   \"Methoxy\" is at C4.\n*   \"Alcohol\" is the hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   \"Nitrile\" is the cyano group (-CN).\n\nWe must test the two possible positions for the nitrile group (C3 or C5) to see which one satisfies this condition.\n\n*   **Case A: Assume the nitrile (-CN) is at C3.**\n    *   The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4.\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4, which is indeed ortho to C3. This part works.\n    *   The hydroxyl group must be at the other ortho position, C2. This also works, as C2 is one of the available ortho-to-C1 positions.\n    *   This arrangement forces the dimethylamino group to be at C6 and the carbaldehyde (formyl) group to be at C5. This structure is fully consistent with the description.\n\n*   **Case B: Assume the nitrile (-CN) is at C5.**\n    *   The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6.\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4, which is ortho to C5. This part works.\n    *   The hydroxyl group must be at the other ortho position, C6. This also works, as C6 is one of the available ortho-to-C1 positions.\n    *   This arrangement forces the dimethylamino group to be at C2 and the formyl group to be at C3. This structure is also fully consistent with the description.\n\n**4. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules to Choose the Correct Scheme**\nWe have two valid structures that fit the description. They represent the same molecule, just numbered in opposite directions from C1.\n*   Structure from Case A: Numbering is C1 -> C2(-OH) -> C3(-CN) -> C4(-OCH₃) -> C5(-CHO) -> C6(-N(CH₃)₂)\n*   Structure from Case B: Numbering is C1 -> C2(-N(CH₃)₂) -> C3(-CHO) -> C4(-OCH₃) -> C5(-CN) -> C6(-OH)\n\nIn both cases, the set of locants (positions) for the substituents is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. When the locant sets are identical, IUPAC rules state that we must use the alphabetical order of the substituents as a tie-breaker. The numbering is chosen to give the lowest possible number to the substituent that comes first alphabetically.\n\n**5. Alphabetize the Substituents and Apply the Tie-Breaker**\nThe substituent prefixes are:\n*   **c**yano\n*   **d**imethylamino\n*   **f**ormyl\n*   **h**ydroxy\n*   **m**ethoxy\n\nThe first substituent in alphabetical order is \"cyano\". We must choose the numbering scheme that gives the cyano group the lower number.\n*   In Case A, the cyano group is at position **3**.\n*   In Case B, the cyano group is at position **5**.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, the numbering from **Case A** is the correct one.\n\n**6. Assemble the Final Name**\nUsing the positions from Case A, we list the substituents in alphabetical order, each preceded by its locant number, followed by the parent name.\n*   3-**c**yano-\n*   6-(**d**imethylamino)-\n*   5-**f**ormyl-\n*   2-**h**ydroxy-\n*   4-**m**ethoxy-\n*   **benzoic acid**\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\nThis name matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct IUPAC name.\n\n**1. Identify the Principal Functional Group and Parent Compound**\nThe molecule contains several functional groups, but the carboxylic acid (-COOH) has the highest priority according to IUPAC rules. When a carboxylic acid is attached to a benzene ring, the parent compound is named **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the ring attached to the carboxylic acid is designated as position **C1**.\n\n**2. Map the Substituents Based on the Description**\n*   **C1**: -COOH (part of the parent name).\n*   **Para to C1**: A methoxy group (-OCH₃) is para to the carboxylic acid. The para position is C4. So, the **methoxy group is at C4**.\n*   **Ortho to C1**: A hydroxyl group (-OH) and a dimethylamino group [-N(CH₃)₂] are ortho to the carboxylic acid. The ortho positions are C2 and C6. So, **{-OH, -N(CH₃)₂} are at {C2, C6}**.\n*   **Meta to C1**: A carbaldehyde (-CHO, named as a \"formyl\" substituent) and a cyano group (-CN) are meta to the carboxylic acid. The meta positions are C3 and C5. So, **{-CHO, -CN} are at {C3, C5}**.\n\n**3. Use the Final Constraint to Determine the Exact Arrangement**\nThis is the most critical step. The description states: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n*   We know the methoxy group is at C4.\n*   The nitrile (cyano group, -CN) must be ortho to the methoxy group. The positions ortho to C4 are C3 and C5, which is consistent with our earlier deduction.\n*   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) must also be ortho to the nitrile group.\n\nLet's test the two possible positions for the nitrile group:\n\n*   **Scenario 1: The nitrile (-CN) is at C3.**\n    *   The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4.\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4 (this fits).\n    *   The hydroxyl group must be at the other ortho position, which is C2.\n    *   This arrangement is consistent with all conditions. It forces the dimethylamino group to be at C6 and the formyl group to be at C5.\n\n*   **Scenario 2: The nitrile (-CN) is at C5.**\n    *   The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6.\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4 (this fits).\n    *   The hydroxyl group must be at the other ortho position, which is C6.\n    *   This arrangement is also consistent with all conditions. It forces the dimethylamino group to be at C2 and the formyl group to be at C3.\n\n**4. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules (Tie-Breaker)**\nWe have two possible structures that fit the description. They are essentially the same molecule, just numbered in opposite directions from C1. In both cases, the substituents occupy positions {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. When the set of locants (position numbers) is identical, IUPAC rules state that we must choose the numbering direction that gives the lowest number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\n*   **Alphabetical order of substituents**:\n    1.  **c**yano\n    2.  **d**imethylamino\n    3.  **f**ormyl\n    4.  **h**ydroxy\n    5.  **m**ethoxy\n\n*   **Applying the rule**: We must give the \"cyano\" group the lowest possible number.\n    *   In Scenario 1, the cyano group is at position **3**.\n    *   In Scenario 2, the cyano group is at position **5**.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, the numbering from **Scenario 1 is the correct one**.\n\n**5. Assemble the Final Name**\nUsing the correct numbering from Scenario 1, the positions are:\n*   C2: hydroxy\n*   C3: cyano\n*   C4: methoxy\n*   C5: formyl\n*   C6: dimethylamino\n\nWe list these substituents in alphabetical order, preceded by their position numbers, and add the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n\n*   3-**c**yano-\n*   6-(**d**imethylamino)-\n*   5-**f**ormyl-\n*   2-**h**ydroxy-\n*   4-**m**ethoxy-\n*   benzoic acid\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\nThis name matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct IUPAC name.\n\n1.  **Identify the Principal Functional Group and Parent Compound:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid (-COOH), which has the highest priority among the given functional groups. When attached to a benzene ring, the parent compound is named **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the ring attached to the -COOH group is designated as position **C1**.\n\n2.  **Map the Substituents Based on Relative Positions:**\n    *   **C1:** -COOH (part of the parent name).\n    *   **Para to C1:** A methoxy group (-OCH₃) is at the para position, which is **C4**.\n    *   **Ortho to C1:** A hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino [-N(CH₃)₂] group are at the ortho positions, **C2** and **C6**.\n    *   **Meta to C1:** A carbaldehyde (-CHO, named as a \"formyl\" substituent) and a cyano (-CN) group are at the meta positions, **C3** and **C5**.\n\n3.  **Use the Final Constraint to Determine the Exact Arrangement:** The description states, \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   \"Alcohol\" refers to the hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    *   \"Nitrile\" refers to the cyano group (-CN).\n    *   The methoxy group is fixed at C4. For it to be ortho to the cyano group, the cyano group must be at either C3 or C5. This is consistent with our previous deduction.\n    *   The hydroxyl group must also be ortho to the cyano group. Let's test the two possibilities for the cyano group's position:\n        *   **Case A: Cyano group is at C3.** The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4. The methoxy group is at C4 (which fits). Therefore, the hydroxyl group must be at **C2**. This forces the dimethylamino group to be at C6 and the formyl group to be at C5.\n        *   **Case B: Cyano group is at C5.** The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6. The methoxy group is at C4 (which fits). Therefore, the hydroxyl group must be at **C6**. This forces the dimethylamino group to be at C2 and the formyl group to be at C3.\n\n4.  **Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules (Tie-Breaker):** We now have two possible structures (from Case A and Case B) that fit the description. Both structures have substituents at positions {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. When the set of locants (position numbers) is identical, IUPAC rules state that we must choose the numbering that gives the lowest possible number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\n5.  **Alphabetize the Substituents:**\n    *   **c**yano\n    *   **d**imethylamino\n    *   **f**ormyl\n    *   **h**ydroxy\n    *   **m**ethoxy\n\n6.  **Choose the Correct Numbering:** The first substituent alphabetically is \"cyano\". We must choose the numbering scheme that gives the cyano group the lower number.\n    *   In Case A, the cyano group is at position **3**.\n    *   In Case B, the cyano group is at position **5**.\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, the numbering from **Case A** is correct.\n\n7.  **Assemble the Final Name:** Using the positions from Case A, we list the substituents in alphabetical order, each preceded by its position number, followed by the parent name.\n    *   The positions are: 2-hydroxy, 3-cyano, 4-methoxy, 5-formyl, 6-dimethylamino.\n    *   Arranging alphabetically: 3-cyano, 6-(dimethylamino), 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.\n    *   The full name is: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n8.  **Compare with the Options:** This name is an exact match for option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo determine the correct IUPAC name, we will follow a systematic, step-by-step process.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Principal Functional Group and Parent Compound\nThe molecule contains several functional groups: carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂), and methoxy (-OCH₃). According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**, and the carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the -COOH group is designated as **C1**.\n\n### Step 2: Map the Substituents Based on Positional Information\nWe place the substituents on the benzene ring according to the description:\n*   **C1**: -COOH (by definition of benzoic acid).\n*   **Para to C1**: A methoxy group (-OCH₃) is para, so it is at **C4**.\n*   **Ortho to C1**: A hydroxyl group (-OH) and a dimethylamino group [-N(CH₃)₂] are ortho, so they occupy positions **C2** and **C6**.\n*   **Meta to C1**: A carbaldehyde (-CHO, prefix \"formyl\") and a cyano group (-CN) are meta, so they occupy positions **C3** and **C5**.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Final Constraint to Determine the Exact Structure\nThe crucial piece of information is: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n*   \"Methoxy\" is the group at C4.\n*   \"Alcohol\" is the hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   \"Nitrile\" is the cyano group (-CN).\n\nWe must test the two possible positions for the cyano group (C3 or C5) to see which one fits this constraint.\n*   **Case A: Cyano group is at C3.** The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4. The methoxy group is at C4 (this fits). The hydroxyl group must therefore be at C2 (this fits, as C2 is an available ortho-to-C1 position). This arrangement is consistent with all conditions.\n*   **Case B: Cyano group is at C5.** The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6. The methoxy group is at C4 (this fits). The hydroxyl group must therefore be at C6 (this fits, as C6 is an available ortho-to-C1 position). This arrangement is also consistent with all conditions.\n\nThis leaves us with two possible structures, which are mirror images in terms of numbering direction:\n*   **Structure from Case A**: C1(-COOH), C2(-OH), C3(-CN), C4(-OCH₃), C5(-CHO), C6(-N(CH₃)₂).\n*   **Structure from Case B**: C1(-COOH), C2(-N(CH₃)₂), C3(-CHO), C4(-OCH₃), C5(-CN), C6(-OH).\n\n### Step 4: Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules to Select the Correct Name\nBoth potential structures have substituents at positions {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. When the set of locants (position numbers) is identical for two different numbering schemes, IUPAC rules state that the tie must be broken by giving the lowest possible number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\n1.  **Alphabetize the substituents**:\n    *   **c**yano\n    *   **d**imethylamino\n    *   **f**ormyl\n    *   **h**ydroxy\n    *   **m**ethoxy\n\n2.  **Apply the tie-breaker**: The first substituent in the alphabetical list is \"cyano\". We must choose the numbering scheme that assigns the lowest number to the cyano group.\n    *   In the structure from Case A, the cyano group is at position **3**.\n    *   In the structure from Case B, the cyano group is at position **5**.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, the numbering from **Case A** is the correct one.\n\n### Step 5: Assemble the Final Name\nUsing the correct positions from Case A, we list the substituents in alphabetical order, each preceded by its number, followed by the parent name.\n*   The positions are: 2-hydroxy, 3-cyano, 4-methoxy, 5-formyl, 6-dimethylamino.\n*   The alphabetized name is: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\nThis name matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct IUPAC name.\n\n**1. Identify the Parent Compound**\nThe molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) attached to a benzene ring. According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid is the principal functional group. Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**, and the carbon atom attached to the -COOH group is designated as **C1**.\n\n**2. Determine the Positions of the Substituents**\nWe are given the following positional information relative to the C1 carboxylic acid:\n*   A methoxy group (-OCH₃) is **para**, placing it at **C4**.\n*   A hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino [-N(CH₃)₂] group are **ortho**, placing them at positions **C2** and **C6**.\n*   A carbaldehyde (-CHO, named as a \"formyl\" substituent) and a cyano (-CN) group are **meta**, placing them at positions **C3** and **C5**.\n\n**3. Use the Final Constraint to Find the Exact Arrangement**\nThe crucial piece of information is: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n*   \"Nitrile\" refers to the cyano group (-CN).\n*   \"Alcohol\" refers to the hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   The methoxy group is fixed at C4.\n*   The cyano group must be ortho to the methoxy group, so it can be at C3 or C5. This is consistent with our earlier finding.\n*   The hydroxyl group must also be ortho to the cyano group.\n\nLet's test the two possible positions for the cyano group:\n*   **Case A: Cyano group is at C3.** The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4. The methoxy group is at C4, which fits. Therefore, the hydroxyl group must be at C2. This forces the dimethylamino group to be at C6 and the formyl group to be at C5.\n*   **Case B: Cyano group is at C5.** The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6. The methoxy group is at C4, which fits. Therefore, the hydroxyl group must be at C6. This forces the dimethylamino group to be at C2 and the formyl group to be at C3.\n\n**4. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules (The Tie-Breaker)**\nWe have two possible structures that fit the description. They represent the same molecule, just numbered in opposite directions from C1. In both cases, the set of locants (positions) for the substituents is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\nWhen the set of locants is identical, IUPAC rules state that we must choose the numbering that gives the lowest possible number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\n**5. Alphabetize the Substituents and Choose the Correct Numbering**\nThe substituent prefixes are:\n1.  **c**yano\n2.  **d**imethylamino\n3.  **f**ormyl\n4.  **h**ydroxy\n5.  **m**ethoxy\n\nThe first substituent alphabetically is \"cyano\". We must choose the numbering scheme that gives the cyano group the lower number.\n*   In Case A, the cyano group is at position **3**.\n*   In Case B, the cyano group is at position **5**.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, the numbering from **Case A** is the correct one.\n\n**6. Assemble the Final Name**\nUsing the correct structure and numbering from Case A, we list the substituents in alphabetical order, followed by the parent name.\n*   The structure is: C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH₃, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH₃)₂.\n*   The name is constructed as follows:\n    *   3-**c**yano-\n    *   6-(**d**imethylamino)-\n    *   5-**f**ormyl-\n    *   2-**h**ydroxy-\n    *   4-**m**ethoxy-\n    *   **benzoic acid**\n\nThe final, correct IUPAC name is **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n**7. Match with the Options**\nThis name is identical to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct IUPAC name.\n\n**1. Identify the Parent Compound**\nThe molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) attached to a benzene ring. According to IUPAC priority rules, this is the principal functional group. Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the ring attached to the -COOH group is assigned position **C1**.\n\n**2. Place the Substituents Based on Relative Positions**\n*   **C1:** -COOH (part of the parent name)\n*   **Para to C1:** A methoxy group (-OCH₃) is para to the carboxylic acid, so it is at **C4**.\n*   **Ortho to C1:** A hydroxyl group (-OH) and a dimethylamino group [-N(CH₃)₂] are ortho to the carboxylic acid. This means they occupy positions **C2** and **C6**.\n*   **Meta to C1:** A carbaldehyde (-CHO, prefix \"formyl\") and a cyano group (-CN) are meta to the carboxylic acid. This means they occupy positions **C3** and **C5**.\n\n**3. Use the Final Constraint to Determine the Exact Structure**\nThe crucial piece of information is: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n*   We know the methoxy group is at C4.\n*   The nitrile (cyano group, -CN) must be ortho to the methoxy group. The positions ortho to C4 are C3 and C5. This is consistent with our previous deduction.\n*   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) must *also* be ortho to the nitrile group.\n\nLet's test the two possible positions for the nitrile group:\n\n*   **Case 1: The nitrile (-CN) is at C3.**\n    *   The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4.\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4 (this fits).\n    *   The hydroxyl group must be at the other ortho position, **C2**.\n    *   This forces the dimethylamino group to be at C6 and the formyl group to be at C5.\n    *   This gives us the structure: C1(-COOH), C2(-OH), C3(-CN), C4(-OCH₃), C5(-CHO), C6(-N(CH₃)₂). This structure is consistent with all conditions.\n\n*   **Case 2: The nitrile (-CN) is at C5.**\n    *   The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6.\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4 (this fits).\n    *   The hydroxyl group must be at the other ortho position, **C6**.\n    *   This forces the dimethylamino group to be at C2 and the formyl group to be at C3.\n    *   This gives us the structure: C1(-COOH), C2(-N(CH₃)₂), C3(-CHO), C4(-OCH₃), C5(-CN), C6(-OH). This structure is also consistent with all conditions.\n\n**4. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules (Tie-Breaker)**\nWe have two possible structures (from Case 1 and Case 2) which are mirror images in terms of numbering direction. Both result in the same set of locants (positions): {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. When there is a tie in the locant set, IUPAC rules state that we must choose the numbering direction that gives the **lowest number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order**.\n\n*   **Alphabetical order of substituents:**\n    1.  **c**yano\n    2.  **d**imethylamino\n    3.  **f**ormyl\n    4.  **h**ydroxy\n    5.  **m**ethoxy\n\n*   The first substituent alphabetically is **cyano**.

The methoxy group is at C4, so the hydroxyl group must be at **C2**. This works, as C2 is an ortho position to the parent C1.

Match with the Options:**\nThis name matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct IUPAC name.\n\n**1. Identify the Principal Functional Group and Parent Compound**\nThe molecule contains several functional groups, but the carboxylic acid (-COOH) has the highest priority according to IUPAC rules. When a carboxylic acid is attached to a benzene ring, the parent compound is named **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the ring attached to the carboxylic acid is designated as position **C1**.\n\n**2. Map the Substituents onto the Benzene Ring**\nBased on the description, we can place the substituents relative to C1:\n*   **-COOH**: At C1.\n*   **-OCH₃ (methoxy)**: *para* to C1, so it is at **C4**.\n*   **-OH (hydroxyl) and -N(CH₃)₂ (dimethylamino)**: *ortho* to C1, so they occupy positions **C2 and C6**.\n*   **-CHO (formyl) and -CN (cyano)**: *meta* to C1, so they occupy positions **C3 and C5**.\n\n**3. Use the Final Constraint to Determine the Exact Arrangement**\nThe crucial piece of information is: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n*   The methoxy group is at C4.\n*   The nitrile (cyano group, -CN) must be ortho to the methoxy group, so it can be at C3 or C5.\n*   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) must also be ortho to the nitrile group.\n\nLet's test the two possible positions for the nitrile group:\n*   **Case A: The nitrile (-CN) is at C3.** The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4. The methoxy group is at C4 (which fits). The hydroxyl group must therefore be at **C2**. This forces the dimethylamino group to be at C6 and the formyl group to be at C5.\n*   **Case B: The nitrile (-CN) is at C5.** The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6. The methoxy group is at C4 (which fits). The hydroxyl group must therefore be at **C6**. This forces the dimethylamino group to be at C2 and the formyl group to be at C3.\n\n**4. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules (The Tie-Breaker)**\nWe now have two possible structures that fit the description. They represent the same molecule, just numbered in opposite directions from C1.\n*   Structure from Case A: Substituents at 2(-OH), 3(-CN), 4(-OCH₃), 5(-CHO), 6(-N(CH₃)₂).\n*   Structure from Case B: Substituents at 2(-N(CH₃)₂), 3(-CHO), 4(-OCH₃), 5(-CN), 6(-OH).\n\nIn both cases, the set of locants (positions) is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. When the locant set is identical, IUPAC rules state that we must choose the numbering direction that gives the lowest number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\n**5. Alphabetize the Substituents and Choose the Correct Numbering**\nThe substituent prefixes are alphabetized as follows:\n1.  **c**yano\n2.  **d**imethylamino\n3.  **f**ormyl\n4.  **h**ydroxy\n5.  **m**ethoxy\n\nThe first substituent alphabetically is \"cyano\". We must choose the numbering scheme that gives the cyano group the lower number.\n*   In Case A, the cyano group is at position **3**.\n*   In Case B, the cyano group is at position **5**.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, the numbering from **Case A is correct**.\n\n**6. Assemble the Final Name**\nUsing the correct numbering from Case A, we list the substituents in alphabetical order, followed by the parent name:\n*   3-**c**yano-\n*   6-(**d**imethylamino)-\n*   5-**f**ormyl-\n*   2-**h**ydroxy-\n*   4-**m**ethoxy-\n*   **benzoic acid**\n\nThe final, correct IUPAC name is **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n**7.

The carbon atom of the ring attached to the -COOH group is designated as **C1**.\n\n**2. Map the Substituents Based on Positional Information**\n*   **C1**: -COOH (defines the parent name).\n*   **Para to C1**: A methoxy group (-OCH3) is para to the carboxylic acid, placing it at **C4**.\n*   **Ortho to C1**: A hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group are ortho to the carboxylic acid. This places them at positions **C2** and **C6**.\n*   **Meta to C1**: A carbaldehyde (-CHO, named as a \"formyl\" substituent) and a cyano (-CN) group are meta to the carboxylic acid. This places them at positions **C3** and **C5**. The description also states these three groups are meta to one another, which is consistent with a 1,3,5-substitution pattern.\n\n**3. Use the Final Constraint to Determine the Exact Structure**\nThis is the most critical piece of information to resolve the remaining ambiguities.\n*   **Constraint**: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   \"Methoxy\" is at C4.\n    *   \"Alcohol\" is the hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   \"Nitrile\" is the cyano (-CN) group.\n*   Let's test the two possible positions for the cyano group (C3 or C5):\n    *   **Case 1: Cyano group is at C3.** For the methoxy group (at C4) and the hydroxyl group to be ortho to it, the hydroxyl group must be at C2. This is a valid arrangement. This forces the dimethylamino group to be at C6 and the formyl group to be at C5.\n    *   **Case 2: Cyano group is at C5.** For the methoxy group (at C4) and the hydroxyl group to be ortho to it, the hydroxyl group must be at C6. This is also a valid arrangement. This forces the dimethylamino group to be at C2 and the formyl group to be at C3.\n\n**4. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules (Tie-Breaker)**\nWe have two possible structures that fit the description. These are essentially the same molecule, just numbered in opposite directions from C1.\n*   Structure from Case 1: Substituents at {2-OH, 3-CN, 4-OCH3, 5-CHO, 6-N(CH3)2}\n*   Structure from Case 2: Substituents at {2-N(CH3)2, 3-CHO, 4-OCH3, 5-CN, 6-OH}\n*   In both cases, the set of locants (position numbers) is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. This is a tie.\n*   **The tie-breaker rule**: When the locant sets are identical, the numbering is chosen to give the lowest possible number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\n**5. Alphabetize the Substituents**\nThe substituent prefixes are listed alphabetically as follows:\n1.  **c**yano\n2.  **d**imethylamino\n3.  **f**ormyl\n4.  **h**ydroxy\n5.  **m**ethoxy\n\n**6. Choose the Correct Numbering**\nThe first substituent alphabetically is \"cyano\".

Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**, and the carbon atom of the ring attached to the -COOH group is designated as position **C1**.\n\n**2. Place Substituents Based on Relative Positions**\n*   **C1**: -COOH (part of the parent name).\n*   **Para to C1**: A methoxy group (-OCH3) is at the para position, which is **C4**.\n*   **Ortho to C1**: A hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group are at the ortho positions, which are **C2** and **C6**.\n*   **Meta to C1**: A carbaldehyde (-CHO, named as a \"formyl\" substituent) and a cyano (-CN) group are at the meta positions, which are **C3** and **C5**.\n\n**3. Use the Final Constraint to Determine the Exact Structure**\nThe key piece of information is: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n*   The methoxy group is at C4.\n*   The alcohol is the hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The nitrile is the cyano (-CN) group.\n*   For the methoxy group at C4 to be ortho to the nitrile, the nitrile must be at C3 or C5. This is consistent.\n*   The hydroxyl group must also be ortho to the nitrile. Let's test the two possibilities for the nitrile's position:\n    *   **Case A: Nitrile (-CN) is at C5.** The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6. The methoxy group is at C4 (this fits). The hydroxyl group must be at the other ortho position, C6. This arrangement is consistent with all conditions.\n    *   **Case B: Nitrile (-CN) is at C3.** The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4. The methoxy group is at C4 (this fits). The hydroxyl group must be at the other ortho position, C2. This arrangement is also consistent with all conditions.\n\n**4. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules (Tie-Breaker)**\nWe have two possible structures that fit the description. They represent the same molecule, just numbered in opposite directions from C1.\n*   **Structure from Case A**: C2-dimethylamino, C3-formyl, C4-methoxy, C5-cyano, C6-hydroxy.\n*   **Structure from Case B**: C2-hydroxy, C3-cyano, C4-methoxy, C5-formyl, C6-dimethylamino.\n\nIn both cases, the set of locants (positions) for the substituents is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. When the locant set is identical, IUPAC rules state that we must choose the numbering direction that gives the lowest number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\n**5. Alphabetize Substituents and Choose the Correct Numbering**\n*   The substituent prefixes are: **c**yano, **d**imethylamino, **f**ormyl, **h**ydroxy, **m**ethoxy.\n*   The first substituent alphabetically is **cyano**. We must choose the numbering scheme that gives the cyano group the lower number.\n*   In the structure from Case A, the cyano group is at position **5**.\n*   In the structure from Case B, the cyano group is at position **3**.\n*   Since 3 is lower than 5, the numbering from **Case B is correct**.\n\n**6. Assemble the Final Name**\nUsing the correct structure and numbering (from Case B), we list the substituents in alphabetical order, followed by the parent name:\n*   3-cyano-\n*   6-(dimethylamino)-\n*   5-formyl-\n*   2-hydroxy-\n*   4-methoxy-\n*   benzoic acid\n\nThe final name is: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n**7. Match with Options**\nThis name matches option B. A review of the candidate answers shows that while many agents correctly deduced this name, several made errors when matching it to the provided options. The chemical reasoning, however, strongly supports this result.\n\n```python\n# The problem asks for the correct IUPAC name of a substituted benzoic acid.\n\n# Step 1: Identify the parent compound.\n# The highest priority functional group is carboxylic acid, so the parent is benzoic acid.

Identify the Parent Compound and Principal Functional Group**\n*   The molecule is a substituted benzene ring.\n*   It contains several functional groups: carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2), and methoxy (-OCH3).\n*   According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority.\n*   Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid group is assigned position **C1**.\n\n**2. Map the Substituents Based on the Description**\n*   **C1:** -COOH (part of the parent name).\n*   **Para to C1:** A methoxy group (-OCH3) is para to the carboxylic acid. The para position is C4. So, the **methoxy group is at C4**.\n*   **Ortho to C1:** A hydroxyl group (-OH) and a dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2) are ortho to the carboxylic acid. The ortho positions are C2 and C6. So, **-OH and -N(CH3)2 are at C2 and C6**.\n*   **Meta to C1:** A carbaldehyde (-CHO, named as a \"formyl\" substituent) and a cyano group (-CN) are meta to the carboxylic acid. The meta positions are C3 and C5. So, **-CHO and -CN are at C3 and C5**.\n\n**3. Use the Final Constraint to Determine the Exact Arrangement**\nThe crucial piece of information is: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n*   We know the methoxy group is at C4.\n*   The nitrile (cyano group, -CN) must be ortho to the methoxy group. The positions ortho to C4 are C3 and C5. This is consistent with our earlier deduction.\n*   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) must also be ortho to the nitrile group.\n\nLet's test the two possible positions for the nitrile group:\n\n*   **Case A: The nitrile (-CN) is at C3.**\n    *   The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4.\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4 (this fits).\n    *   The hydroxyl group must be at the other ortho position, which is **C2**.\n    *   This forces the dimethylamino group to be at C6 and the formyl group to be at C5.\n    *   This arrangement is: C1(-COOH), C2(-OH), C3(-CN), C4(-OCH3), C5(-CHO), C6(-N(CH3)2).\n\n*   **Case B: The nitrile (-CN) is at C5.**\n    *   The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6.\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4 (this fits).\n    *   The hydroxyl group must be at the other ortho position, which is **C6**.\n    *   This forces the dimethylamino group to be at C2 and the formyl group to be at C3.\n    *   This arrangement is: C1(-COOH), C2(-N(CH3)2), C3(-CHO), C4(-OCH3), C5(-CN), C6(-OH).\n\n**4. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules (Tie-Breaker)**\nBoth Case A and Case B describe the same molecule, just numbered in opposite directions (clockwise vs. counter-clockwise). Both numbering schemes result in the same set of locants (positions): {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. When there is a tie in the locant set, IUPAC rules state that we must choose the numbering direction that gives the **lowest number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order**.\n\n*   **Alphabetical order of substituents:**\n    1.  **c**yano\n    2.  **d**imethylamino\n    3.  **f**ormyl\n    4.  **h**ydroxy\n    5.  **m**ethoxy\n\n*   **Apply the rule:** The first substituent alphabetically is \"cyano\". We must choose the numbering scheme that gives the cyano group the lower number.\n    *   In Case A, the cyano group is at position **3**.\n    *   In Case B, the cyano group is at position **5**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Since 3 is lower than 5, **Case A provides the correct IUPAC numbering.**\n\n**5. Assemble the Final Name**\nUsing the correct numbering from Case A, we list the substituents in alphabetical order, followed by the parent name:\n*   **3-cyano-**\n*   **6-(dimethylamino)-**\n*   **5-formyl-**\n*   **2-hydroxy-**\n*   **4-methoxy**\n*   **benzoic acid**\n\nCombining these parts gives the final name: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n**6. Match with the Options**\n*   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n*   B) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n*   C) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid\n*   D) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid\n\nThe derived name exactly matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct IUPAC name.\n\n**1. Identify the Parent Compound**\nThe molecule is a benzene ring with multiple functional groups. According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid (-COOH) group has the highest priority among those listed. Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid is assigned position **C1**.\n\n**2. Place the Substituents on the Ring**\nWe use the positional information given in the question to place the other groups relative to C1:\n*   **Methoxy group (-OCH₃):** It is *para* to the carboxylic acid, so it is at position **C4**.\n*   **Hydroxyl (-OH) and Dimethylamino [-N(CH₃)₂] groups:** They are *ortho* to the carboxylic acid, so they occupy positions **C2** and **C6**.\n*   **Carbaldehyde (-CHO) and Cyano (-CN) groups:** They are *meta* to the carboxylic acid, so they occupy positions **C3** and **C5**.\n\n**3. Use the Final Constraint to Determine the Exact Arrangement**\nThe crucial piece of information is: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n*   \"Methoxy\" is at C4.\n*   \"Alcohol\" is the hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   \"Nitrile\" is the cyano group (-CN).\n\nWe must test the two possible positions for the nitrile group (C3 or C5) to see which one satisfies this condition.\n\n*   **Case A: Assume the nitrile (-CN) is at C3.**\n    *   The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4.\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4, which is indeed ortho to C3. This part works.\n    *   The hydroxyl group must be at the other ortho position, C2. This also works, as C2 is one of the available ortho-to-C1 positions.\n    *   This arrangement forces the dimethylamino group to be at C6 and the carbaldehyde (formyl) group to be at C5. This structure is fully consistent with the description.\n\n*   **Case B: Assume the nitrile (-CN) is at C5.**\n    *   The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6.\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4, which is ortho to C5. This part works.\n    *   The hydroxyl group must be at the other ortho position, C6. This also works, as C6 is one of the available ortho-to-C1 positions.\n    *   This arrangement forces the dimethylamino group to be at C2 and the formyl group to be at C3. This structure is also fully consistent with the description.\n\n**4. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules to Choose the Correct Scheme**\nWe have two valid structures that fit the description. They represent the same molecule, just numbered in opposite directions from C1.\n*   Structure from Case A: Numbering is C1 -> C2(-OH) -> C3(-CN) -> C4(-OCH₃) -> C5(-CHO) -> C6(-N(CH₃)₂)\n*   Structure from Case B: Numbering is C1 -> C2(-N(CH₃)₂) -> C3(-CHO) -> C4(-OCH₃) -> C5(-CN) -> C6(-OH)\n\nIn both cases, the set of locants (positions) for the substituents is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. When the locant sets are identical, IUPAC rules state that we must use the alphabetical order of the substituents as a tie-breaker. The numbering is chosen to give the lowest possible number to the substituent that comes first alphabetically.\n\n**5. Alphabetize the Substituents and Apply the Tie-Breaker**\nThe substituent prefixes are:\n*   **c**yano\n*   **d**imethylamino\n*   **f**ormyl\n*   **h**ydroxy\n*   **m**ethoxy\n\nThe first substituent in alphabetical order is \"cyano\". We must choose the numbering scheme that gives the cyano group the lower number.\n*   In Case A, the cyano group is at position **3**.\n*   In Case B, the cyano group is at position **5**.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, the numbering from **Case A** is the correct one.\n\n**6. Assemble the Final Name**\nUsing the positions from Case A, we list the substituents in alphabetical order, each preceded by its locant number, followed by the parent name.\n*   3-**c**yano-\n*   6-(**d**imethylamino)-\n*   5-**f**ormyl-\n*   2-**h**ydroxy-\n*   4-**m**ethoxy-\n*   **benzoic acid**\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\nThis name matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct IUPAC name.\n\n**1. Identify the Principal Functional Group and Parent Compound**\nThe molecule contains several functional groups, but the carboxylic acid (-COOH) has the highest priority according to IUPAC rules. When a carboxylic acid is attached to a benzene ring, the parent compound is named **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the ring attached to the carboxylic acid is designated as position **C1**.\n\n**2. Map the Substituents Based on the Description**\n*   **C1**: -COOH (part of the parent name).\n*   **Para to C1**: A methoxy group (-OCH₃) is para to the carboxylic acid. The para position is C4. So, the **methoxy group is at C4**.\n*   **Ortho to C1**: A hydroxyl group (-OH) and a dimethylamino group [-N(CH₃)₂] are ortho to the carboxylic acid. The ortho positions are C2 and C6. So, **{-OH, -N(CH₃)₂} are at {C2, C6}**.\n*   **Meta to C1**: A carbaldehyde (-CHO, named as a \"formyl\" substituent) and a cyano group (-CN) are meta to the carboxylic acid. The meta positions are C3 and C5. So, **{-CHO, -CN} are at {C3, C5}**.\n\n**3. Use the Final Constraint to Determine the Exact Arrangement**\nThis is the most critical step. The description states: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n*   We know the methoxy group is at C4.\n*   The nitrile (cyano group, -CN) must be ortho to the methoxy group. The positions ortho to C4 are C3 and C5, which is consistent with our earlier deduction.\n*   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) must also be ortho to the nitrile group.\n\nLet's test the two possible positions for the nitrile group:\n\n*   **Scenario 1: The nitrile (-CN) is at C3.**\n    *   The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4.\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4 (this fits).\n    *   The hydroxyl group must be at the other ortho position, which is C2.\n    *   This arrangement is consistent with all conditions. It forces the dimethylamino group to be at C6 and the formyl group to be at C5.\n\n*   **Scenario 2: The nitrile (-CN) is at C5.**\n    *   The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6.\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4 (this fits).\n    *   The hydroxyl group must be at the other ortho position, which is C6.\n    *   This arrangement is also consistent with all conditions. It forces the dimethylamino group to be at C2 and the formyl group to be at C3.\n\n**4. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules (Tie-Breaker)**\nWe have two possible structures that fit the description. They are essentially the same molecule, just numbered in opposite directions from C1. In both cases, the substituents occupy positions {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. When the set of locants (position numbers) is identical, IUPAC rules state that we must choose the numbering direction that gives the lowest number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\n*   **Alphabetical order of substituents**:\n    1.  **c**yano\n    2.  **d**imethylamino\n    3.  **f**ormyl\n    4.  **h**ydroxy\n    5.  **m**ethoxy\n\n*   **Applying the rule**: We must give the \"cyano\" group the lowest possible number.\n    *   In Scenario 1, the cyano group is at position **3**.\n    *   In Scenario 2, the cyano group is at position **5**.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, the numbering from **Scenario 1 is the correct one**.\n\n**5.

For it to be ortho to the cyano group, the cyano group must be at either C3 or C5. This is consistent with our previous deduction.\n    *   The hydroxyl group must also be ortho to the cyano group. Let's test the two possibilities for the cyano group's position:\n        *   **Case A: Cyano group is at C3.** The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4. The methoxy group is at C4 (which fits). Therefore, the hydroxyl group must be at **C2**.

According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**, and the carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the -COOH group is designated as **C1**.\n\n### Step 2: Map the Substituents Based on Positional Information\nWe place the substituents on the benzene ring according to the description:\n*   **C1**: -COOH (by definition of benzoic acid).\n*   **Para to C1**: A methoxy group (-OCH₃) is para, so it is at **C4**.\n*   **Ortho to C1**: A hydroxyl group (-OH) and a dimethylamino group [-N(CH₃)₂] are ortho, so they occupy positions **C2** and **C6**.\n*   **Meta to C1**: A carbaldehyde (-CHO, prefix \"formyl\") and a cyano group (-CN) are meta, so they occupy positions **C3** and **C5**.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Final Constraint to Determine the Exact Structure\nThe crucial piece of information is: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n*   \"Methoxy\" is the group at C4.\n*   \"Alcohol\" is the hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   \"Nitrile\" is the cyano group (-CN).\n\nWe must test the two possible positions for the cyano group (C3 or C5) to see which one fits this constraint.\n*   **Case A: Cyano group is at C3.** The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4. The methoxy group is at C4 (this fits). The hydroxyl group must therefore be at C2 (this fits, as C2 is an available ortho-to-C1 position). This arrangement is consistent with all conditions.\n*   **Case B: Cyano group is at C5.** The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6. The methoxy group is at C4 (this fits). The hydroxyl group must therefore be at C6 (this fits, as C6 is an available ortho-to-C1 position). This arrangement is also consistent with all conditions.\n\nThis leaves us with two possible structures, which are mirror images in terms of numbering direction:\n*   **Structure from Case A**: C1(-COOH), C2(-OH), C3(-CN), C4(-OCH₃), C5(-CHO), C6(-N(CH₃)₂).\n*   **Structure from Case B**: C1(-COOH), C2(-N(CH₃)₂), C3(-CHO), C4(-OCH₃), C5(-CN), C6(-OH).\n\n### Step 4: Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules to Select the Correct Name\nBoth potential structures have substituents at positions {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. When the set of locants (position numbers) is identical for two different numbering schemes, IUPAC rules state that the tie must be broken by giving the lowest possible number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\n1.  **Alphabetize the substituents**:\n    *   **c**yano\n    *   **d**imethylamino\n    *   **f**ormyl\n    *   **h**ydroxy\n    *   **m**ethoxy\n\n2.  **Apply the tie-breaker**: The first substituent in the alphabetical list is \"cyano\". We must choose the numbering scheme that assigns the lowest number to the cyano group.\n    *   In the structure from Case A, the cyano group is at position **3**.\n    *   In the structure from Case B, the cyano group is at position **5**.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, the numbering from **Case A** is the correct one.\n\n### Step 5: Assemble the Final Name\nUsing the correct positions from Case A, we list the substituents in alphabetical order, each preceded by its number, followed by the parent name.\n*   The positions are: 2-hydroxy, 3-cyano, 4-methoxy, 5-formyl, 6-dimethylamino.\n*   The alphabetized name is: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\nThis name matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct IUPAC name.\n\n**1. Identify the Parent Compound**\nThe molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) attached to a benzene ring. According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid is the principal functional group. Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**, and the carbon atom attached to the -COOH group is designated as **C1**.\n\n**2. Determine the Positions of the Substituents**\nWe are given the following positional information relative to the C1 carboxylic acid:\n*   A methoxy group (-OCH₃) is **para**, placing it at **C4**.\n*   A hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino [-N(CH₃)₂] group are **ortho**, placing them at positions **C2** and **C6**.\n*   A carbaldehyde (-CHO, named as a \"formyl\" substituent) and a cyano (-CN) group are **meta**, placing them at positions **C3** and **C5**.\n\n**3. Use the Final Constraint to Find the Exact Arrangement**\nThe crucial piece of information is: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n*   \"Nitrile\" refers to the cyano group (-CN).\n*   \"Alcohol\" refers to the hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   The methoxy group is fixed at C4.\n*   The cyano group must be ortho to the methoxy group, so it can be at C3 or C5. This is consistent with our earlier finding.\n*   The hydroxyl group must also be ortho to the cyano group.\n\nLet's test the two possible positions for the cyano group:\n*   **Case A: Cyano group is at C3.** The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4. The methoxy group is at C4, which fits. Therefore, the hydroxyl group must be at C2. This forces the dimethylamino group to be at C6 and the formyl group to be at C5.\n*   **Case B: Cyano group is at C5.** The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6. The methoxy group is at C4, which fits. Therefore, the hydroxyl group must be at C6. This forces the dimethylamino group to be at C2 and the formyl group to be at C3.\n\n**4. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules (The Tie-Breaker)**\nWe have two possible structures that fit the description. They represent the same molecule, just numbered in opposite directions from C1. In both cases, the set of locants (positions) for the substituents is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n\nWhen the set of locants is identical, IUPAC rules state that we must choose the numbering that gives the lowest possible number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\n**5. Alphabetize the Substituents and Choose the Correct Numbering**\nThe substituent prefixes are:\n1.  **c**yano\n2.  **d**imethylamino\n3.  **f**ormyl\n4.  **h**ydroxy\n5.  **m**ethoxy\n\nThe first substituent alphabetically is \"cyano\". We must choose the numbering scheme that gives the cyano group the lower number.\n*   In Case A, the cyano group is at position **3**.\n*   In Case B, the cyano group is at position **5**.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, the numbering from **Case A** is the correct one.\n\n**6. Assemble the Final Name**\nUsing the correct structure and numbering from Case A, we list the substituents in alphabetical order, followed by the parent name.\n*   The structure is: C1-COOH, C2-OH, C3-CN, C4-OCH₃, C5-CHO, C6-N(CH₃)₂.\n*   The name is constructed as follows:\n    *   3-**c**yano-\n    *   6-(**d**imethylamino)-\n    *   5-**f**ormyl-\n    *   2-**h**ydroxy-\n    *   4-**m**ethoxy-\n    *   **benzoic acid**\n\nThe final, correct IUPAC name is **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n**7. Match with the Options**\nThis name is identical to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct IUPAC name.\n\n**1. Identify the Parent Compound**\nThe molecule contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) attached to a benzene ring. According to IUPAC priority rules, this is the principal functional group. Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the ring attached to the -COOH group is assigned position **C1**.\n\n**2. Place the Substituents Based on Relative Positions**\n*   **C1:** -COOH (part of the parent name)\n*   **Para to C1:** A methoxy group (-OCH₃) is para to the carboxylic acid, so it is at **C4**.\n*   **Ortho to C1:** A hydroxyl group (-OH) and a dimethylamino group [-N(CH₃)₂] are ortho to the carboxylic acid. This means they occupy positions **C2** and **C6**.\n*   **Meta to C1:** A carbaldehyde (-CHO, prefix \"formyl\") and a cyano group (-CN) are meta to the carboxylic acid. This means they occupy positions **C3** and **C5**.\n\n**3. Use the Final Constraint to Determine the Exact Structure**\nThe crucial piece of information is: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n*   We know the methoxy group is at C4.\n*   The nitrile (cyano group, -CN) must be ortho to the methoxy group. The positions ortho to C4 are C3 and C5. This is consistent with our previous deduction.\n*   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) must *also* be ortho to the nitrile group.\n\nLet's test the two possible positions for the nitrile group:\n\n*   **Case 1: The nitrile (-CN) is at C3.**\n    *   The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4.\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4 (this fits).\n    *   The hydroxyl group must be at the other ortho position, **C2**.\n    *   This forces the dimethylamino group to be at C6 and the formyl group to be at C5.\n    *   This gives us the structure: C1(-COOH), C2(-OH), C3(-CN), C4(-OCH₃), C5(-CHO), C6(-N(CH₃)₂). This structure is consistent with all conditions.\n\n*   **Case 2: The nitrile (-CN) is at C5.**\n    *   The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6.\n    *   The methoxy group is at C4 (this fits).\n    *   The hydroxyl group must be at the other ortho position, **C6**.\n    *   This forces the dimethylamino group to be at C2 and the formyl group to be at C3.\n    *   This gives us the structure: C1(-COOH), C2(-N(CH₃)₂), C3(-CHO), C4(-OCH₃), C5(-CN), C6(-OH). This structure is also consistent with all conditions.\n\n**4. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules (Tie-Breaker)**\nWe have two possible structures (from Case 1 and Case 2) which are mirror images in terms of numbering direction. Both result in the same set of locants (positions): {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. When there is a tie in the locant set, IUPAC rules state that we must choose the numbering direction that gives the **lowest number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order**.\n\n*   **Alphabetical order of substituents:**\n    1.  **c**yano\n    2.  **d**imethylamino\n    3.  **f**ormyl\n    4.  **h**ydroxy\n    5.  **m**ethoxy\n\n*   The first substituent alphabetically is **cyano**. We must choose the numbering scheme that gives the cyano group the lower number.\n    *   In the structure from Case 1, the cyano group is at position **3**.\n    *   In the structure from Case 2, the cyano group is at position **5**.\n\n*   Since 3 is lower than 5, the numbering from **Case 1 is the correct one**.\n\n**5. Assemble the Final Name**\nUsing the correct structure and numbering (from Case 1), we list the substituents in alphabetical order, followed by the parent name.\n*   The positions are: 2-hydroxy, 3-cyano, 4-methoxy, 5-formyl, 6-dimethylamino.\n*   Arranging alphabetically:\n    *   3-cyano-\n    *   6-(dimethylamino)-\n    *   5-formyl-\n    *   2-hydroxy-\n    *   4-methoxy-\n*   Parent name: benzoic acid\n\nThe final, correct IUPAC name is: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\nThis name matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct IUPAC name.\n\n**1. Identify the Parent Compound and Principal Functional Group**\n*   The molecule is a substituted benzene ring.\n*   The functional groups present are carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), cyano (-CN), hydroxyl (-OH), dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2), and methoxy (-OCH3).\n*   According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority.\n*   Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the -COOH group is designated as position **C1**.\n\n**2. Place Substituents Based on Positional Information**\n*   **C1**: -COOH (by definition).\n*   **Para to C1**: A methoxy group (-OCH3) is at the para position, which is **C4**.\n*   **Ortho to C1**: A hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group are at the ortho positions, which are **C2** and **C6**.\n*   **Meta to C1**: A carbaldehyde (-CHO, prefix \"formyl\") and a cyano (-CN) group are at the meta positions, which are **C3** and **C5**.\n\n**3. Use the Final Constraint to Determine the Exact Structure**\nThe key piece of information is: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n*   \"Nitrile\" is the cyano group (-CN).\n*   \"Alcohol\" is the hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   The methoxy group is fixed at C4.\n*   The nitrile (-CN) must be ortho to the methoxy group at C4. The positions ortho to C4 are C3 and C5. This is consistent with our previous step.\n*   The hydroxyl group (-OH) must *also* be ortho to the nitrile group.\n\nLet's test the two possibilities for the nitrile's position:\n*   **Case A: Nitrile (-CN) is at C3.** The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4. The methoxy group is at C4, so the hydroxyl group must be at **C2**. This works, as C2 is an ortho position to the parent C1. This forces the dimethylamino group to be at C6 and the formyl group to be at C5.\n*   **Case B: Nitrile (-CN) is at C5.** The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6. The methoxy group is at C4, so the hydroxyl group must be at **C6**. This also works, as C6 is an ortho position to the parent C1. This forces the dimethylamino group to be at C2 and the formyl group to be at C3.\n\n**4. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules to Choose the Correct Arrangement**\nWe have two possible numbering schemes that both fit the description.\n*   **Scheme from Case A**: Substituents at C2(-OH), C3(-CN), C4(-OCH3), C5(-CHO), C6(-N(CH3)2).\n*   **Scheme from Case B**: Substituents at C2(-N(CH3)2), C3(-CHO), C4(-OCH3), C5(-CN), C6(-OH).\n\nBoth schemes result in the same set of locants (positions): {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. When this happens, IUPAC rules state that we must use alphabetical order as a tie-breaker. The numbering is chosen to give the lowest possible number to the substituent that comes first alphabetically.\n\n*   **Alphabetical order of substituents**: **c**yano, **d**imethylamino, **f**ormyl, **h**ydroxy, **m**ethoxy.\n*   The first substituent in the list is \"cyano\".\n*   In the scheme from Case A, the cyano group is at position **3**.\n*   In the scheme from Case B, the cyano group is at position **5**.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, the numbering from **Case A is the correct one**.\n\n**5.

According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**, and the carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the -COOH group is designated as **C1**.\n\n**2. Map the Substituents Based on the Description:**\n*   **C1:** -COOH (by definition).\n*   **Para to C1:** The methoxy group (-OCH₃) is para to the carboxylic acid, so it is at **C4**.\n*   **Ortho to C1:** The hydroxyl (-OH) and dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂) groups are ortho to the carboxylic acid. This means they occupy positions **C2** and **C6**.\n*   **Meta to C1:** The carbaldehyde (-CHO, prefix: formyl) and cyano (-CN) groups are meta to the carboxylic acid.

This is consistent.\n*   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) must also be ortho to the nitrile.\n\nLet's test the two possibilities for the nitrile's position:\n*   **Case A: Nitrile (-CN) is at C3.** The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4. The methoxy group is at C4 (this fits). Therefore, the hydroxyl group must be at **C2**. This forces the dimethylamino group to be at C6 and the formyl group to be at C5.\n*   **Case B: Nitrile (-CN) is at C5.** The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6. The methoxy group is at C4 (this fits). Therefore, the hydroxyl group must be at **C6**. This forces the dimethylamino group to be at C2 and the formyl group to be at C3.\n\n**4.

Map the Substituents Based on Positional Information**\n*   **C1:** Carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   **Para to C1:** A methoxy group (-OCH₃) is at the para position, which is **C4**.\n*   **Ortho to C1:** A hydroxyl group (-OH) and a dimethylamino group [-N(CH₃)₂] are at the ortho positions, which are **C2** and **C6**.\n*   **Meta to C1:** A carbaldehyde (-CHO, named as a \"formyl\" substituent) and a cyano group (-CN) are at the meta positions, which are **C3** and **C5**.\n\n**3. Use the Final Constraint to Determine the Exact Arrangement**\nThe crucial piece of information is: \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n*   \"Nitrile\" refers to the cyano group (-CN).\n*   \"Alcohol\" refers to the hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   The methoxy group is fixed at C4.\n*   The cyano group must be at either C3 or C5.\n*   The hydroxyl group must be at either C2 or C6.\n\nLet's test the two possible positions for the cyano group:\n*   **Case A: The cyano group is at C3.** The positions ortho to C3 are C2 and C4. The methoxy group is at C4 (which fits the condition). For the hydroxyl group to also be ortho, it must be at **C2**. This arrangement is consistent with all the given information. This forces the dimethylamino group to be at C6 and the formyl group to be at C5.\n*   **Case B: The cyano group is at C5.** The positions ortho to C5 are C4 and C6. The methoxy group is at C4 (which fits). For the hydroxyl group to also be ortho, it must be at **C6**. This arrangement is also consistent. This forces the dimethylamino group to be at C2 and the formyl group to be at C3.\n\n**4. Apply IUPAC Numbering Rules to Select the Correct Arrangement**\nWe have two possible arrangements (Case A and Case B) which are essentially the same molecule numbered in opposite directions. Both result in the same set of locants (positions) for the substituents: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. When there is a tie in the locant set, IUPAC rules state that we must choose the numbering direction that gives the lowest number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n\n*   **Alphabetical order of substituents:**\n    1.  **c**yano\n    2.  **d**imethylamino\n    3.  **f**ormyl\n    4.  **h**ydroxy\n    5.  **m**ethoxy\n\n*   **Apply the tie-breaker:** The first substituent alphabetically is \"cyano\". We must choose the numbering scheme that gives the cyano group the lower number.\n    *   In Case A, the cyano group is at position **3**.\n    *   In Case B, the cyano group is at position **5**.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, the arrangement from **Case A** is the correct one for IUPAC naming.\n\n**5. Assemble the Final Name**\nUsing the positions from Case A, we list the substituents in alphabetical order, followed by the parent name.\n*   The positions are: C2-hydroxy, C3-cyano, C4-methoxy, C5-formyl, C6-dimethylamino.\n*   The alphabetized name is constructed as follows:\n    *   3-cyano-\n    *   6-(dimethylamino)-\n    *   5-formyl-\n    *   2-hydroxy-\n    *   4-methoxy-\n    *   benzoic acid\n\nThe final, correct IUPAC name is **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n**6.
