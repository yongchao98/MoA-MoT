The key is to identify element Y and its fluorides (A1-A5) and then determine the molecular weight of A4.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the most likely solution paths:\n\n### Step 1: Initial Analysis of Element Y\n\nThe first step is to use the mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF = 31.96%) in compound A2 to identify the element Y. The molar mass of Y, M(Y), can be related to the number of fluorine atoms (n) in A2 (YFₙ) by the formula:\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nTesting integer values for n reveals several potential candidates for Y:\n*   **n=2:** M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (e.g., Krypton, Kr, if A2=KrF₂; ɷF ≈ 31.2%)\n*   **n=3:** M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol (e.g., Antimony, Sb, if A2=SbF₃; ɷF ≈ 31.9%)\n*   **n=5 or 6:** M(Y) is in the range of heavy metals like Pt, Au, or actinides like Am, Pu. For example, for AmF₆, ɷF ≈ 31.93%. For PtF₅, ɷF ≈ 32.75%.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluating Candidates with Chemical Clues\n\nWe must use the other chemical clues to narrow down the possibilities. The most revealing clues are:\n1.  **Five binary compounds** of fluorine with Y are known.\n2.  A1 is a **bright-red substance** that **oxidizes xenon**.\n3.  A5 is formed by adding Y to A4 in a **1:1 molar ratio**.\n\nLet's evaluate the strongest hypotheses presented by the candidate answers:\n\n*   **Hypothesis 1: Y is Antimony (Sb)**\n    This path is suggested by the excellent match of the mass percentage for A2=SbF₃. The molecular weight of SbF₃ is ~179 g/mol, which fits the **160-180** range perfectly. However, this hypothesis fails on nearly all other chemical clues: Antimony only has two simple binary fluorides (not five), its higher fluoride (SbF₅) is colorless and stable (not red and unstable), and the reaction stoichiometry is incorrect. This path prioritizes numerical matching over chemical consistency.\n\n*   **Hypothesis 2: Y is Krypton (Kr)**\n    This path is suggested by the unique 1:1 comproportionation reaction `Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂`, which perfectly matches the description of how A5 is formed from Y and A4. This identifies A4 as KrF₄, with a molecular weight of ~160 g/mol, fitting the **140-160** range. However, this hypothesis contradicts key facts: Krypton has only two known binary fluorides (not five), and KrF₄ is a colorless solid (not bright-red).\n\n*   **Hypothesis 3: Y is Platinum (Pt) or Gold (Au)**\n    This path provides the best fit for the qualitative chemical clues.\n    *   **Five Compounds:** Both Pt and Au are known to form at least five binary fluorides.\n    *   **A1 (red, oxidizes Xe):** PtF₆ is a dark-red solid famous for oxidizing xenon. AuF₅ is a red solid and part of a complex (AuF₇) that is a powerful oxidant. This clue fits perfectly.\n    *   **A2 (from A1's decomposition):** A2 would be PtF₅ or AuF₅. The mass percentage for these (32.75% and 32.54%) is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n    *   **Reaction (Y + A4 → A5, 1:1):** A 1:1 comproportionation reaction like `Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF` is chemically plausible. This would identify **A4 as PtF₂**.\n    *   **Molecular Weight of A4:** The molecular weight of PtF₂ is ~233 g/mol (AuF₂ is ~235 g/mol). This value falls squarely within the **220-240** range.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile the problem contains inconsistencies, the hypothesis that Y is Platinum (or Gold) provides the most chemically sound and coherent explanation. It aligns with the majority of the complex chemical clues (number of compounds, color, and reactivity with xenon). The slight discrepancy in the mass percentage is a more likely flaw in the problem statement than the multiple, significant chemical contradictions in the other hypotheses. The identification of A4 as PtF₂ (or AuF₂) is consistent with the reaction stoichiometry and leads directly to one of the provided answer ranges.\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of substance A4 falls in the range of 220-240 g/mol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis is a complex chemistry problem with several contradictory clues. To find the most logical solution, we must carefully analyze the different hypotheses presented and determine which one provides the most coherent explanation, even if it requires dismissing some clues as flawed.\n\n### Step 1: Initial Analysis of Element Y\n\nThe primary numerical clue is that substance A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. As shown in most of the provided analyses, this leads to the relationship M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n, where M(Y) is the molar mass of the unknown element Y and n is its oxidation state in compound A2.\n\nThis calculation yields several potential candidates for element Y:\n*   **Antimony (Sb):** For n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is an excellent match for Sb (121.76 g/mol), and the fluorine percentage in SbF₃ (31.88%) is extremely close to the given value.\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** For n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is reasonably close to Kr (83.8 g/mol), and the fluorine percentage in KrF₂ (31.2%) is also close to the given value.\n*   **Actinides (Am, Pu):** For n=6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is an excellent match for Am or Pu, and their hexafluorides have the correct fluorine percentage.\n*   **Other elements (Pt, Au, Br):** These are also considered, but the initial mass percentage fit is generally weaker.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluating the Hypotheses\n\nWe must use the other chemical clues to determine the correct element. The most decisive clues are the reaction properties.\n\n*   **The Actinide Hypothesis (Y=Am):** As detailed in Answer 5, this path is chemically very consistent. Americium has five known binary fluorides, its higher fluorides are strong oxidizers, and the comproportionation reaction `Am + AmF₄ → 2AmF₂` fits the 1:1 molar ratio clue. However, this hypothesis fails because the molecular weight of the identified A4 (AmF₄, MW ≈ 319 g/mol) does not fall into any of the provided answer ranges.\n*   **The Antimony Hypothesis (Y=Sb):** This path, favored by Answers 2, 7, and 12, is supported by the near-perfect mass percentage match. However, it contradicts several other key clues: Sb only has two common binary fluorides (not five), SbF₅ (A1) is not red or unstable at 293 K, and the 1:1 reaction `Sb + A4 → A5` is not easily explained by known antimony chemistry. This path requires assuming multiple clues are incorrect.\n*   **The Krypton Hypothesis (Y=Kr):** This path, detailed in Answers 1, 4, and 15, provides the best explanation for the chemical *reactions*. The 1:1 molar ratio clue is perfectly explained by the comproportionation reaction `Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂`. This reaction identifies A4 as KrF₄ and A5 as KrF₂. The reactivity of krypton fluorides with xenon and their decomposition pathways are also consistent with the clues. This hypothesis only requires us to assume that the descriptive clues about the \"bright-red\" color and the \"five\" compounds are flawed, which is common in such problems.\n\n### Step 3: Final Determination\n\nComparing the hypotheses, the Krypton path provides the most elegant and chemically sound explanation for the reaction mechanisms, which are often the core of such puzzles. The contradictions it creates are with descriptive properties that are more likely to be inaccurate or misleading than the specific reaction stoichiometry.\n\nFollowing the Krypton hypothesis:\n1.  Element **Y** is **Krypton (Kr)**.\n2.  The reaction `Y + A4 → A5` in a 1:1 molar ratio is **`Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂`**.\n3.  This identifies substance **A4** as **Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄)**.\n4.  The molecular weight of A4 (KrF₄) is calculated:\n    MW(KrF₄) = M(Kr) + 4 × M(F) ≈ 83.80 + 4 × 19.00 = **159.80 g/mol**.\n5.  This molecular weight falls within the range of **140-160 g/mol**.\n\nThis range corresponds to option A in the list provided by the most thorough analysis (Answer 4).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis is a complex chemical puzzle with several clues, some of which appear to be contradictory. To solve it, we must identify the most reliable pieces of information and find the hypothesis that best fits all the data.\n\n**1. Analysis of Clues and Potential Elements (Y)**\n\n*   **Mass Percentage of Fluorine (ɷF) in A2 is 31.96%**: This quantitative clue allows us to calculate a relationship between the molar mass of element Y (M(Y)) and the number of fluorine atoms (n) in compound A2: `M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n`.\n    *   Testing integer values for `n` points to several potential elements: Antimony (Sb, for n=3), Krypton (Kr, for n=2), Platinum (Pt, for n=5), Gold (Au, for n=5), and Americium (Am, for n=6).\n\n*   **Qualitative Chemical Properties**:\n    *   **\"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\"**: This is a very specific clue. It strongly supports elements like Platinum, Gold, Ruthenium, and Americium. It argues against Krypton (only 2 known) and Antimony (only 2 common ones).\n    *   **\"A1 is a bright-red substance\"**: This points towards compounds like PtF₆ (dark-red), RuF₆ (red-brown), or AuF₅ (red). It argues against KrF₄ (colorless) and SbF₅ (colorless).\n    *   **\"A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.\"**: This indicates an extremely powerful oxidizing agent. This is a famous property of PtF₆ and is also true for the higher fluorides of Au, Ru, and Kr. It is not true for SbF₅ (which reacts with xenon fluorides, but not xenon metal itself).\n    *   **\"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to... A4, A5 can be obtained.\"**: This strongly suggests a comproportionation reaction of the type `Y(0) + YFₙ → 2YFₙ/₂`. This is a key structural clue for identifying A4.\n\n**2. Evaluating the Hypotheses**\n\nLet's evaluate the most plausible candidates for element Y:\n\n*   **Antimony (Sb)**: This hypothesis is supported by the excellent match of the fluorine mass percentage for A2=SbF₃. The molecular weight of SbF₃ (178.8 g/mol) also fits one of the answer ranges (160-180). However, this path contradicts three major clues: Antimony only has two common binary fluorides, SbF₅ is colorless (not red), and it does not oxidize xenon metal. This hypothesis is unlikely.\n\n*   **Krypton (Kr)**: This hypothesis provides a perfect explanation for the 1:1 reaction (`Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂`), which would identify A4 as KrF₄. However, it contradicts the \"five compounds\" and \"bright-red\" clues. The mass percentage match is also not the best.\n\n*   **Platinum (Pt) / Gold (Au)**: These hypotheses are the most chemically consistent.\n    1.  Both Pt and Au form at least five binary fluorides.\n    2.  Their higher fluorides (PtF₆, AuF₅) are red/dark-red and are famous for being powerful enough to oxidize xenon.\n    3.  The mass percentage of fluorine in PtF₅ (32.75%) and AuF₅ (32.54%) are reasonably close to the given 31.96%. A small error in the problem's quantitative data is plausible.\n    4.  The 1:1 reaction clue can be used to identify A4. The reaction must be `Y + YFₙ → 2YFₙ/₂`. We need to find a fluoride of Pt or Au (YFₙ) whose molecular weight fits one of the options.\n\n**3. Identifying A4 and Final Conclusion**\n\nLet's test the platinum fluorides against the options:\n*   MW(PtF₆) ≈ 309 g/mol (No match)\n*   MW(PtF₄) ≈ 271 g/mol (No match)\n*   **MW(PtF₂) ≈ 233 g/mol**. This value falls perfectly into the range **C) 220-240**.\n\nLet's test the gold fluorides against the options:\n*   MW(AuF₅) ≈ 292 g/mol (No match)\n*   MW(AuF₃) ≈ 254 g/mol (No match)\n*   **MW(AuF₂) ≈ 235 g/mol**. This value also falls perfectly into the range **C) 220-240**.\n\nBoth the Platinum and Gold hypotheses, which best explain the specific chemical properties described in the problem, converge on the same answer. They both suggest that A4 is the difluoride (PtF₂ or AuF₂), whose molecular weight is in the 220-240 g/mol range. This path requires accepting a small discrepancy in the mass percentage calculation but provides a coherent explanation for all other clues.\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of substance A4 falls in the range of 220-240.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the core chemical clues to identify the element family.**\nThe most revealing clues are that substance A1 is a \"bright-red substance\" that \"oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.\" The ability to oxidize xenon metal is a hallmark of extremely powerful oxidizing agents. The most famous example is platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆), which was used in the first synthesis of a noble gas compound. PtF₆ is a dark-red solid. This makes elements from the platinum group (like Pt, Ru) or other heavy transition metals (like Au) strong candidates for element Y.\n\n**Step 2: Use the mass percentage of fluorine in A2 to narrow down the identity of Y.**\nThe mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) in A2 is 31.96%. The formula relating the molar mass of Y (M(Y)) to the number of fluorine atoms (n) is M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n.\n\nLet's test this formula with candidates from the platinum group and gold:\n*   **Platinum (Pt):** M(Pt) ≈ 195.1 g/mol. We need M(Y) ≈ 195.1, so 195.1 ≈ 40.45 * n, which gives n ≈ 4.8. This suggests A2 could be PtF₅.\n    *   Let's verify: For PtF₅, ɷF = (5 * 19.00) / (195.1 + 5 * 19.00) = 95 / 290.1 ≈ 32.75%. This is a reasonably close match to the given 31.96%.\n*   **Gold (Au):** M(Au) ≈ 197.0 g/mol. We need M(Y) ≈ 197.0, so 197.0 ≈ 40.45 * n, which gives n ≈ 4.87. This also suggests A2 could be AuF₅.\n    *   Let's verify: For AuF₅, ɷF = (5 * 19.00) / (197.0 + 5 * 19.00) = 95 / 292.0 ≈ 32.53%. This is also a reasonably close match.\n\nBoth Platinum and Gold are excellent candidates. Let's proceed with the Platinum hypothesis, as the chemistry is very well-established.\n\n**Step 3: Construct a consistent scenario with Y = Platinum.**\n*   **Y = Pt**.\n*   **A1 = PtF₆**: This fits the description of a red solid that oxidizes xenon.\n*   **A2 = PtF₅**: The problem states A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine (PtF₆ → PtF₅ + ½F₂). The mass percentage (32.75%) is a good fit for A2.\n*   **A3 = PtF₆**: This is obtained by fluorinating Pt and also interacts with xenon.\n*   **A4 and A5**: The reaction is \"Y + A4 → A5\" with a 1:1 molar ratio of reactants. This describes a comproportionation reaction: Pt(0) + Pt(+n)Fₙ → 2Pt(+(n/2))Fₙ/₂. For this to work with a simple binary fluoride product, 'n' must be an even number. The known binary fluorides of platinum are PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, PtF₆. The candidates for A4 are therefore PtF₂, PtF₄, or PtF₆.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the molecular weight of the candidates for A4 and match with the options.**\nWe need to find which of the candidates (PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₆) has a molecular weight that falls into one of the given ranges.\n*   MW(PtF₆) = 195.1 + 6 * 19.0 = 309.1 g/mol.\n*   MW(PtF₄) = 195.1 + 4 * 19.0 = 271.1 g/mol.\n*   **MW(PtF₂) = 195.1 + 2 * 19.0 = 233.1 g/mol.**\n\nNow, let's compare this to the options provided in the prompt (the letter assignments vary, but the ranges are consistent across most versions):\n*   Range 1: 110-130\n*   Range 2: 140-160\n*   Range 3: 160-180\n*   Range 4: 220-240\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of PtF₂ (233.1 g/mol) falls squarely into the **220-240** range. This identifies A4 as PtF₂. The Gold hypothesis (Y=Au) leads to the same conclusion, as A4 would be AuF₂ (MW ≈ 235 g/mol), which is also in the 220-240 range.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe most chemically consistent interpretation of the clues identifies the element Y as Platinum (or Gold). This leads to the identification of substance A4 as the difluoride (PtF₂ or AuF₂), whose molecular weight is approximately 233-235 g/mol. This value falls within the 220-240 range.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the chemical puzzle, integrating the reasoning from the provided answers.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the mass percentage of Fluorine in A2 to identify potential candidates for element Y.**\n\nThe problem states that substance A2 has a mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. The formula for A2 can be written as YFₙ. We can establish a relationship between the molar mass of Y, M(Y), and the number of fluorine atoms, n:\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nLet's test integer values for n to find plausible elements:\n*   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. Candidates: Br, Kr.\n*   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. Candidate: Sb.\n*   n=5: M(Y) ≈ 202.3 g/mol. Candidates: Au, Pt.\n*   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. Candidates: Pu, Am.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the candidates against the key chemical clues.**\n\nThe most restrictive clues are:\n1.  **A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.** This points to extremely powerful oxidizing agents like the higher fluorides of Platinum (PtF₆), Gold (AuF₅), Krypton (KrF₄), or the actinides. Antimony (SbF₅) is a very strong Lewis acid that reacts with xenon *fluorides*, but it does not readily oxidize xenon metal itself. This makes Sb a less likely candidate.\n2.  **A1 is a bright-red substance.** This provides a physical property to check.\n3.  **Five binary compounds of Y with F are known.**\n4.  **A 1:1 molar ratio reaction: Y + A4 → A5.** This strongly suggests a comproportionation reaction, where an element in its 0 oxidation state reacts with a higher fluoride. For a 1:1 ratio, the reaction must be of the form `Y + YF₂ₓ → 2YFₓ`.\n\nLet's test the strongest candidates based on these clues:\n\n*   **Candidate: Krypton (Kr)**\n    *   The reaction `Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂` is a perfect 1:1 comproportionation. This would identify A4 as KrF₄.\n    *   MW(A4 = KrF₄) = 83.8 + 4(19.0) = 159.8 g/mol. This falls in the range **140-160 (B)**.\n    *   **Flaws:** Krypton only has two known binary fluorides (KrF₂ and KrF₄), contradicting the \"five compounds\" clue. Also, A1 (KrF₄) is a colorless solid, not \"bright-red\".\n\n*   **Candidate: Antimony (Sb)**\n    *   The mass percentage for SbF₃ (31.88%) is an excellent match for A2.\n    *   If A4 is SbF₃, its MW is ~178.8 g/mol, which fits the range **160-180 (D)**.\n    *   **Flaws:** The 1:1 reaction stoichiometry does not work for known antimony fluoride reactions. A1 (SbF₅) is colorless, not red. SbF₅ does not oxidize xenon metal. This hypothesis contradicts multiple key clues.\n\n*   **Candidate: Platinum (Pt)**\n    *   **A1 oxidizes xenon:** PtF₆ is famous for this (the Bartlett reaction). This is a perfect fit.\n    *   **A1 is bright-red:** PtF₆ is a dark-red solid. This is a perfect fit.\n    *   **Five compounds:** Platinum forms PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, PtF₆, and PtF is also known. This fits.\n    *   **A1 → A2 + F₂:** The decomposition `2PtF₆ → 2PtF₅ + F₂` is known. This identifies A2 as PtF₅.\n    *   **Mass % of A2 (PtF₅):** The calculated ɷF is ~32.75%, which is a reasonable match for the given 31.96% (a relative error of ~2.5%).\n    *   **1:1 Reaction:** The reaction `Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF` is a valid 1:1 comproportionation. This would identify A4 as PtF₂.\n    *   **MW of A4 (PtF₂):** MW = 195.08 + 2(19.0) = 233.08 g/mol. This value falls squarely in the range **220-240 (C)**.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion**\n\nThe Platinum (Pt) hypothesis provides the most consistent explanation for the majority of the clues, especially the most specific and unusual ones (xenon oxidation, red color, five compounds, and reaction stoichiometry). While the mass percentage is slightly off, it is a better overall fit than the other candidates, which have major contradictions with the chemical properties. The logical path for Platinum identifies A4 as PtF₂.\n\nThe molecular weight of A4 (PtF₂) is ~233 g/mol. This falls into the range of 220-240.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Identify Element Y using the Mass Percentage of Fluorine in A2**\n\nThe most reliable piece of information in the problem is the quantitative data: the mass percentage (ωF) of fluorine in compound A2 is 31.96%.\n\nLet the formula of A2 be YFₙ, where Y is the unknown element, n is the number of fluorine atoms, M(Y) is the molar mass of Y, and M(F) is the molar mass of fluorine (approximately 19.00 g/mol).\n\nThe formula for mass percentage is:\nωF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for M(Y):\n0.3196 = (n × 19.00) / (M(Y) + n × 19.00)\n0.3196 × M(Y) + 0.3196 × (n × 19.00) = n × 19.00\n0.3196 × M(Y) = (1 - 0.3196) × n × 19.00\n0.3196 × M(Y) = 0.6804 × n × 19.00\nM(Y) = (12.9276 / 0.3196) × n\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nNow, we test integer values for n to find a plausible element Y that is known to form multiple fluorides.\n*   n = 1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (e.g., Ca, Ar). Unlikely chemistry.\n*   n = 2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (e.g., Br, Kr).\n*   n = 3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is an extremely close match for **Antimony (Sb)**, which has a molar mass of 121.76 g/mol.\n*   n = 4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol. No common element fits well.\n*   n = 5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (e.g., Au, Pt).\n*   n = 6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (e.g., Pu, Am).\n\nLet's verify the mass percentage for the best candidate, Antimony (Sb), with n=3.\nIf A2 is SbF₃:\nωF(SbF₃) = (3 × 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 × 19.00) = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%.\nThis value is extremely close to the given 31.96% (an error of only 0.25%), making it the most probable identification. Therefore, **Y is Antimony (Sb)** and **A2 is SbF₃**.\n\n**2. Identify the Candidates for A4**\n\nThe problem states that five binary compounds of fluorine with Y (Antimony) are known. The most common and stable binary fluorides of antimony are SbF₃ and SbF₅. It is highly probable that A4 is one of these two compounds.\n\n**3. Determine A4 by Matching Molecular Weight to the Options**\n\nWe will now calculate the molecular weights of the two candidates for A4 and see which one fits into the provided answer ranges.\n\n*   **Candidate 1: A4 = SbF₅**\n    Molecular Weight (MW) = M(Sb) + 5 × M(F) = 121.76 + 5 × 19.00 = **216.76 g/mol**.\n    This value does not fall into any of the given ranges. It is close to range A (220-240), but it is outside of it.\n\n*   **Candidate 2: A4 = SbF₃**\n    Molecular Weight (MW) = M(Sb) + 3 × M(F) = 121.76 + 3 × 19.00 = **178.76 g/mol**.\n    This value falls perfectly within the range **C) 160-180**.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe identification of Y as Antimony is strongly supported by the mass percentage data. Following this, the molecular weight of SbF₃ is a perfect match for one of the answer choices, while the molecular weight of SbF₅ is not. In such problems, where qualitative descriptions may be flawed or ambiguous (e.g., the color of A1, the 1:1 reaction stoichiometry), the quantitative data provides the most reliable path to the solution.\n\nTherefore, A4 is SbF₃, and its molecular weight is approximately 178.8 g/mol.\n\nThe range in which the molecular weight of substance A4 falls is 160-180.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis is a complex chemistry problem with several clues, some of which are contradictory, requiring careful evaluation to find the most consistent solution.\n\n### Step 1: Initial Analysis of Element Y from Mass Percentage\n\nThe most quantitative clue is that substance A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. We can use this to estimate the molar mass of the unknown element Y, assuming a formula of YFₙ for A2.\n\nThe formula relating the molar masses is: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n.\n\nBy testing integer values for n (the oxidation state), we can identify potential candidates for Y:\n*   **n=2**: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. Candidates: Bromine (Br, 79.9) or Krypton (Kr, 83.8).\n*   **n=3**: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. Candidate: Antimony (Sb, 121.8). The calculated ɷF for SbF₃ is 31.88%, an excellent match.\n*   **n=5**: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol. Candidates: Gold (Au, 197.0) or Platinum (Pt, 195.1).\n*   **n=6**: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. Candidates: Plutonium (Pu, 244) or Americium (Am, 243). The calculated ɷF for AmF₆ is 31.93%, another excellent match.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluating Candidates with Qualitative Clues\n\nWe must now use the other clues to narrow down the possibilities. The most discriminating clues are:\n1.  **\"Five binary compounds... are known.\"**\n2.  **\"A1 is a bright-red substance.\"**\n3.  **\"A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.\"**\n4.  **\"A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 and fluorine.\"** (A1 → A2 + F₂)\n5.  **\"Y + A4 → A5 in a 1:1 molar ratio.\"** (Suggests a comproportionation like Y + YFₙ → 2YFₙ/₂)\n\nLet's evaluate the strongest candidates:\n\n*   **Antimony (Sb):** While the mass percentage for A2=SbF₃ is a near-perfect fit, this hypothesis fails on almost all other points. SbF₅ (the only candidate for A1) is colorless, not red; it is stable at 293 K; it does not oxidize xenon metal; and antimony only forms two simple binary fluorides (SbF₃, SbF₅), not five. This path is inconsistent.\n\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** This hypothesis is plausible. A1=KrF₄ decomposes to A2=KrF₂. KrF₄ is a powerful oxidant. The reaction `Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂` fits the 1:1 ratio, identifying A4 as KrF₄ (MW ≈ 159.8 g/mol, range B). However, this hypothesis fails on two key points: only two binary fluorides of Kr are known, not five, and KrF₄ is a colorless solid, not bright-red.\n\n*   **Platinum (Pt):** This hypothesis provides the best fit for the qualitative clues.\n    *   **A1 = PtF₆**: This compound is famously a dark-red solid, is thermally unstable, and was the first chemical to oxidize xenon (the Bartlett reaction). This perfectly matches the description of A1.\n    *   **A1 → A2 + F₂**: The decomposition `2PtF₆ → 2PtF₅ + F₂` is known. This identifies **A2 as PtF₅**.\n    *   **Mass % Check**: The fluorine percentage in PtF₅ is ~32.7%, which is reasonably close to the given 31.96%. In such problems, a small discrepancy is common when the qualitative clues fit so perfectly.\n    *   **Five Compounds**: Platinum is known to form at least four binary fluorides (PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, PtF₆), making the existence of a fifth plausible.\n    *   **1:1 Reaction**: The reaction `Y + A4 → A5` suggests a comproportionation. We need to find a platinum fluoride (A4) whose molecular weight fits one of the options.\n        *   MW(PtF₂) ≈ 233.1 g/mol. This falls in the range **220-240**.\n        *   MW(PtF₄) ≈ 271.1 g/mol. (Not in any range).\n        *   MW(PtF₆) ≈ 309.1 g/mol. (Not in any range).\n    *   The only option that works is **A4 = PtF₂**. The reaction `Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF` fits the 1:1 reactant ratio, and the product A5=PtF would be expected to decompose in water.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Platinum hypothesis provides the most coherent explanation for all the clues, especially the very specific chemical properties of substance A1. The minor discrepancy in the mass percentage is less significant than the multiple, direct contradictions faced by other hypotheses.\n\n1.  **Element Y** is **Platinum (Pt)**.\n2.  **Substance A4** is **Platinum(II) fluoride (PtF₂)**.\n3.  The molecular weight of A4 (PtF₂) is ~233.1 g/mol.\n4.  This value falls within the range **220-240**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis problem is a complex chemical puzzle with several clues, some of which may be inconsistent or designed to be misleading. A careful step-by-step analysis is required to find the most logical solution.\n\n**1. Analysis of Clues**\n\n*   **Clue 1: Mass Percentage of Fluorine in A2 (ɷF = 31.96%)**\n    This is a quantitative clue. The formula `M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n` relates the molar mass of element Y to the number of fluorine atoms (n) in compound A2.\n    *   For n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol, which is an excellent match for **Antimony (Sb)**. The theoretical ɷF in SbF₃ is 31.88%.\n    *   For n=6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol, which is an excellent match for **Americium (Am)**. The theoretical ɷF in AmF₆ is 31.93%.\n    *   Other candidates like Platinum (Pt) and Gold (Au) give a reasonable fit for n=5 (A2 = PtF₅ or AuF₅, with ɷF ≈ 32.7% and 32.5% respectively).\n\n*   **Clue 2: Chemical Properties of A1 and A3**\n    *   \"A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.\"\n    *   \"A3 can also interact with xenon.\"\n    This points to an element that forms extremely powerful oxidizing agents. This is a hallmark of platinum-group metals (like Pt, Ru), gold, and higher actinide fluorides. Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅) is a very strong Lewis acid that reacts with xenon *fluorides*, but it does not oxidize xenon metal itself under normal conditions. This makes the Sb hypothesis chemically weak.\n\n*   **Clue 3: Properties of A1**\n    *   \"bright-red substance\"\n    *   \"decomposes at 293 K into A2 and fluorine\"\n    This describes a highly unstable, colored, higher fluoride.\n    *   **Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆)** is a dark-red solid, unstable, decomposes to PtF₅, and famously oxidizes xenon. This is a perfect match for A1.\n    *   **Gold(V) fluoride (AuF₅)** and its related species are red, unstable, and oxidize xenon. This is also a very strong match.\n    *   The Sb hypothesis fails here, as SbF₅ is a colorless, stable liquid.\n\n*   **Clue 4: The 1:1 Reaction to form A5**\n    *   \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    This strongly suggests a comproportionation reaction of the type `M + MF_{2n} → 2MF_n`. The 1:1 molar ratio of reactants is key.\n\n**2. Evaluating the Hypotheses**\n\n*   **Antimony (Sb) Hypothesis:** While it has the best numerical fit for the mass percentage, it fails on the crucial chemical properties of A1 (color, stability, reaction with xenon). It is likely a numerical trap.\n\n*   **Platinum (Pt) Hypothesis:** This hypothesis is very strong.\n    *   Y = Platinum (Pt).\n    *   A1 = PtF₆ (dark-red, unstable, oxidizes Xe).\n    *   A2 = PtF₅ (product of A1 decomposition; %F is reasonably close).\n    *   A3 = PtF₆ (product of fluorination of Pt; oxidizes Xe).\n    *   The 1:1 reaction `Pt + A4 → A5` can be interpreted as `Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF`. This identifies **A4 = PtF₂**.\n    *   Let's calculate the molecular weight of A4 = PtF₂:\n        MW(PtF₂) ≈ 195.08 + 2 * 19.00 = **233.08 g/mol**.\n\n*   **Gold (Au) Hypothesis:** This is also a very strong hypothesis, similar to Platinum.\n    *   Y = Gold (Au).\n    *   A1 = A higher gold fluoride (e.g., AuF₅ or a complex), which is red, unstable, and oxidizes xenon.\n    *   A2 = AuF₅ (%F is reasonably close).\n    *   The 1:1 reaction `Au + A4 → A5` can be interpreted as `Au + AuF₂ → 2AuF`. This identifies **A4 = AuF₂**.\n    *   Let's calculate the molecular weight of A4 = AuF₂:\n        MW(AuF₂) ≈ 196.97 + 2 * 19.00 = **234.97 g/mol**.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nBoth the Platinum and Gold hypotheses are chemically sound and consistent with the clues. Crucially, both point to the same conclusion for A4: it is the difluoride of the element (PtF₂ or AuF₂). The molecular weights in both cases are very similar:\n*   MW(PtF₂) ≈ 233 g/mol\n*   MW(AuF₂) ≈ 235 g/mol\n\nBoth of these values fall squarely within the range **220-240 g/mol**.\n\nLet's check the given options:\nA) 220-240\nB) 110-130\nC) 160-180\nD) 140-160\n\nThe most logical and chemically consistent derivation leads to a molecular weight for A4 that is in the range of 220-240.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis is a complex chemical puzzle with multiple constraints, some of which appear to be contradictory. A careful step-by-step analysis is required, prioritizing the most reliable clues.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y using the mass percentage of Fluorine in A2.**\n\nThe most reliable starting point is the quantitative data. Substance A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ. The molar mass of element Y, M(Y), can be calculated using the formula:\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nWe test integer values for 'n' to find a plausible element:\n*   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Krypton (Kr, 83.8 g/mol) or Bromine (Br, 79.9 g/mol).\n    *   For KrF₂, the theoretical ɷF is 31.2%. This is a reasonable match.\n*   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is an excellent match for Antimony (Sb, 121.76 g/mol).\n    *   For SbF₃, the theoretical ɷF is 31.88%. This is a very close match.\n*   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is an excellent match for Americium (Am, 243 g/mol) or Plutonium (Pu, 244 g/mol).\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the candidates using the other clues.**\n\nThe problem contains several clues that can help distinguish between these possibilities. The most unique and restrictive clues are:\n1.  **The 1:1 molar ratio reaction:** \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" This describes the reaction `Y + A4 → A5`. A comproportionation reaction of the type `M + MF₂ₓ → 2MFₓ` fits this 1:1 reactant stoichiometry perfectly.\n2.  **Reactivity with Xenon:** A1 and A3 are powerful enough oxidizing agents to react with xenon.\n\nLet's test the most promising hypotheses:\n\n*   **Antimony (Sb) Hypothesis:** While the mass percentage for SbF₃ is an excellent match for A2, this hypothesis fails to explain the 1:1 reaction. The known comproportionation is `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃`, which is not a 1:1 ratio of reactants. It also fails to explain the \"five binary compounds\" and the properties of A1.\n\n*   **Actinide (Am/Pu) Hypothesis:** This fits the mass percentage and the \"five binary compounds\" clue well. The comproportionation reaction `Am + AmF₄ → 2AmF₂` also fits the 1:1 stoichiometry. However, the calculated molecular weight of A4 (AmF₄, MW ≈ 319 g/mol) does not fall into any of the provided answer ranges.\n\n*   **Krypton (Kr) Hypothesis:** This hypothesis provides the most consistent explanation, despite some minor discrepancies.\n    *   **Mass Percentage:** The match for A2=KrF₂ (31.2%) is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n    *   **Reactivity:** A1 (a higher fluoride, KrF₄) and A3 (KrF₂) are known to be powerful oxidizing agents capable of reacting with xenon.\n    *   **1:1 Reaction:** The reaction `Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂` is a known comproportionation that perfectly matches the `Y + A4 → A5` stoichiometry with a 1:1 reactant ratio.\n    *   **Identification of A4:** This reaction unambiguously identifies **A4 as KrF₄** and A5 as KrF₂.\n    *   **Other Clues:** A5 (KrF₂) is known to decompose in water. The main contradictions are the \"five binary compounds\" clue (Krypton only has two) and the \"bright-red\" color of A1 (KrF₄ is colorless). In such problems, it is common for some qualitative descriptions to be inaccurate or serve as red herrings. The unique reaction stoichiometry is a much stronger clue.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4 and Determine the Range.**\n\nBased on the most consistent hypothesis, A4 is Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄).\n*   Molar Mass of Krypton (Kr) ≈ 83.80 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 (KrF₄) = 83.80 + (4 × 19.00) = 159.80 g/mol.\n\nThis value falls within the range of **140-160 g/mol**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis is a complex chemical puzzle with several clues, some of which are contradictory. A careful step-by-step analysis is required to find the most plausible solution.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y from the Mass Percentage of Fluorine in A2**\n\nThe problem states that substance A2 is a binary fluoride of element Y (formula YFₙ) with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. We can establish a relationship between the molar mass of Y (M(Y)) and the number of fluorine atoms (n).\n\n*   The formula for mass percentage is: ɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n*   Using M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol and ɷF = 0.3196, we can solve for M(Y):\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nWe test integer values for 'n' to find a plausible element:\n*   **n=2**: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Krypton (Kr, M=83.8 g/mol). The theoretical ɷF in KrF₂ is 31.2%, which is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n*   **n=3**: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is extremely close to Antimony (Sb, M=121.76 g/mol). The theoretical ɷF in SbF₃ is 31.88%, an almost perfect match.\n\nThis leaves us with two strong candidates for Y: Krypton and Antimony.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the Candidates using the Chemical Reaction Clues**\n\nThe problem provides several qualitative clues. The most specific and restrictive one is the reaction used to form A5: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n\nThis describes a comproportionation reaction: **Y + A4 → A5** (with a 1:1 reactant ratio).\n\n*   **If Y = Antimony (Sb):** The known comproportionation reaction is `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃`. This reaction does not have a 1:1 molar ratio of reactants. No other common 1:1 reaction fits the description. Therefore, the Antimony hypothesis fails to explain this crucial chemical clue.\n\n*   **If Y = Krypton (Kr):** A known comproportionation reaction is **`Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂`**. This reaction has a perfect 1:1 molar ratio between the reactants, Krypton (Y) and Krypton tetrafluoride (A4). This is a perfect fit for the description.\n\nBecause the Krypton hypothesis provides a perfect explanation for the unique reaction stoichiometry, it is the more robust and likely intended solution, despite the minor discrepancy in the mass percentage and other qualitative clues (like the color of A1).\n\n**Step 3: Identify A4 and Calculate its Molecular Weight**\n\nBased on the Krypton hypothesis and the 1:1 reaction, we can confidently identify the compounds:\n*   Element Y = **Krypton (Kr)**\n*   Reactant A4 = **Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄)**\n*   Product A5 = **Krypton difluoride (KrF₂)**\n\nThe question asks for the molecular weight range of substance A4.\n*   A4 = KrF₄\n*   Molecular Weight (MW) of KrF₄ = M(Kr) + 4 × M(F)\n*   MW(KrF₄) ≈ 83.80 g/mol + 4 × 19.00 g/mol = 83.80 + 76.00 = **159.80 g/mol**\n\n**Step 4: Match the Molecular Weight to the Given Options**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of A4 is 159.80 g/mol. We compare this to the provided ranges:\nA) 160-180\nB) 220-240\nC) 110-130\nD) 140-160\n\nThe value 159.80 g/mol falls squarely within the range of 140-160.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the unknown element Y using the mass percentage of fluorine in compound A2.**\n\nThe problem states that compound A2 contains 31.96% fluorine by mass (ωF = 0.3196). Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ. The relationship between the molar mass of Y (M(Y)), the molar mass of fluorine (M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol), and the number of fluorine atoms (n) is given by:\n\nM(Y) = [(1 / ωF) - 1] * n * M(F)\nM(Y) ≈ [(1 / 0.3196) - 1] * n * 19.00\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\nWe test integer values of 'n' to find a plausible element:\n*   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Krypton (Kr, M=83.8 g/mol).\n*   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to Antimony (Sb, M=121.76 g/mol).\n*   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is close to Americium (Am, M≈243 g/mol) or Plutonium (Pu, M≈244 g/mol).\n\nLet's check the theoretical mass percentages for the best candidates:\n*   For KrF₂: ωF = (2 * 19.00) / (83.8 + 38.0) ≈ 31.2%. This is a plausible match.\n*   For SbF₃: ωF = (3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 57.0) ≈ 31.88%. This is an excellent match.\n*   For AmF₆: ωF = (6 * 19.00) / (243 + 114) ≈ 31.93%. This is an excellent match.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the candidates using the chemical properties described.**\n\nThe problem contains several clues, but the most structurally defining one is the 1:1 molar ratio reaction to form A5: `Y + A4 → A5`. This strongly suggests a comproportionation reaction where the element in its zero oxidation state reacts with a higher fluoride. A reaction of the type `M + MFₓ → 2MFₓ/₂` has a 1:1 molar ratio of reactants.\n\nLet's test our candidates against this and other clues:\n\n*   **Antimony (Sb):** The known comproportionation reaction is `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃`. This is not a 1:1 ratio. Furthermore, A1 is described as bright-red and unstable at 293K, while the higher fluoride SbF₅ is a stable, colorless liquid. This hypothesis fails on key chemical properties.\n*   **Americium (Am):** The reaction `Am + AmF₄ → 2AmF₂` fits the 1:1 stoichiometry. This would identify A4 as AmF₄. The molecular weight of AmF₄ is 243 + 4*19 = 319 g/mol. This value does not fall into any of the provided answer ranges. This hypothesis leads to a dead end.\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** The reaction `Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂` is a known comproportionation that fits the 1:1 molar ratio perfectly. This identifies **A4 as KrF₄** and A5 as KrF₂. Let's check the other clues with this assignment:\n    *   A1 decomposes to A2 and fluorine: `KrF₄ → KrF₂ + F₂`. This would mean A1 is KrF₄ and A2 is KrF₂. This is consistent.\n    *   A1 oxidizes xenon: KrF₄ is an exceptionally strong oxidizing agent. This fits.\n    *   A3 is formed by fluorinating Y and interacts with xenon: `Kr + F₂ → KrF₂`. KrF₂ is also a powerful oxidizer. This fits.\n    *   A5 decomposes in water: KrF₂ hydrolyzes in water. This fits.\n\nThe Krypton hypothesis provides a chemically consistent explanation for all the reaction steps. The only inconsistencies are the \"five binary compounds\" (only two are well-known) and the \"bright-red\" color of A1 (KrF₄ is colorless). In complex problems of this type, it is common for some physical descriptions or background facts to be erroneous or intended as red herrings, while the reaction chemistry provides the true path to the solution.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the molecular weight of A4 and select the correct range.**\n\nBased on the most consistent chemical pathway, substance A4 is Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄).\n\n*   Molar mass of Krypton (Kr) ≈ 83.8 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.0 g/mol\n*   Molecular weight of A4 (KrF₄) = M(Kr) + 4 * M(F) = 83.8 + 4 * 19.0 = 159.8 g/mol.\n\nThis calculated molecular weight of 159.8 g/mol falls within the range of 140-160.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided clues and candidate answers, the most chemically consistent solution identifies the element Y as Krypton (Kr).\n\n1.  **Mass Percentage:** The mass percentage of fluorine in A2 (31.96%) is reasonably close to the theoretical value for Krypton difluoride, KrF₂ (31.2%). While other elements like Antimony (Sb) provide a closer numerical match, they lead to significant contradictions with other chemical clues.\n\n2.  **Reaction Stoichiometry:** The most definitive clue is the 1:1 molar ratio reaction: `Y + A4 → A5`. This strongly suggests a comproportionation reaction. The reaction `Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂` perfectly fits this 1:1 reactant stoichiometry. This identifies substance A4 as Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄).\n\n3.  **Other Clues:** This hypothesis requires assuming that the clues about \"five binary compounds\" and the \"bright-red\" color of A1 are either inaccuracies or red herrings, which is common in such complex chemistry puzzles. The Krypton hypothesis provides the most elegant explanation for the core reaction chemistry.\n\n4.  **Molecular Weight Calculation:**\n    *   Element Y is Krypton (Kr).\n    *   Substance A4 is Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄).\n    *   The molecular weight of A4 is calculated as:\n        MW(KrF₄) = M(Kr) + 4 × M(F)\n        MW(KrF₄) ≈ 83.80 g/mol + 4 × 19.00 g/mol\n        MW(KrF₄) ≈ 159.80 g/mol\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The calculated molecular weight of 159.80 g/mol falls squarely within the range of 140-160 g/mol.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis is a complex chemical puzzle with several clues, some of which are contradictory, requiring careful evaluation to determine the most reliable path to the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Initial Analysis of Element Y from Mass Percentage\n\nThe first quantitative clue is that substance A2 has a mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ. The relationship between the molar mass of element Y, M(Y), and the number of fluorine atoms, n, is given by:\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nTesting integer values for n gives us potential candidates for element Y:\n*   **n=2**: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Krypton (Kr, 83.8 g/mol). The theoretical ɷF for KrF₂ is 31.2%, which is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n*   **n=3**: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. This is an excellent match for Antimony (Sb, 121.8 g/mol). The theoretical ɷF for SbF₃ is 31.88%, an almost perfect match.\n*   **n=6**: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is an excellent match for Americium (Am, 243 g/mol) or Plutonium (Pu, 244 g/mol). The theoretical ɷF for AmF₆ is 31.93%.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluating Candidates with Chemical Clues\n\nWe must use the other chemical clues to distinguish between these possibilities. The most specific and unusual clue is the reaction to form A5: *\"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"*\n\nThis describes a comproportionation reaction with a 1:1 stoichiometry for the reactants:\nY + A4 → A5\n\nLet's test our best candidates against this clue:\n*   **Antimony (Sb) Hypothesis**: If Y is Sb, the known fluorides are SbF₃ and SbF₅. The comproportionation reaction is 2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃. This does not have a 1:1 molar ratio. This hypothesis fails to explain this key reaction.\n*   **Americium (Am) Hypothesis**: If Y is Am, the reaction Am + AmF₄ → 2AmF₂ has a 1:1 reactant ratio. This would identify A4 as AmF₄. However, the molecular weight of AmF₄ is ~319 g/mol, which does not fall into any of the provided answer ranges.\n*   **Krypton (Kr) Hypothesis**: If Y is Kr, the known binary fluorides are KrF₂ and KrF₄. The reaction **Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂** is a known comproportionation with a perfect **1:1 molar ratio** of reactants. This provides an elegant and precise explanation for the reaction clue.\n\n### Step 3: Consolidating the Krypton Hypothesis\n\nBy prioritizing the unique reaction stoichiometry, we can build a consistent, albeit not perfect, model:\n*   **Element Y**: Krypton (Kr).\n*   **A2**: KrF₂ (from the mass percentage calculation, 31.2% is a plausible match).\n*   **A1**: A substance that decomposes into A2 (KrF₂) and fluorine. This must be KrF₄. The description of A1 as \"bright-red\" is a likely inaccuracy in the problem statement, as KrF₄ is colorless. However, its extreme instability and ability to oxidize xenon are correct.\n*   **A3**: Obtained by fluorination of Kr, it must be KrF₂. KrF₂ is a powerful enough oxidant to interact with xenon.\n*   **A4**: Identified from the 1:1 reaction `Kr + A4 → A5`. As shown above, **A4 is KrF₄**.\n*   **A5**: The product of the reaction is **KrF₂**. The final clue, that A5 decomposes in water, is also correct for KrF₂ (KrF₂ + H₂O → Kr + ½O₂ + 2HF).\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Molecular Weight of A4\n\nBased on the deduction that A4 is Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄), we can calculate its molecular weight:\n*   Molar Mass of Krypton (Kr) ≈ 83.80 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 (KrF₄) = 83.80 + (4 × 19.00) = 159.80 g/mol.\n\nThis value falls within the range of **140-160**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe analysis identified the unknown element Y as Platinum (Pt). This conclusion was reached because the properties of its fluorides align best with the problem's clues. Specifically, Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆) matches the description of compound A1 as a red, unstable substance that famously oxidizes xenon.\n\nBased on this identification, the reaction \"Y + A4 -> A5\" in a 1:1 molar ratio was interpreted as a comproportionation reaction: `Pt + PtF₂ -> 2PtF`. This established compound A4 as Platinum(II) fluoride (PtF₂).\n\nThe molecular weight of A4 (PtF₂) was calculated to be approximately 233.08 g/mol. This value falls within the range of 220-240 g/mol, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nThis is a complex chemical puzzle with several clues, some of which can be misleading or contain minor inaccuracies, which is common in chemistry olympiad problems. A careful step-by-step analysis, prioritizing the most reliable chemical and quantitative information, is required.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Mass Percentage of Fluorine in A2\n\nThe most crucial quantitative clue is that substance A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ. The molar mass of element Y, M(Y), can be related to n (the number of fluorine atoms) using the molar mass of fluorine (M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol).\n\nThe formula is: ɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n\nRearranging for M(Y), we get: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nWe must test integer values of 'n' to find a plausible element Y that is known to form multiple, highly reactive fluorides.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Candidate Elements\n\n*   **n=3, Y=Antimony (Sb):** M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. The atomic mass of Sb is 121.76 g/mol. The fluorine percentage in SbF₃ is 31.88%, an excellent match. However, the properties of A1 (bright-red, unstable at 293K, oxidizes Xe) do not match SbF₅. This path has a major contradiction.\n*   **n=2, Y=Krypton (Kr):** M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. The atomic mass of Kr is 83.8 g/mol. The fluorine percentage in KrF₂ is 31.2%, a reasonable match. However, Kr only forms two well-known binary fluorides (not five), and A1 (KrF₄) is colorless, not red. This path also has major contradictions.\n*   **n=5 or n=6, Y=Noble Metal or Actinide:** This leads to elements like Gold (Au), Platinum (Pt), or Americium (Am). These elements are known to form multiple, colored, highly reactive fluorides capable of oxidizing xenon.\n    *   For **Y=Platinum (Pt)**, let's test its fluorides. The mass percentage of fluorine in **PtF₅** is 32.75%. This is a reasonably close match to the given 31.96%. Let's assume **A2 = PtF₅**.\n    *   For **Y=Gold (Au)**, the mass percentage of fluorine in **AuF₅** is 32.54%. This is also a very close match. Let's assume **A2 = AuF₅**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with Other Chemical Clues (Assuming Y = Pt or Au)\n\nLet's proceed with the Platinum/Gold hypothesis, as it aligns best with the qualitative clues.\n\n*   **Clue: \"Five binary compounds... are known.\"** Both Pt and Au fit this well.\n*   **Clue: \"A1 is a bright-red substance... decomposes... oxidizes xenon.\"**\n    *   If Y=Pt and A2=PtF₅, then A1 must be a higher fluoride. **PtF₆** is a dark-red solid, is unstable, and is famous for being the first compound to oxidize xenon. This is a perfect fit.\n    *   If Y=Au and A2=AuF₅, then A1 could be a higher fluoride complex. AuF₅ itself is red and a powerful oxidizer. This is also a very good fit.\n*   **Clue: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to... A4, A5 can be obtained.\"** This strongly suggests a comproportionation reaction. For a 1:1 reactant ratio, the reaction is typically of the form: **Y + YFₙ → 2YFₙ/₂**. This means A4 must be a fluoride with an even number of fluorine atoms (n).\n\n### Step 4: Identify A4 and Determine its Molecular Weight\n\nWe need to find a plausible compound A4 (PtFₙ or AuFₙ where n is even) whose molecular weight falls into one of the given ranges.\n\n*   **If Y = Platinum (Pt):** The candidates for A4 are PtF₂, PtF₄, and PtF₆.\n    *   MW(PtF₆) ≈ 309 g/mol (No match)\n    *   MW(PtF₄) ≈ 271 g/mol (No match)\n    *   **MW(PtF₂) ≈ 195.08 + 2 * 19.00 = 233.08 g/mol.** This value falls squarely in the range **220-240**.\n\n*   **If Y = Gold (Au):** The candidates for A4 could include AuF₂.\n    *   **MW(AuF₂) ≈ 196.97 + 2 * 19.00 = 234.97 g/mol.** This value also falls squarely in the range **220-240**.\n\nBoth the Platinum and Gold hypotheses are chemically sound and independently point to the same conclusion: A4 is a difluoride (PtF₂ or AuF₂) with a molecular weight around 233-235 g/mol. This molecular weight falls into the range of 220-240 g/mol.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe most consistent and logical deduction identifies element Y as either Platinum or Gold. In either case, substance A4 is identified as the corresponding difluoride (PtF₂ or AuF₂), whose molecular weight is approximately 233-235 g/mol. This value is within the 220-240 range.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nThis problem is a complex chemical puzzle with several clues, some of which may be contradictory or intended to mislead. A careful step-by-step analysis is required to determine the most plausible solution.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Mass Percentage of Fluorine in A2\n\nThe problem states that substance A2 has a mass percentage of fluorine (ωF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ. The relationship between the molar mass of element Y, M(Y), and the number of fluorine atoms, n, can be derived as follows:\n\nωF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n0.3196 = (n × 19.00) / (M(Y) + n × 19.00)\n\nSolving for M(Y), we get the approximation:\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nWe can test integer values of 'n' to find plausible elements:\n*   **n=2**: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (e.g., Bromine, Krypton)\n*   **n=3**: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (e.g., Antimony). The fluorine percentage in SbF₃ is 31.88%, a very close match.\n*   **n=5**: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (e.g., Gold, Platinum). The fluorine percentage in AuF₅ is 32.54%, and in PtF₅ is 32.75%, both reasonably close.\n*   **n=6**: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (e.g., Plutonium, Americium). The fluorine percentage in AmF₆ is 31.93%, an almost perfect match.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Candidates Using Chemical Properties\n\nThe qualitative clues are crucial for distinguishing between the candidates identified above.\n\n*   **Clue**: \"A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.\" This points to an element that forms exceptionally strong oxidizing agents. This is a hallmark of noble metals like Gold (Au) and Platinum (Pt), and actinides like Americium (Am), as well as Krypton (Kr). Antimony (Sb) is a weaker candidate on this point.\n*   **Clue**: \"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\" This strongly supports Americium (AmF₂, AmF₃, AmF₄, AmF₅, AmF₆) and is plausible for Gold (AuF, AuF₂, AuF₃, AuF₅, and AuF₇-related species) and Platinum. It is a major point of failure for Antimony (only two common fluorides) and Krypton (only two).\n*   **Clue**: \"A1 is a bright-red substance\" that decomposes. AuF₅ is red, and PtF₆ is dark-red. This fits the Gold/Platinum path well.\n*   **Clue**: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to... A4, A5 can be obtained.\" This suggests a comproportionation reaction. A reaction of the type `Y + YF₂ₙ → 2YFₙ` fits this 1:1 reactant stoichiometry.\n\n### Step 3: Synthesize the Clues to Identify A4\n\nThe Americium (Am) hypothesis is chemically very consistent but leads to a molecular weight for A4 (AmF₄, MW ≈ 319) that is not among the options. This suggests a flaw in the problem's options, but we must find the best fit among the choices provided.\n\nThe Gold (Au) and Platinum (Pt) hypotheses are the next most plausible. Let's follow the Gold path:\n1.  **Y = Gold (Au)**.\n2.  **A2 = AuF₅**. The mass percentage (32.54%) is a reasonable fit for the given 31.96%.\n3.  **A1** is a higher, unstable red fluoride that decomposes to A2 (AuF₅), consistent with gold's chemistry.\n4.  The reaction `Y + A4 → A5` becomes `Au + A4 → A5`. For this to be a 1:1 comproportionation, a plausible reaction is `Au + AuF₂ → 2AuF`.\n5.  This identifies **A4 as AuF₂** and **A5 as AuF**. The final clue, that A5 decomposes in water, is consistent with the chemistry of AuF.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4\n\nBased on the deduction that A4 is Gold(II) fluoride (AuF₂), we can calculate its molecular weight:\n*   Molar Mass of Gold (Au) ≈ 196.97 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n*   Molecular Weight of AuF₂ = 196.97 + (2 × 19.00) = 234.97 g/mol.\n\n### Step 5: Match the Molecular Weight to the Given Range\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 234.97 g/mol falls squarely within the range given in option B.\n\n*   A) 110-130\n*   **B) 220-240**\n*   C) 160-180\n*   D) 140-160\n\nThis provides a complete and consistent solution that, despite the problem's inherent difficulties, leads to one of the provided answers.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "This is a complex chemistry puzzle with multiple clues, some of which are contradictory. To find the most logical solution, we must evaluate the different possible identities of element Y and see which one provides the most consistent explanation.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Mass Percentage of Fluorine in A2\n\nThe problem states that substance A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. If we assume the formula of A2 is YFₙ, we can calculate the approximate molar mass of element Y (M(Y)) based on the number of fluorine atoms (n):\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nThis calculation gives us several potential candidates for Y:\n*   **n=2**: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (e.g., Krypton, Kr). For KrF₂, the theoretical ɷF is 31.2%, which is a reasonable match.\n*   **n=3**: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol (e.g., Antimony, Sb). For SbF₃, the theoretical ɷF is 31.88%, an excellent match.\n*   **n=5**: M(Y) ≈ 202.3 g/mol (e.g., Platinum, Pt; Gold, Au). For PtF₅, the theoretical ɷF is 32.75%, a reasonable match.\n*   **n=6**: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (e.g., Americium, Am; Plutonium, Pu). For AmF₆, the theoretical ɷF is 31.93%, an excellent match.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Candidates with Qualitative Chemical Clues\n\nWe must use the other clues to distinguish between these candidates. The most specific and unusual clues are:\n1.  **\"A1 is a bright-red substance\"** that **\"oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.\"**\n2.  **\"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\"**\n3.  **\"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to... A4, A5 can be obtained.\"** This suggests a comproportionation reaction of the type `Y + YFₙ → 2YFₙ/₂`.\n\nLet's evaluate the strongest hypotheses:\n\n*   **The Antimony (Sb) Hypothesis:** While the mass percentage match is excellent, this hypothesis fails on all other key points. A1 (SbF₅) is a colorless liquid, not a red solid; it does not oxidize xenon metal; and Sb only forms two common binary fluorides, not five. This path is inconsistent.\n\n*   **The Krypton (Kr) Hypothesis:** This path provides a perfect explanation for the 1:1 reaction (`Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂`), which identifies A4 as KrF₄ (MW ≈ 159.8 g/mol, fitting the 140-160 range). However, this hypothesis contradicts two major clues: Krypton only has two known binary fluorides, not five, and A1 (KrF₄) is a colorless solid, not bright-red.\n\n*   **The Platinum (Pt) / Gold (Au) Hypothesis:** This path provides the best fit for the qualitative chemical properties.\n    *   **A1 Properties:** Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆) is a dark-red solid, is unstable, and is famous for being the first compound to oxidize xenon. This is a perfect match for the description of A1. Gold's higher fluorides have similar properties.\n    *   **Number of Compounds:** Both Pt and Au are known to form multiple binary fluorides, making the \"five compounds\" clue plausible.\n    *   **Decomposition:** The decomposition `PtF₆ → PtF₅ + ½F₂` identifies A2 as PtF₅. The mass percentage of fluorine in PtF₅ (32.75%) is reasonably close to the given 31.96%. A small error in the quantitative data is common in such problems when the qualitative clues fit so well.\n    *   **1:1 Reaction:** The reaction `Y + A4 → A5` can be interpreted as a comproportionation. A plausible reaction is `Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF`. This identifies **A4 as PtF₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4 and Conclude\n\nBased on the Platinum/Gold hypothesis, which provides the most chemically consistent narrative, substance A4 is the difluoride (PtF₂ or AuF₂). Let's calculate its molecular weight:\n\n*   **MW(PtF₂) = M(Pt) + 2 × M(F) ≈ 195.08 + 2 × 19.00 = 233.08 g/mol.**\n*   **MW(AuF₂) = M(Au) + 2 × M(F) ≈ 196.97 + 2 × 19.00 = 234.97 g/mol.**\n\nBoth calculations yield a molecular weight of approximately 233-235 g/mol. This value falls squarely within the range of **220-240 g/mol**.\n\nThis conclusion is the most robust because it aligns with the majority of the specific and unusual chemical properties described, which are often the intended keys to solving such puzzles.\n\n<<<B>>>"

The key is to identify element Y and its fluorides (A1-A5) and then determine the molecular weight of A4.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the most likely solution paths:\n\n### Step 1: Initial Analysis of Element Y\n\nThe first step is to use the mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF = 31.96%) in compound A2 to identify the element Y. The molar mass of Y, M(Y), can be related to the number of fluorine atoms (n) in A2 (YFₙ) by the formula:\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nTesting integer values for n reveals several potential candidates for Y:\n*   **n=2:** M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (e.g., Krypton, Kr, if A2=KrF₂; ɷF ≈ 31.2%)\n*   **n=3:** M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol (e.g., Antimony, Sb, if A2=SbF₃; ɷF ≈ 31.9%)\n*   **n=5 or 6:** M(Y) is in the range of heavy metals like Pt, Au, or actinides like Am, Pu. For example, for AmF₆, ɷF ≈ 31.93%. For PtF₅, ɷF ≈ 32.75%.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluating Candidates with Chemical Clues\n\nWe must use the other chemical clues to narrow down the possibilities. The most revealing clues are:\n1.  **Five binary compounds** of fluorine with Y are known.\n2.  A1 is a **bright-red substance** that **oxidizes xenon**.\n3.  A5 is formed by adding Y to A4 in a **1:1 molar ratio**.\n\nLet's evaluate the strongest hypotheses presented by the candidate answers:\n\n*   **Hypothesis 1: Y is Antimony (Sb)**\n    This path is suggested by the excellent match of the mass percentage for A2=SbF₃. The molecular weight of SbF₃ is ~179 g/mol, which fits the **160-180** range perfectly. However, this hypothesis fails on nearly all other chemical clues: Antimony only has two simple binary fluorides (not five), its higher fluoride (SbF₅) is colorless and stable (not red and unstable), and the reaction stoichiometry is incorrect. This path prioritizes numerical matching over chemical consistency.\n\n*   **Hypothesis 2: Y is Krypton (Kr)**\n    This path is suggested by the unique 1:1 comproportionation reaction `Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂`, which perfectly matches the description of how A5 is formed from Y and A4. This identifies A4 as KrF₄, with a molecular weight of ~160 g/mol, fitting the **140-160** range. However, this hypothesis contradicts key facts: Krypton has only two known binary fluorides (not five), and KrF₄ is a colorless solid (not bright-red).\n\n*   **Hypothesis 3: Y is Platinum (Pt) or Gold (Au)**\n    This path provides the best fit for the qualitative chemical clues.\n    *   **Five Compounds:** Both Pt and Au are known to form at least five binary fluorides.\n    *   **A1 (red, oxidizes Xe):** PtF₆ is a dark-red solid famous for oxidizing xenon. AuF₅ is a red solid and part of a complex (AuF₇) that is a powerful oxidant. This clue fits perfectly.\n    *   **A2 (from A1's decomposition):** A2 would be PtF₅ or AuF₅. The mass percentage for these (32.75% and 32.54%) is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n    *   **Reaction (Y + A4 → A5, 1:1):** A 1:1 comproportionation reaction like `Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF` is chemically plausible. This would identify **A4 as PtF₂**.\n    *   **Molecular Weight of A4:** The molecular weight of PtF₂ is ~233 g/mol (AuF₂ is ~235 g/mol). This value falls squarely within the **220-240** range.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile the problem contains inconsistencies, the hypothesis that Y is Platinum (or Gold) provides the most chemically sound and coherent explanation. It aligns with the majority of the complex chemical clues (number of compounds, color, and reactivity with xenon). The slight discrepancy in the mass percentage is a more likely flaw in the problem statement than the multiple, significant chemical contradictions in the other hypotheses. The identification of A4 as PtF₂ (or AuF₂) is consistent with the reaction stoichiometry and leads directly to one of the provided answer ranges.\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of substance A4 falls in the range of 220-240 g/mol.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis is a complex chemistry problem with several contradictory clues. To find the most logical solution, we must carefully analyze the different hypotheses presented and determine which one provides the most coherent explanation, even if it requires dismissing some clues as flawed.\n\n### Step 1: Initial Analysis of Element Y\n\nThe primary numerical clue is that substance A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. As shown in most of the provided analyses, this leads to the relationship M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n, where M(Y) is the molar mass of the unknown element Y and n is its oxidation state in compound A2.\n\nThis calculation yields several potential candidates for element Y:\n*   **Antimony (Sb):** For n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is an excellent match for Sb (121.76 g/mol), and the fluorine percentage in SbF₃ (31.88%) is extremely close to the given value.\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** For n=2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is reasonably close to Kr (83.8 g/mol), and the fluorine percentage in KrF₂ (31.2%) is also close to the given value.\n*   **Actinides (Am, Pu):** For n=6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is an excellent match for Am or Pu, and their hexafluorides have the correct fluorine percentage.\n*   **Other elements (Pt, Au, Br):** These are also considered, but the initial mass percentage fit is generally weaker.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluating the Hypotheses\n\nWe must use the other chemical clues to determine the correct element. The most decisive clues are the reaction properties.\n\n*   **The Actinide Hypothesis (Y=Am):** As detailed in Answer 5, this path is chemically very consistent. Americium has five known binary fluorides, its higher fluorides are strong oxidizers, and the comproportionation reaction `Am + AmF₄ → 2AmF₂` fits the 1:1 molar ratio clue. However, this hypothesis fails because the molecular weight of the identified A4 (AmF₄, MW ≈ 319 g/mol) does not fall into any of the provided answer ranges.\n*   **The Antimony Hypothesis (Y=Sb):** This path, favored by Answers 2, 7, and 12, is supported by the near-perfect mass percentage match. However, it contradicts several other key clues: Sb only has two common binary fluorides (not five), SbF₅ (A1) is not red or unstable at 293 K, and the 1:1 reaction `Sb + A4 → A5` is not easily explained by known antimony chemistry. This path requires assuming multiple clues are incorrect.\n*   **The Krypton Hypothesis (Y=Kr):** This path, detailed in Answers 1, 4, and 15, provides the best explanation for the chemical *reactions*. The 1:1 molar ratio clue is perfectly explained by the comproportionation reaction `Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂`. This reaction identifies A4 as KrF₄ and A5 as KrF₂. The reactivity of krypton fluorides with xenon and their decomposition pathways are also consistent with the clues. This hypothesis only requires us to assume that the descriptive clues about the \"bright-red\" color and the \"five\" compounds are flawed, which is common in such problems.\n\n### Step 3: Final Determination\n\nComparing the hypotheses, the Krypton path provides the most elegant and chemically sound explanation for the reaction mechanisms, which are often the core of such puzzles. The contradictions it creates are with descriptive properties that are more likely to be inaccurate or misleading than the specific reaction stoichiometry.\n\nFollowing the Krypton hypothesis:\n1.  Element **Y** is **Krypton (Kr)**.\n2.  The reaction `Y + A4 → A5` in a 1:1 molar ratio is **`Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂`**.\n3.  This identifies substance **A4** as **Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄)**.\n4.  The molecular weight of A4 (KrF₄) is calculated:\n    MW(KrF₄) = M(Kr) + 4 × M(F) ≈ 83.80 + 4 × 19.00 = **159.80 g/mol**.\n5.  This molecular weight falls within the range of **140-160 g/mol**.\n\nThis range corresponds to option A in the list provided by the most thorough analysis (Answer 4).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis is a complex chemical puzzle with several clues, some of which appear to be contradictory.

It strongly supports elements like Platinum, Gold, Ruthenium, and Americium. It argues against Krypton (only 2 known) and Antimony (only 2 common ones).\n    *   **\"A1 is a bright-red substance\"**: This points towards compounds like PtF₆ (dark-red), RuF₆ (red-brown), or AuF₅ (red).

This is a famous property of PtF₆ and is also true for the higher fluorides of Au, Ru, and Kr. It is not true for SbF₅ (which reacts with xenon fluorides, but not xenon metal itself).\n    *   **\"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to... A4, A5 can be obtained.\"**: This strongly suggests a comproportionation reaction of the type `Y(0) + YFₙ → 2YFₙ/₂`. This is a key structural clue for identifying A4.\n\n**2. Evaluating the Hypotheses**\n\nLet's evaluate the most plausible candidates for element Y:\n\n*   **Antimony (Sb)**: This hypothesis is supported by the excellent match of the fluorine mass percentage for A2=SbF₃. The molecular weight of SbF₃ (178.8 g/mol) also fits one of the answer ranges (160-180). However, this path contradicts three major clues: Antimony only has two common binary fluorides, SbF₅ is colorless (not red), and it does not oxidize xenon metal. This hypothesis is unlikely.\n\n*   **Krypton (Kr)**: This hypothesis provides a perfect explanation for the 1:1 reaction (`Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂`), which would identify A4 as KrF₄. However, it contradicts the \"five compounds\" and \"bright-red\" clues. The mass percentage match is also not the best.\n\n*   **Platinum (Pt) / Gold (Au)**: These hypotheses are the most chemically consistent.\n    1.  Both Pt and Au form at least five binary fluorides.\n    2.  Their higher fluorides (PtF₆, AuF₅) are red/dark-red and are famous for being powerful enough to oxidize xenon.\n    3.  The mass percentage of fluorine in PtF₅ (32.75%) and AuF₅ (32.54%) are reasonably close to the given 31.96%. A small error in the problem's quantitative data is plausible.\n    4.  The 1:1 reaction clue can be used to identify A4. The reaction must be `Y + YFₙ → 2YFₙ/₂`. We need to find a fluoride of Pt or Au (YFₙ) whose molecular weight fits one of the options.\n\n**3. Identifying A4 and Final Conclusion**\n\nLet's test the platinum fluorides against the options:\n*   MW(PtF₆) ≈ 309 g/mol (No match)\n*   MW(PtF₄) ≈ 271 g/mol (No match)\n*   **MW(PtF₂) ≈ 233 g/mol**. This value falls perfectly into the range **C) 220-240**.\n\nLet's test the gold fluorides against the options:\n*   MW(AuF₅) ≈ 292 g/mol (No match)\n*   MW(AuF₃) ≈ 254 g/mol (No match)\n*   **MW(AuF₂) ≈ 235 g/mol**. This value also falls perfectly into the range **C) 220-240**.\n\nBoth the Platinum and Gold hypotheses, which best explain the specific chemical properties described in the problem, converge on the same answer. They both suggest that A4 is the difluoride (PtF₂ or AuF₂), whose molecular weight is in the 220-240 g/mol range. This path requires accepting a small discrepancy in the mass percentage calculation but provides a coherent explanation for all other clues.\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of substance A4 falls in the range of 220-240.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the core chemical clues to identify the element family.**\nThe most revealing clues are that substance A1 is a \"bright-red substance\" that \"oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.\" The ability to oxidize xenon metal is a hallmark of extremely powerful oxidizing agents. The most famous example is platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆), which was used in the first synthesis of a noble gas compound. PtF₆ is a dark-red solid. This makes elements from the platinum group (like Pt, Ru) or other heavy transition metals (like Au) strong candidates for element Y.\n\n**Step 2: Use the mass percentage of fluorine in A2 to narrow down the identity of Y.**\nThe mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) in A2 is 31.96%. The formula relating the molar mass of Y (M(Y)) to the number of fluorine atoms (n) is M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n.\n\nLet's test this formula with candidates from the platinum group and gold:\n*   **Platinum (Pt):** M(Pt) ≈ 195.1 g/mol. We need M(Y) ≈ 195.1, so 195.1 ≈ 40.45 * n, which gives n ≈ 4.8. This suggests A2 could be PtF₅.\n    *   Let's verify: For PtF₅, ɷF = (5 * 19.00) / (195.1 + 5 * 19.00) = 95 / 290.1 ≈ 32.75%. This is a reasonably close match to the given 31.96%.\n*   **Gold (Au):** M(Au) ≈ 197.0 g/mol. We need M(Y) ≈ 197.0, so 197.0 ≈ 40.45 * n, which gives n ≈ 4.87. This also suggests A2 could be AuF₅.\n    *   Let's verify: For AuF₅, ɷF = (5 * 19.00) / (197.0 + 5 * 19.00) = 95 / 292.0 ≈ 32.53%. This is also a reasonably close match.\n\nBoth Platinum and Gold are excellent candidates. Let's proceed with the Platinum hypothesis, as the chemistry is very well-established.\n\n**Step 3: Construct a consistent scenario with Y = Platinum.**\n*   **Y = Pt**.\n*   **A1 = PtF₆**: This fits the description of a red solid that oxidizes xenon.\n*   **A2 = PtF₅**: The problem states A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine (PtF₆ → PtF₅ + ½F₂). The mass percentage (32.75%) is a good fit for A2.\n*   **A3 = PtF₆**: This is obtained by fluorinating Pt and also interacts with xenon.\n*   **A4 and A5**: The reaction is \"Y + A4 → A5\" with a 1:1 molar ratio of reactants. This describes a comproportionation reaction: Pt(0) + Pt(+n)Fₙ → 2Pt(+(n/2))Fₙ/₂. For this to work with a simple binary fluoride product, 'n' must be an even number. The known binary fluorides of platinum are PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, PtF₆. The candidates for A4 are therefore PtF₂, PtF₄, or PtF₆.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the molecular weight of the candidates for A4 and match with the options.**\nWe need to find which of the candidates (PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₆) has a molecular weight that falls into one of the given ranges.\n*   MW(PtF₆) = 195.1 + 6 * 19.0 = 309.1 g/mol.\n*   MW(PtF₄) = 195.1 + 4 * 19.0 = 271.1 g/mol.\n*   **MW(PtF₂) = 195.1 + 2 * 19.0 = 233.1 g/mol.**\n\nNow, let's compare this to the options provided in the prompt (the letter assignments vary, but the ranges are consistent across most versions):\n*   Range 1: 110-130\n*   Range 2: 140-160\n*   Range 3: 160-180\n*   Range 4: 220-240\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of PtF₂ (233.1 g/mol) falls squarely into the **220-240** range. This identifies A4 as PtF₂. The Gold hypothesis (Y=Au) leads to the same conclusion, as A4 would be AuF₂ (MW ≈ 235 g/mol), which is also in the 220-240 range.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe most chemically consistent interpretation of the clues identifies the element Y as Platinum (or Gold). This leads to the identification of substance A4 as the difluoride (PtF₂ or AuF₂), whose molecular weight is approximately 233-235 g/mol. This value falls within the 220-240 range.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the chemical puzzle, integrating the reasoning from the provided answers.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the mass percentage of Fluorine in A2 to identify potential candidates for element Y.**\n\nThe problem states that substance A2 has a mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. The formula for A2 can be written as YFₙ. We can establish a relationship between the molar mass of Y, M(Y), and the number of fluorine atoms, n:\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nLet's test integer values for n to find plausible elements:\n*   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. Candidates: Br, Kr.\n*   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. Candidate: Sb.\n*   n=5: M(Y) ≈ 202.3 g/mol. Candidates: Au, Pt.\n*   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. Candidates: Pu, Am.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the candidates against the key chemical clues.**\n\nThe most restrictive clues are:\n1.  **A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.** This points to extremely powerful oxidizing agents like the higher fluorides of Platinum (PtF₆), Gold (AuF₅), Krypton (KrF₄), or the actinides. Antimony (SbF₅) is a very strong Lewis acid that reacts with xenon *fluorides*, but it does not readily oxidize xenon metal itself. This makes Sb a less likely candidate.\n2.  **A1 is a bright-red substance.** This provides a physical property to check.\n3.  **Five binary compounds of Y with F are known.**\n4.  **A 1:1 molar ratio reaction: Y + A4 → A5.** This strongly suggests a comproportionation reaction, where an element in its 0 oxidation state reacts with a higher fluoride. For a 1:1 ratio, the reaction must be of the form `Y + YF₂ₓ → 2YFₓ`.\n\nLet's test the strongest candidates based on these clues:\n\n*   **Candidate: Krypton (Kr)**\n    *   The reaction `Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂` is a perfect 1:1 comproportionation. This would identify A4 as KrF₄.\n    *   MW(A4 = KrF₄) = 83.8 + 4(19.0) = 159.8 g/mol. This falls in the range **140-160 (B)**.\n    *   **Flaws:** Krypton only has two known binary fluorides (KrF₂ and KrF₄), contradicting the \"five compounds\" clue. Also, A1 (KrF₄) is a colorless solid, not \"bright-red\".\n\n*   **Candidate: Antimony (Sb)**\n    *   The mass percentage for SbF₃ (31.88%) is an excellent match for A2.\n    *   If A4 is SbF₃, its MW is ~178.8 g/mol, which fits the range **160-180 (D)**.\n    *   **Flaws:** The 1:1 reaction stoichiometry does not work for known antimony fluoride reactions. A1 (SbF₅) is colorless, not red. SbF₅ does not oxidize xenon metal. This hypothesis contradicts multiple key clues.\n\n*   **Candidate: Platinum (Pt)**\n    *   **A1 oxidizes xenon:** PtF₆ is famous for this (the Bartlett reaction). This is a perfect fit.\n    *   **A1 is bright-red:** PtF₆ is a dark-red solid. This is a perfect fit.\n    *   **Five compounds:** Platinum forms PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, PtF₆, and PtF is also known. This fits.\n    *   **A1 → A2 + F₂:** The decomposition `2PtF₆ → 2PtF₅ + F₂` is known. This identifies A2 as PtF₅.\n    *   **Mass % of A2 (PtF₅):** The calculated ɷF is ~32.75%, which is a reasonable match for the given 31.96% (a relative error of ~2.5%).\n    *   **1:1 Reaction:** The reaction `Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF` is a valid 1:1 comproportionation. This would identify A4 as PtF₂.\n    *   **MW of A4 (PtF₂):** MW = 195.08 + 2(19.0) = 233.08 g/mol. This value falls squarely in the range **220-240 (C)**.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion**\n\nThe Platinum (Pt) hypothesis provides the most consistent explanation for the majority of the clues, especially the most specific and unusual ones (xenon oxidation, red color, five compounds, and reaction stoichiometry). While the mass percentage is slightly off, it is a better overall fit than the other candidates, which have major contradictions with the chemical properties. The logical path for Platinum identifies A4 as PtF₂.\n\nThe molecular weight of A4 (PtF₂) is ~233 g/mol. This falls into the range of 220-240.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Identify Element Y using the Mass Percentage of Fluorine in A2**\n\nThe most reliable piece of information in the problem is the quantitative data: the mass percentage (ωF) of fluorine in compound A2 is 31.96%.\n\nLet the formula of A2 be YFₙ, where Y is the unknown element, n is the number of fluorine atoms, M(Y) is the molar mass of Y, and M(F) is the molar mass of fluorine (approximately 19.00 g/mol).\n\nThe formula for mass percentage is:\nωF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for M(Y):\n0.3196 = (n × 19.00) / (M(Y) + n × 19.00)\n0.3196 × M(Y) + 0.3196 × (n × 19.00) = n × 19.00\n0.3196 × M(Y) = (1 - 0.3196) × n × 19.00\n0.3196 × M(Y) = 0.6804 × n × 19.00\nM(Y) = (12.9276 / 0.3196) × n\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nNow, we test integer values for n to find a plausible element Y that is known to form multiple fluorides.\n*   n = 1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (e.g., Ca, Ar). Unlikely chemistry.\n*   n = 2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (e.g., Br, Kr).\n*   n = 3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is an extremely close match for **Antimony (Sb)**, which has a molar mass of 121.76 g/mol.\n*   n = 4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol. No common element fits well.\n*   n = 5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (e.g., Au, Pt).\n*   n = 6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (e.g., Pu, Am).\n\nLet's verify the mass percentage for the best candidate, Antimony (Sb), with n=3.\nIf A2 is SbF₃:\nωF(SbF₃) = (3 × 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 × 19.00) = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%.\nThis value is extremely close to the given 31.96% (an error of only 0.25%), making it the most probable identification. Therefore, **Y is Antimony (Sb)** and **A2 is SbF₃**.\n\n**2. Identify the Candidates for A4**\n\nThe problem states that five binary compounds of fluorine with Y (Antimony) are known. The most common and stable binary fluorides of antimony are SbF₃ and SbF₅. It is highly probable that A4 is one of these two compounds.\n\n**3. Determine A4 by Matching Molecular Weight to the Options**\n\nWe will now calculate the molecular weights of the two candidates for A4 and see which one fits into the provided answer ranges.\n\n*   **Candidate 1: A4 = SbF₅**\n    Molecular Weight (MW) = M(Sb) + 5 × M(F) = 121.76 + 5 × 19.00 = **216.76 g/mol**.\n    This value does not fall into any of the given ranges. It is close to range A (220-240), but it is outside of it.\n\n*   **Candidate 2: A4 = SbF₃**\n    Molecular Weight (MW) = M(Sb) + 3 × M(F) = 121.76 + 3 × 19.00 = **178.76 g/mol**.\n    This value falls perfectly within the range **C) 160-180**.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe identification of Y as Antimony is strongly supported by the mass percentage data. Following this, the molecular weight of SbF₃ is a perfect match for one of the answer choices, while the molecular weight of SbF₅ is not. In such problems, where qualitative descriptions may be flawed or ambiguous (e.g., the color of A1, the 1:1 reaction stoichiometry), the quantitative data provides the most reliable path to the solution.\n\nTherefore, A4 is SbF₃, and its molecular weight is approximately 178.8 g/mol.\n\nThe range in which the molecular weight of substance A4 falls is 160-180.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis is a complex chemistry problem with several clues, some of which are contradictory, requiring careful evaluation to find the most consistent solution.\n\n### Step 1: Initial Analysis of Element Y from Mass Percentage\n\nThe most quantitative clue is that substance A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. We can use this to estimate the molar mass of the unknown element Y, assuming a formula of YFₙ for A2.\n\nThe formula relating the molar masses is: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n.\n\nBy testing integer values for n (the oxidation state), we can identify potential candidates for Y:\n*   **n=2**: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. Candidates: Bromine (Br, 79.9) or Krypton (Kr, 83.8).\n*   **n=3**: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. Candidate: Antimony (Sb, 121.8). The calculated ɷF for SbF₃ is 31.88%, an excellent match.\n*   **n=5**: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol. Candidates: Gold (Au, 197.0) or Platinum (Pt, 195.1).\n*   **n=6**: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. Candidates: Plutonium (Pu, 244) or Americium (Am, 243). The calculated ɷF for AmF₆ is 31.93%, another excellent match.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluating Candidates with Qualitative Clues\n\nWe must now use the other clues to narrow down the possibilities. The most discriminating clues are:\n1.  **\"Five binary compounds... are known.\"**\n2.  **\"A1 is a bright-red substance.\"**\n3.  **\"A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.\"**\n4.  **\"A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 and fluorine.\"** (A1 → A2 + F₂)\n5.  **\"Y + A4 → A5 in a 1:1 molar ratio.\"** (Suggests a comproportionation like Y + YFₙ → 2YFₙ/₂)\n\nLet's evaluate the strongest candidates:\n\n*   **Antimony (Sb):** While the mass percentage for A2=SbF₃ is a near-perfect fit, this hypothesis fails on almost all other points. SbF₅ (the only candidate for A1) is colorless, not red; it is stable at 293 K; it does not oxidize xenon metal; and antimony only forms two simple binary fluorides (SbF₃, SbF₅), not five. This path is inconsistent.\n\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** This hypothesis is plausible. A1=KrF₄ decomposes to A2=KrF₂. KrF₄ is a powerful oxidant. The reaction `Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂` fits the 1:1 ratio, identifying A4 as KrF₄ (MW ≈ 159.8 g/mol, range B). However, this hypothesis fails on two key points: only two binary fluorides of Kr are known, not five, and KrF₄ is a colorless solid, not bright-red.\n\n*   **Platinum (Pt):** This hypothesis provides the best fit for the qualitative clues.\n    *   **A1 = PtF₆**: This compound is famously a dark-red solid, is thermally unstable, and was the first chemical to oxidize xenon (the Bartlett reaction). This perfectly matches the description of A1.\n    *   **A1 → A2 + F₂**: The decomposition `2PtF₆ → 2PtF₅ + F₂` is known. This identifies **A2 as PtF₅**.\n    *   **Mass % Check**: The fluorine percentage in PtF₅ is ~32.7%, which is reasonably close to the given 31.96%. In such problems, a small discrepancy is common when the qualitative clues fit so perfectly.\n    *   **Five Compounds**: Platinum is known to form at least four binary fluorides (PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, PtF₆), making the existence of a fifth plausible.\n    *   **1:1 Reaction**: The reaction `Y + A4 → A5` suggests a comproportionation. We need to find a platinum fluoride (A4) whose molecular weight fits one of the options.\n        *   MW(PtF₂) ≈ 233.1 g/mol. This falls in the range **220-240**.\n        *   MW(PtF₄) ≈ 271.1 g/mol. (Not in any range).\n        *   MW(PtF₆) ≈ 309.1 g/mol. (Not in any range).\n    *   The only option that works is **A4 = PtF₂**. The reaction `Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF` fits the 1:1 reactant ratio, and the product A5=PtF would be expected to decompose in water.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Platinum hypothesis provides the most coherent explanation for all the clues, especially the very specific chemical properties of substance A1. The minor discrepancy in the mass percentage is less significant than the multiple, direct contradictions faced by other hypotheses.\n\n1.  **Element Y** is **Platinum (Pt)**.\n2.  **Substance A4** is **Platinum(II) fluoride (PtF₂)**.\n3.  The molecular weight of A4 (PtF₂) is ~233.1 g/mol.\n4.  This value falls within the range **220-240**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis problem is a complex chemical puzzle with several clues, some of which may be inconsistent or designed to be misleading. A careful step-by-step analysis is required to find the most logical solution.\n\n**1. Analysis of Clues**\n\n*   **Clue 1: Mass Percentage of Fluorine in A2 (ɷF = 31.96%)**\n    This is a quantitative clue. The formula `M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n` relates the molar mass of element Y to the number of fluorine atoms (n) in compound A2.\n    *   For n=3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol, which is an excellent match for **Antimony (Sb)**. The theoretical ɷF in SbF₃ is 31.88%.\n    *   For n=6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol, which is an excellent match for **Americium (Am)**. The theoretical ɷF in AmF₆ is 31.93%.\n    *   Other candidates like Platinum (Pt) and Gold (Au) give a reasonable fit for n=5 (A2 = PtF₅ or AuF₅, with ɷF ≈ 32.7% and 32.5% respectively).\n\n*   **Clue 2: Chemical Properties of A1 and A3**\n    *   \"A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.\"\n    *   \"A3 can also interact with xenon.\"\n    This points to an element that forms extremely powerful oxidizing agents. This is a hallmark of platinum-group metals (like Pt, Ru), gold, and higher actinide fluorides. Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅) is a very strong Lewis acid that reacts with xenon *fluorides*, but it does not oxidize xenon metal itself under normal conditions. This makes the Sb hypothesis chemically weak.\n\n*   **Clue 3: Properties of A1**\n    *   \"bright-red substance\"\n    *   \"decomposes at 293 K into A2 and fluorine\"\n    This describes a highly unstable, colored, higher fluoride.\n    *   **Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆)** is a dark-red solid, unstable, decomposes to PtF₅, and famously oxidizes xenon. This is a perfect match for A1.\n    *   **Gold(V) fluoride (AuF₅)** and its related species are red, unstable, and oxidize xenon. This is also a very strong match.\n    *   The Sb hypothesis fails here, as SbF₅ is a colorless, stable liquid.\n\n*   **Clue 4: The 1:1 Reaction to form A5**\n    *   \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n    This strongly suggests a comproportionation reaction of the type `M + MF_{2n} → 2MF_n`. The 1:1 molar ratio of reactants is key.\n\n**2. Evaluating the Hypotheses**\n\n*   **Antimony (Sb) Hypothesis:** While it has the best numerical fit for the mass percentage, it fails on the crucial chemical properties of A1 (color, stability, reaction with xenon). It is likely a numerical trap.\n\n*   **Platinum (Pt) Hypothesis:** This hypothesis is very strong.\n    *   Y = Platinum (Pt).\n    *   A1 = PtF₆ (dark-red, unstable, oxidizes Xe).\n    *   A2 = PtF₅ (product of A1 decomposition; %F is reasonably close).\n    *   A3 = PtF₆ (product of fluorination of Pt; oxidizes Xe).\n    *   The 1:1 reaction `Pt + A4 → A5` can be interpreted as `Pt + PtF₂ → 2PtF`. This identifies **A4 = PtF₂**.\n    *   Let's calculate the molecular weight of A4 = PtF₂:\n        MW(PtF₂) ≈ 195.08 + 2 * 19.00 = **233.08 g/mol**.\n\n*   **Gold (Au) Hypothesis:** This is also a very strong hypothesis, similar to Platinum.\n    *   Y = Gold (Au).\n    *   A1 = A higher gold fluoride (e.g., AuF₅ or a complex), which is red, unstable, and oxidizes xenon.\n    *   A2 = AuF₅ (%F is reasonably close).\n    *   The 1:1 reaction `Au + A4 → A5` can be interpreted as `Au + AuF₂ → 2AuF`. This identifies **A4 = AuF₂**.\n    *   Let's calculate the molecular weight of A4 = AuF₂:\n        MW(AuF₂) ≈ 196.97 + 2 * 19.00 = **234.97 g/mol**.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nBoth the Platinum and Gold hypotheses are chemically sound and consistent with the clues. Crucially, both point to the same conclusion for A4: it is the difluoride of the element (PtF₂ or AuF₂). The molecular weights in both cases are very similar:\n*   MW(PtF₂) ≈ 233 g/mol\n*   MW(AuF₂) ≈ 235 g/mol\n\nBoth of these values fall squarely within the range **220-240 g/mol**.\n\nLet's check the given options:\nA) 220-240\nB) 110-130\nC) 160-180\nD) 140-160\n\nThe most logical and chemically consistent derivation leads to a molecular weight for A4 that is in the range of 220-240.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis is a complex chemical puzzle with multiple constraints, some of which appear to be contradictory. A careful step-by-step analysis is required, prioritizing the most reliable clues.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y using the mass percentage of Fluorine in A2.**\n\nThe most reliable starting point is the quantitative data. Substance A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ. The molar mass of element Y, M(Y), can be calculated using the formula:\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nWe test integer values for 'n' to find a plausible element:\n*   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Krypton (Kr, 83.8 g/mol) or Bromine (Br, 79.9 g/mol).\n    *   For KrF₂, the theoretical ɷF is 31.2%. This is a reasonable match.\n*   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is an excellent match for Antimony (Sb, 121.76 g/mol).\n    *   For SbF₃, the theoretical ɷF is 31.88%. This is a very close match.\n*   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is an excellent match for Americium (Am, 243 g/mol) or Plutonium (Pu, 244 g/mol).\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the candidates using the other clues.**\n\nThe problem contains several clues that can help distinguish between these possibilities. The most unique and restrictive clues are:\n1.  **The 1:1 molar ratio reaction:** \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" This describes the reaction `Y + A4 → A5`. A comproportionation reaction of the type `M + MF₂ₓ → 2MFₓ` fits this 1:1 reactant stoichiometry perfectly.\n2.  **Reactivity with Xenon:** A1 and A3 are powerful enough oxidizing agents to react with xenon.\n\nLet's test the most promising hypotheses:\n\n*   **Antimony (Sb) Hypothesis:** While the mass percentage for SbF₃ is an excellent match for A2, this hypothesis fails to explain the 1:1 reaction. The known comproportionation is `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃`, which is not a 1:1 ratio of reactants. It also fails to explain the \"five binary compounds\" and the properties of A1.\n\n*   **Actinide (Am/Pu) Hypothesis:** This fits the mass percentage and the \"five binary compounds\" clue well. The comproportionation reaction `Am + AmF₄ → 2AmF₂` also fits the 1:1 stoichiometry. However, the calculated molecular weight of A4 (AmF₄, MW ≈ 319 g/mol) does not fall into any of the provided answer ranges.\n\n*   **Krypton (Kr) Hypothesis:** This hypothesis provides the most consistent explanation, despite some minor discrepancies.\n    *   **Mass Percentage:** The match for A2=KrF₂ (31.2%) is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n    *   **Reactivity:** A1 (a higher fluoride, KrF₄) and A3 (KrF₂) are known to be powerful oxidizing agents capable of reacting with xenon.\n    *   **1:1 Reaction:** The reaction `Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂` is a known comproportionation that perfectly matches the `Y + A4 → A5` stoichiometry with a 1:1 reactant ratio.\n    *   **Identification of A4:** This reaction unambiguously identifies **A4 as KrF₄** and A5 as KrF₂.\n    *   **Other Clues:** A5 (KrF₂) is known to decompose in water. The main contradictions are the \"five binary compounds\" clue (Krypton only has two) and the \"bright-red\" color of A1 (KrF₄ is colorless). In such problems, it is common for some qualitative descriptions to be inaccurate or serve as red herrings. The unique reaction stoichiometry is a much stronger clue.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4 and Determine the Range.**\n\nBased on the most consistent hypothesis, A4 is Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄).\n*   Molar Mass of Krypton (Kr) ≈ 83.80 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 (KrF₄) = 83.80 + (4 × 19.00) = 159.80 g/mol.\n\nThis value falls within the range of **140-160 g/mol**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis is a complex chemical puzzle with several clues, some of which are contradictory. A careful step-by-step analysis is required to find the most plausible solution.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y from the Mass Percentage of Fluorine in A2**\n\nThe problem states that substance A2 is a binary fluoride of element Y (formula YFₙ) with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. We can establish a relationship between the molar mass of Y (M(Y)) and the number of fluorine atoms (n).\n\n*   The formula for mass percentage is: ɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n*   Using M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol and ɷF = 0.3196, we can solve for M(Y):\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nWe test integer values for 'n' to find a plausible element:\n*   **n=2**: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Krypton (Kr, M=83.8 g/mol). The theoretical ɷF in KrF₂ is 31.2%, which is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n*   **n=3**: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is extremely close to Antimony (Sb, M=121.76 g/mol). The theoretical ɷF in SbF₃ is 31.88%, an almost perfect match.\n\nThis leaves us with two strong candidates for Y: Krypton and Antimony.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the Candidates using the Chemical Reaction Clues**\n\nThe problem provides several qualitative clues. The most specific and restrictive one is the reaction used to form A5: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n\nThis describes a comproportionation reaction: **Y + A4 → A5** (with a 1:1 reactant ratio).\n\n*   **If Y = Antimony (Sb):** The known comproportionation reaction is `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃`. This reaction does not have a 1:1 molar ratio of reactants. No other common 1:1 reaction fits the description. Therefore, the Antimony hypothesis fails to explain this crucial chemical clue.\n\n*   **If Y = Krypton (Kr):** A known comproportionation reaction is **`Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂`**. This reaction has a perfect 1:1 molar ratio between the reactants, Krypton (Y) and Krypton tetrafluoride (A4). This is a perfect fit for the description.\n\nBecause the Krypton hypothesis provides a perfect explanation for the unique reaction stoichiometry, it is the more robust and likely intended solution, despite the minor discrepancy in the mass percentage and other qualitative clues (like the color of A1).\n\n**Step 3: Identify A4 and Calculate its Molecular Weight**\n\nBased on the Krypton hypothesis and the 1:1 reaction, we can confidently identify the compounds:\n*   Element Y = **Krypton (Kr)**\n*   Reactant A4 = **Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄)**\n*   Product A5 = **Krypton difluoride (KrF₂)**\n\nThe question asks for the molecular weight range of substance A4.\n*   A4 = KrF₄\n*   Molecular Weight (MW) of KrF₄ = M(Kr) + 4 × M(F)\n*   MW(KrF₄) ≈ 83.80 g/mol + 4 × 19.00 g/mol = 83.80 + 76.00 = **159.80 g/mol**\n\n**Step 4: Match the Molecular Weight to the Given Options**\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of A4 is 159.80 g/mol. We compare this to the provided ranges:\nA) 160-180\nB) 220-240\nC) 110-130\nD) 140-160\n\nThe value 159.80 g/mol falls squarely within the range of 140-160.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the unknown element Y using the mass percentage of fluorine in compound A2.**\n\nThe problem states that compound A2 contains 31.96% fluorine by mass (ωF = 0.3196). Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ. The relationship between the molar mass of Y (M(Y)), the molar mass of fluorine (M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol), and the number of fluorine atoms (n) is given by:\n\nM(Y) = [(1 / ωF) - 1] * n * M(F)\nM(Y) ≈ [(1 / 0.3196) - 1] * n * 19.00\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\nWe test integer values of 'n' to find a plausible element:\n*   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Krypton (Kr, M=83.8 g/mol).\n*   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is very close to Antimony (Sb, M=121.76 g/mol).\n*   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is close to Americium (Am, M≈243 g/mol) or Plutonium (Pu, M≈244 g/mol).\n\nLet's check the theoretical mass percentages for the best candidates:\n*   For KrF₂: ωF = (2 * 19.00) / (83.8 + 38.0) ≈ 31.2%. This is a plausible match.\n*   For SbF₃: ωF = (3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 57.0) ≈ 31.88%. This is an excellent match.\n*   For AmF₆: ωF = (6 * 19.00) / (243 + 114) ≈ 31.93%. This is an excellent match.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the candidates using the chemical properties described.**\n\nThe problem contains several clues, but the most structurally defining one is the 1:1 molar ratio reaction to form A5: `Y + A4 → A5`. This strongly suggests a comproportionation reaction where the element in its zero oxidation state reacts with a higher fluoride. A reaction of the type `M + MFₓ → 2MFₓ/₂` has a 1:1 molar ratio of reactants.\n\nLet's test our candidates against this and other clues:\n\n*   **Antimony (Sb):** The known comproportionation reaction is `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃`. This is not a 1:1 ratio. Furthermore, A1 is described as bright-red and unstable at 293K, while the higher fluoride SbF₅ is a stable, colorless liquid. This hypothesis fails on key chemical properties.\n*   **Americium (Am):** The reaction `Am + AmF₄ → 2AmF₂` fits the 1:1 stoichiometry. This would identify A4 as AmF₄. The molecular weight of AmF₄ is 243 + 4*19 = 319 g/mol. This value does not fall into any of the provided answer ranges. This hypothesis leads to a dead end.\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** The reaction `Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂` is a known comproportionation that fits the 1:1 molar ratio perfectly. This identifies **A4 as KrF₄** and A5 as KrF₂. Let's check the other clues with this assignment:\n    *   A1 decomposes to A2 and fluorine: `KrF₄ → KrF₂ + F₂`. This would mean A1 is KrF₄ and A2 is KrF₂. This is consistent.\n    *   A1 oxidizes xenon: KrF₄ is an exceptionally strong oxidizing agent. This fits.\n    *   A3 is formed by fluorinating Y and interacts with xenon: `Kr + F₂ → KrF₂`. KrF₂ is also a powerful oxidizer. This fits.\n    *   A5 decomposes in water: KrF₂ hydrolyzes in water. This fits.\n\nThe Krypton hypothesis provides a chemically consistent explanation for all the reaction steps. The only inconsistencies are the \"five binary compounds\" (only two are well-known) and the \"bright-red\" color of A1 (KrF₄ is colorless). In complex problems of this type, it is common for some physical descriptions or background facts to be erroneous or intended as red herrings, while the reaction chemistry provides the true path to the solution.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the molecular weight of A4 and select the correct range.**\n\nBased on the most consistent chemical pathway, substance A4 is Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄).\n\n*   Molar mass of Krypton (Kr) ≈ 83.8 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.0 g/mol\n*   Molecular weight of A4 (KrF₄) = M(Kr) + 4 * M(F) = 83.8 + 4 * 19.0 = 159.8 g/mol.\n\nThis calculated molecular weight of 159.8 g/mol falls within the range of 140-160.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided clues and candidate answers, the most chemically consistent solution identifies the element Y as Krypton (Kr).\n\n1.  **Mass Percentage:** The mass percentage of fluorine in A2 (31.96%) is reasonably close to the theoretical value for Krypton difluoride, KrF₂ (31.2%). While other elements like Antimony (Sb) provide a closer numerical match, they lead to significant contradictions with other chemical clues.\n\n2.  **Reaction Stoichiometry:** The most definitive clue is the 1:1 molar ratio reaction: `Y + A4 → A5`. This strongly suggests a comproportionation reaction. The reaction `Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂` perfectly fits this 1:1 reactant stoichiometry. This identifies substance A4 as Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄).\n\n3.  **Other Clues:** This hypothesis requires assuming that the clues about \"five binary compounds\" and the \"bright-red\" color of A1 are either inaccuracies or red herrings, which is common in such complex chemistry puzzles. The Krypton hypothesis provides the most elegant explanation for the core reaction chemistry.\n\n4.  **Molecular Weight Calculation:**\n    *   Element Y is Krypton (Kr).\n    *   Substance A4 is Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄).\n    *   The molecular weight of A4 is calculated as:\n        MW(KrF₄) = M(Kr) + 4 × M(F)\n        MW(KrF₄) ≈ 83.80 g/mol + 4 × 19.00 g/mol\n        MW(KrF₄) ≈ 159.80 g/mol\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The calculated molecular weight of 159.80 g/mol falls squarely within the range of 140-160 g/mol.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis is a complex chemical puzzle with several clues, some of which are contradictory, requiring careful evaluation to determine the most reliable path to the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Initial Analysis of Element Y from Mass Percentage\n\nThe first quantitative clue is that substance A2 has a mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ. The relationship between the molar mass of element Y, M(Y), and the number of fluorine atoms, n, is given by:\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nTesting integer values for n gives us potential candidates for element Y:\n*   **n=2**: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is close to Krypton (Kr, 83.8 g/mol). The theoretical ɷF for KrF₂ is 31.2%, which is reasonably close to the given 31.96%.\n*   **n=3**: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. This is an excellent match for Antimony (Sb, 121.8 g/mol). The theoretical ɷF for SbF₃ is 31.88%, an almost perfect match.\n*   **n=6**: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is an excellent match for Americium (Am, 243 g/mol) or Plutonium (Pu, 244 g/mol). The theoretical ɷF for AmF₆ is 31.93%.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluating Candidates with Chemical Clues\n\nWe must use the other chemical clues to distinguish between these possibilities. The most specific and unusual clue is the reaction to form A5: *\"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"*\n\nThis describes a comproportionation reaction with a 1:1 stoichiometry for the reactants:\nY + A4 → A5\n\nLet's test our best candidates against this clue:\n*   **Antimony (Sb) Hypothesis**: If Y is Sb, the known fluorides are SbF₃ and SbF₅. The comproportionation reaction is 2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃. This does not have a 1:1 molar ratio. This hypothesis fails to explain this key reaction.\n*   **Americium (Am) Hypothesis**: If Y is Am, the reaction Am + AmF₄ → 2AmF₂ has a 1:1 reactant ratio. This would identify A4 as AmF₄. However, the molecular weight of AmF₄ is ~319 g/mol, which does not fall into any of the provided answer ranges.\n*   **Krypton (Kr) Hypothesis**: If Y is Kr, the known binary fluorides are KrF₂ and KrF₄. The reaction **Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂** is a known comproportionation with a perfect **1:1 molar ratio** of reactants. This provides an elegant and precise explanation for the reaction clue.\n\n### Step 3: Consolidating the Krypton Hypothesis\n\nBy prioritizing the unique reaction stoichiometry, we can build a consistent, albeit not perfect, model:\n*   **Element Y**: Krypton (Kr).\n*   **A2**: KrF₂ (from the mass percentage calculation, 31.2% is a plausible match).\n*   **A1**: A substance that decomposes into A2 (KrF₂) and fluorine. This must be KrF₄. The description of A1 as \"bright-red\" is a likely inaccuracy in the problem statement, as KrF₄ is colorless. However, its extreme instability and ability to oxidize xenon are correct.\n*   **A3**: Obtained by fluorination of Kr, it must be KrF₂. KrF₂ is a powerful enough oxidant to interact with xenon.\n*   **A4**: Identified from the 1:1 reaction `Kr + A4 → A5`. As shown above, **A4 is KrF₄**.\n*   **A5**: The product of the reaction is **KrF₂**. The final clue, that A5 decomposes in water, is also correct for KrF₂ (KrF₂ + H₂O → Kr + ½O₂ + 2HF).\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Molecular Weight of A4\n\nBased on the deduction that A4 is Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄), we can calculate its molecular weight:\n*   Molar Mass of Krypton (Kr) ≈ 83.80 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n*   Molecular Weight of A4 (KrF₄) = 83.80 + (4 × 19.00) = 159.80 g/mol.\n\nThis value falls within the range of **140-160**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe analysis identified the unknown element Y as Platinum (Pt). This conclusion was reached because the properties of its fluorides align best with the problem's clues. Specifically, Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆) matches the description of compound A1 as a red, unstable substance that famously oxidizes xenon.\n\nBased on this identification, the reaction \"Y + A4 -> A5\" in a 1:1 molar ratio was interpreted as a comproportionation reaction: `Pt + PtF₂ -> 2PtF`. This established compound A4 as Platinum(II) fluoride (PtF₂).\n\nThe molecular weight of A4 (PtF₂) was calculated to be approximately 233.08 g/mol. This value falls within the range of 220-240 g/mol, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nThis is a complex chemical puzzle with several clues, some of which can be misleading or contain minor inaccuracies, which is common in chemistry olympiad problems. A careful step-by-step analysis, prioritizing the most reliable chemical and quantitative information, is required.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Mass Percentage of Fluorine in A2\n\nThe most crucial quantitative clue is that substance A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ. The molar mass of element Y, M(Y), can be related to n (the number of fluorine atoms) using the molar mass of fluorine (M(F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol).\n\nThe formula is: ɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n\nRearranging for M(Y), we get: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nWe must test integer values of 'n' to find a plausible element Y that is known to form multiple, highly reactive fluorides.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Candidate Elements\n\n*   **n=3, Y=Antimony (Sb):** M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. The atomic mass of Sb is 121.76 g/mol. The fluorine percentage in SbF₃ is 31.88%, an excellent match. However, the properties of A1 (bright-red, unstable at 293K, oxidizes Xe) do not match SbF₅. This path has a major contradiction.\n*   **n=2, Y=Krypton (Kr):** M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. The atomic mass of Kr is 83.8 g/mol. The fluorine percentage in KrF₂ is 31.2%, a reasonable match. However, Kr only forms two well-known binary fluorides (not five), and A1 (KrF₄) is colorless, not red. This path also has major contradictions.\n*   **n=5 or n=6, Y=Noble Metal or Actinide:** This leads to elements like Gold (Au), Platinum (Pt), or Americium (Am). These elements are known to form multiple, colored, highly reactive fluorides capable of oxidizing xenon.\n    *   For **Y=Platinum (Pt)**, let's test its fluorides. The mass percentage of fluorine in **PtF₅** is 32.75%. This is a reasonably close match to the given 31.96%. Let's assume **A2 = PtF₅**.\n    *   For **Y=Gold (Au)**, the mass percentage of fluorine in **AuF₅** is 32.54%. This is also a very close match. Let's assume **A2 = AuF₅**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify with Other Chemical Clues (Assuming Y = Pt or Au)\n\nLet's proceed with the Platinum/Gold hypothesis, as it aligns best with the qualitative clues.\n\n*   **Clue: \"Five binary compounds... are known.\"** Both Pt and Au fit this well.\n*   **Clue: \"A1 is a bright-red substance... decomposes... oxidizes xenon.\"**\n    *   If Y=Pt and A2=PtF₅, then A1 must be a higher fluoride. **PtF₆** is a dark-red solid, is unstable, and is famous for being the first compound to oxidize xenon. This is a perfect fit.\n    *   If Y=Au and A2=AuF₅, then A1 could be a higher fluoride complex. AuF₅ itself is red and a powerful oxidizer. This is also a very good fit.\n*   **Clue: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to... A4, A5 can be obtained.\"** This strongly suggests a comproportionation reaction. For a 1:1 reactant ratio, the reaction is typically of the form: **Y + YFₙ → 2YFₙ/₂**. This means A4 must be a fluoride with an even number of fluorine atoms (n).\n\n### Step 4: Identify A4 and Determine its Molecular Weight\n\nWe need to find a plausible compound A4 (PtFₙ or AuFₙ where n is even) whose molecular weight falls into one of the given ranges.\n\n*   **If Y = Platinum (Pt):** The candidates for A4 are PtF₂, PtF₄, and PtF₆.\n    *   MW(PtF₆) ≈ 309 g/mol (No match)\n    *   MW(PtF₄) ≈ 271 g/mol (No match)\n    *   **MW(PtF₂) ≈ 195.08 + 2 * 19.00 = 233.08 g/mol.** This value falls squarely in the range **220-240**.\n\n*   **If Y = Gold (Au):** The candidates for A4 could include AuF₂.\n    *   **MW(AuF₂) ≈ 196.97 + 2 * 19.00 = 234.97 g/mol.** This value also falls squarely in the range **220-240**.\n\nBoth the Platinum and Gold hypotheses are chemically sound and independently point to the same conclusion: A4 is a difluoride (PtF₂ or AuF₂) with a molecular weight around 233-235 g/mol. This molecular weight falls into the range of 220-240 g/mol.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe most consistent and logical deduction identifies element Y as either Platinum or Gold. In either case, substance A4 is identified as the corresponding difluoride (PtF₂ or AuF₂), whose molecular weight is approximately 233-235 g/mol. This value is within the 220-240 range.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nThis problem is a complex chemical puzzle with several clues, some of which may be contradictory or intended to mislead. A careful step-by-step analysis is required to determine the most plausible solution.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Mass Percentage of Fluorine in A2\n\nThe problem states that substance A2 has a mass percentage of fluorine (ωF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ. The relationship between the molar mass of element Y, M(Y), and the number of fluorine atoms, n, can be derived as follows:\n\nωF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n0.3196 = (n × 19.00) / (M(Y) + n × 19.00)\n\nSolving for M(Y), we get the approximation:\nM(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n\n\nWe can test integer values of 'n' to find plausible elements:\n*   **n=2**: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (e.g., Bromine, Krypton)\n*   **n=3**: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (e.g., Antimony). The fluorine percentage in SbF₃ is 31.88%, a very close match.\n*   **n=5**: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (e.g., Gold, Platinum). The fluorine percentage in AuF₅ is 32.54%, and in PtF₅ is 32.75%, both reasonably close.\n*   **n=6**: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (e.g., Plutonium, Americium). The fluorine percentage in AmF₆ is 31.93%, an almost perfect match.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Candidates Using Chemical Properties\n\nThe qualitative clues are crucial for distinguishing between the candidates identified above.\n\n*   **Clue**: \"A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.\" This points to an element that forms exceptionally strong oxidizing agents. This is a hallmark of noble metals like Gold (Au) and Platinum (Pt), and actinides like Americium (Am), as well as Krypton (Kr). Antimony (Sb) is a weaker candidate on this point.\n*   **Clue**: \"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\" This strongly supports Americium (AmF₂, AmF₃, AmF₄, AmF₅, AmF₆) and is plausible for Gold (AuF, AuF₂, AuF₃, AuF₅, and AuF₇-related species) and Platinum. It is a major point of failure for Antimony (only two common fluorides) and Krypton (only two).\n*   **Clue**: \"A1 is a bright-red substance\" that decomposes. AuF₅ is red, and PtF₆ is dark-red. This fits the Gold/Platinum path well.\n*   **Clue**: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to... A4, A5 can be obtained.\" This suggests a comproportionation reaction. A reaction of the type `Y + YF₂ₙ → 2YFₙ` fits this 1:1 reactant stoichiometry.\n\n### Step 3: Synthesize the Clues to Identify A4\n\nThe Americium (Am) hypothesis is chemically very consistent but leads to a molecular weight for A4 (AmF₄, MW ≈ 319) that is not among the options. This suggests a flaw in the problem's options, but we must find the best fit among the choices provided.\n\nThe Gold (Au) and Platinum (Pt) hypotheses are the next most plausible. Let's follow the Gold path:\n1.  **Y = Gold (Au)**.\n2.  **A2 = AuF₅**. The mass percentage (32.54%) is a reasonable fit for the given 31.96%.\n3.  **A1** is a higher, unstable red fluoride that decomposes to A2 (AuF₅), consistent with gold's chemistry.\n4.  The reaction `Y + A4 → A5` becomes `Au + A4 → A5`. For this to be a 1:1 comproportionation, a plausible reaction is `Au + AuF₂ → 2AuF`.\n5.  This identifies **A4 as AuF₂** and **A5 as AuF**. The final clue, that A5 decomposes in water, is consistent with the chemistry of AuF.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4\n\nBased on the deduction that A4 is Gold(II) fluoride (AuF₂), we can calculate its molecular weight:\n*   Molar Mass of Gold (Au) ≈ 196.97 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19.00 g/mol\n*   Molecular Weight of AuF₂ = 196.97 + (2 × 19.00) = 234.97 g/mol.\n\n### Step 5: Match the Molecular Weight to the Given Range\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of 234.97 g/mol falls squarely within the range given in option B.\n\n*   A) 110-130\n*   **B) 220-240**\n*   C) 160-180\n*   D) 140-160\n\nThis provides a complete and consistent solution that, despite the problem's inherent difficulties, leads to one of the provided answers.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
