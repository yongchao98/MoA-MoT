The correct solution is given by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Here are the critical points to consider when evaluating the options:\n\n1.  **Retardation is Essential**: The electromagnetic field propagates at the finite speed of light, `c`. This means the potential at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` is determined by the charge's state (position $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ and velocity $\\vec{v}$) at an earlier, *retarded time* $t_r$. The time difference is the light-travel time: $t - t_r = d/c$.\n    *   **Pitfall**: Using a static potential form like $V = q/(4\\pi\\epsilon_o r)$, which ignores this time delay. Options B and C make this fundamental error.\n\n2.  **The Relativistic Denominator**: The derivation from Maxwell's equations introduces a crucial correction factor in the denominator that accounts for the motion of the source. This factor is often written as $d(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})$, where $\\vec{n} = \\vec{d}/d$ is the direction vector and $\\vec{\\beta} = \\vec{v}/c$ is the normalized velocity.\n    *   In the notation of the problem, this becomes: $d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d}}{d} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c}) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$.\n    *   To match the format of the options, one can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`, which transforms the denominator to: $c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}) = dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$.\n\n3.  **The Sign of the Velocity Term**: The correct denominator is $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$. The negative sign is physically significant and represents a Doppler-like effect. When the charge moves towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$), the denominator decreases, and the potential's magnitude increases.\n    *   **Pitfall**: Using a positive sign, as in $(dc + \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$. This corresponds to the \"advanced potential,\" a mathematical solution that violates causality (the effect precedes the cause) and is generally considered unphysical. Option D makes this error.\n\n4.  **Correct Forms of V and A**:\n    *   The scalar potential V is: $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$.\n    *   The vector potential A is: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy applying these points to the given options:\n*   **Option A** correctly represents both the scalar and vector Liénard-Wiechert potentials with the proper relativistic denominator and the correct sign.\n*   **Option B** uses an incorrect static potential and a dimensionally incorrect formula for the vector potential.\n*   **Option C** uses an incorrect static potential, although the relationship it suggests between A and V is correct for a point charge.\n*   **Option D** incorrectly uses a `+` sign in the denominator, corresponding to the unphysical advanced potential.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the only correct choice. The majority of the provided candidate answers correctly derive the formulas corresponding to Option A, even if many of them subsequently misidentify the option letter.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on an analysis of the provided answers and a first-principles derivation, here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the correct final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Principle**: The question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. In classical electrodynamics, these are described by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials are the solutions to Maxwell's equations for a point charge in arbitrary, relativistic motion, and they correctly account for the finite speed of light, `c`.\n\n2.  **The Concept of Retarded Time**: The field observed at a point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` is not caused by the charge's simultaneous state. Instead, it's caused by the charge's state at an earlier, \"retarded\" time, $t_r$. The time difference, $t - t_r$, is the time it took for the field to propagate from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$. Using the notation from the problem:\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the position of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}|$ is the distance the field traveled.\n    *   The retarded time condition is: $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n3.  **The Liénard-Wiechert Formulas**: The standard derivation of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials from the general retarded potential integrals yields the following expressions:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\n    In these formulas, all source-related quantities ($\\vec{d}$, $d$, and $\\vec{v}$) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n4.  **Matching the Formula to the Options**: The given options have a slightly different algebraic form. We can rewrite the derived potentials by multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{qc}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n5.  **Evaluating the Candidate Options**:\n    *   **Option A**: Has a `+` sign in the denominator. This corresponds to the \"advanced potential,\" a mathematically valid but typically unphysical solution that violates causality. This is incorrect.\n    *   **Option B**: Uses the static Coulomb potential for V, which is incorrect as it neglects the crucial velocity-dependent term in the denominator that arises from the charge's motion.\n    *   **Option C**: Also uses the incorrect static potential for V and has an incorrect expression for $\\vec{A}$.\n    *   **Option D**: $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$. This perfectly matches the correctly derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The negative sign in the denominator is a key feature, representing a Doppler-like effect that increases the potential when the charge moves toward the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$).\n\n### Conclusion\nThe correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge are given by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. After deriving these potentials and formatting them to match the style of the given options, the result is identical to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem requires finding the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) for a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, which are the relativistically correct solutions to Maxwell's equations for a point charge in arbitrary motion.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Concept**: The electromagnetic field propagates at a finite speed, `c`. Therefore, the potential measured at a point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` is determined by the charge's state (position and velocity) at an earlier, \"retarded\" time, `tr`. The problem defines the necessary variables:\n    *   `q`: charge\n    *   $\\vec{v}$: velocity of the charge at the retarded time `tr`.\n    *   $\\vec{d}$: vector from the charge's position at `tr` to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n    *   `d`: magnitude of $\\vec{d}$.\n    *   The retarded time `tr` is defined by the relation $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials**: The standard formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, derived from the retarded potential integrals, are:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n    The term in the denominator, $d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$, accounts for the relativistic Doppler effect on the potential.\n\n3.  **Match to the Format of the Options**: The given options have a denominator of the form $(dc \\pm \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$. We can rewrite our standard formulas to match this format by multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    *   For the scalar potential `V`:\n        $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q \\cdot c}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   For the vector potential `A`:\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v} \\cdot c}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n4.  **Compare with the Given Options**:\n    *   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**: Incorrect. This uses the static potential form for V, which does not account for the motion of the charge in the denominator. The expression for A is also incorrect.\n    *   **B) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**: **Correct**. This exactly matches our derived expressions for both the scalar and vector potentials.\n    *   **C) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**: Incorrect. This uses the static potential form for V. While the relationship $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is correct for Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the base expression for V is wrong.\n    *   **D) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**: Incorrect. The sign in the denominator is wrong. A plus sign corresponds to the \"advanced potentials,\" which are generally considered unphysical as they violate causality.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials given in option B. A review of the candidate answers shows that while most correctly derive the formulas, many make a mistake in matching their result to the lettered options. The consistent derivation across multiple agents confirms the physics, and a careful comparison points to B as the only correct choice.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\n### Step-by-step Analysis of the Problem\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Concept**: The question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. This is a fundamental problem in classical electrodynamics, and the solutions are known as the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**.\n\n2.  **Understand Retardation**: The key physical principle is that electromagnetic fields propagate at a finite speed, the speed of light `c`. Therefore, the potential measured at a position $\\vec{r}$ and time `t` is not determined by the charge's state at time `t`, but by its state at an earlier **retarded time**, $t_r$. The time difference, $t - t_r$, is the time it took for the field to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point.\n\n3.  **Define Variables based on the Prompt**:\n    *   `q`: The charge.\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: The position of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n    *   $\\vec{v}$: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time, i.e., $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$.\n    *   $\\vec{r}$: The observation point.\n    *   $\\vec{d}$: The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point, $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n    *   `d`: The magnitude of this vector, $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n    *   The retardation condition is: $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n4.  **State the Standard Liénard-Wiechert Formulas**: The standard derivation from Maxwell's equations yields the following expressions for the potentials:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\n    The term in the denominator, $(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})$, is a crucial relativistic correction factor that accounts for the Doppler-like effect of the moving source.\n\n5.  **Manipulate the Formulas to Match the Options**: The given options have a denominator of the form $(dc \\pm \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$.

The derivation shows that the denominator must contain the term $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$, where the negative sign is characteristic of the retarded potential. This matches option D. Many of the provided agent answers correctly derive these formulas but then make a mistake in matching them to the lettered option. Based on the correct physical derivation, option D is the only correct choice.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Physical Principle\nThe question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. This is a standard problem in classical electrodynamics, and the solutions are known as the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**. These potentials are the solutions to Maxwell's equations for a point charge in arbitrary motion and account for the finite speed of light, `c`.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Concept of Retarded Time\nThe core idea is that the electromagnetic field propagates at a finite speed `c`. Therefore, the potential measured at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` is not determined by the charge's state at time `t`, but by its state at an earlier time, $t_r$, known as the **retarded time**. The time difference, $t - t_r$, is the time it took for the signal to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point.\n\nUsing the notation from the problem:\n*   The charge's position at the retarded time is $\\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n*   The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point is $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n*   The distance the signal travels is $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n*   The retarded time condition is therefore: $t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c}$.\n\n### Step 3: State the Standard Liénard-Wiechert Formulas\nThe derivation of these potentials from the general retarded potential integrals is a standard but non-trivial exercise found in most advanced electromagnetism textbooks. The results are:\n\nScalar Potential:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\nVector Potential:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\nIn these formulas, all quantities on the right-hand side (like $d$, $\\vec{d}$, and $\\vec{v}$) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n### Step 4: Reformat the Formulas to Match the Options\nThe given options have a denominator of the form $(dc \\pm \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$. We can achieve this form by multiplying the numerator and denominator of the standard formulas by `c`:\n\nFor the scalar potential V:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{q \\cdot c}{(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}) \\cdot c} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nFor the vector potential $\\vec{A}$:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v} \\cdot c}{(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}) \\cdot c} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n### Step 5: Compare with the Given Options\nNow, let's carefully compare these correct expressions with the choices provided:\n\n*   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n    *   This is incorrect. The plus sign in the denominator corresponds to \"advanced potentials,\" which violate causality (effects preceding their cause) and are generally discarded as unphysical.\n\n*   **B) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n    *   **This exactly matches our derived expressions.** The minus sign is the correct one for retarded potentials.\n\n*   **C) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n    *   This is incorrect. The expression for V is the static Coulomb potential, which does not account for the motion of the charge or the retardation effect. The expression for $\\vec{A}$ is also dimensionally and physically incorrect.\n\n*   **D) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n    *   This is incorrect. While the relationship $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is correct for Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the expression for V itself is the static potential, which is wrong.

The time difference `t - tr` is the time it took for the electromagnetic signal to travel from the charge's position at `tr` to the observation point `r`.\n\n2.  **Define Variables from the Problem Statement**:\n    *   `q`: The charge.\n    *   `tr`: The retarded time (when the field was generated).\n    *   `s(tr)`: The position of the charge at `tr`.\n    *   `r`: The observation position.\n    *   `d = r - s(tr)`: The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n    *   `d = |d|`: The distance the signal traveled.\n    *   `v`: The velocity of the charge at `tr`.\n    *   The retarded time condition is `t - tr = d/c`.\n\n3.  **Recall or Derive the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials**: The standard derivation from Maxwell's equations for a moving point charge yields the following expressions for the potentials:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{R - \\frac{\\vec{R} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{R - \\frac{\\vec{R} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n\n4.  **Translate to the Problem's Notation**: We substitute the standard notation (`R`, `R`) with the notation given in the problem (`d`, `d`):\n    *   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\n5.  **Match the Format of the Options**: The options provided have a denominator of the form `(dc ± d⋅v)`.

The expressions for both V and A exactly match the Liénard-Wiechert potentials derived above.\n    *   D) Incorrect. This has a `+` sign in the denominator. This corresponds to the \"advanced potentials,\" which are solutions to Maxwell's equations but are generally discarded as unphysical because they violate causality (the effect would precede the cause).\n\n### Conclusion\nThe correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.

Since electromagnetic interactions propagate at the finite speed of light, `c`, the potential measured at a point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` is caused by the charge's state (position and velocity) at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time `t_r`. The time difference `t - t_r` is the time it took for the field to travel the distance `d` from the charge's retarded position to the observer. This is expressed as $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n2.  **Start from General Retarded Potentials**: The Liénard-Wiechert potentials are derived from the general integral solutions for the wave equations governing V and $\\vec{A}$. For a point charge `q` moving with velocity $\\vec{v}$, these integrals simplify.\n\n3.  **The Crucial Denominator**: A careful derivation of the potentials for a moving point charge reveals a correction factor in the denominator compared to the static case. This factor accounts for the relativistic Doppler effect on the potential. The standard form of the denominator is $R(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})$, where $R$ is the distance, $\\vec{n}$ is the unit vector pointing from the charge to the observer, and $\\vec{\\beta} = \\vec{v}/c$.\n\n4.  **Translate to the Problem's Notation**:\n    *   The distance `R` is given as `d`.\n    *   The unit vector $\\vec{n}$ is $\\vec{d}/d$.\n    *   The velocity is $\\vec{v}$.\n    *   Therefore, the denominator term becomes: $d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d}}{d} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c}) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$.\n\n5.  **Formulate the Potentials**: Using this denominator, the potentials are:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\n6.  **Match with the Options**: The given options have a denominator of the form $(dc \\pm \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$. To get our derived expressions into this format, we multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{qc}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n7.  **Final Comparison**:\n    *   Options A and C are incorrect because they use the static potential form ($V \\propto 1/r$), which does not account for the motion-dependent denominator.\n    *   Option B is incorrect because it has a plus sign ($+$) in the denominator.

These are known as the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**. They are the relativistically correct solutions to Maxwell's equations for a moving point charge and account for the finite speed of light, an effect known as retardation.\n\n2.  **Recall the Standard Formulas**: The standard textbook expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{R(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{R(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n\n    The subscript \"ret\" signifies that all quantities inside the brackets are evaluated at the retarded time, $t_r$.\n\n3.  **Translate to the Problem's Notation**: It is crucial to map the standard notation to the specific notation defined in the problem description.\n    *   Standard $\\vec{R}$ (vector from retarded position to observation point) corresponds to the problem's $\\vec{d}$.\n    *   Standard $R$ (magnitude of $\\vec{R}$) corresponds to the problem's $d$.\n    *   Standard $\\vec{n}$ (unit vector $\\vec{R}/R$) corresponds to the problem's $\\vec{d}/d$.\n    *   Standard $\\vec{v}$ (velocity at retarded time) is the same as the problem's $\\vec{v}$.\n    *   Standard $\\vec{\\beta}$ (normalized velocity) is $\\vec{v}/c$.\n\n4.  **Simplify the Denominator**: The key term in the potentials is the denominator. Let's substitute the problem's notation into the standard denominator term $R(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})$:\n    $d \\left(1 - \\dfrac{\\vec{d}}{d} \\cdot \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c}\\right) = d - \\dfrac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\n5.  **Rewrite the Potentials**: Now, substitute this simplified denominator back into the potential equations:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\n6.  **Match the Format of the Options**: The given options have a denominator of the form $(dc \\pm \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$. We can achieve this by multiplying the numerator and denominator of our derived expressions by $c$:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n7.  **Compare with the Given Options**:\n    *   A) Incorrect.

This uses the static potential form ($V \\propto 1/r$) which neglects the crucial velocity-dependent retardation effect in the denominator. The expression for $\\vec{A}$ is also incorrect.\n    *   C) Incorrect. This also uses the static potential form. While the relation $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is correct for Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the base expression for V is wrong.\n    *   D) **Correct**. This option exactly matches the derived expressions for both the scalar and vector potentials.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Retardation vs. Static Potential**: The potential from a moving charge is not the simple Coulomb potential. The denominator is modified from the distance `d` to $d(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)$, which accounts for the fact that the distance the field signal has to travel is changing as the source moves. This immediately rules out options B and C.\n*   **Sign of the Denominator**: The negative sign in $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$ is a critical feature of the retarded potentials. It ensures that the potential is larger when the charge is moving towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$) due to a \"compression\" of the emitted field, a phenomenon related to the Doppler effect. A positive sign would describe an unphysical \"advanced potential\" where the effect precedes the cause. This rules out option A.\n*   **Consistency Check**: The Liénard-Wiechert potentials are related by $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V$.

Many of the provided candidate answers correctly derive the physical formulas but fail in the final step of matching them to the correct lettered option.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Identify the Core Physics Problem**\nThe question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a point charge `q` moving along an arbitrary trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$. This is a fundamental problem in classical electrodynamics. The solutions must account for the finite speed of light, `c`, which means the potentials at an observation point `r` at time `t` are determined by the charge's state (position and velocity) at an earlier, \"retarded\" time, `tr`. The correct expressions are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n**2. Define the Variables and Notation**\nLet's carefully list the variables as defined in the problem:\n*   `q`: The electric charge.\n*   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: The position of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n*   $\\vec{r}$: The position of the observation point.\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$: The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n*   $d = |\\vec{d}|$: The distance from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n*   $\\vec{v}$: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time, $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}\\Big|_{t=t_r}$.\n*   $t_r$: The retarded time, defined by the relation $t - t_r = d/c$. This means the signal emitted at $t_r$ travels the distance $d$ to arrive at the observer at time $t$.\n\n**3. Recall or Derive the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials**\nThe Liénard-Wiechert potentials are the solutions to Maxwell's equations for a moving point charge. The standard formulas are:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\nThe term in the denominator, $d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$, is the crucial part. It arises from a relativistic Doppler-like effect; the apparent volume of the charge is compressed or expanded from the observer's point of view due to its motion. The minus sign is correct for retarded potentials, which respect causality (cause precedes effect). A plus sign would correspond to \"advanced potentials,\" which are mathematically valid solutions but are typically discarded as unphysical.\n\n**4. Match the Standard Form to the Given Options**\nThe options in the question have a slightly different algebraic form. We can get to that form by multiplying the numerator and denominator of our standard expressions by `c`:\n\nFor the scalar potential V:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{q \\cdot c}{c \\left(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}\\right)} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nFor the vector potential $\\vec{A}$:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v} \\cdot c}{c \\left(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}\\right)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n**5. Compare with the Options**\nNow, let's compare these final expressions with the choices provided:\n\n*   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n    This option **exactly matches** our derived expressions for both V and $\\vec{A}$.\n\n*   **B) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n    This is incorrect. The plus sign in the denominator corresponds to the unphysical advanced potentials.\n\n*   **C) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n    This is incorrect. The expression for V is the static Coulomb potential, which does not account for the motion of the charge or the retardation effect in the denominator. It uses `r` (the instantaneous distance) instead of `d` (the retarded distance) and is missing the velocity-dependent term.\n\n*   **D) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n    This is incorrect for the same reasons as C, and the expression for $\\vec{A}$ is also wrong.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge are given by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, which, in the notation of the problem, are correctly stated in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nThe problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) for a moving point charge.

These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The solution involves applying the concept of \"retarded time\" to account for the finite speed of light.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics:** The question asks for the electromagnetic potentials of a moving point charge. This is a fundamental problem in classical electrodynamics. Unlike static charges (described by Coulomb's law) or steady currents, a charge in arbitrary motion requires a more general solution that accounts for the time it takes for the field to propagate from the source to the observer. This leads to the concept of retarded time and the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n2.  **Understand Retarded Time ($t_r$):** The potential measured at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$ is not caused by the charge's state at that same instant. Instead, it is caused by the charge's state at an earlier time, $t_r$, called the retarded time. The time delay, $t - t_r$, is precisely the time required for light to travel the distance $d$ from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$. This is defined by the relation:\n    $t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c}$, where $d = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$.\n\n3.  **Recall the Liénard-Wiechert Formulas:** The derivation of these potentials from Maxwell's equations is a standard but complex procedure. The result for the scalar potential V is:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n    And for the vector potential $\\vec{A}$:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n    All variables on the right-hand side ($\\vec{d}$, $d$, and $\\vec{v}$) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n4.  **Careful Point: The Denominator:** The term $(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})$ is the most critical part of the expression.\n    *   The **minus sign** is correct and physically significant. It represents a relativistic Doppler-like effect. When the charge moves towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$ is positive), the denominator decreases, and the potential becomes stronger. Conversely, it becomes weaker when the charge moves away.\n    *   A plus sign would correspond to an \"advanced potential,\" a solution that is typically discarded as unphysical because it violates causality.\n\n5.  **Match Formulas to the Given Options:** The options are presented in a slightly different algebraic form. We can rewrite the standard formulas by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n    *   For the scalar potential V:\n        $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   For the vector potential $\\vec{A}$:\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n6.  **Final Comparison:**\n    *   **A) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$**: These expressions **perfectly match** the derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n    *   **B) and C)**: These options are incorrect because they use the static potential form, which depends on the distance `r` from the origin and completely neglects the crucial velocity-dependent term in the denominator that arises from retardation.\n    *   **D)**: This option is incorrect because it has a plus sign in the denominator, which corresponds to the unphysical advanced potential.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, option A is the only correct representation of the scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe code analyzed 17 candidate answers to determine the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\nThe analysis revealed two key findings:\n1.

However, an analysis of the physical reasoning within each response showed that all 17 agents correctly derived the same set of formulas, known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nThese universally derived formulas are:\n*   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n*   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions match option B exactly. The discrepancy between the scattered final votes and the unanimous reasoning indicates that most agents made a simple error in mapping their correct derivation to the final letter choice. Based on the overwhelming consensus of the physical derivations, the correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nThis problem requires identifying the correct expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge, known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The analysis involves deriving these potentials from fundamental principles or recalling their standard form and carefully matching them to the given options.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Principle**: The question concerns the electromagnetic potentials from a moving point charge. Unlike a static charge, the potentials from a moving charge must account for the finite speed of light, `c`. This means the potential at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` is determined by the charge's state (position and velocity) at an earlier, \"retarded\" time, $t_r$.\n\n2.  **Define Variables from the Prompt**:\n    *   $t_r$: The retarded time, when the field was generated.\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: The position of the charge `q` at time $t_r$.\n    *   $\\vec{v}$: The velocity of the charge at time $t_r$.\n    *   $\\vec{r}$: The observation point.\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$: The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}|$: The distance the field traveled.\n    *   The retarded time is defined by the condition $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n3.  **Recall or Derive the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials**: The standard derivation of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials from Maxwell's equations yields the following expressions:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\n4.  **Careful Point 1: The Denominator**: The term $(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})$ is the most critical part. It is not simply the distance `d`. This term arises from a relativistic effect (related to the Doppler effect) that accounts for the fact that the volume element of the moving charge appears compressed or expanded to the observer. The minus sign is characteristic of retarded potentials (effects follow causes). A plus sign would correspond to advanced potentials, which are generally discarded as unphysical.\n\n5.  **Careful Point 2: Matching the Format**: The given options have a denominator of the form $(dc \\pm \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$. To transform the standard expressions into this format, we multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n6.  **Careful Point 3: Final Comparison with Options**: We now compare these derived formulas with the choices provided:\n    *   **A) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$**: This option **perfectly matches** the derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n    *   **B) and C)**: These options incorrectly use the static potential form $V = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}$, which neglects the crucial velocity-dependent term in the denominator and uses the incorrect distance `r` (presumably from the origin) instead of `d` (from the retarded position).\n    *   **D)**: This option has a plus sign in the denominator, which corresponds to the unphysical advanced potential.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe overwhelming majority of the candidate answers correctly identify the physical formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. However, many of them incorrectly map their derived result to the lettered options. The correct derivation, shown above, leads unambiguously to the expressions presented in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Core Physics Problem\nThe question asks for the scalar potential (V) and the vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a point charge `q` moving along a specified trajectory. This is a fundamental problem in classical electrodynamics. The solution must account for the fact that electromagnetic fields propagate at a finite speed, `c`. The correct expressions are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Notation and the Concept of Retarded Time\nThe problem uses specific notation that must be carefully handled:\n*   $\\vec{r}$ is the point where the field is observed.\n*   $t$ is the time of observation.\n*   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the position of the charge at an earlier \"retarded time\" $t_r$.\n*   $\\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n*   $\\vec{d}$ is the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point: $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n*   $d$ is the magnitude of this vector, $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n\nThe retarded time $t_r$ is defined by the condition that the signal, traveling at speed `c`, must have left the charge at $t_r$ to arrive at $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$. This is expressed as:\n$t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c}$\n\n### Step 3: State the Standard Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\nThe standard formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, derived from Maxwell's equations, are:\n*   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n*   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\nThe term in the denominator, $d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$, is crucial. It accounts for the relativistic Doppler effect on the potential due to the motion of the source.\n\n### Step 4: Match the Standard Formula to the Given Options\nTo compare our standard formulas with the options provided, we can manipulate the expressions by multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n\nFor the scalar potential V:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{qc}{c \\left(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}\\right)} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nFor the vector potential $\\vec{A}$:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{c \\left(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}\\right)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n### Step 5: Carefully Compare with Each Option\nNow we compare these derived expressions with the choices A, B, C, and D.\n\n*   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n    This is incorrect.

The sign in the denominator is positive. A positive sign corresponds to \"advanced potentials,\" which describe effects happening before their cause and are generally discarded as unphysical.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe analysis of the candidate answers reveals a common pitfall: many correctly derived the Liénard-Wiechert potentials but then failed to map them to the correct lettered option.

The correct solution is given by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Here are the critical points to consider when evaluating the options:\n\n1.  **Retardation is Essential**: The electromagnetic field propagates at the finite speed of light, `c`. This means the potential at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` is determined by the charge's state (position $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ and velocity $\\vec{v}$) at an earlier, *retarded time* $t_r$. The time difference is the light-travel time: $t - t_r = d/c$.\n    *   **Pitfall**: Using a static potential form like $V = q/(4\\pi\\epsilon_o r)$, which ignores this time delay. Options B and C make this fundamental error.\n\n2.  **The Relativistic Denominator**: The derivation from Maxwell's equations introduces a crucial correction factor in the denominator that accounts for the motion of the source. This factor is often written as $d(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})$, where $\\vec{n} = \\vec{d}/d$ is the direction vector and $\\vec{\\beta} = \\vec{v}/c$ is the normalized velocity.\n    *   In the notation of the problem, this becomes: $d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d}}{d} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c}) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$.\n    *   To match the format of the options, one can multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`, which transforms the denominator to: $c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}) = dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$.\n\n3.  **The Sign of the Velocity Term**: The correct denominator is $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$. The negative sign is physically significant and represents a Doppler-like effect. When the charge moves towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$), the denominator decreases, and the potential's magnitude increases.\n    *   **Pitfall**: Using a positive sign, as in $(dc + \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$. This corresponds to the \"advanced potential,\" a mathematical solution that violates causality (the effect precedes the cause) and is generally considered unphysical. Option D makes this error.\n\n4.  **Correct Forms of V and A**:\n    *   The scalar potential V is: $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$.\n    *   The vector potential A is: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy applying these points to the given options:\n*   **Option A** correctly represents both the scalar and vector Liénard-Wiechert potentials with the proper relativistic denominator and the correct sign.\n*   **Option B** uses an incorrect static potential and a dimensionally incorrect formula for the vector potential.\n*   **Option C** uses an incorrect static potential, although the relationship it suggests between A and V is correct for a point charge.\n*   **Option D** incorrectly uses a `+` sign in the denominator, corresponding to the unphysical advanced potential.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the only correct choice. The majority of the provided candidate answers correctly derive the formulas corresponding to Option A, even if many of them subsequently misidentify the option letter.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on an analysis of the provided answers and a first-principles derivation, here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the correct final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Principle**: The question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. In classical electrodynamics, these are described by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials are the solutions to Maxwell's equations for a point charge in arbitrary, relativistic motion, and they correctly account for the finite speed of light, `c`.\n\n2.  **The Concept of Retarded Time**: The field observed at a point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` is not caused by the charge's simultaneous state. Instead, it's caused by the charge's state at an earlier, \"retarded\" time, $t_r$. The time difference, $t - t_r$, is the time it took for the field to propagate from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$. Using the notation from the problem:\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the position of the charge at the retarded time.\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}|$ is the distance the field traveled.\n    *   The retarded time condition is: $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n3.  **The Liénard-Wiechert Formulas**: The standard derivation of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials from the general retarded potential integrals yields the following expressions:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\n    In these formulas, all source-related quantities ($\\vec{d}$, $d$, and $\\vec{v}$) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n4.  **Matching the Formula to the Options**: The given options have a slightly different algebraic form. We can rewrite the derived potentials by multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{qc}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n5.  **Evaluating the Candidate Options**:\n    *   **Option A**: Has a `+` sign in the denominator. This corresponds to the \"advanced potential,\" a mathematically valid but typically unphysical solution that violates causality. This is incorrect.\n    *   **Option B**: Uses the static Coulomb potential for V, which is incorrect as it neglects the crucial velocity-dependent term in the denominator that arises from the charge's motion.\n    *   **Option C**: Also uses the incorrect static potential for V and has an incorrect expression for $\\vec{A}$.\n    *   **Option D**: $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$. This perfectly matches the correctly derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The negative sign in the denominator is a key feature, representing a Doppler-like effect that increases the potential when the charge moves toward the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$).\n\n### Conclusion\nThe correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge are given by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. After deriving these potentials and formatting them to match the style of the given options, the result is identical to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem requires finding the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) for a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, which are the relativistically correct solutions to Maxwell's equations for a point charge in arbitrary motion.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Concept**: The electromagnetic field propagates at a finite speed, `c`. Therefore, the potential measured at a point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` is determined by the charge's state (position and velocity) at an earlier, \"retarded\" time, `tr`. The problem defines the necessary variables:\n    *   `q`: charge\n    *   $\\vec{v}$: velocity of the charge at the retarded time `tr`.\n    *   $\\vec{d}$: vector from the charge's position at `tr` to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n    *   `d`: magnitude of $\\vec{d}$.\n    *   The retarded time `tr` is defined by the relation $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials**: The standard formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, derived from the retarded potential integrals, are:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n    The term in the denominator, $d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$, accounts for the relativistic Doppler effect on the potential.\n\n3.  **Match to the Format of the Options**: The given options have a denominator of the form $(dc \\pm \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$. We can rewrite our standard formulas to match this format by multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    *   For the scalar potential `V`:\n        $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q \\cdot c}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   For the vector potential `A`:\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v} \\cdot c}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n4.  **Compare with the Given Options**:\n    *   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**: Incorrect. This uses the static potential form for V, which does not account for the motion of the charge in the denominator. The expression for A is also incorrect.\n    *   **B) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**: **Correct**. This exactly matches our derived expressions for both the scalar and vector potentials.\n    *   **C) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**: Incorrect. This uses the static potential form for V. While the relationship $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is correct for Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the base expression for V is wrong.\n    *   **D) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**: Incorrect. The sign in the denominator is wrong. A plus sign corresponds to the \"advanced potentials,\" which are generally considered unphysical as they violate causality.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials given in option B. A review of the candidate answers shows that while most correctly derive the formulas, many make a mistake in matching their result to the lettered options. The consistent derivation across multiple agents confirms the physics, and a careful comparison points to B as the only correct choice.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\n### Step-by-step Analysis of the Problem\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Concept**: The question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. This is a fundamental problem in classical electrodynamics, and the solutions are known as the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**.\n\n2.  **Understand Retardation**: The key physical principle is that electromagnetic fields propagate at a finite speed, the speed of light `c`. Therefore, the potential measured at a position $\\vec{r}$ and time `t` is not determined by the charge's state at time `t`, but by its state at an earlier **retarded time**, $t_r$. The time difference, $t - t_r$, is the time it took for the field to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point.\n\n3.  **Define Variables based on the Prompt**:\n    *   `q`: The charge.\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: The position of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n    *   $\\vec{v}$: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time, i.e., $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$.\n    *   $\\vec{r}$: The observation point.\n    *   $\\vec{d}$: The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point, $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n    *   `d`: The magnitude of this vector, $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n    *   The retardation condition is: $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n4.  **State the Standard Liénard-Wiechert Formulas**: The standard derivation from Maxwell's equations yields the following expressions for the potentials:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\n    The term in the denominator, $(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})$, is a crucial relativistic correction factor that accounts for the Doppler-like effect of the moving source.\n\n5.  **Manipulate the Formulas to Match the Options**: The given options have a denominator of the form $(dc \\pm \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$.

The derivation shows that the denominator must contain the term $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$, where the negative sign is characteristic of the retarded potential. This matches option D. Many of the provided agent answers correctly derive these formulas but then make a mistake in matching them to the lettered option. Based on the correct physical derivation, option D is the only correct choice.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Physical Principle\nThe question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. This is a standard problem in classical electrodynamics, and the solutions are known as the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**. These potentials are the solutions to Maxwell's equations for a point charge in arbitrary motion and account for the finite speed of light, `c`.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Concept of Retarded Time\nThe core idea is that the electromagnetic field propagates at a finite speed `c`. Therefore, the potential measured at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` is not determined by the charge's state at time `t`, but by its state at an earlier time, $t_r$, known as the **retarded time**. The time difference, $t - t_r$, is the time it took for the signal to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point.\n\nUsing the notation from the problem:\n*   The charge's position at the retarded time is $\\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n*   The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point is $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n*   The distance the signal travels is $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n*   The retarded time condition is therefore: $t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c}$.\n\n### Step 3: State the Standard Liénard-Wiechert Formulas\nThe derivation of these potentials from the general retarded potential integrals is a standard but non-trivial exercise found in most advanced electromagnetism textbooks. The results are:\n\nScalar Potential:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\nVector Potential:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\nIn these formulas, all quantities on the right-hand side (like $d$, $\\vec{d}$, and $\\vec{v}$) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n### Step 4: Reformat the Formulas to Match the Options\nThe given options have a denominator of the form $(dc \\pm \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$. We can achieve this form by multiplying the numerator and denominator of the standard formulas by `c`:\n\nFor the scalar potential V:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{q \\cdot c}{(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}) \\cdot c} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nFor the vector potential $\\vec{A}$:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v} \\cdot c}{(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}) \\cdot c} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n### Step 5: Compare with the Given Options\nNow, let's carefully compare these correct expressions with the choices provided:\n\n*   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n    *   This is incorrect. The plus sign in the denominator corresponds to \"advanced potentials,\" which violate causality (effects preceding their cause) and are generally discarded as unphysical.\n\n*   **B) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n    *   **This exactly matches our derived expressions.** The minus sign is the correct one for retarded potentials.\n\n*   **C) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n    *   This is incorrect. The expression for V is the static Coulomb potential, which does not account for the motion of the charge or the retardation effect. The expression for $\\vec{A}$ is also dimensionally and physically incorrect.\n\n*   **D) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n    *   This is incorrect. While the relationship $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is correct for Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the expression for V itself is the static potential, which is wrong. The full relativistic denominator is missing.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge are given in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge.

The time difference `t - tr` is the time it took for the electromagnetic signal to travel from the charge's position at `tr` to the observation point `r`.\n\n2.  **Define Variables from the Problem Statement**:\n    *   `q`: The charge.\n    *   `tr`: The retarded time (when the field was generated).\n    *   `s(tr)`: The position of the charge at `tr`.\n    *   `r`: The observation position.\n    *   `d = r - s(tr)`: The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n    *   `d = |d|`: The distance the signal traveled.\n    *   `v`: The velocity of the charge at `tr`.\n    *   The retarded time condition is `t - tr = d/c`.\n\n3.  **Recall or Derive the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials**: The standard derivation from Maxwell's equations for a moving point charge yields the following expressions for the potentials:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{R - \\frac{\\vec{R} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{R - \\frac{\\vec{R} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n\n4.  **Translate to the Problem's Notation**: We substitute the standard notation (`R`, `R`) with the notation given in the problem (`d`, `d`):\n    *   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\n5.  **Match the Format of the Options**: The options provided have a denominator of the form `(dc ± d⋅v)`.

The expressions for both V and A exactly match the Liénard-Wiechert potentials derived above.\n    *   D) Incorrect. This has a `+` sign in the denominator. This corresponds to the \"advanced potentials,\" which are solutions to Maxwell's equations but are generally discarded as unphysical because they violate causality (the effect would precede the cause).\n\n### Conclusion\nThe correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.

Since electromagnetic interactions propagate at the finite speed of light, `c`, the potential measured at a point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` is caused by the charge's state (position and velocity) at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time `t_r`. The time difference `t - t_r` is the time it took for the field to travel the distance `d` from the charge's retarded position to the observer. This is expressed as $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n2.  **Start from General Retarded Potentials**: The Liénard-Wiechert potentials are derived from the general integral solutions for the wave equations governing V and $\\vec{A}$. For a point charge `q` moving with velocity $\\vec{v}$, these integrals simplify.\n\n3.  **The Crucial Denominator**: A careful derivation of the potentials for a moving point charge reveals a correction factor in the denominator compared to the static case. This factor accounts for the relativistic Doppler effect on the potential. The standard form of the denominator is $R(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})$, where $R$ is the distance, $\\vec{n}$ is the unit vector pointing from the charge to the observer, and $\\vec{\\beta} = \\vec{v}/c$.\n\n4.  **Translate to the Problem's Notation**:\n    *   The distance `R` is given as `d`.\n    *   The unit vector $\\vec{n}$ is $\\vec{d}/d$.\n    *   The velocity is $\\vec{v}$.\n    *   Therefore, the denominator term becomes: $d(1 - \\frac{\\vec{d}}{d} \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c}) = d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$.\n\n5.  **Formulate the Potentials**: Using this denominator, the potentials are:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\n6.  **Match with the Options**: The given options have a denominator of the form $(dc \\pm \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$. To get our derived expressions into this format, we multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{qc}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n7.  **Final Comparison**:\n    *   Options A and C are incorrect because they use the static potential form ($V \\propto 1/r$), which does not account for the motion-dependent denominator.\n    *   Option B is incorrect because it has a plus sign ($+$) in the denominator.

These are known as the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**. They are the relativistically correct solutions to Maxwell's equations for a moving point charge and account for the finite speed of light, an effect known as retardation.\n\n2.  **Recall the Standard Formulas**: The standard textbook expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{R(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{R(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})} \\right]_{\\text{ret}}$\n\n    The subscript \"ret\" signifies that all quantities inside the brackets are evaluated at the retarded time, $t_r$.\n\n3.  **Translate to the Problem's Notation**: It is crucial to map the standard notation to the specific notation defined in the problem description.\n    *   Standard $\\vec{R}$ (vector from retarded position to observation point) corresponds to the problem's $\\vec{d}$.\n    *   Standard $R$ (magnitude of $\\vec{R}$) corresponds to the problem's $d$.\n    *   Standard $\\vec{n}$ (unit vector $\\vec{R}/R$) corresponds to the problem's $\\vec{d}/d$.\n    *   Standard $\\vec{v}$ (velocity at retarded time) is the same as the problem's $\\vec{v}$.\n    *   Standard $\\vec{\\beta}$ (normalized velocity) is $\\vec{v}/c$.\n\n4.  **Simplify the Denominator**: The key term in the potentials is the denominator. Let's substitute the problem's notation into the standard denominator term $R(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{\\beta})$:\n    $d \\left(1 - \\dfrac{\\vec{d}}{d} \\cdot \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c}\\right) = d - \\dfrac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$\n\n5.  **Rewrite the Potentials**: Now, substitute this simplified denominator back into the potential equations:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\n6.  **Match the Format of the Options**: The given options have a denominator of the form $(dc \\pm \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$. We can achieve this by multiplying the numerator and denominator of our derived expressions by $c$:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n7.  **Compare with the Given Options**:\n    *   A) Incorrect.

This uses the static potential form ($V \\propto 1/r$) which neglects the crucial velocity-dependent retardation effect in the denominator. The expression for $\\vec{A}$ is also incorrect.\n    *   C) Incorrect. This also uses the static potential form. While the relation $\\vec{A} = (\\vec{v}/c^2)V$ is correct for Liénard-Wiechert potentials, the base expression for V is wrong.\n    *   D) **Correct**. This option exactly matches the derived expressions for both the scalar and vector potentials.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Retardation vs. Static Potential**: The potential from a moving charge is not the simple Coulomb potential. The denominator is modified from the distance `d` to $d(1 - \\vec{n} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c)$, which accounts for the fact that the distance the field signal has to travel is changing as the source moves. This immediately rules out options B and C.\n*   **Sign of the Denominator**: The negative sign in $(dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$ is a critical feature of the retarded potentials. It ensures that the potential is larger when the charge is moving towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$) due to a \"compression\" of the emitted field, a phenomenon related to the Doppler effect. A positive sign would describe an unphysical \"advanced potential\" where the effect precedes the cause. This rules out option A.\n*   **Consistency Check**: The Liénard-Wiechert potentials are related by $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V$. Using the relation $c^2 = 1/(\\epsilon_o \\mu_o)$, we can verify this for option D:\n    $\\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V = \\epsilon_o \\mu_o \\vec{v} \\left( \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\vec{A}$. The relationship holds.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given by the Liénard-Wiechert formulas, which, in the specified notation, match option D. Many of the provided candidate answers correctly derive the physical formulas but fail in the final step of matching them to the correct lettered option.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Identify the Core Physics Problem**\nThe question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a point charge `q` moving along an arbitrary trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$. This is a fundamental problem in classical electrodynamics. The solutions must account for the finite speed of light, `c`, which means the potentials at an observation point `r` at time `t` are determined by the charge's state (position and velocity) at an earlier, \"retarded\" time, `tr`. The correct expressions are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n**2. Define the Variables and Notation**\nLet's carefully list the variables as defined in the problem:\n*   `q`: The electric charge.\n*   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: The position of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n*   $\\vec{r}$: The position of the observation point.\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$: The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n*   $d = |\\vec{d}|$: The distance from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n*   $\\vec{v}$: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time, $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}\\Big|_{t=t_r}$.\n*   $t_r$: The retarded time, defined by the relation $t - t_r = d/c$. This means the signal emitted at $t_r$ travels the distance $d$ to arrive at the observer at time $t$.\n\n**3. Recall or Derive the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials**\nThe Liénard-Wiechert potentials are the solutions to Maxwell's equations for a moving point charge. The standard formulas are:\n\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\nThe term in the denominator, $d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$, is the crucial part. It arises from a relativistic Doppler-like effect; the apparent volume of the charge is compressed or expanded from the observer's point of view due to its motion. The minus sign is correct for retarded potentials, which respect causality (cause precedes effect). A plus sign would correspond to \"advanced potentials,\" which are mathematically valid solutions but are typically discarded as unphysical.\n\n**4. Match the Standard Form to the Given Options**\nThe options in the question have a slightly different algebraic form. We can get to that form by multiplying the numerator and denominator of our standard expressions by `c`:\n\nFor the scalar potential V:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{q \\cdot c}{c \\left(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}\\right)} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nFor the vector potential $\\vec{A}$:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{q\\vec{v} \\cdot c}{c \\left(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}\\right)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n**5. Compare with the Options**\nNow, let's compare these final expressions with the choices provided:\n\n*   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n    This option **exactly matches** our derived expressions for both V and $\\vec{A}$.\n\n*   **B) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n    This is incorrect. The plus sign in the denominator corresponds to the unphysical advanced potentials.\n\n*   **C) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n    This is incorrect. The expression for V is the static Coulomb potential, which does not account for the motion of the charge or the retardation effect in the denominator. It uses `r` (the instantaneous distance) instead of `d` (the retarded distance) and is missing the velocity-dependent term.\n\n*   **D) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n    This is incorrect for the same reasons as C, and the expression for $\\vec{A}$ is also wrong.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge are given by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, which, in the notation of the problem, are correctly stated in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<\nACTION: TEXT\nGUIDANCE:\nThe problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) for a moving point charge.

These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The solution involves applying the concept of \"retarded time\" to account for the finite speed of light.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics:** The question asks for the electromagnetic potentials of a moving point charge. This is a fundamental problem in classical electrodynamics. Unlike static charges (described by Coulomb's law) or steady currents, a charge in arbitrary motion requires a more general solution that accounts for the time it takes for the field to propagate from the source to the observer. This leads to the concept of retarded time and the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n2.  **Understand Retarded Time ($t_r$):** The potential measured at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$ is not caused by the charge's state at that same instant. Instead, it is caused by the charge's state at an earlier time, $t_r$, called the retarded time. The time delay, $t - t_r$, is precisely the time required for light to travel the distance $d$ from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$. This is defined by the relation:\n    $t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c}$, where $d = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$.\n\n3.  **Recall the Liénard-Wiechert Formulas:** The derivation of these potentials from Maxwell's equations is a standard but complex procedure. The result for the scalar potential V is:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n    And for the vector potential $\\vec{A}$:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n    All variables on the right-hand side ($\\vec{d}$, $d$, and $\\vec{v}$) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n4.  **Careful Point: The Denominator:** The term $(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})$ is the most critical part of the expression.\n    *   The **minus sign** is correct and physically significant. It represents a relativistic Doppler-like effect. When the charge moves towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$ is positive), the denominator decreases, and the potential becomes stronger. Conversely, it becomes weaker when the charge moves away.\n    *   A plus sign would correspond to an \"advanced potential,\" a solution that is typically discarded as unphysical because it violates causality.\n\n5.  **Match Formulas to the Given Options:** The options are presented in a slightly different algebraic form. We can rewrite the standard formulas by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n    *   For the scalar potential V:\n        $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   For the vector potential $\\vec{A}$:\n        $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n6.  **Final Comparison:**\n    *   **A) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$**: These expressions **perfectly match** the derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n    *   **B) and C)**: These options are incorrect because they use the static potential form, which depends on the distance `r` from the origin and completely neglects the crucial velocity-dependent term in the denominator that arises from retardation.\n    *   **D)**: This option is incorrect because it has a plus sign in the denominator, which corresponds to the unphysical advanced potential.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, option A is the only correct representation of the scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe code analyzed 17 candidate answers to determine the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\nThe analysis revealed two key findings:\n1.  A direct tally of the final votes from each agent was inconclusive, with votes scattered across all four options (A, B, C, and D).\n2.  However, an analysis of the physical reasoning within each response showed that all 17 agents correctly derived the same set of formulas, known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nThese universally derived formulas are:\n*   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n*   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions match option B exactly. The discrepancy between the scattered final votes and the unanimous reasoning indicates that most agents made a simple error in mapping their correct derivation to the final letter choice. Based on the overwhelming consensus of the physical derivations, the correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nThis problem requires identifying the correct expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge, known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The analysis involves deriving these potentials from fundamental principles or recalling their standard form and carefully matching them to the given options.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Principle**: The question concerns the electromagnetic potentials from a moving point charge. Unlike a static charge, the potentials from a moving charge must account for the finite speed of light, `c`. This means the potential at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ at time `t` is determined by the charge's state (position and velocity) at an earlier, \"retarded\" time, $t_r$.\n\n2.  **Define Variables from the Prompt**:\n    *   $t_r$: The retarded time, when the field was generated.\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: The position of the charge `q` at time $t_r$.\n    *   $\\vec{v}$: The velocity of the charge at time $t_r$.\n    *   $\\vec{r}$: The observation point.\n    *   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$: The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}|$: The distance the field traveled.\n    *   The retarded time is defined by the condition $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\n3.  **Recall or Derive the Liénard-Wiechert Potentials**: The standard derivation of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials from Maxwell's equations yields the following expressions:\n    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n    *   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\n4.  **Careful Point 1: The Denominator**: The term $(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})$ is the most critical part. It is not simply the distance `d`. This term arises from a relativistic effect (related to the Doppler effect) that accounts for the fact that the volume element of the moving charge appears compressed or expanded to the observer. The minus sign is characteristic of retarded potentials (effects follow causes). A plus sign would correspond to advanced potentials, which are generally discarded as unphysical.\n\n5.  **Careful Point 2: Matching the Format**: The given options have a denominator of the form $(dc \\pm \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})$. To transform the standard expressions into this format, we multiply the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n    *   $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    *   $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{c(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n6.  **Careful Point 3: Final Comparison with Options**: We now compare these derived formulas with the choices provided:\n    *   **A) $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$**: This option **perfectly matches** the derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n    *   **B) and C)**: These options incorrectly use the static potential form $V = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}$, which neglects the crucial velocity-dependent term in the denominator and uses the incorrect distance `r` (presumably from the origin) instead of `d` (from the retarded position).\n    *   **D)**: This option has a plus sign in the denominator, which corresponds to the unphysical advanced potential.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe overwhelming majority of the candidate answers correctly identify the physical formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. However, many of them incorrectly map their derived result to the lettered options. The correct derivation, shown above, leads unambiguously to the expressions presented in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Core Physics Problem\nThe question asks for the scalar potential (V) and the vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a point charge `q` moving along a specified trajectory. This is a fundamental problem in classical electrodynamics. The solution must account for the fact that electromagnetic fields propagate at a finite speed, `c`. The correct expressions are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Notation and the Concept of Retarded Time\nThe problem uses specific notation that must be carefully handled:\n*   $\\vec{r}$ is the point where the field is observed.\n*   $t$ is the time of observation.\n*   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ is the position of the charge at an earlier \"retarded time\" $t_r$.\n*   $\\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n*   $\\vec{d}$ is the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point: $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n*   $d$ is the magnitude of this vector, $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n\nThe retarded time $t_r$ is defined by the condition that the signal, traveling at speed `c`, must have left the charge at $t_r$ to arrive at $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$. This is expressed as:\n$t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c}$\n\n### Step 3: State the Standard Liénard-Wiechert Potentials\nThe standard formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, derived from Maxwell's equations, are:\n*   Scalar Potential: $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n*   Vector Potential: $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\nThe term in the denominator, $d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}$, is crucial. It accounts for the relativistic Doppler effect on the potential due to the motion of the source.\n\n### Step 4: Match the Standard Formula to the Given Options\nTo compare our standard formulas with the options provided, we can manipulate the expressions by multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`:\n\nFor the scalar potential V:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{qc}{c \\left(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}\\right)} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nFor the vector potential $\\vec{A}$:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{c \\left(d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}\\right)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n### Step 5: Carefully Compare with Each Option\nNow we compare these derived expressions with the choices A, B, C, and D.\n\n*   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n    This is incorrect. The expression for V is the static Coulomb potential, which does not account for the motion of the charge or retardation effects in the denominator. The expression for $\\vec{A}$ is also incorrect.\n\n*   **B) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)**\n    This is incorrect for the same reason as A; it uses the static potential for V.\n\n*   **C) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n    This option **perfectly matches** the correct Liénard-Wiechert potentials derived in Step 4.\n\n*   **D) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}**\n    This is incorrect. The sign in the denominator is positive. A positive sign corresponds to \"advanced potentials,\" which describe effects happening before their cause and are generally discarded as unphysical.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe analysis of the candidate answers reveals a common pitfall: many correctly derived the Liénard-Wiechert potentials but then failed to map them to the correct lettered option. A careful, step-by-step derivation and comparison confirms that the expressions in option C are the correct ones.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
