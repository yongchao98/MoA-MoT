The goal is to arrange them by the increasing yield of the *para*-isomer. This depends on two main factors:\n1.  **Directing Effect:** Substituents are either *ortho,para-directing* or *meta-directing*. Meta-directors will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer, while ortho,para-directors will produce a significant amount.\n2.  **Para/Ortho Ratio:** For ortho,para-directors, the ratio of the para product to the ortho product determines the final para yield. This is influenced by steric hindrance (larger groups favor the less crowded para position) and electronic effects.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents**\nFirst, we must classify the substituent on each benzene ring:\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directors (High Para Yield):**\n    *   1) `-CH₃` (Toluene): Activating\n    *   5) `-C₂H₅` (Ethylbenzene): Activating\n    *   3) `-Cl` (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating\n*   **Meta-Directors (Low Para Yield):**\n    *   4) `-NO₂` (Nitrobenzene): Strongly Deactivating\n    *   6) `-COOH` (Benzoic acid): Deactivating\n    *   2) `-COOC₂H₅` (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating\n\nThis classification immediately tells us that the final sequence will have substances {4, 6, 2} at the beginning (lowest yield) and substances {1, 5, 3} at the end (highest yield).\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directors (Lowest Para Yield)**\nFor substances 4, 6, and 2, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the minor para product.\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: `-NO₂` > `-COOH` > `-COOC₂H₅`.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (Highest Para Yield)**\nFor substances 1, 5, and 3, we must compare their preference for the para position.\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (`-C₂H₅`) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH₃`). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine electrophile to the adjacent *ortho* positions, making the remote *para* position more accessible. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher proportion of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chloro group (`-Cl`) is deactivating due to its strong inductive effect but is an ortho,para-director due to resonance. The deactivating inductive effect is felt most strongly at the ortho positions, which disfavors ortho substitution relative to para substitution. This electronic effect, combined with the steric size of the chlorine atom, leads to a very high preference for the para-isomer. Experimental data shows that bromination of chlorobenzene yields about 87% para-isomer, which is significantly higher than for toluene (approx. 67%). Therefore, chlorobenzene has the highest para yield in this group. The order is **5 < 3**.\n\nCombining these findings, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Orders and Determine the Final Answer**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the complete sequence:\n*   (Low para-yield group) < (High para-yield group)\n*   **(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**\n\nThe final combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence corresponds exactly to option B. A majority of the candidate answers that performed a step-by-step analysis derived this same sequence, even if some of them made a mistake in selecting the final letter. The chemical reasoning is sound and consistent.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction, a step-by-step analysis of the substituents' effects is required.\n\n**Step 1: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\nFirst, we separate the substituents into two groups based on whether they direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the *meta* position or the *ortho* and *para* positions.\n\n*   **Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups are deactivating and will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer. The major product will be the meta-isomer.\n    *   4) `-NO₂` (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) `-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) `-COOC₂H₅` (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups will produce a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) `-CH₃` (Toluene)\n    *   5) `-C₂H₅` (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) `-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial classification establishes that the substances with meta-directing groups (4, 6, 2) will have the lowest para-isomer yields and will appear first in the final sequence.\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Groups (4, 6, 2)**\nFor these substances, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A more strongly deactivating group will direct more exclusively to the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe established order of deactivating strength is:\n`-NO₂` > `-COOH` > `-COOC₂H₅`\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of this:\n**4 < 6 < 2**\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Groups (1, 5, 3)**\nFor these substances, we need to compare the ratio of the para-isomer to the ortho-isomer. This is influenced by both steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH₃ (1) and -C₂H₅ (5):** The ethyl group (`-C₂H₅`) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH₃`). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine electrophile to the adjacent *ortho* positions. Consequently, substitution at the less hindered *para* position is more favored for ethylbenzene than for toluene. This means the para-isomer yield is higher for ethylbenzene.\n    *   Order: **1 < 5**\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1, 5) with -Cl (3):** The chloro group is deactivating due to its strong inductive electron withdrawal, but it directs to the ortho and para positions via resonance. The inductive effect is strongest at the ortho positions, which disfavors ortho attack more than para attack. This electronic effect, combined with the steric size of the chlorine atom, leads to a very high preference for the para-isomer. Experimental data shows that the bromination of chlorobenzene yields about 87% of the para-isomer, which is a higher percentage than that obtained from either toluene (approx. 67%) or ethylbenzene.\n    *   Order: **5 < 3**\n\nCombining these findings, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\n**1 < 5 < 3**\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Orders**\nBy combining the two ranked groups, we obtain the final overall order. The meta-directors have the lowest yields, followed by the ortho, para-directors.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThe complete sequence is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### **Step 1: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\n\nFirst, we must classify the substituent on each benzene ring as either an *ortho, para*-director or a *meta*-director. This is the primary factor determining the yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) **-CH₃** (Toluene): Activating\n    *   5) **-C₂H₅** (Ethylbenzene): Activating\n    *   3) **-Cl** (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating, but o,p-directing\n\n*   **Meta-Directors (Low Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position, resulting in a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) **-NO₂** (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating\n    *   6) **-COOH** (Benzoic acid): Deactivating\n    *   2) **-COOC₂H₅** (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating\n\nBased on this classification, the three meta-directing substances (4, 6, 2) will have the lowest para-isomer yields, while the three ortho, para-directing substances (1, 5, 3) will have the highest yields. The final sequence will be `{4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}`.\n\n### **Step 2: Order the Meta-Directors**\n\nFor the meta-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the minor para-product.\n\nThe established order of deactivating strength is:\n**-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**\n\nTherefore, the order of *increasing* para-isomer yield is the reverse:\n**Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**\n\n### **Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors**\n\nFor the ortho, para-directing groups, we need to compare the ratio of the para-isomer to the ortho-isomer. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH₃ (1) and -C₂H₅ (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, making the remote para position more accessible. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher proportion of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   Order: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)**\n\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** The chloro group is deactivating due to its strong inductive effect, which is felt most strongly at the ortho positions. This electronic effect disfavors ortho substitution more than para substitution. This, combined with the steric hindrance of the chlorine atom, leads to a very high preference for the para-isomer. Experimental data shows that bromination of chlorobenzene yields about 89% of the para-isomer, which is a higher percentage than for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n    *   Order: **Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**\n\nCombining these, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\n**Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**\n\n### **Step 4: Combine the Orders**\n\nNow, we combine the two sorted groups. The para-isomer yield for any o,p-director is significantly higher than for any m-director.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThe final combined order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct order.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents based on their directing effects.**\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, substituents on the benzene ring direct the incoming electrophile (in this case, Br⁺) to specific positions. We can classify them into two main categories:\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho (positions 2 and 6) and para (position 4) positions. They will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) **-CH₃** (Toluene): Activating group.\n    *   5) **-C₂H₅** (Ethylbenzene): Activating group.\n    *   3) **-Cl** (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating group, but still an ortho, para-director.\n\n*   **Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta (positions 3 and 5) positions. They are all deactivating and will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) **-NO₂** (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating.\n    *   6) **-COOH** (Benzoic acid): Deactivating.\n    *   2) **-COOC₂H₅** (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating.\n\nBased on this classification, the substances with meta-directing groups (4, 6, 2) will have the lowest yields of the para-isomer and will come first in the sequence. The substances with ortho, para-directing groups (1, 5, 3) will have the highest yields and will come last.\n\n**Step 2: Order the meta-directing substances (4, 6, 2).**\nFor these substances, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, which means it will produce an even smaller amount of the minor para-product.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is generally accepted as: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of this: **Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**.\n*   This gives the first part of our sequence: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the ortho, para-directing substances (1, 5, 3).**\nFor these substances, we need to compare the ratio of the para-isomer to the ortho-isomer. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH₃ (1) and -C₂H₅ (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, making the remote para position more accessible. Consequently, ethylbenzene gives a higher proportion of the para-isomer than toluene. So, the order is **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** The chloro group is deactivating due to its strong inductive effect, which withdraws electron density. This effect is felt most strongly at the ortho positions. This electronic factor, combined with the steric size of the chlorine atom, leads to a very high preference for the para-isomer. Experimental data shows that the bromination of chlorobenzene yields a very high percentage of the para-isomer (around 87-89%), which is higher than that for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n\n*   Combining these points, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n*   This gives the second part of our sequence: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the two groups to get the final order.**\nWe combine the order of the meta-directors with the order of the ortho, para-directors.\n\n*   Meta-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Ortho, para-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThe final combined order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\n\nFirst, we must classify the substituent on each benzene ring (C6H5-) as either an *ortho, para*-director or a *meta*-director. This is the most critical factor in determining the yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **Meta-Directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the meta position. They are all deactivating and will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) **-NO₂** (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n    *   6) **-COOH** (Benzoic acid): Deactivating, *meta*-director.\n    *   2) **-COOC₂H₅** (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) **-CH₃** (Toluene): Activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   5) **-C₂H₅** (Ethylbenzene): Activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   3) **-Cl** (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating, but *ortho, para*-director.\n\nBased on this classification, the three meta-directing substances (4, 6, 2) will have the lowest para-isomer yields, and the three ortho, para-directing substances (1, 5, 3) will have the highest yields. The final sequence must follow the pattern: `{4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}`.\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directors (Lowest Para Yield)**\n\nFor the meta-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer is extremely low. The order among them is determined by their deactivating strength. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the *meta* position, and thus produces an even smaller fraction of the *para* isomer.\n\nThe established order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅\n\nTherefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order of their deactivating strength:\nYield(para-NO₂) < Yield(para-COOH) < Yield(para-COOC₂H₅)\n\nSo, the order for these three substances is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (Highest Para Yield)**\n\nFor the ortho, para-directing groups, we need to compare the ratio of the para-isomer to the ortho-isomer. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **-CH₃ (1) vs. -C₂H₅ (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased steric bulk hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent *ortho* positions, thus increasing the proportion of substitution at the less hindered *para* position. Therefore, the yield of the para-isomer from ethylbenzene is greater than that from toluene.\n    *   Order: **1 < 5**\n\n*   **-Cl (3) vs. Alkyl Groups (1, 5):** The chloro group is an *o,p*-director, but it is deactivating due to its strong inductive electron-withdrawing effect (-I effect). This -I effect is felt more strongly at the *ortho* positions than at the more distant *para* position. This electronic effect, combined with sterics, strongly favors the formation of the *para*-isomer. Experimental data shows that the bromination of chlorobenzene yields about 87-89% of the para-isomer, which is a very high selectivity, higher than that for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene (~70%).\n    *   Order: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Orders**\n\nNow, we combine the two groups. The para-isomer yield for any *o,p*-director is significantly higher than for any *m*-director.\n\n*   Order of *m*-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Order of *o,p*-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nCombining them gives the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\n\nFirst, we categorize the substituents on the benzene ring (C6H5-) based on whether they direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the *meta* position or the *ortho* and *para* positions.\n\n*   **Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position. Consequently, they will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) **-NO₂** (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating.\n    *   6) **-COOH** (Benzoic acid): Deactivating.\n    *   2) **-COOC₂H₅** (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) **-CH₃** (Toluene): Activating.\n    *   5) **-C₂H₅** (Ethylbenzene): Activating.\n    *   3) **-Cl** (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating, but ortho, para-directing.\n\nBased on this classification, the three meta-directing substances (4, 6, 2) will have the lowest para-isomer yields, and the three ortho, para-directing substances (1, 5, 3) will have the highest.\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (Lowest Para Yield)**\n\nFor the meta-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the para product.\n\nThe established order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅\n\nTherefore, the order of *increasing* para-isomer yield is the reverse of this:\n**4 (-NO₂) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC₂H₅)**\n\nThis establishes the first part of our sequence: `4 < 6 < 2`.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (Highest Para Yield)**\n\nFor these substances, we need to compare the ratio of the para-isomer to the ortho-isomer. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH₃ (1) and -C₂H₅ (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine electrophile to the adjacent *ortho* positions, making the remote *para* position more accessible. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher proportion of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** The chloro group is a special case. While it is deactivating overall due to its strong inductive effect, it is an ortho, para-director. This inductive effect is felt most strongly at the ortho positions, making them less reactive than the para position. This electronic effect, combined with the steric size of the chlorine atom, leads to a very high preference for the para-isomer. Experimental data shows that the bromination of chlorobenzene yields a very high percentage of the para-isomer (around 87%), which is higher than that for both toluene (around 67%) and ethylbenzene.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\n**1 (-CH₃) < 5 (-C₂H₅) < 3 (-Cl)**\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Orders to Get the Final Sequence**\n\nWe combine the two ordered groups. The meta-directing substances have the lowest para-yields, followed by the ortho, para-directing substances.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe final combined order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe first step is to determine whether each substituent directs the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the *meta* position or the *ortho* and *para* positions.\n\n*   **Meta-Directors:** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) **-NO₂** (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating.\n    *   6) **-COOH** (Benzoic acid): Deactivating.\n    *   2) **-COOC₂H₅** (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) **-CH₃** (Toluene): Activating.\n    *   5) **-C₂H₅** (Ethylbenzene): Activating.\n    *   3) **-Cl** (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating, but ortho, para-directing.\n\nBased on this classification, the three meta-directing substances (4, 6, 2) will have the lowest para-isomer yields, and the three ortho, para-directing substances (1, 5, 3) will have the highest yields.\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directors (Lowest Para Yield)**\nFor the meta-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely proportional to the strength of the deactivating effect. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the minor para product.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n\nTherefore, the order of *increasing* para-isomer yield for this group is the reverse:\n**Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (Highest Para Yield)**\nFor these substances, we need to compare the ratio of the para-isomer to the ortho-isomer. This is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH₃ (1) and -C₂H₅ (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, making the remote para position more accessible. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher proportion of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)**.\n\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** The chloro group is deactivating due to its strong inductive effect, which withdraws electron density. This effect is felt most strongly at the ortho positions. This electronic factor, combined with the steric hindrance of the chlorine atom, leads to a very high preference for the para-isomer. The para-isomer is the major product by a large margin (experimental data shows ~87% yield for bromination). This percentage is higher than for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene. The order is: **Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n\nCombining these, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\n**Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Orders to Get the Final Sequence**\nNow, we combine the two groups. The meta-directing substances have the lowest yields, followed by the ortho, para-directing substances.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThe final combined order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided candidate answers and chemical principles.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Problem**\n\nThe task is to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield after electrophilic bromination. This requires understanding the directing effects of different functional groups.\n\nThe substances are:\n1.  `C6H5-CH3` (Toluene)\n2.  `C6H5-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate)\n3.  `C6H5-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n4.  `C6H5-NO2` (Nitrobenzene)\n5.  `C6H5-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene)\n6.  `C6H5-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n\n### **2. Classify Substituents and Group Them**\n\nThe first step, agreed upon by nearly all candidate answers, is to classify the substituents as either *meta-directing* or *ortho,para-directing*.\n\n*   **Meta-Directors (Low Para-Yield):** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. The yield of the para-isomer will be very low.\n    *   4) `-NO2` (Nitro)\n    *   6) `-COOH` (Carboxylic acid)\n    *   2) `-COOC2H5` (Ester)\n\n*   **Ortho,Para-Directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The yield of the para-isomer will be significant.\n    *   1) `-CH3` (Methyl)\n    *   5) `-C2H5` (Ethyl)\n    *   3) `-Cl` (Chloro)\n\nThis means the final sequence must have the meta-directors (4, 6, 2) first, followed by the ortho,para-directors (1, 5, 3).\n\n### **3. Order the Meta-Directors**\n\nThe yield of the minor para-product for meta-directors is inversely related to the group's deactivating strength. A stronger deactivating group is a more effective meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse: `4 < 6 < 2`.\n\nThis establishes the beginning of the sequence as **`4 < 6 < 2 ...`**.\n\n### **4. Order the Ortho,Para-Directors**\n\nFor this group, we need to compare the ratio of the para-isomer to the ortho-isomer. This is influenced by steric and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 vs. 5):** The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`). This increased bulk hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, thus increasing the proportion of substitution at the less hindered para position. Therefore, the para-yield for ethylbenzene (5) is greater than for toluene (1). The order is **`1 < 5`**.\n*   **Comparing with the Halogen (3):** The chloro group (`-Cl`) is known to be highly para-directing. Its strong inductive electron-withdrawing effect is felt more strongly at the ortho positions than at the more distant para position. This electronic effect, combined with sterics, strongly favors the formation of the para-isomer, often with a higher yield than for alkylbenzenes. Therefore, the para-yield for chlorobenzene (3) is the highest in this group. The order is **`5 < 3`**.\n\nCombining these gives the order for the high-yield group: **`... < 1 < 5 < 3`**.\n\n### **5. Combine the Groups and Select the Final Answer**\n\nCombining the two ordered groups gives the complete sequence of increasing para-isomer yield:\n\n**`4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`**\n\nNow, we compare this derived sequence to the given options:\nA) `3<5<1<6<2<4`\nB) `4<6<2<1<5<3`\nC) `4<2<6<3<1<5`\nD) `6<2<4<5<1<3`\n\nThe derived sequence **`4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`** perfectly matches option **B**. A review of the candidate answers shows that while many correctly deduced this chemical sequence, several made errors in matching it to the correct letter option. The answers that correctly identified option B (e.g., Answers 2, 7, 8, 16, 17) provide the most accurate and complete solution.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nTo determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction, a step-by-step analysis of the substituents' effects is required.\n\n**Step 1: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\n\nFirst, we categorize the substituents on the benzene ring (C6H5-) into two main groups: those that direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the *meta* position and those that direct it to the *ortho* and *para* positions.\n\n*   **Meta-Directors (Deactivating):** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring and direct substitution to the meta position. Consequently, they produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) **-NO₂** (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) **-COOH** (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) **-COOC₂H₅** (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directors:** These groups direct substitution to the ortho and para positions, resulting in a significantly higher yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) **-CH₃** (Toluene): Activating group.\n    *   5) **-C₂H₅** (Ethylbenzene): Activating group.\n    *   3) **-Cl** (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating group, but an ortho, para-director.\n\nThis initial classification tells us that the final sequence will have the meta-directing substances (4, 6, 2) at the beginning (lowest yield), followed by the ortho, para-directing substances (1, 5, 3).\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directors (Lowest Para Yield)**\n\nFor the meta-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the group's deactivating strength. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, which results in an even smaller fraction of the para-product.\n\nThe established order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of this:\n**4 (-NO₂) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC₂H₅)**\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (Highest Para Yield)**\n\nFor this group, we need to compare the ratio of the para-isomer to the ortho-isomer. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH₃ (1) and -C₂H₅ (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine electrophile to the adjacent *ortho* positions, making the less-crowded *para* position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher proportion of the para-isomer than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** The chloro group is a special case. While it deactivates the ring through its inductive effect, it directs ortho and para via resonance. The strong inductive withdrawal is felt more strongly at the closer ortho positions than at the para position. This electronic effect, combined with the chlorine atom's size, strongly favors substitution at the para position. Experimental data shows that halogenation of chlorobenzene gives a very high yield of the para-isomer (e.g., ~87%), which is typically higher than that for toluene (~67%) or ethylbenzene. Therefore, the order is **5 < 3**.\n\nCombining these gives the order of increasing para-yield for this group:\n**1 (-CH₃) < 5 (-C₂H₅) < 3 (-Cl)**\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\n\nBy combining the sorted lists of the two groups, we obtain the final overall order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer.\n\n(Meta-directors) < (Ortho, para-directors)\n**(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**\n\nThe complete sequence is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nTo determine the final answer, I will carefully analyze the chemical principles governing the reaction and cross-reference the reasoning provided by the candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Reaction:** The question asks to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing yield of the *para*-isomer from an electrophilic bromination reaction. The yield of the para-isomer is determined by the directing effect of the substituent already on the benzene ring.\n\n2.  **Classify the Substituents:** The first step is to classify each substituent as either *ortho,para*-directing or *meta*-directing. This classification is the primary determinant of the para-isomer yield.\n\n    *   **Ortho, Para-Directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions.\n        *   1) **-CH₃** (Toluene): Activating\n        *   5) **-C₂H₅** (Ethylbenzene): Activating\n        *   3) **-Cl** (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating\n\n    *   **Meta-Directors (Low Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the meta position, resulting in a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n        *   4) **-NO₂** (Nitrobenzene): Strongly Deactivating\n        *   6) **-COOH** (Benzoic acid): Deactivating\n        *   2) **-COOC₂H₅** (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating\n\n    This initial grouping establishes that substances 4, 6, and 2 will have the lowest para-yields, while substances 1, 5, and 3 will have the highest.\n\n3.  **Order the Meta-Directors (Lowest Yields):**\n    For the meta-directing groups (4, 6, 2), the yield of the para-isomer is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, leading to an even smaller percentage of the para product.\n    *   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of this strength: Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\n    *   The beginning of our sequence is **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n4.  **Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (Highest Yields):**\n    For the ortho, para-directing groups (1, 5, 3), we need to compare the ratio of the para-isomer to the ortho-isomer. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n    *   **-CH₃ (1) vs. -C₂H₅ (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent *ortho* positions, making the less-hindered *para* position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher yield of the para-isomer than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n    *   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** Halogens like chlorine are a special case. While deactivating overall, they strongly favor the para position in electrophilic substitution. This is due to a combination of the chlorine atom's size and its strong inductive electron-withdrawal, which deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. Experimental data consistently shows that the bromination of chlorobenzene gives a very high percentage of the para-isomer (often ~87%), which is higher than for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n    *   The end of our sequence is **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n5.  **Combine the Orders and Determine the Final Answer:**\n    We combine the two ordered groups:\n    *   (Low-yield group) < (High-yield group)\n    *   (4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\n    The complete sequence for the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield is:\n    **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\n    This sequence corresponds exactly to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Classify the Substituents and their Directing Effects**\n\nThe first step is to classify the substituent on each benzene ring. This determines whether the incoming bromine electrophile will be directed to the *ortho/para* positions or the *meta* position.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups will produce a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) **-CH₃** (Toluene): Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   5) **-C₂H₅** (Ethylbenzene): Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   3) **-Cl** (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating, but o,p-director.\n\n*   **Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer, with the meta-isomer being the major product.\n    *   4) **-NO₂** (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating, m-director.\n    *   6) **-COOH** (Benzoic acid): Deactivating, m-director.\n    *   2) **-COOC₂H₅** (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating, m-director.\n\nThis initial classification tells us that the substances with meta-directing groups (4, 6, 2) will have the lowest para-isomer yields, and the substances with ortho, para-directing groups (1, 5, 3) will have the highest yields.\n\n**2. Order the Meta-Directing Groups (Lowest Para Yield)**\n\nFor the meta-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the minor para product.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse: **Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**.\n\nThis establishes the first part of the sequence: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**3. Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Groups (Highest Para Yield)**\n\nFor these groups, we need to compare the ratio of the para product to the ortho product. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH₃ (1) and -C₂H₅ (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine electrophile to the adjacent *ortho* positions, making the remote *para* position more accessible. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher proportion of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** The chloro group is a special case. While it deactivates the ring, it strongly favors substitution at the para position. This is due to a combination of its size and its strong inductive electron-withdrawing effect, which is felt more strongly at the closer ortho positions, making them less favorable for attack than the para position. Experimental data shows that chlorination or bromination of chlorobenzene results in a very high para-isomer yield, typically higher than that for toluene and ethylbenzene.\n\n*   Combining these points, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n\n**4. Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\n\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the complete sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n(Low para-yield group) < (High para-yield group)\n**(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**\n\nThe final, complete order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### **Step 1: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\n\nThe first step is to classify the substituent on each benzene ring as either an *ortho, para*-director or a *meta*-director. This classification is the primary determinant of the para-isomer yield.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions, resulting in a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) **-CH₃** (Toluene): Activating group.\n    *   5) **-C₂H₅** (Ethylbenzene): Activating group.\n    *   3) **-Cl** (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating group, but directs ortho, para.\n\n*   **Meta-Directors (Low Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. The yield of the para-isomer is consequently very low.\n    *   4) **-NO₂** (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating.\n    *   6) **-COOH** (Benzoic acid): Deactivating.\n    *   2) **-COOC₂H₅** (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating.\n\nBased on this initial classification, we know that the substances with meta-directing groups (4, 6, 2) will have the lowest para-isomer yields, and the substances with ortho, para-directing groups (1, 5, 3) will have the highest yields. The final correct sequence must list {4, 6, 2} before {1, 5, 3}.\n\n### **Step 2: Order the Meta-Directors**\n\nFor the meta-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer is extremely low. The order among them is determined by their deactivating strength. A stronger deactivating group is a more effective meta-director, which means it will produce an even smaller amount of the para-isomer.\n\nThe established order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅\n\nTherefore, the order of *increasing* para-isomer yield is the reverse of this:\nYield(para-NO₂) < Yield(para-COOH) < Yield(para-COOC₂H₅)\n\nThis gives the order for the first three substances: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### **Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors**\n\nFor the ortho, para-directing groups, we need to compare the ratio of the para-isomer to the ortho-isomer. This is primarily influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **-CH₃ (1) vs. -C₂H₅ (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent *ortho* positions, making the less-crowded *para* position more favorable. Therefore, ethylbenzene (5) will produce a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **-Cl (3) vs. Alkyl Groups (1, 5):** The chloro group is deactivating due to its strong inductive effect, but it directs ortho, para due to resonance. The deactivating inductive effect is felt more strongly at the closer ortho positions than at the para position. This electronic factor, combined with the steric size of the chlorine atom, strongly favors substitution at the para position. Experimental data shows that the bromination of chlorobenzene gives a very high yield of the para-isomer (around 87%), which is significantly higher than that for toluene (around 67%) or ethylbenzene.\n\nCombining these points, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### **Step 4: Combine the Orders and Determine the Final Answer**\n\nNow, we combine the two ordered groups. The para-isomer yield for any ortho, para-director is significantly higher than for any meta-director.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nCombining them gives the final sequence for the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence corresponds exactly to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe code successfully determined the order of substances based on increasing para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination.\n\nThe process involved two main steps:\n1.  **Grouping and Sorting Meta-Directors**: The substances with meta-directing groups (-NO₂, -COOH, -COOC₂H₅) were identified as having the lowest para-yield. They were sorted based on the inverse of their deactivating strength, resulting in the order: Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\n2.  **Grouping and Sorting Ortho/Para-Directors**: The substances with ortho/para-directing groups (-CH₃, -C₂H₅, -Cl) were identified as having the highest para-yield. They were sorted based on steric and electronic effects that favor the para position, resulting in the order: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\nCombining these two sorted groups produced the final sequence `[4, 6, 2, 1, 5, 3]`. The code then correctly matched this sequence to the provided multiple-choice options, identifying it as option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### **1. Understand the Goal**\nThe task is to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-bromo derivative formed during electrophilic bromination. This order depends on the electronic and steric properties of the substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n### **2. Classify the Substituents**\nFirst, we must classify each substituent based on its directing effect in electrophilic aromatic substitution. This is the most crucial step.\n\n*   **Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the meta position. Consequently, they produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   **4) C6H5-NO₂:** The nitro group (-NO₂) is strongly deactivating.\n    *   **6) C6H5-COOH:** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is deactivating.\n    *   **2) C6H5-COOC₂H₅:** The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is deactivating.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer.\n    *   **1) C6H5-CH₃:** The methyl group (-CH₃) is activating.\n    *   **5) C6H5-C₂H₅:** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is activating.\n    *   **3) C6H5-Cl:** The chloro group (-Cl) is deactivating but directs ortho, para.\n\nBased on this classification, the three meta-directing substances (4, 6, 2) will have the lowest para-isomer yields and will come first in the sequence. The three ortho, para-directing substances (1, 5, 3) will have the highest yields and will come last.\n\n### **3. Order the Meta-Directors (Lowest Para Yield)**\nFor the meta-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the group's deactivating strength. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the minor para product.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of this: **Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**.\n\nThis gives us the beginning of the sequence: **4 < 6 < 2 ...**\n\n### **4. Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (Highest Para Yield)**\nFor these groups, we need to compare the ratio of the para product to the ortho product. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH₃ (1) and -C₂H₅ (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, making the remote para position more accessible. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher proportion of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)**.\n\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** The chloro group is a special case. While it is deactivating overall (due to its inductive effect), it directs ortho, para (due to resonance). The strong inductive electron withdrawal is felt most strongly at the ortho positions, making them less reactive than the more distant para position. This electronic effect, combined with the steric size of the chlorine atom, leads to a very high preference for the para-isomer. Experimental data shows that the bromination of chlorobenzene yields a very high percentage of the para-product (around 87-89%), which is higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n\n### **5. Combine the Orders**\nNow, we combine the two sorted groups. The para-yield for any ortho, para-director is significantly higher than for any meta-director.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nCombining them gives the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe task is to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during an electrophilic bromination reaction. This order depends on the electronic and steric properties of the substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents**\nThe first step is to classify each substituent as either an *ortho, para-director* or a *meta-director*. This is the most critical factor in determining the yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) `-CH₃` (Toluene)\n    *   5) `-C₂H₅` (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) `-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n\n*   **Meta-Directors (Low Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor product, with a yield close to zero.\n    *   4) `-NO₂` (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) `-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) `-COOC₂H₅` (Ethyl benzoate)\n\nBased on this classification, the three meta-directing compounds (4, 6, 2) will have the lowest para-isomer yields, and the three ortho, para-directing compounds (1, 5, 3) will have the highest. The final correct sequence must place all meta-directors before all ortho, para-directors.\n\n**3. Order the Meta-Directors (Lowest Yields)**\nFor the meta-directing groups, the yield of the minor para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the para product.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: `-NO₂` > `-COOH` > `-COOC₂H₅`.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of this: Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\n*   The beginning of our sequence is **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**4. Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (Highest Yields)**\nFor these groups, we need to compare the ratio of the para product to the ortho product. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing `-CH₃` (1) and `-C₂H₅` (5):** The ethyl group (`-C₂H₅`) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH₃`). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, making the remote para position more accessible. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher proportion of the para-isomer than toluene. This gives the order: **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with `-Cl` (3):** Halogens like chlorine are a special case.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### **Step 1: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\n\nThe first and most important step is to classify the substituent on each benzene ring as either an *ortho, para*-director or a *meta*-director. This classification is the primary determinant of the para-isomer yield.\n\n*   **Meta-Directors (Low Para-Yield):** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the meta position. The yield of the para-isomer will be very low.\n    *   4) **-NO₂** (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) **-COOH** (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) **-COOC₂H₅** (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The yield of the para-isomer will be significant.\n    *   1) **-CH₃** (Toluene)\n    *   5) **-C₂H₅** (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) **-Cl** (Chlorobenzene)\n\nBased on this classification, the three meta-directing substances (4, 6, 2) will have the lowest para-isomer yields, while the three ortho, para-directing substances (1, 5, 3) will have the highest yields. The final sequence must have the meta-directors listed before the ortho, para-directors.\n\n### **Step 2: Order the Meta-Directors (Lowest Para Yield)**\n\nFor the meta-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the minor para-product.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n*   Therefore, the order of *increasing* para-isomer yield is the reverse of this: **Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**.\n\nThis establishes the first part of the sequence: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### **Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (Highest Para Yield)**\n\nFor the ortho, para-directing groups, we need to compare the ratio of the para-isomer to the ortho-isomer. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH₃ (1) and -C₂H₅ (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, making the remote para position more accessible. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher proportion of the para-isomer than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** The chloro group is a special case. While it is deactivating overall due to its strong inductive effect, it is an ortho, para-director. This inductive effect is felt most strongly at the ortho positions, making them less reactive than the para position. This electronic effect, combined with the steric size of the chlorine atom, leads to a very high preference for the para-isomer. Experimental data shows that the bromination of chlorobenzene yields a very high percentage of the para-isomer (around 87-89%), which is higher than that for both toluene (around 67%) and ethylbenzene. Therefore, the order is **5 < 3**.\n\nCombining these points, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### **Step 4: Combine the Orders and Select the Final Answer**\n\nNow, we combine the two ordered groups. The para-isomer yield for any ortho, para-director is significantly higher than for any meta-director.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThe final combined order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nComparing this sequence to the given options:\nA) 3<5<1<6<2<4\nB) 4<6<2<1<5<3\nC) 4<2<6<3<1<5\nD) 6<2<4<5<1<3\n\nThe derived sequence perfectly matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"

The goal is to arrange them by the increasing yield of the *para*-isomer. This depends on two main factors:\n1.  **Directing Effect:** Substituents are either *ortho,para-directing* or *meta-directing*. Meta-directors will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer, while ortho,para-directors will produce a significant amount.\n2.  **Para/Ortho Ratio:** For ortho,para-directors, the ratio of the para product to the ortho product determines the final para yield. This is influenced by steric hindrance (larger groups favor the less crowded para position) and electronic effects.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Substituents**\nFirst, we must classify the substituent on each benzene ring:\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directors (High Para Yield):**\n    *   1) `-CH₃` (Toluene): Activating\n    *   5) `-C₂H₅` (Ethylbenzene): Activating\n    *   3) `-Cl` (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating\n*   **Meta-Directors (Low Para Yield):**\n    *   4) `-NO₂` (Nitrobenzene): Strongly Deactivating\n    *   6) `-COOH` (Benzoic acid): Deactivating\n    *   2) `-COOC₂H₅` (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating\n\nThis classification immediately tells us that the final sequence will have substances {4, 6, 2} at the beginning (lowest yield) and substances {1, 5, 3} at the end (highest yield).\n\n**Step 3: Order the Meta-Directors (Lowest Para Yield)**\nFor substances 4, 6, and 2, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the minor para product.\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: `-NO₂` > `-COOH` > `-COOC₂H₅`.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (Highest Para Yield)**\nFor substances 1, 5, and 3, we must compare their preference for the para position.\n*   **Comparing Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5):** The ethyl group (`-C₂H₅`) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH₃`). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine electrophile to the adjacent *ortho* positions, making the remote *para* position more accessible. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher proportion of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with Chlorobenzene (3):** The chloro group (`-Cl`) is deactivating due to its strong inductive effect but is an ortho,para-director due to resonance. The deactivating inductive effect is felt most strongly at the ortho positions, which disfavors ortho substitution relative to para substitution. This electronic effect, combined with the steric size of the chlorine atom, leads to a very high preference for the para-isomer. Experimental data shows that bromination of chlorobenzene yields about 87% para-isomer, which is significantly higher than for toluene (approx. 67%). Therefore, chlorobenzene has the highest para yield in this group. The order is **5 < 3**.\n\nCombining these findings, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Orders and Determine the Final Answer**\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the complete sequence:\n*   (Low para-yield group) < (High para-yield group)\n*   **(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**\n\nThe final combined order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence corresponds exactly to option B. A majority of the candidate answers that performed a step-by-step analysis derived this same sequence, even if some of them made a mistake in selecting the final letter. The chemical reasoning is sound and consistent.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction, a step-by-step analysis of the substituents' effects is required.\n\n**Step 1: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\nFirst, we separate the substituents into two groups based on whether they direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the *meta* position or the *ortho* and *para* positions.\n\n*   **Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups are deactivating and will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer. The major product will be the meta-isomer.\n    *   4) `-NO₂` (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) `-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) `-COOC₂H₅` (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups will produce a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) `-CH₃` (Toluene)\n    *   5) `-C₂H₅` (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) `-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n\nThis initial classification establishes that the substances with meta-directing groups (4, 6, 2) will have the lowest para-isomer yields and will appear first in the final sequence.\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Groups (4, 6, 2)**\nFor these substances, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A more strongly deactivating group will direct more exclusively to the meta position, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\nThe established order of deactivating strength is:\n`-NO₂` > `-COOH` > `-COOC₂H₅`\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of this:\n**4 < 6 < 2**\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Groups (1, 5, 3)**\nFor these substances, we need to compare the ratio of the para-isomer to the ortho-isomer. This is influenced by both steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH₃ (1) and -C₂H₅ (5):** The ethyl group (`-C₂H₅`) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH₃`). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine electrophile to the adjacent *ortho* positions. Consequently, substitution at the less hindered *para* position is more favored for ethylbenzene than for toluene. This means the para-isomer yield is higher for ethylbenzene.\n    *   Order: **1 < 5**\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1, 5) with -Cl (3):** The chloro group is deactivating due to its strong inductive electron withdrawal, but it directs to the ortho and para positions via resonance. The inductive effect is strongest at the ortho positions, which disfavors ortho attack more than para attack. This electronic effect, combined with the steric size of the chlorine atom, leads to a very high preference for the para-isomer. Experimental data shows that the bromination of chlorobenzene yields about 87% of the para-isomer, which is a higher percentage than that obtained from either toluene (approx. 67%) or ethylbenzene.\n    *   Order: **5 < 3**\n\nCombining these findings, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\n**1 < 5 < 3**\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Orders**\nBy combining the two ranked groups, we obtain the final overall order. The meta-directors have the lowest yields, followed by the ortho, para-directors.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThe complete sequence is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### **Step 1: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\n\nFirst, we must classify the substituent on each benzene ring as either an *ortho, para*-director or a *meta*-director. This is the primary factor determining the yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) **-CH₃** (Toluene): Activating\n    *   5) **-C₂H₅** (Ethylbenzene): Activating\n    *   3) **-Cl** (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating, but o,p-directing\n\n*   **Meta-Directors (Low Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position, resulting in a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) **-NO₂** (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating\n    *   6) **-COOH** (Benzoic acid): Deactivating\n    *   2) **-COOC₂H₅** (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating\n\nBased on this classification, the three meta-directing substances (4, 6, 2) will have the lowest para-isomer yields, while the three ortho, para-directing substances (1, 5, 3) will have the highest yields. The final sequence will be `{4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}`.\n\n### **Step 2: Order the Meta-Directors**\n\nFor the meta-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the minor para-product.\n\nThe established order of deactivating strength is:\n**-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**\n\nTherefore, the order of *increasing* para-isomer yield is the reverse:\n**Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**\n\n### **Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors**\n\nFor the ortho, para-directing groups, we need to compare the ratio of the para-isomer to the ortho-isomer. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH₃ (1) and -C₂H₅ (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, making the remote para position more accessible. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher proportion of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   Order: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)**\n\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** The chloro group is deactivating due to its strong inductive effect, which is felt most strongly at the ortho positions. This electronic effect disfavors ortho substitution more than para substitution. This, combined with the steric hindrance of the chlorine atom, leads to a very high preference for the para-isomer. Experimental data shows that bromination of chlorobenzene yields about 89% of the para-isomer, which is a higher percentage than for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n    *   Order: **Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**\n\nCombining these, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\n**Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**\n\n### **Step 4: Combine the Orders**\n\nNow, we combine the two sorted groups. The para-isomer yield for any o,p-director is significantly higher than for any m-director.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThe final combined order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct order.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents based on their directing effects.**\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, substituents on the benzene ring direct the incoming electrophile (in this case, Br⁺) to specific positions. We can classify them into two main categories:\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho (positions 2 and 6) and para (position 4) positions. They will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) **-CH₃** (Toluene): Activating group.\n    *   5) **-C₂H₅** (Ethylbenzene): Activating group.\n    *   3) **-Cl** (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating group, but still an ortho, para-director.\n\n*   **Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta (positions 3 and 5) positions. They are all deactivating and will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) **-NO₂** (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating.\n    *   6) **-COOH** (Benzoic acid): Deactivating.\n    *   2) **-COOC₂H₅** (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating.\n\nBased on this classification, the substances with meta-directing groups (4, 6, 2) will have the lowest yields of the para-isomer and will come first in the sequence. The substances with ortho, para-directing groups (1, 5, 3) will have the highest yields and will come last.\n\n**Step 2: Order the meta-directing substances (4, 6, 2).**\nFor these substances, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, which means it will produce an even smaller amount of the minor para-product.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is generally accepted as: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of this: **Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**.\n*   This gives the first part of our sequence: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the ortho, para-directing substances (1, 5, 3).**\nFor these substances, we need to compare the ratio of the para-isomer to the ortho-isomer. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH₃ (1) and -C₂H₅ (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, making the remote para position more accessible. Consequently, ethylbenzene gives a higher proportion of the para-isomer than toluene. So, the order is **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** The chloro group is deactivating due to its strong inductive effect, which withdraws electron density. This effect is felt most strongly at the ortho positions. This electronic factor, combined with the steric size of the chlorine atom, leads to a very high preference for the para-isomer. Experimental data shows that the bromination of chlorobenzene yields a very high percentage of the para-isomer (around 87-89%), which is higher than that for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n\n*   Combining these points, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n*   This gives the second part of our sequence: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the two groups to get the final order.**\nWe combine the order of the meta-directors with the order of the ortho, para-directors.\n\n*   Meta-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Ortho, para-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThe final combined order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\n\nFirst, we must classify the substituent on each benzene ring (C6H5-) as either an *ortho, para*-director or a *meta*-director. This is the most critical factor in determining the yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **Meta-Directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the meta position. They are all deactivating and will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) **-NO₂** (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n    *   6) **-COOH** (Benzoic acid): Deactivating, *meta*-director.\n    *   2) **-COOC₂H₅** (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) **-CH₃** (Toluene): Activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   5) **-C₂H₅** (Ethylbenzene): Activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   3) **-Cl** (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating, but *ortho, para*-director.\n\nBased on this classification, the three meta-directing substances (4, 6, 2) will have the lowest para-isomer yields, and the three ortho, para-directing substances (1, 5, 3) will have the highest yields. The final sequence must follow the pattern: `{4, 6, 2} < {1, 5, 3}`.\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directors (Lowest Para Yield)**\n\nFor the meta-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer is extremely low. The order among them is determined by their deactivating strength. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the *meta* position, and thus produces an even smaller fraction of the *para* isomer.\n\nThe established order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅\n\nTherefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order of their deactivating strength:\nYield(para-NO₂) < Yield(para-COOH) < Yield(para-COOC₂H₅)\n\nSo, the order for these three substances is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (Highest Para Yield)**\n\nFor the ortho, para-directing groups, we need to compare the ratio of the para-isomer to the ortho-isomer. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **-CH₃ (1) vs. -C₂H₅ (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased steric bulk hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent *ortho* positions, thus increasing the proportion of substitution at the less hindered *para* position. Therefore, the yield of the para-isomer from ethylbenzene is greater than that from toluene.\n    *   Order: **1 < 5**\n\n*   **-Cl (3) vs. Alkyl Groups (1, 5):** The chloro group is an *o,p*-director, but it is deactivating due to its strong inductive electron-withdrawing effect (-I effect). This -I effect is felt more strongly at the *ortho* positions than at the more distant *para* position. This electronic effect, combined with sterics, strongly favors the formation of the *para*-isomer. Experimental data shows that the bromination of chlorobenzene yields about 87-89% of the para-isomer, which is a very high selectivity, higher than that for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene (~70%).\n    *   Order: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Orders**\n\nNow, we combine the two groups. The para-isomer yield for any *o,p*-director is significantly higher than for any *m*-director.\n\n*   Order of *m*-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Order of *o,p*-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nCombining them gives the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\n\nFirst, we categorize the substituents on the benzene ring (C6H5-) based on whether they direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the *meta* position or the *ortho* and *para* positions.\n\n*   **Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position. Consequently, they will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) **-NO₂** (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating.\n    *   6) **-COOH** (Benzoic acid): Deactivating.\n    *   2) **-COOC₂H₅** (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) **-CH₃** (Toluene): Activating.\n    *   5) **-C₂H₅** (Ethylbenzene): Activating.\n    *   3) **-Cl** (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating, but ortho, para-directing.\n\nBased on this classification, the three meta-directing substances (4, 6, 2) will have the lowest para-isomer yields, and the three ortho, para-directing substances (1, 5, 3) will have the highest.\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (Lowest Para Yield)**\n\nFor the meta-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the para product.\n\nThe established order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅\n\nTherefore, the order of *increasing* para-isomer yield is the reverse of this:\n**4 (-NO₂) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC₂H₅)**\n\nThis establishes the first part of our sequence: `4 < 6 < 2`.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (Highest Para Yield)**\n\nFor these substances, we need to compare the ratio of the para-isomer to the ortho-isomer. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH₃ (1) and -C₂H₅ (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine electrophile to the adjacent *ortho* positions, making the remote *para* position more accessible. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher proportion of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** The chloro group is a special case. While it is deactivating overall due to its strong inductive effect, it is an ortho, para-director. This inductive effect is felt most strongly at the ortho positions, making them less reactive than the para position. This electronic effect, combined with the steric size of the chlorine atom, leads to a very high preference for the para-isomer. Experimental data shows that the bromination of chlorobenzene yields a very high percentage of the para-isomer (around 87%), which is higher than that for both toluene (around 67%) and ethylbenzene.\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\n**1 (-CH₃) < 5 (-C₂H₅) < 3 (-Cl)**\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Orders to Get the Final Sequence**\n\nWe combine the two ordered groups. The meta-directing substances have the lowest para-yields, followed by the ortho, para-directing substances.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: `4 < 6 < 2`\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: `1 < 5 < 3`\n\nThe final combined order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\nThe first step is to determine whether each substituent directs the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the *meta* position or the *ortho* and *para* positions.\n\n*   **Meta-Directors:** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) **-NO₂** (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating.\n    *   6) **-COOH** (Benzoic acid): Deactivating.\n    *   2) **-COOC₂H₅** (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) **-CH₃** (Toluene): Activating.\n    *   5) **-C₂H₅** (Ethylbenzene): Activating.\n    *   3) **-Cl** (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating, but ortho, para-directing.\n\nBased on this classification, the three meta-directing substances (4, 6, 2) will have the lowest para-isomer yields, and the three ortho, para-directing substances (1, 5, 3) will have the highest yields.\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directors (Lowest Para Yield)**\nFor the meta-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely proportional to the strength of the deactivating effect. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the minor para product.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n\nTherefore, the order of *increasing* para-isomer yield for this group is the reverse:\n**Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (Highest Para Yield)**\nFor these substances, we need to compare the ratio of the para-isomer to the ortho-isomer. This is influenced by steric and electronic factors.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH₃ (1) and -C₂H₅ (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, making the remote para position more accessible. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher proportion of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)**.\n\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** The chloro group is deactivating due to its strong inductive effect, which withdraws electron density. This effect is felt most strongly at the ortho positions. This electronic factor, combined with the steric hindrance of the chlorine atom, leads to a very high preference for the para-isomer. The para-isomer is the major product by a large margin (experimental data shows ~87% yield for bromination). This percentage is higher than for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene. The order is: **Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n\nCombining these, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\n**Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Orders to Get the Final Sequence**\nNow, we combine the two groups. The meta-directing substances have the lowest yields, followed by the ortho, para-directing substances.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThe final combined order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided candidate answers and chemical principles.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Problem**\n\nThe task is to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield after electrophilic bromination. This requires understanding the directing effects of different functional groups.\n\nThe substances are:\n1.  `C6H5-CH3` (Toluene)\n2.  `C6H5-COOC2H5` (Ethyl benzoate)\n3.  `C6H5-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n4.  `C6H5-NO2` (Nitrobenzene)\n5.  `C6H5-C2H5` (Ethylbenzene)\n6.  `C6H5-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n\n### **2. Classify Substituents and Group Them**\n\nThe first step, agreed upon by nearly all candidate answers, is to classify the substituents as either *meta-directing* or *ortho,para-directing*.\n\n*   **Meta-Directors (Low Para-Yield):** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. The yield of the para-isomer will be very low.\n    *   4) `-NO2` (Nitro)\n    *   6) `-COOH` (Carboxylic acid)\n    *   2) `-COOC2H5` (Ester)\n\n*   **Ortho,Para-Directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The yield of the para-isomer will be significant.\n    *   1) `-CH3` (Methyl)\n    *   5) `-C2H5` (Ethyl)\n    *   3) `-Cl` (Chloro)\n\nThis means the final sequence must have the meta-directors (4, 6, 2) first, followed by the ortho,para-directors (1, 5, 3).\n\n### **3. Order the Meta-Directors**\n\nThe yield of the minor para-product for meta-directors is inversely related to the group's deactivating strength. A stronger deactivating group is a more effective meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: `-NO2` > `-COOH` > `-COOC2H5`.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse: `4 < 6 < 2`.\n\nThis establishes the beginning of the sequence as **`4 < 6 < 2 ...`**.\n\n### **4. Order the Ortho,Para-Directors**\n\nFor this group, we need to compare the ratio of the para-isomer to the ortho-isomer. This is influenced by steric and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 vs. 5):** The ethyl group (`-C2H5`) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH3`). This increased bulk hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, thus increasing the proportion of substitution at the less hindered para position. Therefore, the para-yield for ethylbenzene (5) is greater than for toluene (1). The order is **`1 < 5`**.\n*   **Comparing with the Halogen (3):** The chloro group (`-Cl`) is known to be highly para-directing. Its strong inductive electron-withdrawing effect is felt more strongly at the ortho positions than at the more distant para position. This electronic effect, combined with sterics, strongly favors the formation of the para-isomer, often with a higher yield than for alkylbenzenes. Therefore, the para-yield for chlorobenzene (3) is the highest in this group. The order is **`5 < 3`**.\n\nCombining these gives the order for the high-yield group: **`... < 1 < 5 < 3`**.\n\n### **5. Combine the Groups and Select the Final Answer**\n\nCombining the two ordered groups gives the complete sequence of increasing para-isomer yield:\n\n**`4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`**\n\nNow, we compare this derived sequence to the given options:\nA) `3<5<1<6<2<4`\nB) `4<6<2<1<5<3`\nC) `4<2<6<3<1<5`\nD) `6<2<4<5<1<3`\n\nThe derived sequence **`4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3`** perfectly matches option **B**. A review of the candidate answers shows that while many correctly deduced this chemical sequence, several made errors in matching it to the correct letter option. The answers that correctly identified option B (e.g., Answers 2, 7, 8, 16, 17) provide the most accurate and complete solution.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nTo determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction, a step-by-step analysis of the substituents' effects is required.\n\n**Step 1: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect**\n\nFirst, we categorize the substituents on the benzene ring (C6H5-) into two main groups: those that direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the *meta* position and those that direct it to the *ortho* and *para* positions.\n\n*   **Meta-Directors (Deactivating):** These groups withdraw electron density from the ring and direct substitution to the meta position. Consequently, they produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) **-NO₂** (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) **-COOH** (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) **-COOC₂H₅** (Ethyl benzoate)\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directors:** These groups direct substitution to the ortho and para positions, resulting in a significantly higher yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) **-CH₃** (Toluene): Activating group.\n    *   5) **-C₂H₅** (Ethylbenzene): Activating group.\n    *   3) **-Cl** (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating group, but an ortho, para-director.\n\nThis initial classification tells us that the final sequence will have the meta-directing substances (4, 6, 2) at the beginning (lowest yield), followed by the ortho, para-directing substances (1, 5, 3).\n\n**Step 2: Order the Meta-Directors (Lowest Para Yield)**\n\nFor the meta-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the group's deactivating strength. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, which results in an even smaller fraction of the para-product.\n\nThe established order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅\n\nTherefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of this:\n**4 (-NO₂) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC₂H₅)**\n\n**Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (Highest Para Yield)**\n\nFor this group, we need to compare the ratio of the para-isomer to the ortho-isomer. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH₃ (1) and -C₂H₅ (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine electrophile to the adjacent *ortho* positions, making the less-crowded *para* position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher proportion of the para-isomer than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** The chloro group is a special case. While it deactivates the ring through its inductive effect, it directs ortho and para via resonance. The strong inductive withdrawal is felt more strongly at the closer ortho positions than at the para position. This electronic effect, combined with the chlorine atom's size, strongly favors substitution at the para position. Experimental data shows that halogenation of chlorobenzene gives a very high yield of the para-isomer (e.g., ~87%), which is typically higher than that for toluene (~67%) or ethylbenzene. Therefore, the order is **5 < 3**.\n\nCombining these gives the order of increasing para-yield for this group:\n**1 (-CH₃) < 5 (-C₂H₅) < 3 (-Cl)**\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\n\nBy combining the sorted lists of the two groups, we obtain the final overall order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer.\n\n(Meta-directors) < (Ortho, para-directors)\n**(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**\n\nThe complete sequence is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nTo determine the final answer, I will carefully analyze the chemical principles governing the reaction and cross-reference the reasoning provided by the candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Reaction:** The question asks to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing yield of the *para*-isomer from an electrophilic bromination reaction. The yield of the para-isomer is determined by the directing effect of the substituent already on the benzene ring.\n\n2.  **Classify the Substituents:** The first step is to classify each substituent as either *ortho,para*-directing or *meta*-directing. This classification is the primary determinant of the para-isomer yield.\n\n    *   **Ortho, Para-Directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions.\n        *   1) **-CH₃** (Toluene): Activating\n        *   5) **-C₂H₅** (Ethylbenzene): Activating\n        *   3) **-Cl** (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating\n\n    *   **Meta-Directors (Low Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the meta position, resulting in a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n        *   4) **-NO₂** (Nitrobenzene): Strongly Deactivating\n        *   6) **-COOH** (Benzoic acid): Deactivating\n        *   2) **-COOC₂H₅** (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating\n\n    This initial grouping establishes that substances 4, 6, and 2 will have the lowest para-yields, while substances 1, 5, and 3 will have the highest.\n\n3.  **Order the Meta-Directors (Lowest Yields):**\n    For the meta-directing groups (4, 6, 2), the yield of the para-isomer is inversely proportional to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, leading to an even smaller percentage of the para product.\n    *   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of this strength: Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\n    *   The beginning of our sequence is **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n4.  **Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (Highest Yields):**\n    For the ortho, para-directing groups (1, 5, 3), we need to compare the ratio of the para-isomer to the ortho-isomer. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n    *   **-CH₃ (1) vs. -C₂H₅ (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent *ortho* positions, making the less-hindered *para* position more favorable. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher yield of the para-isomer than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n    *   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** Halogens like chlorine are a special case. While deactivating overall, they strongly favor the para position in electrophilic substitution. This is due to a combination of the chlorine atom's size and its strong inductive electron-withdrawal, which deactivates the nearby ortho positions more than the distant para position. Experimental data consistently shows that the bromination of chlorobenzene gives a very high percentage of the para-isomer (often ~87%), which is higher than for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene.\n    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n    *   The end of our sequence is **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n5.  **Combine the Orders and Determine the Final Answer:**\n    We combine the two ordered groups:\n    *   (Low-yield group) < (High-yield group)\n    *   (4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\n    The complete sequence for the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield is:\n    **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\n    This sequence corresponds exactly to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Classify the Substituents and their Directing Effects**\n\nThe first step is to classify the substituent on each benzene ring. This determines whether the incoming bromine electrophile will be directed to the *ortho/para* positions or the *meta* position.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups will produce a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) **-CH₃** (Toluene): Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   5) **-C₂H₅** (Ethylbenzene): Activating, o,p-director.\n    *   3) **-Cl** (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating, but o,p-director.\n\n*   **Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups will produce a very low yield of the para-isomer, with the meta-isomer being the major product.\n    *   4) **-NO₂** (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating, m-director.\n    *   6) **-COOH** (Benzoic acid): Deactivating, m-director.\n    *   2) **-COOC₂H₅** (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating, m-director.\n\nThis initial classification tells us that the substances with meta-directing groups (4, 6, 2) will have the lowest para-isomer yields, and the substances with ortho, para-directing groups (1, 5, 3) will have the highest yields.\n\n**2. Order the Meta-Directing Groups (Lowest Para Yield)**\n\nFor the meta-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the minor para product.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse: **Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**.\n\nThis establishes the first part of the sequence: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**3. Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Groups (Highest Para Yield)**\n\nFor these groups, we need to compare the ratio of the para product to the ortho product. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH₃ (1) and -C₂H₅ (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine electrophile to the adjacent *ortho* positions, making the remote *para* position more accessible. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher proportion of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** The chloro group is a special case. While it deactivates the ring, it strongly favors substitution at the para position. This is due to a combination of its size and its strong inductive electron-withdrawing effect, which is felt more strongly at the closer ortho positions, making them less favorable for attack than the para position. Experimental data shows that chlorination or bromination of chlorobenzene results in a very high para-isomer yield, typically higher than that for toluene and ethylbenzene.\n\n*   Combining these points, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n\n**4. Combine the Groups for the Final Order**\n\nBy combining the two ordered groups, we get the complete sequence from the lowest to the highest yield of the para-isomer.\n\n(Low para-yield group) < (High para-yield group)\n**(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**\n\nThe final, complete order is: **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### **Step 1: Classify the Substituents by Directing Effect**\n\nThe first step is to classify the substituent on each benzene ring as either an *ortho, para*-director or a *meta*-director. This classification is the primary determinant of the para-isomer yield.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the ortho and para positions, resulting in a significant yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) **-CH₃** (Toluene): Activating group.\n    *   5) **-C₂H₅** (Ethylbenzene): Activating group.\n    *   3) **-Cl** (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating group, but directs ortho, para.\n\n*   **Meta-Directors (Low Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. The yield of the para-isomer is consequently very low.\n    *   4) **-NO₂** (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating.\n    *   6) **-COOH** (Benzoic acid): Deactivating.\n    *   2) **-COOC₂H₅** (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating.\n\nBased on this initial classification, we know that the substances with meta-directing groups (4, 6, 2) will have the lowest para-isomer yields, and the substances with ortho, para-directing groups (1, 5, 3) will have the highest yields. The final correct sequence must list {4, 6, 2} before {1, 5, 3}.\n\n### **Step 2: Order the Meta-Directors**\n\nFor the meta-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer is extremely low. The order among them is determined by their deactivating strength. A stronger deactivating group is a more effective meta-director, which means it will produce an even smaller amount of the para-isomer.\n\nThe established order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅\n\nTherefore, the order of *increasing* para-isomer yield is the reverse of this:\nYield(para-NO₂) < Yield(para-COOH) < Yield(para-COOC₂H₅)\n\nThis gives the order for the first three substances: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n### **Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directors**\n\nFor the ortho, para-directing groups, we need to compare the ratio of the para-isomer to the ortho-isomer. This is primarily influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **-CH₃ (1) vs. -C₂H₅ (5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent *ortho* positions, making the less-crowded *para* position more favorable. Therefore, ethylbenzene (5) will produce a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene (1). The order is **1 < 5**.\n\n*   **-Cl (3) vs. Alkyl Groups (1, 5):** The chloro group is deactivating due to its strong inductive effect, but it directs ortho, para due to resonance. The deactivating inductive effect is felt more strongly at the closer ortho positions than at the para position. This electronic factor, combined with the steric size of the chlorine atom, strongly favors substitution at the para position. Experimental data shows that the bromination of chlorobenzene gives a very high yield of the para-isomer (around 87%), which is significantly higher than that for toluene (around 67%) or ethylbenzene.\n\nCombining these points, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### **Step 4: Combine the Orders and Determine the Final Answer**\n\nNow, we combine the two ordered groups. The para-isomer yield for any ortho, para-director is significantly higher than for any meta-director.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nCombining them gives the final sequence for the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence corresponds exactly to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe code successfully determined the order of substances based on increasing para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination.\n\nThe process involved two main steps:\n1.  **Grouping and Sorting Meta-Directors**: The substances with meta-directing groups (-NO₂, -COOH, -COOC₂H₅) were identified as having the lowest para-yield. They were sorted based on the inverse of their deactivating strength, resulting in the order: Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\n2.  **Grouping and Sorting Ortho/Para-Directors**: The substances with ortho/para-directing groups (-CH₃, -C₂H₅, -Cl) were identified as having the highest para-yield. They were sorted based on steric and electronic effects that favor the para position, resulting in the order: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\nCombining these two sorted groups produced the final sequence `[4, 6, 2, 1, 5, 3]`. The code then correctly matched this sequence to the provided multiple-choice options, identifying it as option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### **1. Understand the Goal**\nThe task is to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-bromo derivative formed during electrophilic bromination. This order depends on the electronic and steric properties of the substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n### **2. Classify the Substituents**\nFirst, we must classify each substituent based on its directing effect in electrophilic aromatic substitution. This is the most crucial step.\n\n*   **Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to the meta position. Consequently, they produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   **4) C6H5-NO₂:** The nitro group (-NO₂) is strongly deactivating.\n    *   **6) C6H5-COOH:** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is deactivating.\n    *   **2) C6H5-COOC₂H₅:** The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is deactivating.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. They will produce a significant amount of the para-isomer.\n    *   **1) C6H5-CH₃:** The methyl group (-CH₃) is activating.\n    *   **5) C6H5-C₂H₅:** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is activating.\n    *   **3) C6H5-Cl:** The chloro group (-Cl) is deactivating but directs ortho, para.\n\nBased on this classification, the three meta-directing substances (4, 6, 2) will have the lowest para-isomer yields and will come first in the sequence. The three ortho, para-directing substances (1, 5, 3) will have the highest yields and will come last.\n\n### **3. Order the Meta-Directors (Lowest Para Yield)**\nFor the meta-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the group's deactivating strength. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the minor para product.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: **-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅**.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of this: **Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**.\n\nThis gives us the beginning of the sequence: **4 < 6 < 2 ...**\n\n### **4. Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (Highest Para Yield)**\nFor these groups, we need to compare the ratio of the para product to the ortho product. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH₃ (1) and -C₂H₅ (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, making the remote para position more accessible. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher proportion of the para-isomer than toluene. The order is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)**.\n\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** The chloro group is a special case. While it is deactivating overall (due to its inductive effect), it directs ortho, para (due to resonance). The strong inductive electron withdrawal is felt most strongly at the ortho positions, making them less reactive than the more distant para position. This electronic effect, combined with the steric size of the chlorine atom, leads to a very high preference for the para-isomer. Experimental data shows that the bromination of chlorobenzene yields a very high percentage of the para-product (around 87-89%), which is higher than for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n\n### **5. Combine the Orders**\nNow, we combine the two sorted groups. The para-yield for any ortho, para-director is significantly higher than for any meta-director.\n\n*   Order of meta-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Order of ortho, para-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nCombining them gives the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe task is to arrange six substituted benzene compounds in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during an electrophilic bromination reaction. This order depends on the electronic and steric properties of the substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents**\nThe first step is to classify each substituent as either an *ortho, para-director* or a *meta-director*. This is the most critical factor in determining the yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directors (High Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions. The para-isomer is a major product.\n    *   1) `-CH₃` (Toluene)\n    *   5) `-C₂H₅` (Ethylbenzene)\n    *   3) `-Cl` (Chlorobenzene)\n\n*   **Meta-Directors (Low Para-Yield):** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the meta position. The para-isomer is a very minor product, with a yield close to zero.\n    *   4) `-NO₂` (Nitrobenzene)\n    *   6) `-COOH` (Benzoic acid)\n    *   2) `-COOC₂H₅` (Ethyl benzoate)\n\nBased on this classification, the three meta-directing compounds (4, 6, 2) will have the lowest para-isomer yields, and the three ortho, para-directing compounds (1, 5, 3) will have the highest. The final correct sequence must place all meta-directors before all ortho, para-directors.\n\n**3. Order the Meta-Directors (Lowest Yields)**\nFor the meta-directing groups, the yield of the minor para-isomer is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the group. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the para product.\n\n*   The established order of deactivating strength is: `-NO₂` > `-COOH` > `-COOC₂H₅`.\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of this: Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).\n*   The beginning of our sequence is **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**4. Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (Highest Yields)**\nFor these groups, we need to compare the ratio of the para product to the ortho product. This is influenced by steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing `-CH₃` (1) and `-C₂H₅` (5):** The ethyl group (`-C₂H₅`) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (`-CH₃`). This increased size hinders the approach of the bromine electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions, making the remote para position more accessible. Thus, ethylbenzene gives a higher proportion of the para-isomer than toluene. This gives the order: **1 < 5**.\n*   **Comparing with `-Cl` (3):** Halogens like chlorine are a special case. While deactivating overall, they strongly favor the para position over the ortho position. This is due to a combination of the chlorine atom's size and its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect, which is felt more strongly at the ortho positions, disfavoring attack there. Experimental data consistently shows that chlorobenzene gives a very high yield of the para-isomer (e.g., ~87% in bromination), which is higher than that for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene (~70%).\n*   Combining these facts, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n*   The end of our sequence is **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**5. Combine the Orders and Determine the Final Answer**\nBy combining the two ordered subgroups, we get the complete sequence for the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield:\n\n(Low-yield group) < (High-yield group)\n**(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)**\n\nThe final, complete order is **4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**.\n\nThis sequence matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
