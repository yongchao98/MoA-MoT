Analyze the relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance.**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is reached when the energy absorbed from its star equals the energy it radiates. The energy absorbed is proportional to the stellar flux, which decreases with the square of the distance (`a`) from the star. The energy radiated is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (T_eq⁴) according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n\nThis leads to the relationship:\nT_eq⁴ ∝ (1 - A) / a²\nwhere `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\nTaking the fourth root of both sides gives:\nT_eq ∝ (1 - A)¹ᐟ⁴ / a¹ᐟ²\n\nSince the problem states that the planets have the same albedo, the `(1 - A)¹ᐟ⁴` term is constant for both planets and can be ignored when calculating a ratio. Thus, the relationship simplifies to:\nT_eq ∝ 1 / a¹ᐟ² or T_eq ∝ 1/√a\n\nThis means the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance.\n\n**2. Relate Orbital Distance to Orbital Period.**\nKepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (`a`):\nP² ∝ a³\n\nTo use this in our temperature equation, we need to express the distance (`a`) in terms of the period (`P`):\na ∝ P²ᐟ³\n\n**3. Combine the relationships to link Temperature and Period.**\nBy substituting the expression for distance (`a`) from Step 2 into the simplified temperature relationship from Step 1, we get:\nT_eq ∝ 1 / (P²ᐟ³)¹ᐟ²\nUsing the rule of exponents, (xᵐ)ⁿ = xᵐⁿ:\nT_eq ∝ 1 / P⁽²ᐟ³⁾*⁽¹ᐟ²⁾\nT_eq ∝ 1 / P¹ᐟ³ or T_eq ∝ P⁻¹ᐟ³\n\nThis shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n**4. Set up and Calculate the Ratio.**\nThe question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 to that of Planet_2 (T_eq4 / T_eq2). Using the relationship from Step 3:\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P₄)⁻¹ᐟ³ / (P₂)⁻¹ᐟ³ = (P₂ / P₄)¹ᐟ³\n\nThe problem gives the ratio of orbital periods as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. From this, we use the relative period values for Planet_2 (`P₂ = 2`) and Planet_4 (`P₄ = 3.5`).\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation:\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)¹ᐟ³\n\nNow, we perform the calculation:\n2 / 3.5 ≈ 0.5714\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ (0.5714)¹ᐟ³ ≈ 0.8298\n\n**5.

Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~0.69\nB) ~0.57\nC) ~0.75\nD) ~0.83\n\nThe result matches option D.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Temperature vs. Distance:** It is crucial to remember that T_eq ∝ 1/√a, not 1/a or 1/a².\n*   **Kepler's Law:** The exponents in Kepler's Third Law (P² ∝ a³) must be applied correctly.\n*   **Exponent Arithmetic:** Combining the relationships requires correctly multiplying the exponents: (2/3) * (1/2) = 1/3.\n*   **Ratio Order:** The question asks for T_eq4 / T_eq2. This requires the period ratio to be inverted in the final formula: (P₂ / P₄)¹ᐟ³. Getting this order wrong would result in the reciprocal answer (~1.205).\n*   **Irrelevant Information:** The TTV method and orbital resonance are contextual details and are not needed for the mathematical calculation.\n\nAll candidate answers correctly derive the physics and perform the calculation to arrive at ~0.83. The discrepancies in their final letter choices are due to inconsistent labeling of the multiple-choice options. Based on the options provided in the prompt, the correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nAn analysis of the provided answers reveals a consistent methodological approach to solving the problem, although the final letter choices vary due to apparent differences in the option listings for each agent. The correct physical reasoning, however, is present in the majority of the responses.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq) and Orbital Distance (a):** The first step is to establish the relationship between a planet's equilibrium temperature and its distance from the star. The energy a planet absorbs is inversely proportional to the square of its orbital distance (`a²`). The temperature, according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, is proportional to the fourth root of the absorbed energy. Therefore, `T_eq ∝ (1/a²)^(1/4)`, which simplifies to `T_eq ∝ 1/√a` or `T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)`. This step is correctly identified by almost all candidates. The problem states the planets have the same albedo, which allows for this direct proportionality.\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** The next step is to relate the orbital distance (`a`) to the orbital period (`P`), as the periods are the known quantities. Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis: `P² ∝ a³`. To use this in the temperature equation, it must be rearranged to solve for `a`: `a ∝ P^(2/3)`. This is also correctly done in the valid responses.\n\n3.  **Combining Relationships:** The relationship for `a` from Kepler's Law is substituted into the temperature relationship.\n    *   `T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)`\n    *   Substituting `a ∝ P^(2/3)` gives `T_eq ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2)`.\n    *   By multiplying the exponents, we get `T_eq ∝ P^(-1/3)`.\n    This crucial step shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Ratio:** The question asks for the ratio of the temperature of Planet_4 to Planet_2 (`T_eq4 / T_eq2`). Using the relationship from the previous step:\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P4)^(-1/3) / (P2)^(-1/3) = (P4 / P2)^(-1/3)`.\n    This is equivalent to `(P2 / P4)^(1/3)`.\n\n5.  **Substituting Values:** The given orbital period ratios are 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. We use the relative values for Planet_2 (`P2 = 2`) and Planet_4 (`P4 = 3.5`).\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)`.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** The fraction `2 / 3.5` simplifies to `4 / 7`, which is approximately 0.5714.\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (4 / 7)^(1/3) ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3) ≈ 0.8298`.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The calculated ratio is approximately 0.83. Comparing this to the options provided in the prompt:\n    *   A) ~0.57\n    *   B) ~0.83\n    *   C) ~0.69\n    *   D) ~0.75\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Ratio Inversion:** It is critical to correctly set up the final ratio. A common mistake is to calculate `(P4 / P2)^(1/3)` instead of `(P2 / P4)^(1/3)`, which would yield the reciprocal of the answer (~1.21).\n*   **Exponent Math:** Correctly multiplying the exponents `(2/3)` and `(-1/2)` to get `(-1/3)` is essential.\n*   **Assumptions:** The simplification relies on the fact that the planets orbit the same star (constant luminosity) and have the same albedo, as stated in the problem.\n*   **Option Mapping:** Several candidate answers perform the calculation correctly but select the wrong letter. This highlights the importance of carefully matching the calculated result to the specific list of options provided.\n\nThe consensus of the correct derivations and calculations points to a single numerical answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nAn analysis of the provided answers reveals a strong consensus on the physical principles and mathematical steps required to solve the problem. The discrepancies arise almost entirely from matching the final calculated value to the correct multiple-choice option letter.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature vs. Orbital Distance:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the balance of incoming stellar radiation and outgoing thermal radiation. For planets orbiting the same star with the same albedo, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis, `a`).\n    $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$ or $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\n\n2.  **Orbital Period vs. Orbital Distance (Kepler's Third Law):** Kepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (`P`) is directly proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (`a`).\n    $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n\n3.  **Relating Temperature and Period:** To find the relationship between temperature and period, we first rearrange Kepler's Law to express distance in terms of period:\n    $a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n    Now, we substitute this into the temperature relationship from Step 1:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto (P^{2/3})^{-1/2}$\n    Using the rule of exponents, we multiply them:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto P^{(2/3) \\cdot (-1/2)} = P^{-1/3}$\n    This shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Temperature Ratio:** We need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 to that of Planet_2 ($T_{eq,4} / T_{eq,2}$). Using the relationship from Step 3:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{(P_4)^{-1/3}}{(P_2)^{-1/3}} = (\\frac{P_4}{P_2})^{-1/3} = (\\frac{P_2}{P_4})^{1/3}$\n\n5.  **Substituting the Given Values:** The problem states the ratio of orbital periods is $P_1 : P_2 : P_3 : P_4 : P_5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5$.\n    Therefore, the ratio of the periods for Planet_2 and Planet_4 is:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \\frac{2}{3.5}$\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** We plug this ratio into our equation:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = (\\frac{2}{3.5})^{1/3} = (\\frac{4}{7})^{1/3}$\n    Calculating the value:\n    $(\\frac{4}{7})^{1/3} \\approx (0.5714)^{1/3} \\approx 0.8298$\n\n7.  **Matching with Options:** The calculated value is approximately 0.83. Comparing this to the given options:\n    A) ~0.75\n    B) ~0.57\n    C) ~0.83\n    D) ~0.69\n    The result matches option C.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Correct Physical Laws:** It is crucial to use the correct proportionalities: $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$ and $P^2 \\propto a^3$. A mistake in either exponent will lead to an incorrect final answer.\n*   **Correct Ratio Setup:** The question asks for the ratio of Planet_4 to Planet_2 ($T_4/T_2$). Because of the inverse relationship between temperature and period, the period ratio inside the calculation must be inverted ($P_2/P_4$).\n*   **Ignoring Extraneous Information:** The information about the TTV method and orbital resonance confirms the physical context but is not directly used in the calculation. The key information is the period ratio and the fact that the albedos are the same.\n*   **Final Answer Selection:** As seen in the candidate answers, even with a correct calculation, it is easy to select the wrong letter. It is essential to carefully match the calculated numerical value (~0.83) to the corresponding option letter (C).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principles:** The problem requires understanding two key concepts:\n    *   **Planetary Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq):** This is the temperature a planet would have if it were a perfect blackbody heated only by its parent star. The energy absorbed depends on the stellar flux, which decreases with the square of the distance (`a`) from the star. The temperature is related to the fourth root of the absorbed energy. This leads to the proportionality:\n        `T_eq ∝ 1 / √a`\n        This means the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's orbital distance.\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates a planet's orbital period (`P`) to its orbital distance (semi-major axis, `a`). For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the distance:\n        `P² ∝ a³`\n\n2.  **Combine the Principles to Relate Temperature and Period:** Our goal is to find a temperature ratio, but we are given a period ratio. We need to find a direct relationship between `T_eq` and `P`.\n    *   First, rearrange Kepler's Law to solve for distance (`a`) in terms of period (`P`):\n        `a³ ∝ P²`  =>  `a ∝ (P²)^(1/3)`  =>  `a ∝ P^(2/3)`\n    *   Now, substitute this expression for `a` into the temperature proportionality:\n        `T_eq ∝ 1 / √(P^(2/3))`\n    *   Simplify the exponents: `√(P^(2/3))` is `(P^(2/3))^(1/2)`, which equals `P^((2/3) * (1/2)) = P^(1/3)`.\n    *   So, the final relationship is:\n        `T_eq ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)` or `T_eq ∝ P^(-1/3)`\n        This shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n3.  **Set Up the Ratio Calculation:** The question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 to that of Planet_2 (`T_eq4 / T_eq2`).\n    *   Using the proportionality from the previous step:\n        `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P₄)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3)`\n    *   This can be rewritten as:\n        `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P₄ / P₂)⁻¹/³ = (P₂ / P₄)¹/³`\n\n4.  **Substitute the Given Values:** The problem states the ratio of orbital periods is `P₁:P₂:P₃:P₄:P₅ = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5`.\n    *   From this, we take the relative period values for Planet 2 and Planet 4: `P₂ = 2` and `P₄ = 3.5`.\n    *   Substitute these into the ratio equation:\n        `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)¹/³`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    *   First, calculate the fraction: `2 / 3.5 ≈ 0.5714`\n    *   Next, calculate the cube root of this value: `(0.5714)¹/³ ≈ 0.82988...`\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the ratio is approximately `0.83`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Assumptions:** The calculation relies on the fact that the planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, which allows for the cancellation of other terms in the full equilibrium temperature formula.\n*   **Ratio Inversion:** It is crucial to set up the final ratio correctly. Since temperature is *inversely* proportional to the cube root of the period, the ratio `T₄/T₂` corresponds to `(P₂/P₄)¹/³`, not `(P₄/P₂)¹/³`. Calculating the latter would give the inverse answer (~1.20).\n*   **Exponents:** Correctly manipulating the exponents (`-1/2` from the temperature-distance relation and `2/3` from the distance-period relation) is essential to arrive at the final `-1/3` power for the temperature-period relation.\n*   **Matching to Options:** The calculated value of ~0.83 must be matched to the correct multiple-choice option.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe step-by-step analysis consistently yields a numerical result of approximately 0.83.

The analysis of the candidate answers showed that while most agents correctly calculated the value 0.83, some made errors in selecting the final letter, likely due to differently ordered options in their specific prompts. However, the underlying physics and calculation are consistent and point to 0.83.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Fundamental Physical Principles**\n\nThe solution relies on two key principles of planetary science:\n\n*   **Planetary Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates into space. For planets orbiting the same star and having the same albedo (reflectivity), the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis, `a`).\n    *   $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$ or $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\n\n*   **Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion:** This law relates a planet's orbital period (`P`) to its semi-major axis (`a`). For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis.\n    *   $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n\n### **2. Deriving the Relationship between Temperature and Period**\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find a direct relationship between the equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) and the orbital period (`P`). We can do this by combining the two principles above.\n\n1.  First, rearrange Kepler's Third Law to express the semi-major axis (`a`) in terms of the period (`P`):\n    $a^3 \\propto P^2 \\implies a \\propto (P^2)^{1/3} \\implies a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n\n2.  Next, substitute this expression for `a` into the equilibrium temperature relationship:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2} \\implies T_{eq} \\propto (P^{2/3})^{-1/2}$\n\n3.  Simplify the exponents by multiplying them (`(2/3) * (-1/2) = -1/3`):\n    $T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\nThis final relationship shows that a planet's equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of its orbital period.\n\n### **3. Calculating the Ratio**\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 to that of Planet_2 ($T_{eq,4} / T_{eq,2}$). Using the relationship derived above:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{(P_4)^{-1/3}}{(P_2)^{-1/3}} = (\\frac{P_4}{P_2})^{-1/3} = (\\frac{P_2}{P_4})^{1/3}$\n\nThe problem provides the ratio of orbital periods as $P_1 : P_2 : P_3 : P_4 : P_5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5$. From this, we can assign the relative period values:\n*   $P_2 = 2$\n*   $P_4 = 3.5$\n\nNow, substitute these values into the equation:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = (\\frac{2}{3.5})^{1/3}$\n\n### **4. Final Calculation**\n\nTo get the numerical value:\n1.  Calculate the fraction: $\\frac{2}{3.5} \\approx 0.5714$\n2.  Calculate the cube root of the result: $(0.5714)^{1/3} \\approx 0.8298$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the ratio is **0.83**.\n\n### **5. Conclusion and Analysis of Candidate Answers**\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.83 matches option B.\n\nA review of the candidate answers shows that the vast majority correctly derive the relationship $T_{eq,4} / T_{eq,2} = (P_2 / P_4)^{1/3}$ and calculate the value to be ~0.83. The discrepancies in the final letter choices (e.g., some agents choosing A, C, or D) appear to be due to either a simple mistake in the final step or a different mapping of values to letters in their internal processing.

Therefore, the albedo term (1-A) and all stellar properties are constant for both planets.\n*   This simplifies the relationship to: **T_eq ∝ 1/√a** or **T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)**.\n\n**3. Relate Orbital Distance to Orbital Period**\nThe problem provides the ratio of orbital periods (P), not orbital distances (a).

Combine the Physical Laws**\nNow, we substitute the relationship for 'a' from Kepler's Law into the simplified temperature relationship.\n*   We have T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2).\n*   Substituting a ∝ P^(2/3), we get: T_eq ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2).\n*   Using the rule of exponents, we multiply them: T_eq ∝ P^((2/3) * (-1/2)) = P^(-1/3).\n*   This gives us the final relationship: **T_eq ∝ P^(-1/3)**. The equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n**5. Set Up and Calculate the Ratio**\nWe can now write the ratio for T_eq4 / T_eq2 using the relationship derived above.\n*   T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P4)^(-1/3) / (P2)^(-1/3)\n*   This can be rewritten as: T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P4 / P2)^(-1/3) = **(P2 / P4)^(1/3)**.\n\n**6. Substitute the Given Values**\nThe problem states the ratio of orbital periods is P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n*   From this, we take the relative period for Planet_2 as P2 = 2.\n*   We take the relative period for Planet_4 as P4 = 3.5.\n*   Substitute these into our ratio equation: T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3).\n\n**7.

Analyze the Core Physics**\n\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates. For a planet, the absorbed energy is proportional to 1/d², where 'd' is the distance from the star. The radiated energy is proportional to T_eq⁴ (from the Stefan-Boltzmann law).

This relationship holds true for comparing planets in the same system with the same albedo, as stated in the problem.\n\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law connects a planet's orbital period (P) with its average distance (semi-major axis, 'a') from the star. For circular orbits, d = a. The law states P² ∝ d³. We can rearrange this to express the distance in terms of the period: d ∝ P^(2/3).\n\n### **2. Combine the Physical Laws**\n\nTo find the relationship between temperature and period, we substitute the expression for distance 'd' from Kepler's Law into the temperature relationship.\n*   We have T_eq ∝ 1/√d\n*   And d ∝ P^(2/3)\n*   Substituting gives: T_eq ∝ 1 / √(P^(2/3))\n*   Simplifying the exponent: T_eq ∝ 1 / P^(1/3) or T_eq ∝ P^(-1/3).\n\nThis shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n### **3.

From this, we use the relative period values for Planet_2 (P2 = 2) and Planet_4 (P4 = 3.5).\n\n*   Substitute these values into the equation:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n\n*   To simplify the fraction, we can write 3.5 as 7/2:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / (7/2))^(1/3) = (4 / 7)^(1/3)\n\n*   Now, we calculate the numerical value:\n    (4 / 7) ≈ 0.5714\n    (0.5714)^(1/3) ≈ 0.8298\n\n### **4.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Governing Physical Principles:** The solution requires combining two fundamental laws of planetary science:\n    *   **Planetary Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates. For planets orbiting the same star and having the same albedo (reflectivity), the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis, `a`).\n        $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$ or $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion:** This law relates a planet's orbital period (`P`) to its semi-major axis (`a`). For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis.\n        $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n\n2.  **Derive the Relationship between Temperature and Period:** The goal is to find a direct relationship between temperature and period, since the period ratio is given.\n    *   First, we rearrange Kepler's Law to express the distance (`a`) in terms of the period (`P`):\n        $a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n    *   Next, we substitute this expression for `a` into the equilibrium temperature relationship:\n        $T_{eq} \\propto (P^{2/3})^{-1/2}$\n    *   Using the rule of exponents, $(x^m)^n = x^{m \\cdot n}$, we multiply the exponents:\n        $T_{eq} \\propto P^{(2/3) \\cdot (-1/2)} = P^{-1/3}$\n    *   This crucial result shows that a planet's equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of its orbital period.\n\n3.  **Set Up the Ratio Calculation:** The question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 to that of Planet_2 ($T_{eq,4} / T_{eq,2}$).\n    *   Using the relationship from the previous step:\n        $\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{(P_4)^{-1/3}}{(P_2)^{-1/3}} = (\\frac{P_4}{P_2})^{-1/3}$\n    *   This can be rewritten for easier calculation as:\n        $\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = (\\frac{P_2}{P_4})^{1/3}$\n\n4.  **Substitute the Given Values:** The problem states the ratio of orbital periods is $P_1 : P_2 : P_3 : P_4 : P_5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5$.\n    *   From this, we take the relative period for Planet 2 as $P_2 = 2$.\n    *   And the relative period for Planet 4 as $P_4 = 3.5$.\n\n5.  **Perform the Final Calculation:** We substitute these values into our ratio equation.\n```python\n# Define the relative orbital periods for Planet 2 and Planet 4\nP2 = 2\nP4 = 3.5\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (T_eq4 / T_eq2)\n# The relationship is T_eq is proportional to P^(-1/3)\n# So, T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)\ntemperature_ratio = (P2 / P4)**(1/3)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\nThe calculation yields approximately `0.8298`. Rounding to two decimal places gives **0.83**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Correct Physical Laws:** The entire derivation depends on the correct proportionalities: $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$ and $P^2 \\propto a^3$. An error in either exponent would lead to an incorrect result.\n*   **Correct Ratio Setup:** A very common mistake is to incorrectly set up the final ratio. Because temperature is *inversely* proportional to the cube root of the period, the temperature ratio $T_4/T_2$ corresponds to the period ratio $(P_2/P_4)^{1/3}$, not $(P_4/P_2)^{1/3}$. The latter would yield the reciprocal answer (~1.21).\n*   **Ignoring Extraneous Information:** The information about the TTV discovery method and orbital resonance provides context but is not needed for the mathematical calculation. The condition that the planets have the \"same albedo\" is, however, essential for the simplified temperature relationship to be valid.\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers:** All candidate answers correctly derive the physics and perform the calculation, arriving at the value of ~0.83. The discrepancies in their final letter choices are due to the multiple-choice options being presented in a different order for each agent.

Analyze the relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance.**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is reached when the energy absorbed from its star equals the energy it radiates. The energy absorbed is proportional to the stellar flux, which decreases with the square of the distance (`a`) from the star. The energy radiated is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (T_eq⁴) according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n\nThis leads to the relationship:\nT_eq⁴ ∝ (1 - A) / a²\nwhere `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\nTaking the fourth root of both sides gives:\nT_eq ∝ (1 - A)¹ᐟ⁴ / a¹ᐟ²\n\nSince the problem states that the planets have the same albedo, the `(1 - A)¹ᐟ⁴` term is constant for both planets and can be ignored when calculating a ratio. Thus, the relationship simplifies to:\nT_eq ∝ 1 / a¹ᐟ² or T_eq ∝ 1/√a\n\nThis means the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance.\n\n**2. Relate Orbital Distance to Orbital Period.**\nKepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (`a`):\nP² ∝ a³\n\nTo use this in our temperature equation, we need to express the distance (`a`) in terms of the period (`P`):\na ∝ P²ᐟ³\n\n**3. Combine the relationships to link Temperature and Period.**\nBy substituting the expression for distance (`a`) from Step 2 into the simplified temperature relationship from Step 1, we get:\nT_eq ∝ 1 / (P²ᐟ³)¹ᐟ²\nUsing the rule of exponents, (xᵐ)ⁿ = xᵐⁿ:\nT_eq ∝ 1 / P⁽²ᐟ³⁾*⁽¹ᐟ²⁾\nT_eq ∝ 1 / P¹ᐟ³ or T_eq ∝ P⁻¹ᐟ³\n\nThis shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n**4. Set up and Calculate the Ratio.**\nThe question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 to that of Planet_2 (T_eq4 / T_eq2). Using the relationship from Step 3:\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P₄)⁻¹ᐟ³ / (P₂)⁻¹ᐟ³ = (P₂ / P₄)¹ᐟ³\n\nThe problem gives the ratio of orbital periods as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. From this, we use the relative period values for Planet_2 (`P₂ = 2`) and Planet_4 (`P₄ = 3.5`).\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation:\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)¹ᐟ³\n\nNow, we perform the calculation:\n2 / 3.5 ≈ 0.5714\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ (0.5714)¹ᐟ³ ≈ 0.8298\n\n**5.

The correct physical reasoning, however, is present in the majority of the responses.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq) and Orbital Distance (a):** The first step is to establish the relationship between a planet's equilibrium temperature and its distance from the star. The energy a planet absorbs is inversely proportional to the square of its orbital distance (`a²`). The temperature, according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, is proportional to the fourth root of the absorbed energy. Therefore, `T_eq ∝ (1/a²)^(1/4)`, which simplifies to `T_eq ∝ 1/√a` or `T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)`. This step is correctly identified by almost all candidates. The problem states the planets have the same albedo, which allows for this direct proportionality.\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** The next step is to relate the orbital distance (`a`) to the orbital period (`P`), as the periods are the known quantities. Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis: `P² ∝ a³`. To use this in the temperature equation, it must be rearranged to solve for `a`: `a ∝ P^(2/3)`. This is also correctly done in the valid responses.\n\n3.  **Combining Relationships:** The relationship for `a` from Kepler's Law is substituted into the temperature relationship.\n    *   `T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)`\n    *   Substituting `a ∝ P^(2/3)` gives `T_eq ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2)`.\n    *   By multiplying the exponents, we get `T_eq ∝ P^(-1/3)`.\n    This crucial step shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Ratio:** The question asks for the ratio of the temperature of Planet_4 to Planet_2 (`T_eq4 / T_eq2`). Using the relationship from the previous step:\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P4)^(-1/3) / (P2)^(-1/3) = (P4 / P2)^(-1/3)`.\n    This is equivalent to `(P2 / P4)^(1/3)`.\n\n5.  **Substituting Values:** The given orbital period ratios are 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. We use the relative values for Planet_2 (`P2 = 2`) and Planet_4 (`P4 = 3.5`).\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)`.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** The fraction `2 / 3.5` simplifies to `4 / 7`, which is approximately 0.5714.\n    `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (4 / 7)^(1/3) ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3) ≈ 0.8298`.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The calculated ratio is approximately 0.83. Comparing this to the options provided in the prompt:\n    *   A) ~0.57\n    *   B) ~0.83\n    *   C) ~0.69\n    *   D) ~0.75\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Ratio Inversion:** It is critical to correctly set up the final ratio. A common mistake is to calculate `(P4 / P2)^(1/3)` instead of `(P2 / P4)^(1/3)`, which would yield the reciprocal of the answer (~1.21).\n*   **Exponent Math:** Correctly multiplying the exponents `(2/3)` and `(-1/2)` to get `(-1/3)` is essential.\n*   **Assumptions:** The simplification relies on the fact that the planets orbit the same star (constant luminosity) and have the same albedo, as stated in the problem.\n*   **Option Mapping:** Several candidate answers perform the calculation correctly but select the wrong letter.

The discrepancies arise almost entirely from matching the final calculated value to the correct multiple-choice option letter.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature vs. Orbital Distance:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the balance of incoming stellar radiation and outgoing thermal radiation. For planets orbiting the same star with the same albedo, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis, `a`).\n    $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$ or $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\n\n2.  **Orbital Period vs. Orbital Distance (Kepler's Third Law):** Kepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (`P`) is directly proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (`a`).\n    $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n\n3.  **Relating Temperature and Period:** To find the relationship between temperature and period, we first rearrange Kepler's Law to express distance in terms of period:\n    $a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n    Now, we substitute this into the temperature relationship from Step 1:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto (P^{2/3})^{-1/2}$\n    Using the rule of exponents, we multiply them:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto P^{(2/3) \\cdot (-1/2)} = P^{-1/3}$\n    This shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Temperature Ratio:** We need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 to that of Planet_2 ($T_{eq,4} / T_{eq,2}$). Using the relationship from Step 3:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{(P_4)^{-1/3}}{(P_2)^{-1/3}} = (\\frac{P_4}{P_2})^{-1/3} = (\\frac{P_2}{P_4})^{1/3}$\n\n5.  **Substituting the Given Values:** The problem states the ratio of orbital periods is $P_1 : P_2 : P_3 : P_4 : P_5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5$.\n    Therefore, the ratio of the periods for Planet_2 and Planet_4 is:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \\frac{2}{3.5}$\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** We plug this ratio into our equation:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = (\\frac{2}{3.5})^{1/3} = (\\frac{4}{7})^{1/3}$\n    Calculating the value:\n    $(\\frac{4}{7})^{1/3} \\approx (0.5714)^{1/3} \\approx 0.8298$\n\n7.  **Matching with Options:** The calculated value is approximately 0.83.

A mistake in either exponent will lead to an incorrect final answer.\n*   **Correct Ratio Setup:** The question asks for the ratio of Planet_4 to Planet_2 ($T_4/T_2$). Because of the inverse relationship between temperature and period, the period ratio inside the calculation must be inverted ($P_2/P_4$).\n*   **Ignoring Extraneous Information:** The information about the TTV method and orbital resonance confirms the physical context but is not directly used in the calculation. The key information is the period ratio and the fact that the albedos are the same.\n*   **Final Answer Selection:** As seen in the candidate answers, even with a correct calculation, it is easy to select the wrong letter. It is essential to carefully match the calculated numerical value (~0.83) to the corresponding option letter (C).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principles:** The problem requires understanding two key concepts:\n    *   **Planetary Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq):** This is the temperature a planet would have if it were a perfect blackbody heated only by its parent star. The energy absorbed depends on the stellar flux, which decreases with the square of the distance (`a`) from the star. The temperature is related to the fourth root of the absorbed energy. This leads to the proportionality:\n        `T_eq ∝ 1 / √a`\n        This means the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's orbital distance.\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates a planet's orbital period (`P`) to its orbital distance (semi-major axis, `a`). For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the distance:\n        `P² ∝ a³`\n\n2.  **Combine the Principles to Relate Temperature and Period:** Our goal is to find a temperature ratio, but we are given a period ratio. We need to find a direct relationship between `T_eq` and `P`.\n    *   First, rearrange Kepler's Law to solve for distance (`a`) in terms of period (`P`):\n        `a³ ∝ P²`  =>  `a ∝ (P²)^(1/3)`  =>  `a ∝ P^(2/3)`\n    *   Now, substitute this expression for `a` into the temperature proportionality:\n        `T_eq ∝ 1 / √(P^(2/3))`\n    *   Simplify the exponents: `√(P^(2/3))` is `(P^(2/3))^(1/2)`, which equals `P^((2/3) * (1/2)) = P^(1/3)`.\n    *   So, the final relationship is:\n        `T_eq ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)` or `T_eq ∝ P^(-1/3)`\n        This shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n3.  **Set Up the Ratio Calculation:** The question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 to that of Planet_2 (`T_eq4 / T_eq2`).\n    *   Using the proportionality from the previous step:\n        `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P₄)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3)`\n    *   This can be rewritten as:\n        `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P₄ / P₂)⁻¹/³ = (P₂ / P₄)¹/³`\n\n4.  **Substitute the Given Values:** The problem states the ratio of orbital periods is `P₁:P₂:P₃:P₄:P₅ = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5`.\n    *   From this, we take the relative period values for Planet 2 and Planet 4: `P₂ = 2` and `P₄ = 3.5`.\n    *   Substitute these into the ratio equation:\n        `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)¹/³`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    *   First, calculate the fraction: `2 / 3.5 ≈ 0.5714`\n    *   Next, calculate the cube root of this value: `(0.5714)¹/³ ≈ 0.82988...`\n    *   Rounding to two decimal places, the ratio is approximately `0.83`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Assumptions:** The calculation relies on the fact that the planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, which allows for the cancellation of other terms in the full equilibrium temperature formula.\n*   **Ratio Inversion:** It is crucial to set up the final ratio correctly. Since temperature is *inversely* proportional to the cube root of the period, the ratio `T₄/T₂` corresponds to `(P₂/P₄)¹/³`, not `(P₄/P₂)¹/³`.

Fundamental Physical Principles**\n\nThe solution relies on two key principles of planetary science:\n\n*   **Planetary Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates into space. For planets orbiting the same star and having the same albedo (reflectivity), the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis, `a`).\n    *   $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$ or $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2}$\n\n*   **Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion:** This law relates a planet's orbital period (`P`) to its semi-major axis (`a`). For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis.\n    *   $P^2 \\propto a^3$\n\n### **2. Deriving the Relationship between Temperature and Period**\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find a direct relationship between the equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) and the orbital period (`P`). We can do this by combining the two principles above.\n\n1.  First, rearrange Kepler's Third Law to express the semi-major axis (`a`) in terms of the period (`P`):\n    $a^3 \\propto P^2 \\implies a \\propto (P^2)^{1/3} \\implies a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n\n2.  Next, substitute this expression for `a` into the equilibrium temperature relationship:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto a^{-1/2} \\implies T_{eq} \\propto (P^{2/3})^{-1/2}$\n\n3.  Simplify the exponents by multiplying them (`(2/3) * (-1/2) = -1/3`):\n    $T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\nThis final relationship shows that a planet's equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of its orbital period.\n\n### **3. Calculating the Ratio**\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 to that of Planet_2 ($T_{eq,4} / T_{eq,2}$). Using the relationship derived above:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{(P_4)^{-1/3}}{(P_2)^{-1/3}} = (\\frac{P_4}{P_2})^{-1/3} = (\\frac{P_2}{P_4})^{1/3}$\n\nThe problem provides the ratio of orbital periods as $P_1 : P_2 : P_3 : P_4 : P_5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5$. From this, we can assign the relative period values:\n*   $P_2 = 2$\n*   $P_4 = 3.5$\n\nNow, substitute these values into the equation:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = (\\frac{2}{3.5})^{1/3}$\n\n### **4.

Calculate the cube root of the result: $(0.5714)^{1/3} \\approx 0.8298$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the ratio is **0.83**.\n\n### **5. Conclusion and Analysis of Candidate Answers**\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.83 matches option B.\n\nA review of the candidate answers shows that the vast majority correctly derive the relationship $T_{eq,4} / T_{eq,2} = (P_2 / P_4)^{1/3}$ and calculate the value to be ~0.83. The discrepancies in the final letter choices (e.g., some agents choosing A, C, or D) appear to be due to either a simple mistake in the final step or a different mapping of values to letters in their internal processing.

For planets orbiting the same star:\n    *   `P² ∝ a³`\n    *   Solving for `a`, we get: `a ∝ P^(2/3)`\n\n3.  **Temperature vs. Period:** Substitute the expression for `a` from Kepler's Law into the temperature relationship:\n    *   `T_eq ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2)`\n    *   `T_eq ∝ P^((2/3) * (-1/2))`\n    *   `T_eq ∝ P^(-1/3)`\n    This shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio:** We need the ratio of the temperature of Planet 4 to Planet 2 (`T_eq4 / T_eq2`):\n    *   `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P4)^(-1/3) / (P2)^(-1/3) = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)`\n\n5.  **Substitute Values:** The problem gives the orbital period ratios as `1:2:2.5:3.5:5`. We use the relative values `P2 = 2` and `P4 = 3.5`.\n    *   `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)`\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   `T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3)`\n    *   `T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.8298`\n\nThe calculated value is approximately **0.83**, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nBased on an analysis of the provided answers, here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature and Distance:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates.

For planets orbiting the same star with the same albedo, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's orbital distance ($d$).\n    $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}}$ or $T_{eq} \\propto d^{-1/2}$\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** This law connects a planet's orbital period ($P$) with its orbital distance ($d$). It states that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the distance ($P^2 \\propto d^3$). To use this in our temperature equation, we must express distance in terms of period:\n    $d \\propto P^{2/3}$\n\n3.  **Combining the Relationships:** By substituting the expression for distance from Kepler's Law into the temperature relationship, we can find how temperature depends on the orbital period:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto (P^{2/3})^{-1/2}$\n    By multiplying the exponents, we get:\n    $T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$ or $T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}}$\n    This shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 to that of Planet_2 ($T_{eq,4} / T_{eq,2}$). Using the relationship derived above:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{(P_4)^{-1/3}}{(P_2)^{-1/3}} = (\\frac{P_4}{P_2})^{-1/3} = (\\frac{P_2}{P_4})^{1/3}$\n\n5.  **Substituting the Given Values:** The problem states the ratio of orbital periods is $P_1:P_2:P_3:P_4:P_5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5$.

Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 to that of Planet_2 (T_eq4 / T_eq2).\n\n**2. Analyze the Physics of Equilibrium Temperature**\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates into space. The formula for equilibrium temperature shows that it is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's distance (semi-major axis, 'a') from its star, provided other factors are constant.\n*   The formula is T_eq ∝ (1 - A)^(1/4) / √a, where A is the albedo.\n*   The problem states that the planets have the same albedo, and they orbit the same star. Therefore, the albedo term (1-A) and all stellar properties are constant for both planets.\n*   This simplifies the relationship to: **T_eq ∝ 1/√a** or **T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)**.\n\n**3. Relate Orbital Distance to Orbital Period**\nThe problem provides the ratio of orbital periods (P), not orbital distances (a). We must use Kepler's Third Law to connect these two quantities.\n*   Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis: **P² ∝ a³**.\n*   To use this in our temperature equation, we need to express 'a' in terms of 'P'. Rearranging the law gives: **a ∝ P^(2/3)**.\n\n**4. Combine the Physical Laws**\nNow, we substitute the relationship for 'a' from Kepler's Law into the simplified temperature relationship.\n*   We have T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2).\n*   Substituting a ∝ P^(2/3), we get: T_eq ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2).\n*   Using the rule of exponents, we multiply them: T_eq ∝ P^((2/3) * (-1/2)) = P^(-1/3).\n*   This gives us the final relationship: **T_eq ∝ P^(-1/3)**. The equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n**5. Set Up and Calculate the Ratio**\nWe can now write the ratio for T_eq4 / T_eq2 using the relationship derived above.\n*   T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P4)^(-1/3) / (P2)^(-1/3)\n*   This can be rewritten as: T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P4 / P2)^(-1/3) = **(P2 / P4)^(1/3)**.\n\n**6. Substitute the Given Values**\nThe problem states the ratio of orbital periods is P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n*   From this, we take the relative period for Planet_2 as P2 = 2.\n*   We take the relative period for Planet_4 as P4 = 3.5.\n*   Substitute these into our ratio equation: T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3).\n\n**7.

The problem states the albedos are the same, and the planets orbit the same star.\n    *   `T_eq ∝ 1 / a^(1/2)` or `T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)`\n\n2.  **Orbital Distance and Orbital Period (Kepler's Third Law):**\n    Kepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (`a`).\n    *   `P² ∝ a³`\n    To use this in our temperature equation, we need to express the distance (`a`) in terms of the period (`P`):\n    *   `a ∝ P^(2/3)`\n\n3.  **Combining Temperature and Period Relationships:**\n    Now, we substitute the expression for distance from Step 2 into the temperature relationship from Step 1.\n    *   `T_eq ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2)`\n    Using the rule of exponents `(x^m)^n = x^(m*n)`, we multiply the exponents:\n    *   `T_eq ∝ P^((2/3) * (-1/2))`\n    *   `T_eq ∝ P^(-1/3)`\n    This shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Temperature Ratio:**\n    We need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 to that of Planet_2 (`T_eq4 / T_eq2`). Using the relationship from Step 3:\n    *   `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P4)^(-1/3) / (P2)^(-1/3)`\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    *   `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)`\n\n5.  **Substituting the Given Values:**\n    The problem gives the ratio of orbital periods as `1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5`. From this, we can assign the relative period values:\n    *   `P2 = 2`\n    *   `P4 = 3.5`\n    Now, substitute these into the ratio equation:\n    *   `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)`\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   `T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3) ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3)`\n    *   `T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.8298`\n\n### **Conclusion and Careful Points**\n\n*   The calculated value is approximately **0.83**.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The relationship is `T_eq ∝ P^(-1/3)`. It is crucial to get the exponent `-1/3` correct by combining the `a^(-1/2)` and `a ∝ P^(2/3)` relationships.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** The question asks for the ratio of Planet_4 to Planet_2 (`T_eq4 / T_eq2`). Because of the inverse relationship with the period, the period ratio inside the cube root must be `P2 / P4`.\n*   **Careful Point 3:** The majority of the provided candidate answers correctly perform the calculation, arriving at ~0.83. However, many then incorrectly match this result to the multiple-choice letters.\n*   **Final Decision:** The calculated value of ~0.83 corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe Python code successfully calculated the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2.\n\nThe calculation was based on the established physical relationships:\n1.  A planet's equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance (`a`): `T_eq ∝ a^(-1/2)`.\n2.  Kepler's Third Law relates the orbital period (`P`) to the orbital distance (`a`): `a ∝ P^(2/3)`.\n3.  Combining these two principles shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period: `T_eq ∝ P^(-1/3)`.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the temperatures `T4/T2` is equal to `(P2/P4)^(1/3)`. Using the given relative periods of `P2 = 2` and `P4 = 3.5`, the code computed `(2 / 3.5)^(1/3)`.\n\nThe code output shows the calculated ratio is approximately `0.8298`. This value is closest to the provided option B, which is `~0.83`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Distance:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates. For planets orbiting the same star and having the same albedo, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's orbital distance (d).\n    *   T_eq ∝ 1/√d or T_eq ∝ d⁻¹ᐟ²\n\n2.  **Relationship between Orbital Distance and Orbital Period:** Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is directly proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis. For the circular orbits in this problem, the semi-major axis is the orbital distance (d).\n    *   P² ∝ d³\n    *   To use this in our temperature equation, we need to express distance in terms of period: d ∝ P²ᐟ³\n\n3.  **Combining the Relationships:** Now, we substitute the relationship for distance (from Step 2) into the relationship for temperature (from Step 1).\n    *   T_eq ∝ (P²ᐟ³)⁻¹ᐟ²\n    *   By multiplying the exponents, we get: T_eq ∝ P⁻¹ᐟ³\n    *   This shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n4.  **Setting up the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 to that of Planet_2 (T_eq4 / T_eq2).\n    *   T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P₄)⁻¹ᐟ³ / (P₂)⁻¹ᐟ³\n    *   This can be rewritten as: T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P₂ / P₄)¹ᐟ³\n\n5.  **Using the Given Period Ratios:** The problem states the ratio of orbital periods is P₁:P₂:P₃:P₄:P₅ = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n    *   From this, we use the relative period for Planet_2 (P₂) = 2.\n    *   And the relative period for Planet_4 (P₄) = 3.5.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** We substitute these values into the ratio equation from Step 4.\n    *   T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)¹ᐟ³\n    *   T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ (0.5714)¹ᐟ³\n    *   T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.8298\n\n7.  **Comparing with Options:** The calculated value of approximately 0.83 matches option B.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Temperature vs. Distance:** It is essential to use the correct proportionality, T_eq ∝ 1/√d. Any other relationship would lead to an incorrect result.\n*   **Kepler's Law:** The relationship P² ∝ d³ must be correctly rearranged to d ∝ P²ᐟ³ before substitution.\n*   **Ratio Inversion:** Because temperature is *inversely* proportional to the cube root of the period, the ratio T_eq4 / T_eq2 corresponds to the period ratio (P₂ / P₄)¹ᐟ³. A common mistake is to forget the inversion and calculate (P₄ / P₂)¹ᐟ³, which would yield the reciprocal of the correct answer (~1.205).\n*   **Matching Calculation to Option:** The vast majority of the provided candidate answers correctly calculated the numerical value of ~0.83. However, many failed to match this result to the correct letter from the original options (A) ~0.57, (B) ~0.83, (C) ~0.75, (D) ~0.69. The correct match is B.\n\nBased on the consistent and correct physical derivation across the majority of the answers, the calculated ratio is ~0.83.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Core Physics**\n\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates. For a planet, the absorbed energy is proportional to 1/d², where 'd' is the distance from the star. The radiated energy is proportional to T_eq⁴ (from the Stefan-Boltzmann law). Therefore, T_eq⁴ ∝ 1/d², which simplifies to T_eq ∝ 1/√d. This relationship holds true for comparing planets in the same system with the same albedo, as stated in the problem.\n\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law connects a planet's orbital period (P) with its average distance (semi-major axis, 'a') from the star. For circular orbits, d = a. The law states P² ∝ d³. We can rearrange this to express the distance in terms of the period: d ∝ P^(2/3).\n\n### **2. Combine the Physical Laws**\n\nTo find the relationship between temperature and period, we substitute the expression for distance 'd' from Kepler's Law into the temperature relationship.\n*   We have T_eq ∝ 1/√d\n*   And d ∝ P^(2/3)\n*   Substituting gives: T_eq ∝ 1 / √(P^(2/3))\n*   Simplifying the exponent: T_eq ∝ 1 / P^(1/3) or T_eq ∝ P^(-1/3).\n\nThis shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n### **3. Set Up and Calculate the Ratio**\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 (T_eq4 / T_eq2).\n\n*   Using the proportionality from the previous step:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P4)^(-1/3) / (P2)^(-1/3)\n\n*   This can be rewritten as:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)\n\n*   The problem gives the orbital period ratios as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. From this, we use the relative period values for Planet_2 (P2 = 2) and Planet_4 (P4 = 3.5).\n\n*   Substitute these values into the equation:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\n\n*   To simplify the fraction, we can write 3.5 as 7/2:\n    T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / (7/2))^(1/3) = (4 / 7)^(1/3)\n\n*   Now, we calculate the numerical value:\n    (4 / 7) ≈ 0.5714\n    (0.5714)^(1/3) ≈ 0.8298\n\n### **4.
