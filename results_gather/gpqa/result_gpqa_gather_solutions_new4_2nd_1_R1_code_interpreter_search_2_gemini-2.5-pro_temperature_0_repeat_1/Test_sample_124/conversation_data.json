This is the potential for a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator. The term \"isotropic\" signifies that the restoring force (and thus the angular frequency $\\omega$) is the same in all directions.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Energy Eigenvalues\nThe Schrödinger equation for this system is separable in Cartesian coordinates $(x, y, z)$. The total Hamiltonian is the sum of three independent one-dimensional (1D) harmonic oscillator Hamiltonians.\n\nThe energy eigenvalue for a 1D harmonic oscillator in state $n_i$ is:\n$E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$\n\nFor the 3D system, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the three independent oscillators:\n$E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nBy defining a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, the energy levels can be expressed more compactly as:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Energy of the Third Excited State\nThe energy levels are ordered by the principal quantum number $n$.\n*   **Ground State:** Corresponds to the lowest possible energy, which is for $n=0$.\n*   **First Excited State:** Corresponds to $n=1$.\n*   **Second Excited State:** Corresponds to $n=2$.\n*   **Third Excited State:** Corresponds to $n=3$.\n\nTo find the energy of the third excited state, we substitute $n=3$ into the energy formula:\n$E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = (\\frac{6}{2} + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n\nThis result eliminates options A and D, which have an incorrect energy expression.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State\nThe number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given energy level is its degeneracy.

However, the physical reasoning consistently points to the same numerical answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
